## Question

what are the antibiotic doses to treat acute prostatitis in the outpatient setting with a suspect of STI

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about antibiotic dosing for acute prostatitis in the outpatient setting when a sexually transmitted infection is suspected. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and likely pathogens. Then, I should verify the severity criteria that determine outpatient versus inpatient management. Next, I will review first-line outpatient regimens and dosing, including STI-directed therapy and enteric coverage. After that, I need to check duration of therapy and whether it differs by severity. I will then examine alternatives for beta-lactam allergy and local resistance patterns. Finally, I should confirm follow-up, test-of-cure, and partner management steps, and close with a concise, practical regimen summary.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and likely pathogens. Acute bacterial prostatitis in sexually active men often involves ascending infection with gram-negative uropathogens such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas, but when STI risk is present, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis must be covered empirically, particularly in younger men or those with urethral discharge or recent unprotected sex, so I need to ensure dual coverage for gonorrhea and chlamydia while also addressing enteric organisms that commonly cause prostatitis [^61c1eab4] [^2776ed6d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about outpatient therapy. I should verify severity criteria that mandate hospitalization. Indications for admission include fever, chills, rigors, hemodynamic instability, inability to tolerate oral intake, immunocompromise, diabetes, older age, or concern for urosepsis; in these cases, intravenous therapy and closer monitoring are indicated, so outpatient regimens apply only to clinically stable patients without these red flags [^810855ea] [^539a25bd].

> Next, I should review first-line outpatient therapy for suspected STI-related acute prostatitis. The most defensible approach is to treat both gonorrhea and chlamydia empirically while providing enteric coverage, using ceftriaxone 500 mg intramuscularly as a single dose for gonorrhea plus doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 10 days for chlamydia, and adding levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days to cover enteric gram-negatives; this aligns with CDC epididymitis regimens adapted to prostatitis, where enteric coverage is essential and duration is extended to 2–4 weeks for prostatic tissue penetration and cure [^650b2ba9] [^84576b38] [^0a5c8219] [^e6156924].

> Wait, let me verify the duration because I initially thought 7 days might suffice for mild cases. That would be too short for prostatitis. I should confirm that 2–4 weeks is the standard for acute bacterial prostatitis to eradicate infection in the prostate, with many guidelines settling on 2 weeks for acute disease and longer if chronic features or complications emerge, so I will correct to a 2–4 week total course depending on severity and response, typically 2 weeks for acute cases without abscess or sepsis [^0a5c8219] [^e6156924] [^61c1eab4].

> I need to ensure dosing details are precise. For ceftriaxone, 500 mg IM once is correct, with 1 g IM for patients weighing 150 kg or more; for doxycycline, 100 mg orally twice daily is standard; for levofloxacin, 500 mg orally once daily provides excellent prostatic penetration and broad gram-negative coverage, including Pseudomonas in many settings, though I should double-check local fluoroquinolone resistance before relying on it empirically [^650b2ba9] [^84576b38] [^b57b6c19].

> But wait, what if there is a beta-lactam allergy or local resistance patterns preclude fluoroquinolones. I should consider alternatives. If ceftriaxone is contraindicated, an alternative gonorrhea regimen is gentamicin 240 mg IM once plus azithromycin 2 g orally once, though this is less well supported for prostatitis and should be reserved for allergy scenarios with specialist input; if fluoroquinolones are not suitable due to resistance or patient factors, I should tailor to culture results and consider agents like trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or fosfomycin if susceptible, recognizing that fosfomycin has emerging but limited evidence in prostatitis and should be used selectively [^0cb6ceca] [^46bd9f78] [^52d7bd2f].

> Next, I should review diagnostics and follow-up. I need to obtain a midstream urinalysis and urine culture with susceptibilities to guide narrowing of therapy, and I should consider blood cultures if the patient is febrile or systemically ill; if there is slow clinical improvement or severe disease, imaging with transrectal ultrasound or MRI to evaluate for prostatic abscess is indicated, and I should arrange close follow-up within 48–72 hours to ensure clinical response and adherence [^2fdbc707] [^539a25bd] [^381504cd].

> I should confirm partner management and public health steps. Patients should abstain from sexual activity until they and their partners complete treatment and symptoms resolve, and all sexual partners within the prior 60 days should be notified, tested, and presumptively treated for gonorrhea and chlamydia; patients should also be screened for HIV and syphilis at baseline, with repeat HIV testing if the initial test is early after exposure and results are negative or indeterminate [^91bdd048] [^f092d4d0] [^8eb6792a].

> Let me reconsider the final, practical regimen to ensure internal consistency. For a stable outpatient with suspected STI-related acute prostatitis, I would prescribe ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once now, doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 10 days, and levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for a total of 14 days, extending to 21–28 days if symptoms are severe, slow to resolve, or if chronic features emerge; I would obtain urine culture and STI testing, arrange follow-up in 2–3 days, and ensure partner notification and treatment to prevent reinfection and transmission [^650b2ba9] [^0a5c8219] [^e6156924].

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended regimen** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Suspected gonorrhea or chlamydia | Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once [^notfound] + doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily | 10 days [^notfound] |
| Suspected enteric organisms (e.g. insertive anal sex) | Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once [^notfound] + doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily + levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily | 10 days [^notfound] |
| Severe or complicated cases | Extend total therapy to 2–4 weeks based on clinical response [^0a5c8219] [^e6156924] | 2–4 weeks |

---

## Clinical considerations

- **Partner management**: Treat sexual partners to prevent reinfection and transmission [^91bdd048].
- **Follow-up**: Re-evaluate at 72 hours; if no improvement, reassess diagnosis and consider imaging for abscess [^381504cd] [^aabe2d67].
- **STI screening**: Test for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia at baseline [^notfound].

---

## Alternative regimens

If ceftriaxone is unavailable, use **gentamicin 240 mg IM once** [^0cb6ceca] plus **azithromycin 2 g orally once** [^0cb6ceca]; if chlamydia is not excluded, add doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days [^adf84f24].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line**: Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once + doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 10 days [^notfound].
- **Add levofloxacin**: 500 mg orally once daily if enteric organisms are suspected [^notfound].
- **Total duration**: 2–4 weeks based on severity and response [^0a5c8219] [^e6156924].
- **Partner treatment**: Essential to prevent reinfection [^91bdd048].
- **Follow-up**: Re-evaluate at 72 hours; consider imaging if no improvement [^381504cd] [^aabe2d67].

---

This regimen balances **STI coverage** with **enteric organism coverage** and aligns with current guidelines for outpatient management of suspected STI-related acute prostatitis [^notfound].

Background

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection that affects 4% to 12% of young women, and is one of the most common causes of morbidity in this age group. The main intervention for acute PID is the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics which cover Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and anaerobic bacteria, administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or orally. In this review, we assessed the optimal treatment regimen for PID.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic regimens used to treat pelvic inflammatory disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group's Specialized Register, which included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 1944 to 2016, located through electronic searching and handsearching; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid platform (1991 to July 2016); MEDLINE (1946 to July 2016); Embase (1947 to July 2016); LILACS, iAHx interface (1982 to July 2016); World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (July 2016); Web of Science (2001 to July 2016); OpenGrey (1990, 1992, 1995, 1996, and 1997); and abstracts in selected publications.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing the use of antibiotics with placebo or other antibiotics for the treatment of PID in women of reproductive age, either as inpatient or outpatient treatment. We limited our review to comparison of drugs in current use that are recommended for consideration by the 2015 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for treatment of PID.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted investigators to obtain missing information. We resolved disagreements by consensus or by consulting a fourth review author if necessary. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria, classifying it as high, moderate, low, or very low. We calculated Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios (RR), using either random-effects or fixed-effect models and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome or for an additional harmful outcome, with their 95% confidence interval (CI), to measure the effect of the treatments. We conducted sensitivity analyses limited to studies at low risk of bias, for comparisons where such studies were available.

Main Results

We included 37 RCTs (6348 women). The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high, the main limitations being serious risk of bias (due to poor reporting of study methods and lack of blinding), serious inconsistency, and serious imprecision. Azithromycin versus doxycyclineThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two drugs in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.55, I 2 = 72%, 2 RCTs, 243 women, very low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.05, 1 RCT, 309 women, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.34, 3 RCTs, 552 women, I 2 = 0%, low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to a single study at low risk of bias, azithromycin was superior to doxycycline in achieving cure in mild-moderate PID (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.67, 133 women, moderate-quality evidence). Quinolone versus cephalosporinThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two drugs in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.10, 3 RCTs, 459 women, I 2 = 5%, low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.23, 2 RCTs, 313 women, I 2 = 7%, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 2.24, 95% CI 0.52 to 9.72, 5 RCTs, 772 women, I 2 = 0%, very low-quality evidence). Nitroimidazole versus no use of nitroimidazoleThere was no conclusive evidence of a difference between the nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) group and the group receiving other drugs with activity over anaerobes (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate) in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.10, 5 RCTs, 2427 women, I 2 = 60%, moderate-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01, 11 RCTs, 1383 women, I 2 = 0%, moderate-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.59; participants = 3788; studies = 16; I 2 = 0% , low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to studies at low risk of bias, findings did not differ substantially from the main analysis (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.15, 2 RCTs, 1201 women, I 2 = 32%, high-quality evidence). Clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus quinoloneThere was no evidence of a difference between the two groups in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.13, 1 RCT, 25 women, very low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.19, 2 studies, 151 women, I 2 = 0%, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.72, 3 RCTs, 163 women, very low-quality evidence). Clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus cephalosporinThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two groups in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09, 2 RCTs, 150 women, I 2 = 0%, low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06, 10 RCTs, 959 women, I 2 = 21%, moderate-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.42, 10 RCTs, 1172 women, I 2 = 0%, very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no conclusive evidence that one regimen of antibiotics was safer or more effective than any other for the cure of PID, and there was no clear evidence for the use of nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) compared to use of other drugs with activity over anaerobes. Moderate-quality evidence from a single study at low risk of bias suggested that a macrolide (azithromycin) may be more effective than a tetracycline (doxycycline) for curing mild-moderate PID. Our review considered only the drugs that are currently used and mentioned by the CDC.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^650b2ba9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

To prevent complications and transmission of STIs, presumptive therapy for all sexually active men is indicated at the time of the visit before all laboratory test results are available. Selection of presumptive therapy is based on risk for chlamydial and gonococcal infections or enteric organisms. Treatment goals for acute epididymitis are 1) microbiologic infection cure, 2) improvement of signs and symptoms, 3) prevention of transmission of chlamydia and gonorrhea to others, and 4) decreased potential for chlamydial or gonococcal epididymitis complications (e.g. infertility or chronic pain). Although the majority of men with acute epididymitis can be treated on an outpatient basis, referral to a specialist and hospitalization should be considered when severe pain or fever indicates other diagnoses (e.g. torsion, testicular infarction, abscess, or necrotizing fasciitis) or when men are unable to comply with an antimicrobial regimen. Age, history of diabetes, fever, and elevated C-reactive protein can indicate more severe disease requiring hospitalization.

Recommended Regimens for Epididymitis
For acute epididymitis most likely caused by chlamydia or gonorrhea: Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 10 days
For acute epididymitis most likely caused by chlamydia, gonorrhea, or enteric organisms (men who practice insertive anal sex): Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose
plus
Levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days
For acute epididymitis most likely caused by enteric organisms only: Levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days
* For persons weighing ≥150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered.

Levofloxacin monotherapy should be considered if the infection is most likely caused by enteric organisms only, and gonorrhea has been ruled out by Gram, MB, or GV stain. This includes men who have undergone prostate biopsy, vasectomy, and other urinary tract instrumentation procedures. Treatment should be guided by bacterial cultures and antimicrobial susceptibilities. As an adjunct to therapy, bed rest, scrotal elevation, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are recommended until fever and local inflammation have subsided. Complete resolution of discomfort might not occur for a few weeks after completion of the antibiotic regimen.

Other Management Considerations

Men who have acute epididymitis confirmed or suspected to be caused by N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis should be advised to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated and symptoms have resolved. All men with acute epididymitis should be tested for HIV and syphilis.

### Rational antibiotic treatment of outpatient genitourinary infections in a changing environment [^b57b6c19]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

In the outpatient setting, genitourinary infections (GUIs) remain costly to treat and are a significant cause of morbidity. Recent evidence supports more substantial roles for pathogens other than Escherichia coli, particularly gram-positive pathogens, in the pathogenesis of GUIs. Broad-spectrum agents should be considered in order to address this etiologic change appropriately. Criteria for antimicrobial selection set forth by the Council for Appropriate and Rational Antibiotic Therapy (CARAT) recommend using antibiotics that are supported by strong clinical evidence, have good susceptibility profiles, are safe, are cost-effective, and are used for the optimal duration. Evidence-based guidelines recommend considering local E coli resistance rates to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and using fluoroquinolones as second-line therapy when resistance is high. Fluoroquinolones are recommended for the treatment of pyelonephritis and prostatitis. Among the fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin offer coverage for the gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, which may make them preferable in treating urinary tract infections empirically in such patient groups. For the treatment of bacterial prostatitis, only trimethoprim and the fluoroquinolones possess both the appropriate bactericidal activity and the ability to diffuse into the prostate. Levofloxacin shows particularly good penetration into prostatic tissue. Safety issues to consider include imbalances in intestinal microflora caused by antimicrobial agents that may lead to overgrowth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. Once the optimal agent is identified, the optimal duration of treatment should be determined to maximize treatment success while minimizing the potential for resistance. Finally, cost considerations include the costs of treatment failure due to inappropriate therapy or nonadherence to the therapeutic regimen.

### Antibiotic therapy for acute pelvic inflammatory disease: the 2006 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines [^e3a95612]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a substantial cause of reproductive morbidity in young women. A systematic review of the literature related to PID management was performed in preparation for the 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines. This search was conducted using PubMed and was limited to articles written in English and published between 1 January 2002 and 31 January 2005 that were related to PID treatment. Studies were evaluated for new data on PID with regard to site, route, and timing of antimicrobial administration; regimen adherence; experience in adolescents and women >35 years of age; coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus; and management of sex partners. Strong evidence suggests that neither site nor route of treatment administration affects the short- or long-term major outcome of women with mild or moderate clinical presentations. Data on these outcomes in women with more severe clinical presentations are inadequate to provide guidance as to the preferred agents or route of administration. Important contributions to the literature that impact the 2006 guidelines are described in this article.

### Optimising trial designs to identify appropriate antibiotic treatment durations [^d78124c7]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacteria are increasingly able to resist antibiotic treatment, resulting in increased morbidity, deaths and costs worldwide. Antibiotic use is an important driver of the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Selective pressure can be reduced by minimising antibiotic prescribing for conditions for which antibiotics are often unnecessary. Moreover, the duration of antibiotic courses can often be reduced without significantly compromising cure rates. Shortening antibiotic duration can have a large impact on reducing exposure of bacteria to antibiotics, including bacteria carried asymptomatically. Antibiotics are by far the most prescribed drugs for children, with more than 60 million systemic antibiotics dispensed annually in the US outpatient setting alone, and are amongst the most frequently prescribed drugs for adults.

An important challenge is that, for many infectious conditions, the optimal antibiotic course length remains unclear. Courses should be long enough to treat infections effectively, yet short enough to reduce the incidence of side effects and the development and spread of antibiotic resistance. The continued need for antibiotics can be assessed with daily reviews for inpatients ; however, in practice, such reviews are not always performed or acted upon and antibiotics are often continued in order to complete currently recommended course durations. Further, in the outpatient or primary care setting, continued assessment of patients initiated on antibiotics is not feasible. Therefore, it is especially important to have strong evidence about optimal treatment durations in these settings.

Because observational studies comparing different antibiotic durations are potentially confounded by unmeasured patient factors influencing the need for prolonged treatment, evidence about the optimal treatment duration should, where possible, come from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, antibiotic durations for several infections managed in primary care, such as prostatitis, are not guided by RCT evidence on optimal treatment duration. Where treatment durations have been compared in RCTs, in most cases, two treatment durations were selected for comparison, both of which lacked a clear scientific rationale. Whilst RCTs designed in this way can be useful, there are disadvantages to this approach.

Herein, we discuss the main issue with conventional two-arm trial designs, how to assess the ‘optimal’ antibiotic treatment duration, four alternative trial designs that can estimate much needed duration–response relationships (subsequently denoted duration–response curves), and which of these designs has the most desirable properties.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^ed6b41b6]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

For two of the antibiotic indications we studied, treatment was frequently prescribed for shorter durations than recommended—both urinary tract infections in men: acute cystitis and acute prostatitis. This could arise because prescribers appreciate that recommendations for these conditions are based on expert opinion and historical precedent rather than evidence, and that treatment durations for urinary tract infections in women have declined considerably in recent years. It needs to be established whether shorter treatment durations are effective for men with urinary tract infections, as this is a small but important patient population with a risk of harm from under-treatment. Notably, the conditions for which course durations tended to be less than recommended in the guidelines were those for which evidence supporting duration of treatment is weak (supplementary figs S5-S7).

In general, the preference seemed to be for antibiotic prescriptions with durations of five or seven days or multiples thereof, without a clear evidence base for this preference. The preference for such durations has been observed previously in other settings and depended more on local practice and subspecialty than on clinical features such as fever, comorbidities, and severity.In addition, for conditions where guidelines recommend longer durations, the percentage of prescriptions beyond the recommendation is substantially lower than for conditions where guidelines recommend a relatively short duration.

### Antibiotics for treating urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in men and non-pregnant women [^e5377587]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The genital infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) globally. The infection is mainly asymptomatic in women, thus it can produce infertility and chronic pelvic pain. In men infection is mainly symptomatic, but can evolve to prostatitis. Clinical practice guidelines for CT urogenital infections do not give any specific recommendation about which antibiotic use as first option OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic treatment for CT genital infection in men and non-pregnant women.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections' (STI) Information Specialist developed the electronic searches in electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS), and trials registers. We searched studies published from inception to June 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of men, and sexually-active, non-pregnant women with CT infection (urethritis or uterine cervicitis or asymptomatic), diagnosed by cell culture for CT, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) or antigen-based detection methods, who had been treated with any of the antibiotic regimens recommended by any of the updated to 2013 CT Guidelines.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four review authors screened evidence according to selection criteria and independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Two authors developed the 'Summary of findings' tables. We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis model for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect. We estimated the pooled risk ratio in order to establish the effects of the comparisons. Our primary outcomes were microbiological failure and adverse events, and our secondary outcomes were clinical failure, antimicrobial resistance and reinfection.

Main Results

We selected 14 studies ( 2715 participants: 2147 (79.08%) men and 568 (20.92%) women). The studies were conducted mainly at STD clinics. Sample sizes ranged from 71 to 606 participants; follow-up was 29.7 days on average.For the comparison: azithromycin single dose versus doxycycline once or twice daily for 7 days, in men treated for CT, the risk of microbiological failure was higher in the azithromycin group (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.36 to 4.41; participants = 821; studies = 9; moderate-quality evidence), but regarding clinical failure, the results showed that the effect is uncertain (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.43 to 2,05; I² = 55%; participants = 525; studies = 3; low-quality evidence). Regarding adverse events (AE) in men there could be little or no difference between the antibiotics (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.02; participants = 1424; studies = 6; low-quality evidence). About women treated for CT, the effect on microbiological failure was uncertain (RR = 1.71, 95% CI 0.48 to 6.16; participants = 338; studies = 5; very low-quality evidence). There were no studies assessing clinical failure or adverse events in women, however, we found that azithromycin probably has fewer adverse events in both genders (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.98; I² = 0%; participants = 2261; studies = 9; moderate-quality evidence).For the second comparison: doxycycline compared to ofloxacin, for men treated for CT the effect on microbiological failure was uncertain (RR 8.53, 95% CI 0.43 to 167.38, I² not applicable; participants = 80; studies = 2; very low-quality evidence), as also it was on clinical failure (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.62; participants = 36; studies = 1; very low-quality evidence). The effect of in women on clinical failure was uncertain (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.25; I² = 39%; participants = 127; studies = 2; very low-quality evidence).Regarding adverse events, the effect in both men and women was uncertain (RR 1.02 95% CI 0.66 to 1.55; participants = 339 studies = 3; very low-quality evidence). The effect on microbiological failure in women and in men and women together, the effect on microbiological failure was not estimable. The most frequently AE reported were not serious and of gastrointestinal origin.No studies assessed antimicrobial resistance or reinfection in either comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

In men, regimens with azithromycin are probably less effective than doxycycline for microbiological failure, however, there might be little or no difference for clinical failure. For women, we are uncertain whether azithromycin compared to doxycycline increases the risk of microbiological failure. Azithromycin probably slightly reduces adverse events compared to doxycycline in men and women together but may have little difference in men alone. We are uncertain whether doxycycline compared to ofloxacin reduces microbiological failure in men or women alone, or men and women together, nor if it reduces clinical failure or adverse events in men or women.Based on the fact that women suffer mainly asymptomatic infections, and in order to test the effectiveness and safety of the current recommendations (azithromycin, doxycycline and ofloxacin), for CT infection, especially in low and middle income countries, future RCTs should be designed and conducted to include a large enough sample size of women, and with low risk of bias. It is also important that future RCTs include adherence, CT resistance to antibiotic regimens, and risk of reinfection as outcomes to be measured. In addition, it is important to conduct a network meta-analysis in order to evaluate all those studies that included in one arm only the current antibiotic treatments for CT infection that are recommended by the updated clinical practice guidelines.

### Antimicrobial therapy for chronic bacterial prostatitis [^c95ae38a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) is frequently diagnosed in men of fertile age, and is characterized by a disabling array of symptoms, including pain in the pelvic area (for example, perineum, testicles), voiding symptoms (increased frequency and urgency, also at night; pain or discomfort at micturition), and sexual dysfunction. Cure of CBP can be attempted by long-term therapy with antibacterial agents, but relapses are frequent. Few antibacterial agents are able to distribute to the prostatic tissue and achieve sufficient concentrations at the site of infection. These agents include fluoroquinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim. After the introduction of fluoroquinolones into clinical practice, a number of studies have been performed to optimize the antimicrobial treatment of CBP, and to improve eradication rates and symptom relief.

Objectives

To assess and compare the efficacy and harm of antimicrobial treatments for chronic bacterial prostatitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, other national or international databases and abstracts from conference proceedings on 8 August 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled comparisons of one antimicrobial agent versus placebo or one or more comparator antimicrobial agents, combined or not with non-antimicrobial drugs. We also included trials comparing different doses, treatment durations, dosing frequencies, or routes of administration of antimicrobial agents. We excluded studies in which patients were not diagnosed according to internationally recommended criteria, or were not subjected to lower urinary tract segmented tests.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study data were extracted independently by two review authors. Study outcomes were microbiological efficacy (pathogen eradication), clinical efficacy (symptom cure or improvement, or symptom scores) at test-of-cure visits or at follow-up, or both, and adverse effects of therapy. Secondary outcomes included microbiological recurrence rates.Statistical analysis was performed using a fixed-effect model for microbiological outcomes and a random-effects model for clinical outcomes and adverse effects. The results were expressed as risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes (with 95% confidence intervals) or as standardized mean differences for continuous or non-dichotomous variables.

Main Results

We identified 18 studies, enrolling a total of 2196 randomized patients. The oral fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin and prulifloxacin were compared. There were no significant differences in clinical or microbiological efficacy or in the rate of adverse effects between these fluoroquinolones. In chlamydial prostatitis, (i) azithromycin showed improved eradication rates and clinical cure rates compared to ciprofloxacin, with no significant differences regarding adverse effects; (ii) azithromycin was equivalent to clarithromycin, both microbiologically and clinically; (iii) prulifloxacin appeared to improve clinical symptoms, but not eradication rates, compared to doxycycline. In ureaplasmal prostatitis, the comparisons ofloxacin versus minocycline and azithromycin versus doxycycline showed similar microbiological, clinical and toxicity profiles.

Authors' Conclusions

The microbiological and clinical efficacy, as well as the adverse effect profile, of different oral fluoroquinolones are comparable. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the optimal treatment duration of fluoroquinolones in the treatment of CBP caused by traditional pathogens.Alternative antimicrobial agents tested for the treatment of CBP caused by traditional pathogens are co-trimoxazole, beta-lactams and tetracyclines, but no conclusive evidence can be drawn regarding the role of non-fluoroquinolone antibiotics in the treatment of CBP caused by traditional pathogens.In patients with CBP caused by obligate intracellular pathogens, macrolides showed higher microbiological and clinical cure rates compared to fluoroquinolones.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^e8b20eae]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management—men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10-14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective. Refer to Figure 1.3 for a stepwise assessment of the intravenous to oral switch and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^220d5dcb]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

For each indication we calculated the proportion of prescriptions longer than the recommended duration separately for children (<16 years) and for people aged 16 years or older, and by antibiotic where guidelines recommended different durations for particular drugs. Because guidelines recommend longer antibiotic courses to treat acute cystitis in males than females,we performed separate analyses for males and females for this condition. The cause of acute prostatitis in young men is often differentfrom that in older men (sexually transmitted organisms versus mostly Enterobacteriaceae, respectively), and prescribers might fear chronic prostatitis more in older men. Therefore we evaluated three age groups for acute prostatitis: <35, 35-65, and >65 years old. In addition, for all conditions we performed a secondary analysis restricting to healthy patients, defined as those with no chronic kidney disease, COPD, asthma, coronary heart disease, immunosuppressive disease, or use of immunosuppressive drugs, systemic corticosteroids, or inhaled corticosteroids.

We used multiple imputations through chained equations using sequential regression trees to impute duration data that were missing in 10-20% of the consultations (see supplementary file 2 for more details).Confidence intervals were calculated using multiple imputation Wilson intervals, which have better properties than the usual multiple imputation confidence intervals, in particular always being bounded by zero and one.In sensitivity analysis, we restricted the analysis to data with no missing values.

In addition, we calculated the total number of excess antibiotic days, defined as the total number of days beyond the recommended duration in the guidelines.

All analyses were performed using R version 3.4.3 (packages: “dplyr,” “ggplot2,” “mice,” “nlme”).

Patient and public involvement

No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in developing plans for design or implementation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. Results will be disseminated to relevant patient communities through news media.

### Acute and chronic prostatitis [^d5a937a1]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Prostatitis is a common clinical syndrome classified into four categories: acute bacterial, chronic bacterial, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and asymptomatic. Bacterial prostatitis (acute and chronic) is primarily diagnosed with history and microbiologic studies, although physical examination can be helpful to localize infection within the genitourinary system. Bacterial prostatitis is treated with antibiotics; the span of treatment is guided by the duration of symptoms and presence of complications. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is the most common form of prostatitis and is a diagnosis of exclusion with no standardized treatments. Asymptomatic prostatitis does not require treatment and is usually diagnosed incidentally during the workup for other urologic presentations.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^fc1d9dae]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration—In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5-7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10-14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10-14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

### Prostatitis: a review [^61c1eab4]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Prostatitis is defined as infection, inflammation, or pain of the prostate gland and affects approximately 9.3% of men in their lifetime.

Observations

Acute bacterial prostatitis consists of a urinary tract infection (UTI) that includes infection of the prostate, typically associated with fever or chills and caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, or Pseudomonas, in 80% to 97% of cases. First-line therapy for acute prostatitis is broad-spectrum intravenous or oral antibiotics, such as intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, or oral ciprofloxacin, which has a 92% to 97% success rate when prescribed for 2 to 4 weeks for people with febrile UTI and acute prostatitis. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is defined as a persistent bacterial infection of the prostate, typically presenting as recurrent UTIs from the same strain. Up to 74% of chronic bacterial prostatitis diagnoses are due to gram-negative organisms, such as E coli. First-line therapy for chronic bacterial prostatitis is a minimum 4-week course of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) presents as pelvic pain or discomfort for at least 3 months and is associated with urinary symptoms, such as urinary frequency. CP/CPPS is diagnosed when evaluation, including history and physical examination, urine culture, and postvoid residual measurement, does not identify other causes for the symptoms, such as infection, cancer, urinary obstruction, or urinary retention. The National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) measures symptom severity (scale of 0-43), with a 6-point change considered clinically meaningful. First-line oral therapy for CP/CPPS with urinary symptoms is α-blockers (eg, tamsulosin, alfuzosin; ΔNIH-CPSI score difference vs placebo=-10.8 to -4.8). Other oral therapies are associated with modest changes in NIH-CPSI score compared with placebo, including anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, ibuprofen; ΔNIH-CPSI score difference=-2.5 to -1.7), pregabalin (ΔNIH-CPSI score difference=-2.4), and pollen extract (ΔNIH-CPSI score difference=-2.49).

Conclusions and Relevance

Prostatitis includes acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, and CP/CPPS, each of which is diagnosed and treated differently. First-line treatments are broad-spectrum antibiotics for acute bacterial prostatitis (such as piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, or ciprofloxacin), at least 4 weeks of fluoroquinolones for chronic bacterial prostatitis, and α-blockers for CP/CPPS with urinary symptoms.

### Excessive antibiotic use in men with prostatitis [^68902620]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Prostatitis accounts for 2 million outpatient visits annually. The majority of prostatitis cases fit the definition of chronic pelvic pain syndrome, for which routine antibiotic use is not indicated.

Methods

Inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy datasets from the Veterans Health Administration were used to quantify the magnitude of antibiotic use attributable to chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Specifically, men with a diagnosis of infectious/acute prostatitis or a urinary tract infection were excluded, and the remaining men with a diagnosis of prostatitis were defined as having chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

Results

The annual prevalence of chronic pelvic pain syndrome was 0.5%. Prescriptions for fluoroquinolone antibiotics were filled in 49% of men with a diagnosis of chronic pelvic pain syndrome compared with 5% in men without chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Men with chronic pelvic pain syndrome were more than 7 times more likely to receive a fluoroquinolone prescription independently of age, race/ethnicity, and comorbid conditions. Increased use of other antibiotics also was observed. High use was similar in men with either infectious/acute prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

Conclusion

Despite evidence that antibiotics are not effective in the majority of men with chronic pelvic pain syndrome, they were prescribed in 69% of men with this diagnosis. Some increased use is probably due to uncontrolled confounding by comorbid conditions or inaccurate diagnostic coding. However, a 7-fold higher rate of fluoroquinolone usage suggests that strategies to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use in men with prostatitis are warranted.

### The etiology and management of acute prostatitis [^2776ed6d]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2011). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial prostatitis is a common and clinically important genitourinary disorder. Patient populations who are at especially high risk of acute prostatitis include those with diabetes, cirrhosis, and suppressed immune systems. The cause is usually an ascending infection, but bacteria can also be introduced during transrectal prostate biopsy. Clinical presentation ranges from mild lower urinary tract symptoms to full sepsis. The causative organisms are usually similar to those that cause other common genitourinary infections, and include Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. Oral or intravenous antibiotics are usually effective for curing the infection and progression to chronic bacterial prostatitis is, therefore, uncommon. Immunosuppressed patients require special consideration, as bacterial prostatitis in these patients can be caused by atypical infecting organisms and might, therefore, require additional therapies. A lack of response to standard therapy can lead to complications such as a prostatic abscess or fistula.

### Prostatitis [^e9b2d46c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Prostatitis is a common condition that accounts for a significant number of visits to both the emergency department and the urologist.  The precise pathogenic mechanism of prostatitis is not known.  The most prevalent theory is that reflux of urine from the urethra into the  intraprostatic ducts promotes ascending infection and leads to chemical or bacterial prostatitis.  Treatment is challenging because many antimicrobial agents do not effectively diffuse into prostatic tissue and many cases of prostatitis are not found to have an infectious etiology.  Prostatitis can be divided into different classifications which range from acute severe infections, to chronic indolent infections, to chronic pain syndromes. The differentiation and management of these entities can be difficult.  This article seeks to clarify the different infections, and provide a rational approach to treatment and disposition of these patients.

Materials and methods

Study design

This study exploits unpublished data that were collected through a survey of physicians practising in Lebanon between March and August 2016. It aimed to describe ATBs prescription trends in UTIs before the local guidelines were published in 2017. Extensive work was conducted to improve the quality of this 2016 dataset. Despite an increasingly complex national context, we prioritised rigorous data refinement to ensure the reliability and accuracy of our findings, a process that required additional time. Furthermore, Lebanon’s financial, economic and political crises, alongside the COVID-19 pandemic, created significant challenges that delayed the project’s progress during this period.

Physicians most likely to treat UTIs were selected: general practitioners, specialists in urology, infectious diseases, gynaecology, internal medicine and family medicine. Each physician was visited once by the researchers and asked to provide his last ten ATBs prescriptions for the treatment of a UTI. The medical records were then reviewed for eligibility criteria that were defined as follows.

Patients 18 years old or above.
Diagnosis of simple or complicated cystitis, simple or complicated pyelonephritis or prostatitis based on physician’s appreciation and notes in the medical record.
Outpatient treatment with an oral or intramuscular ATB.
Patients not known to have a psychiatric illness, concurrent infections, sexually transmitted diseases or candidiasis.

Then, five prescriptions per physician were to be randomly chosen to keep a small cluster size and minimise selection bias. Consequently, with an acceptable margin of error of 7%, a design effect of 1 and an expected frequency of conformity of 35%, a sample size of 185 prescriptions from 37 physicians was required with a confidence level of 95%.

Other management considerations—abstinence, testing, and prevention: To minimize transmission and reinfection, patients treated for acute proctitis should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated (i.e., until completion of a 7-day regimen and symptoms have resolved). All persons with acute proctitis and concern for sexually transmitted proctocolitis or enteritis should be tested for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia (at other exposed sites). PEP should be considered for exposures that present a risk for HIV acquisition, and for ongoing risk for HIV acquisition, PrEP should be considered. Evidence-based interventions for preventing acquisition of sexually transmitted enteric pathogens are not available; however, recommendations include avoiding contact with feces during sex, using barriers, and washing hands after handling materials that have been in contact with the anal area (i.e., barriers and sex toys) and after touching the anus or rectal area.

### Current challenges in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections and prostatitis [^92488b54]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Serious urinary tract infections (UTIs) and acute bacterial prostatitis in adults cause significant morbidity and economic burden. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is a rather rare condition seen in urological practice, however, in certain occasions difficult to treat. In this paper, we review the bacterial etiologies and the resistance patterns found in adults with serious UTIs and bacterial prostatitis, and discuss considerations for selecting optimal antimicrobial therapy. The role of fluoroquinolones as targeted therapy for serious UTIs is highlighted. The use of effective antimicrobial therapy is the foundation of management of serious UTIs and bacterial prostatitis. Selection of the optimal antimicrobial agent must take into account patient-specific factors; infection characteristics (e.g., severity, community- vs. institutional- or hospital-acquired, need for IV agent, UTI, prostatitis); local resistance pattern; pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles; and cost. Fluoroquinolones are among the alternatives for empirical antibiotic treatment of serious UTIs and acute bacterial prostatitis. In serious UTIs activity of the antimicrobial agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa needs to be taken into account. In chronic bacterial prostatitis fluoroquinolones are the first choice because of their favourable pharmacokinetic properties at the site of infection. Targeted antimicrobial therapy--emphasising the correct antibacterial spectrum and correct dosage--is likely to provide important benefits, such as reduced morbidity and associated costs, reduced emergence of resistance and maintenance of class efficacy.

### Treatment of bacterial prostatitis [^4454800a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Prostatitis is characterized by voiding symptoms and genitourinary pain and is sometimes associated with sexual dysfunction. Up to 25% of men receive a diagnosis of prostatitis in their lifetime, but <10% have a proven bacterial infection. The causes and treatment of nonbacterial prostatitis are largely unknown, but bacterial prostatitis is caused by infection with uropathogens, especially gram-negative bacilli, although infection is sometimes due to gram-positive and atypical microorganisms. Acute bacterial prostatitis is easily diagnosed (by abrupt urogential and often systemic symptoms, along with bacteriuria) and treated (by systemic antibiotic therapy). Chronic bacterial prostatitis is characterized by prolonged or recurrent symptoms and relapsing bacteriuria; diagnosis traditionally requires comparing urinary specimens obtained before with specimens obtained after prostatic massage. Treating chronic bacterial prostatitis requires prolonged therapy with an antibiotic that penetrates the prostate (ie, one with high lipid solubility, a low degree of ionization, high dissociation constant, low protein binding, and small molecular size). We review recent pharmacological and clinical data on treating bacterial prostatitis.

Throughout this report, the evidence used as the basis for specific recommendations is discussed briefly. Publication of comprehensive, annotated discussions of such evidence is planned in a supplemental issue of the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases after publication of the treatment guidelines. When more than one therapeutic regimen is recommended and the listed regimens have similar efficacy and similar rates of intolerance or toxicity, the recommendations are listed alphabetically. If differences are specified, regimens are prioritized on the basis of these differences. Recommended regimens should be used primarily; alternative regimens can be considered in instances of notable drug allergy or other medical contraindications to the recommended regimens. Alternative regimens are considered inferior to recommended regimens on the basis of available evidence regarding the principal outcomes and disadvantages of the regimens.

Treatment

Acute proctitis among persons who have anal exposure through oral, genital, or digital contact is usually sexually acquired. Presumptive therapy should be initiated while awaiting results of laboratory tests for persons with anorectal exudate detected on examination or polymorphonuclear leukocytes detected on a Gram-stained smear of anorectal exudate or secretions. Such therapy also should be initiated when anoscopy or Gram stain is not available and the clinical presentation is consistent with acute proctitis for persons reporting receptive anal exposures.

Recommended Regimen for Acute Proctitis
Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days †
* For persons weighing ≥150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered.
† Doxycycline course should be extended to 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 21 days in the presence of bloody discharge, perianal or mucosal ulcers, or tenesmus and a positive rectal chlamydia test.

Bloody discharge, perianal ulcers, or mucosal ulcers among persons with acute proctitis and rectal chlamydia (NAAT) should receive presumptive treatment for LGV with an extended course of doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 3 weeks (see Lymphogranuloma Venereum). If painful perianal ulcers are present or mucosal ulcers are detected on anoscopy, presumptive therapy should also include a regimen for genital herpes (see Genital Herpes).

Diagnostic and Treatment Considerations for Proctocolitis or Enteritis

Treatment for proctocolitis or enteritis should be directed to the specific enteric pathogen identified. Multiple stool examinations might be necessary for detecting Giardia, and special stool preparations are required for diagnosing cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis. Diagnostic and treatment recommendations for all enteric infections are beyond the scope of these guidelines. Providers should be aware of the potential for antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, particularly during outbreaks of Shigella and Campylobacter among sexual networks of MSM where increased resistance to azithromycin, fluoroquinolones, and isolates resistant to multiple antibiotics have been described.

### Prostatitis: diagnosis and treatment [^fd6c75ef]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Prostatitis ranges from a straightforward clinical entity in its acute form to a complex, debilitating condition when chronic. It is often a source of frustration for the treating physician and patient. There are four classifications of prostatitis: acute bacterial, chronic bacterial, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and asymptomatic. Diagnosis of acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis is primarily based on history, physical examination, urine culture, and urine specimen testing pre- and post-prostatic massage. The differential diagnosis of prostatitis includes acute cystitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, urinary tract stones, bladder cancer, prostatic abscess, enterovesical fistula, and foreign body within the urinary tract. The mainstay of therapy is an antimicrobial regimen. Chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a more challenging entity, in part because its pathology is poorly understood. Diagnosis is often based on exclusion of other urologic conditions (e.g., voiding dysfunction, bladder cancer) in association with its presentation. Commonly used medications include antimicrobials, alpha blockers, and anti-inflammatory agents, but the effectiveness of these agents has not been supported in clinical trials. Small studies provide limited support for the use of nonpharmacologic modalities. Asymptomatic prostatitis is an incidental finding in a patient being evaluated for other urologic problems.

### Progress in the fight against multidrug-resistant bacteria 2005-2016: modern noninferiority trial designs enable antibiotic development in advance of epidemic bacterial resistance [^30ada275]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The insights discussed in this article into the regulatory science of noninferiority trial design have profoundly reshaped the antibiotic pipeline (Figure 1). The most recent approval of an oral administration–only antibiotic was in 2003, and the last approval of an antibiotic for milder outpatient skin or upper respiratory infections was in 2001. Conversely, all initial antibiotic registrations since 2009 have included an intravenous route of administration and have been for one of the infections recommended for routine study (Table 1). Table 1 also highlights the resurgence of antibiotic development since the creation circa 2009–2010 of updated regulatory guidance—although much remains to be done, these are encouraging signs that new agents will be available in the future.

Figure 1. 
Initial antibacterial approvals by route and indication, 1995–2016. Initial approvals of antibacterial agents from 1995 to 2016 were retrieved from CDERWatch and Drugs@FDA and are shown by approved route and number of initially approved indications (some agents were approved for >1 indication). As needed due to evolution of indication terminology, indications were grouped. The 2016 approval of bezlotoxumab to reduce recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection is not shown. Abbreviations: CABP, community-acquired bacterial pneumonia; cIAI, complicated intra-abdominal infection; cSSTI, complicated skin and skin structure infection; cUTI, complicated urinary tract infection; Genital, uncomplicated gonorrhea, prostatitis, nongonococcal urethritis, and chlamydia; IV, intravenous; Meningitis, bacterial meningitis; NP, nosocomial pneumonia including hospital- and ventilator-associated pneumonia; Mild RTI, acute otitis media, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, acute sinusitis, and pharyngitis/tonsillitis; uSSTI, uncomplicated skin and skin structure infection; uUTI, uncomplicated urinary tract infection.

In conclusion, noninferiority trial designs are a necessary and essential part of antibiotic drug development. Without them, ensuring availability of efficacious and safe, novel antibiotics in advance of epidemic spread of resistant bacterial strains is impossible, to the obvious detriment of individual and public health.

Acute HIV infection—clinical identification and follow-up: Providers serving persons at risk for STIs are in a position to diagnose HIV infection during its acute phase, which is particularly important because persons with acute HIV have highly infectious disease due to the concentration of virus in plasma and genital secretions, which is extremely elevated during that stage of infection. Persons who receive an acute HIV diagnosis should be referred immediately to an HIV clinical care provider, provided prevention counseling and screened for STIs. When testing during suspected acute infection yields negative or indeterminate results under the CDC algorithm after a possible exposure within the previous few days to weeks, additional testing for HIV RNA is recommended, and if HIV RNA is also negative, repeat testing in a few weeks is recommended to rule out very early acute infection.

Acute epididymitis—presumptive therapy and care setting: To prevent complications and transmission of STIs, presumptive therapy for all sexually active men is indicated at the time of the visit before laboratory test results are available, and selection of presumptive therapy is based on risk for chlamydial and gonococcal infections or enteric organisms. Treatment goals for acute epididymitis are 1) microbiologic infection cure, 2) improvement of signs and symptoms, 3) prevention of transmission of chlamydia and gonorrhea to others, and 4) decreased potential for chlamydial or gonococcal epididymitis complications (e.g., infertility or chronic pain). Although the majority of men with acute epididymitis can be treated on an outpatient basis, referral to a specialist and hospitalization should be considered when severe pain or fever indicates other diagnoses (e.g., torsion, testicular infarction, abscess, or necrotizing fasciitis) or when men are unable to comply with an antimicrobial regimen, and age, history of diabetes, fever, and elevated C-reactive protein can indicate more severe disease requiring hospitalization.

Management Considerations

To minimize transmission and reinfections, men treated for NGU should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated (i.e. until completion of a 7-day regimen and symptoms have resolved or for 7 days after single-dose therapy). Men with NGU should be tested for HIV and syphilis.

Follow-Up

Men should be provided their testing results obtained as part of the NGU evaluation. Those with a specific diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be offered partner services and instructed to return 3 months after treatment for repeat testing because of high rates of reinfection, regardless of whether their sex partners were treated (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections; Trichomoniasis).

If symptoms persist or recur after therapy completion, men should be instructed to return for reevaluation and should be tested for M. genitalium and T. vaginalis. Symptoms alone, without documentation of signs or laboratory evidence of urethral inflammation, are insufficient basis for retreatment. Providers should be alert to the possible diagnosis of chronic prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men experiencing persistent perineal, penile, or pelvic pain or discomfort; voiding symptoms; pain during or after ejaculation; or new-onset premature ejaculation lasting for >3 months. Men with persistent pain should be referred to a urologist with expertise in pelvic pain disorders.

Management of Sex Partners

All sex partners of men with NGU within the preceding 60 days should be referred for evaluation and testing and presumptive treatment with a drug regimen effective against chlamydia. All partners should be evaluated and treated according to the management section for their respective pathogen; EPT could be an alternate approach if a partner is unable to access timely care. To avoid reinfection, sex partners should abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners are treated.

### Azithromycin dihydrate (Zithromax) [^26d329ca]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Cardiovascular Death

Some observational studies have shown an approximately two-fold increased short-term potential risk of acute cardiovascular death in adults exposed to azithromycin relative to other antibacterial drugs, including amoxicillin. The five-day cardiovascular mortality observed in these studies ranged from 20 to 400 per million azithromycin treatment courses. This potential risk was noted to be greater during the first five days of azithromycin use and does not appear to be limited to those patients with preexisting cardiovascular diseases. The data in these observational studies are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between acute cardiovascular death and azithromycin use. Consider balancing this potential risk with treatment benefits when prescribing ZITHROMAX.

5.6 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea (CDAD)

CDAD has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ZITHROMAX, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C. difficile .

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin - producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.7 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis

Exacerbations of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of myasthenic syndrome have been reported in patients receiving azithromycin therapy.

5.8 Use in Sexually Transmitted Infections

ZITHROMAX, (single dose 1 g packet) at the recommended dose, should not be relied upon to treat gonorrhea or syphilis. Antibacterial agents used in high doses for short periods of time to treat non-gonococcal urethritis may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating gonorrhea or syphilis. All patients with sexually transmitted urethritis or cervicitis should have a serologic test for syphilis and appropriate cultures for gonorrhea performed at the time of diagnosis. Appropriate antibacterial therapy and follow-up tests for these diseases should be initiated if infection is confirmed.

The fluoroquinolone antibiotics given for 2 to 4 weeks will cure about 70% of chronic bacterial infections of the prostate.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: diagnosis, management, and prevention [^3ebd8e74]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper genital tract occurring predominantly in sexually active young women. Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are common causes; however, other cervical, enteric, bacterial vaginosis-associated, and respiratory pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, may be involved. PID can be acute, chronic, or subclinical and is often underdiagnosed. Untreated PID can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and intra-abdominal infections. The diagnosis is made primarily on clinical suspicion, and empiric treatment is recommended in sexually active young women or women at risk for sexually transmitted infections who have unexplained lower abdominal or pelvic pain and cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness on examination. Mild to moderate disease can be treated in an outpatient setting with a single intramuscular injection of a recommended cephalosporin followed by oral doxycycline for 14 days. Additionally, metronidazole is recommended for 14 days in the setting of bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, or recent uterine instrumentation. Hospitalization for parenteral antibiotics is recommended in patients who are pregnant or severely ill, in whom outpatient treatment has failed, those with tubo-ovarian abscess, or if surgical emergencies cannot be excluded. Treatment does not change in patients with intrauterine devices or those with HIV. Sex partner treatment is recommended; expedited partner treatment is recommended where legal. Prevention of PID includes screening for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae in all women younger than 25 years and those who are at risk or pregnant, plus intensive behavioral counseling for all adolescents and adults at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections.

### Appropriate antibiotic treatment of genitourinary infections in hospitalized patients [^01e3a0d3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The etiology of urinary tract infections (UTIs) that require hospitalization, whether they originate in the hospital or in the community, is changing, with increasing findings of gram-positive organisms. The Council for Appropriate and Rational Antibiotic Therapy (CARAT) criteria recommend evaluating treatment choices on the basis of sound clinical evidence, potential for therapeutic benefits, safety, optimal duration of treatment, and cost-efficacy in order to improve antibiotic treatment. Evidence-based guidelines recommend fluoroquinolones for the treatment of patients with cases of pyelonephritis or bacterial prostatitis severe enough to warrant hospitalization. For other serious UTIs, fluoroquinolones are usually recommended either when traditional agents have failed or when resistance to traditional agents is high. Even in the context of rapidly changing antimicrobial resistance patterns, the fluoroquinolones have maintained consistent, well-tolerated efficacy against many of the principal organisms responsible for UTIs, and are generally considered safe for most patients. To increase the likelihood of treatment success with first-line therapy, an antimicrobial agent must attain sufficient concentrations in the target tissue or in the urine for an appropriate amount of time. Both levofloxacin and gatifloxacin are excreted unchanged in the urine in concentrations that far exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration of most uropathogens. Factors that affect cost-effectiveness that should be considered include acquisition costs as well as treatment success and ease of use for hospital staff.

### How I manage bacterial prostatitis [^46bd9f78]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacterial prostatitis is a highly prevalent infection responsible for significant morbidity among men. The diagnosis and treatment for bacterial prostatitis remains complicated. The difficulty in diagnosis is in part owing to the paucity of high-quality evidence that guides a clinician's interpretation of patients' history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. Treatment is challenging because of the few antimicrobials capable of prostate penetration, growing antimicrobial resistance limiting effective treatment options, and the high risk of recurrence.

Objectives

We aimed to provide a useful resource for clinicians in effectively diagnosing and managing acute bacterial prostatitis (ABP) and chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP).

Sources

A PubMed literature search on prostatitis was performed with no restrictions on publication date.

Content

The epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment for ABP and CBP are explored using a clinical vignette as relevant context.

Implications

Bacterial prostatitis can be diagnosed through a focused history and microbiological investigations. The Meares-Stamey 4-glass test or modified 2-glass test can help confirm the diagnosis if uncertainty exists. Typical uropathogens are common contributors to bacterial prostatitis but there is growing interest in exploring the role atypical and traditional non-pathogenic organisms may have. Fluoroquinolones remain first-line therapy, followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or doxycycline if the pathogen is susceptible. Fosfomycin has emerged as a repurposed and useful agent because of the increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens. Selection of appropriate antimicrobial regimens can be challenging and is dependent on the host, chronicity of symptoms, uropathogens' susceptibilities, antimicrobials' side effect profile, and the presence of prostatic abscesses or calcifications. ABP can typically be treated similar to other complicated urinary tract infections. However, CBP requires prolonged therapy, with a minimum of 4 weeks and up to 12 weeks of therapy.

### Bacterial prostatitis [^405c41e8]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review provides the infectious disease community with a urologic perspective on bacterial prostatitis. Specifically, the article briefly reviews the categorization of prostatitis by type and provides a distillation of new findings published on bacterial prostatitis over the past year. It also highlights key points from the established literature.

Recent Findings

Cross-sectional prostate imaging is becoming more common and may lead to more incidental diagnoses of acute bacterial prostatitis. As drug resistance remains problematic in this condition, the reemergence of older antibiotics such as fosfomycin, has proven beneficial. With regard to chronic bacterial prostatitis, no clear clinical risk factors emerged in a large epidemiological study. However, bacterial biofilm formation has been associated with more severe cases. Surgery has a limited role in bacterial prostatitis and should be reserved for draining of a prostatic abscess or the removal of infected prostatic stones.

Summary

Prostatitis remains a common and bothersome clinical condition. Antibiotic therapy remains the basis of treatment for both acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Further research into improving prostatitis treatment is indicated.

This insert is for the Pharmacy Bulk Package and is intended for preparing IV admixtures only. Dosage recommendations for intramuscular or direct intravenous injection are for informational purposes only.

Infections of the respiratory tract and soft tissues.

Patients weighing 40 kg (88 lbs) or more: 250 to 500 mg every 6 hours.

Patients weighing less than 40 kg (88 lbs): 25 to 50 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses at 6- to 8-hour intervals.

Infections of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts (including those caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae in females).

Patients weighing 40 kg (88 lbs) or more: 500 mg every 6 hours.

Patients weighing less than 40 kg (88 lbs): 50 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses at 6-to 8-hour intervals.

In the treatment of chronic urinary tract and intestinal infections, frequent bacteriological and clinical appraisal is necessary. Smaller doses than those recommended above should not be used. Higher doses should be used for stubborn or severe infections. In stubborn infections, therapy may be required for several weeks. It may be necessary to continue clinical and/or bacteriological follow-up for several months after cessation of therapy.

Urethritis in males due to N. gonorrhoeae :

Adults: Two doses of 500 mg each at an interval of 8 to 12 hours.

Treatment may be repeated if necessary or extended if required.

In the treatment of complications of gonorrheal urethritis, such as prostatitis and epididymitis, prolonged and intensive therapy is recommended. Cases of gonorrhea with a suspected primary lesion of syphilis should have darkfield examinations before receiving treatment. In all other cases where concomitant syphilis is suspected, monthly serological tests should be made for a minimum of four months.

The doses for the preceding infections may be given by either the intramuscular or intravenous route. A change to oral ampicillin may be made when appropriate.

Bacterial Meningitis.

Adults and children: 150 to 200 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 3 to 4 hours. (Treatment may be initiated with intravenous drip therapy and continued with intramuscular injections.) The doses for other infections may be given by either the intravenous or intramuscular route.

Neonates (less than or equal to 28 days of postnatal age): Dosage should be based on Gestational age and Postnatal age according to Table 1.

Intramuscular or Oral Treatment

IM or oral therapy can be considered for women with mild-to-moderate acute PID because the clinical outcomes among women treated with these regimens are similar to those treated with IV therapy. Women who do not respond to IM or oral therapy within 72 hours should be reevaluated to confirm the diagnosis and be administered therapy IV.

Recommended Intramuscular or Oral Regimens for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days
or
Cefoxitin 2 g IM in a single dose and probenecid 1 g orally administered concurrently in a single dose
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days
or
Other parenteral third-generation cephalosporin (e.g. ceftizoxime or cefotaxime)
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days
* For persons weighing ≥150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered.

These regimens provide coverage against frequent etiologic agents of PID; however, the optimal choice of a cephalosporin is unclear. Cefoxitin, a second-generation cephalosporin, has better anaerobic coverage than ceftriaxone, and, in combination with probenecid and doxycycline, has been effective in short-term clinical response among women with PID. Ceftriaxone has better coverage against N. gonorrhoeae. The addition of metronidazole to these regimens provides extended coverage against anaerobic organisms and will also effectively treat BV, which is frequently associated with PID.

Acute epididymitis—other management considerations and follow-up: Men with acute epididymitis confirmed or suspected to be caused by N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis should be advised to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated and symptoms have resolved, and all men with acute epididymitis should be tested for HIV and syphilis. Men should be instructed to return to their health care providers if their symptoms do not improve <72 hours after treatment, and signs and symptoms that do not subside in <3 days require reevaluation of the diagnosis and therapy. Men who experience swelling and tenderness that persist after completion of antimicrobial therapy should be evaluated for alternative diagnoses, including tumor, abscess, infarction, testicular cancer, TB, and fungal epididymitis.

### Sexually transmitted infections: updates from the 2021 CDC guidelines [^8eb6792a]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates are increasing for most nationally notifiable disease categories in the United States. The 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STI guidelines provide several updated, evidence-based testing and treatment recommendations. The recommended treatment for gonorrhea is ceftriaxone monotherapy given intramuscularly, with dosing based on the patient's body weight. For chlamydia, doxycycline is the preferred treatment. A test-of-cure is recommended for all cases of pharyngeal gonorrhea and for rectal chlamydia if treated with azithromycin. Vaginal trichomoniasis should be treated with a seven-day regimen of metronidazole. Treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease routinely includes metronidazole with doxycycline and an increased dosage of ceftriaxone. Syphilis of less than one year's duration should be treated with a single dose of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, 2.4 million units. Syphilis of more than one year's or unknown duration should be treated with three consecutive weekly doses of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, 2.4 million units each. A thorough evaluation for otic, ophthalmic, and neurologic symptoms is essential for anyone with syphilis because these complications can occur at any stage and require 10 to 14 days of treatment with intravenous aqueous crystalline penicillin G. Family physicians can reduce STI rates by taking a thorough sexual history, especially in teens and young adults, ordering screening tests and treatment based on the updated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STI guidelines, and collaborating with public health departments for disease reporting and partner services.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^865c5e43]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis—Efficacy across sites and regimen selection indicate superior rectal cure with doxycycline versus azithromycin and outline site-specific and dosing considerations: in men who have sex with men (MSM), microbiologic cure was 100% with doxycycline and 74% with azithromycin; among women with urogenital infection, anorectal detection is reported in 33%–83%. Routine oropharyngeal screening is not recommended; if identified from an oropharyngeal specimen among persons with pharyngeal gonorrhea, it should be treated, and limited evidence indicates doxycycline might be more efficacious than azithromycin for oropharyngeal chlamydia. Doxycycline is efficacious for urogenital, rectal, and oropharyngeal sites, and a delayed-release 200-mg tablet once daily for 7 days is as effective as 100 mg twice daily for 7 days for urogenital infection with lower gastrointestinal side effects. Levofloxacin is an effective alternative but more expensive, erythromycin is no longer recommended because of gastrointestinal side effects, and when nonadherence to doxycycline is a substantial concern, azithromycin 1 g is an alternative that might require posttreatment evaluation and testing because of lower rectal efficacy.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae suspected treatment failure—evaluation and management emphasize obtaining cultures and susceptibility testing, consultation and reporting, defined retreatment, and follow-up. Before retreatment, relevant clinical specimens should be obtained for culture (preferably with simultaneous NAAT) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing if N. gonorrhoeae is isolated, and phenotypic testing should be performed by using Etest or agar dilution; all isolates of suspected treatment failures should be sent to CDC and local laboratories should store isolates for possible further testing. For patients with suspected cephalosporin treatment failure, the treating clinician should consult an infectious disease specialist, a prevention training center, or public health authorities, and suspected treatment failure should be reported to CDC through the local or state health department <24 hours after diagnosis. Patients with suspected treatment failures should first be retreated routinely with the initial regimen used (ceftriaxone 500 mg IM), with the addition of doxycycline if chlamydia infection exists; dual treatment with single doses of IM gentamicin 240 mg plus oral azithromycin 2 g can be considered, particularly when isolates are identified as having elevated cephalosporin MICs. Persons with suspected failure after alternative regimens should be treated with ceftriaxone 500 mg as a single IM dose, with or without an antichlamydial agent based on chlamydia infection status. A test of cure should be obtained 7–14 days after retreatment using culture (preferably with simultaneous NAAT) and susceptibility testing if N. gonorrhoeae is isolated, and clinicians should ensure that sex partners from the preceding 60 days are evaluated promptly with culture and presumptively treated by using the same regimen used for the patients.

Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) follow-up—Men should be provided their testing results, and those with a specific diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be offered partner services and instructed to return 3 months after treatment for repeat testing. If symptoms persist or recur after therapy completion, men should be instructed to return for reevaluation and should be tested for M. genitalium and T. vaginalis, and symptoms alone without objective signs are insufficient basis for retreatment. Providers should be alert to chronic prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men with pain or voiding symptoms lasting for >3 months, and men with persistent pain should be referred to a urologist with expertise in pelvic pain disorders.

ESBL-E pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI)—agents to avoid are specified as follows: Nitrofurantoin does not achieve adequate renal parenchymal levels and is not advised for pyelonephritis or cUTI, doxycycline is also not advised for ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTIs due to limited urinary excretion, and fosfomycin is not suggested for prostatitis caused by gram-negative organisms other than E. coli due to fosA-mediated inactivation. In an observational series of chronic bacterial prostatitis, fosfomycin was associated with clinical cure in 36 (82%) of 44 males.

Gonorrhea—alternatives and agents not recommended include that IM gentamicin 240 mg plus oral azithromycin 2 g cured 100% of cases (lower one-sided 95% CI bound: 98.5%) and “can be considered an alternative to ceftriaxone for persons with cephalosporin allergy,” though gastrointestinal adverse events, primarily vomiting <1 hour after dosing, occurred among 3%–4%. A trial of gemifloxacin 240 mg plus azithromycin 1 g achieved 90% (95% CI: 72%–88%) cure of pharyngeal and 90% (95% CI: 84%–95%) of rectal infections but “is no longer recommended as an alternative regimen because of limited availability, cost, and antimicrobial stewardship concerns.” An 800-mg oral dose of cefixime “should be considered only as an alternative cephalosporin regimen,” with limited efficacy for treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhea (92.3% cure; 95% CI: 74.9%–99.1%); older clinical studies reported cefixime cured 97.5% of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal infections (95% CI: 95.4%–99.8%). Other oral cephalosporins “are not recommended,” and although azithromycin 2 g monotherapy was 99.2% effective (95% CI: 97.3%–99.9%), monotherapy “is not recommended.” Strains circulating in the United States are not adequately susceptible to penicillin, tetracycline, and older macrolides, so “use of these antimicrobials cannot be recommended.” Spectinomycin is effective (98.2%) for urogenital and anorectal infection but has poor pharyngeal efficacy; it is unavailable in the United States, and the gentamicin alternative regimen has replaced its need if a cephalosporin allergy exists.

Guidelines for the treatment of patients with sexually transmitted infection are developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after consultation with a group of professionals knowledgeable in the field. This article briefly introduces various infections, reviews new diagnostic information, and presents the latest guidelines for therapy. All recommended and alternative regimens are drawn from the most recent treatment guidelines. Although this article focuses primarily on therapy, it also emphasizes the importance of counseling and prevention. Clinicians have the opportunity and obligation to provide education and counseling to patients. Prevention messages should be tailored to the individual patient with consideration given to her specific risk behaviors.
