## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the length of the diagonal BD of a square ABCD with side length 1, given that points E and F lie on BC and DC respectively, with angle EAF equal to 30 degrees and CE equal to CF. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometry of the square and the diagonal. Then, I should verify whether the conditions about E and F actually constrain BD or are extraneous. Next, I will calculate BD using the Pythagorean theorem. Finally, I will double-check that none of the angle or segment conditions alter the diagonal's length before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the basic setup: ABCD is a square with side length 1, so AB = BC = CD = DA = 1, and the diagonals AC and BD are equal in length and bisect each other at 90 degrees. I need to ensure I'm not overlooking any hidden constraints that would change BD, but at first glance BD should be fixed by the square's geometry alone.

> Wait, let me verify the relevance of the conditions about E and F. The problem states E is on BC, F is on DC, angle EAF is 30 degrees, and CE = CF. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these conditions define where E and F can sit on the sides, but they do not change the square's side length or the diagonal length, which is determined solely by the square's geometry. So BD should be independent of the exact positions of E and F satisfying those constraints.

> I will now examine the diagonal calculation. In a square, the diagonal forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs equal to the side length, so by the Pythagorean theorem, BD² = AB² + AD² = 1² + 1² = 2, which implies BD = √2. Let me double-check that this is consistent with standard square properties — yes, the diagonal of a unit square is √2.

> But wait, what if the angle condition somehow imposes a scaling or rotation that affects BD? Hmm, wait a minute, I should confirm that angle EAF and the equality CE = CF only constrain the locations of E and F on the perimeter and do not alter the intrinsic dimensions of the square. Since the square's side length is given as 1 and no transformation is described, BD remains √2 regardless of where E and F are placed on BC and DC satisfying the stated angle and segment conditions.

> Final answer: The length of BD is √2. I should emphasize that the conditions about E and F are red herrings for finding BD; they would matter if we were solving for the positions of E and F, but not for the diagonal of the square itself.

The length of diagonal (BD) in a square of side length 1 is √2. The conditions about points (E) and (F) are irrelevant to the length of (BD), as the diagonal of a square depends only on the side length.

## Geometric properties of a square

A square has four equal sides and four right angles. The diagonals of a square are equal in length, bisect each other at right angles, and bisect the angles of the square. For a square with side length (s), the diagonal (d) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:

d = √(s² + s²) = √(2s²) = s√2

---

## Calculation of the diagonal (BD)

Given that the side length of square (ABCD) is 1, the length of diagonal (BD) is:

BD = 1 × √2 = √2

---

## Relevance of points (E) and (F)

The problem mentions points (E) and (F) on sides (BC) and (DC), respectively, with ∠EAF = 30° and (CE = CF). These conditions define specific positions for (E) and (F) but do not affect the length of the diagonal (BD), which is determined solely by the side length of the square.

---

## Conclusion

The length of diagonal (BD) in square (ABCD) with side length 1 is √2. The conditions regarding points (E) and (F) are extraneous to the calculation of (BD).

### Glass-cutting medical images via a mechanical image segmentation method based on crack propagation [^115WZwEP]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Initial crack

In each partial model, we set an initial crack. The initial crack will grow along grooves under external load until reaching object boundaries. For the first local model, the initial crack needs to be specified. After completing crack propagation in the current region, the next local model can be determined according to the position and the orientation of the crack. The new area will partially overlap the old one so that it can contain the end portion of the crack in the previous area as the initial crack.

The initial crack in the first local model can be provided either manually or automatically (Fig. 10b). In the manual method (top half of Fig. 10b), one needs only to choose a short line a few pixels in length along the target boundary as the position of the initial crack in the mechanical model. This selection is simple and accurate because the target boundary is generally very clear in such a location and there is an obvious groove corresponding to the target boundary in the mechanical model. For the automatic method (bottom half of Fig. 10b), the initial crack can be generated by the following procedure: define the side length of square ABCD representing the local image to be 2 L. The target boundary intersects with the two parallel edges AD and BC. Draw a straight line starting from P M1, the midpoint of the side AB, and passing through P M2, the midpoint of the side DC, ending at the point O. The distance from P M1 to O is N times the length of AB (N > 1). Therefore, a triangle AOB is formed with angle at point O equal to φ = 2 arctan(1/(2 N)). Dividing φ by an integer m defines the angle increment, Δ φ = 2 arctan(1/(2 N))/ m. Starting at line OA, and sweeping toward line OB by incrementing the angle by Δ φ each iteration, the ray with angle φ i = i Δ φ (i = 0, 1, 2,…) will intersect the target boundary at the point P i in this local image area. Because the grayscale value of the pixels at the target boundary changes significantly, an edge-detection operator, such as the Canny edge detector, can easily identify the coordinates of the points P i. After detecting several boundary points, the initial crack of the first local model can be automatically formed by connecting these points to form a small line segment.

### Quantification of surgical route parameters for exposure of the jugular foramen via a trans-mastoidal approach exposing jugular foramen in three-dimensional visualization model [^114FfjR6]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Surgical operation within the region of the jugular foramen presents a great challenge. The authors characterized the quantitative impact of surgical window parameters on the exposure of the jugular foramen via a trans-mastoidal approach.

Methods

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging data were used to establish a 3-dimensional model of the jugular foramen region. The mastoidale, posterior edge of the mastoid, and the superior edge of the bony external acoustic meatus were selected as points a, b, and c. The anterior edge of the tuberculum jugulare was selected as point d. The midpoints of line segments ab, ac, and bc were selected as points e, f, and g. Triangle abc was divided into triangles aef, beg, cfg, and efg. Surgical corridors of the triangular pyramid were outlined by connecting the above triangles to point d. Anatomic exposure was evaluated by measuring the area and volume of various structures within each route. Statistical comparisons were performed via analysis of variance.

Results

The model allowed for adequate visualization of all structures. The areas of triangles beg and efg were greater than those of triangles aef and cfg (P < 0.05). The volumes of triangular pyramids d-beg and d-cfg were greater than those of triangular pyramids d-aef and d-efg (P = 0.000). Statistically significant differences were also observed for volumes of osseous, venous, and cranial nerve structures in all divided routes (P = 0.000).

Conclusion

Our results indicate that 3-dimensional modeling may aid in the quantification of surgical exposure and that division of the craniotomy window may allow for more precise operation.

### Polygonal non-wetting droplets on microtextured surfaces [^116bsmvy]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Design of silicon micropillar arrays and operations

A schematic representation of the experimental setup is given in Fig. 1a. It consisted of a z -axis translation stage on the bottom and a superhydrophobic glass plate (treated with a commercial coating agent, Glaco Mirror Coat "Zero", Soft 99, Co.), on the top (Supplementary Method 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). As shown in the first row of each panel (Fig. 1b–d), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) illustrated well-defined shapes of silicon micropillar arrays fabricated by standard contact photolithography and deep-reactive ion etching. These microtextured surfaces can be categorized into three groups. First, cross-sectional areas of the pillars based on triangular, circular, and square were arranged in square arrays, respectively (Fig. 1b). Second, the triangular cross-sections of the pillars were arranged in triangular arrays (Fig. 1c). Third, cross-sections of the pillars based on triangular, square, hexagonal, and circular were arranged in hexagonal arrays, respectively (Fig. 1d). Note that a refers to the typical length scale of the cross-sectional area of a pillar, i.e. the side length of the triangular and square pillars, the diameter of the cylindrical pillars, and the diagonal length of the hexagonal pillars (Supplementary Fig. 2). Also, the side length of the triangular and square pillars was set to a = 20 μm, side length of the hexagonal pillars was a = 10 μm, and diameter of the cylindrical pillars was a = 20 μm. The minimum spacing of the pillars was denoted as b = 10 μm and the pillar height was h = 90 μm (Supplementary Method 2, Supplementary Table 1). All samples were first coated by a silane film CF 3 (CF 2) 9 CH 2 CH 2 SiCl 3 (FDDTS) deposited by RPX-540 of Integrated Surface Technologies, Inc. Afterward, the surface of each pillar became hydrophobic with the Young contact angle θ 0 = 110 ± 5°. Each sample was cleaned before the experiments. By placing water (Fig. 1b–d) and liquid metal (Galinstan, Fig. 1e) droplets in a confinement consisting of a microtextured surface on the bottom and a superhydrophobic glass surface on the top, polygonal-shaped droplets were formed by narrowing the separation of the two surfaces. The top-view visualization of the droplet by a CCD camera (Canon 550D, Hi-Scope advanced KH3000) and separation H of the two surfaces by length sensor (Heidenhain-Metro 2581) were recorded simultaneously. The details of the microfabrication, silanization, sample-cleaning procedure, contact angle measurements, and experimental process are all provided in the Methods section.

### Spatial distribution of B cells and lymphocyte clusters as a predictor of triple-negative breast cancer outcome [^11558rxd]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Spatial distribution analysis of TILs

Using the data spreadsheets with every cell phenotyped and given a set of Cartesian coordinates, we tiled each image with a grid of identical squares. We omitted squares that had no cells, since they lay outside the tissue. However, we included squares that were within the tissue but contained no cells of interest. The length L of one side of a square varies from 10 to 600 μm. A square was assigned 1 or 0 according to the answer to a binary question. For comparison we calculated the occupancy FD of a uniform random (Poisson) distribution of points. We processed the data using in-house custom-developed software (RStudio) and the R packages "spatstat" for point patterns, "dbscan" for cluster analysis, and "EBImage" for raster images.

Statistical methods

Occupancy,

An image is overlaid with a grid of squares (Fig. 2a); each square has an area of L 2. A '0' or '1' is assigned to each square according to the answer to a binary (yes-no) question, e.g. "Is there at least one B cell in the square?" (Fig. 2a inset). The occupancy is the fraction of squares with 1's, i.e. it is an estimate of the probability that a square will have a 1. To characterize the spatial distribution at different length scales, the size of the squares in the grid is varied to produce the occupancy as a function of L, the length of one side of a square. The occupancy depends to some extent on the average cell density for binary questions such as "Is there at least one CD20 + B cell in the square?" because a higher average cell density corresponds to a higher probability that a square is assigned a '1'.

### Carbon fractions in the world's dead wood [^11771fPP]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Each dead wood CF observation was then categorized according to three primary factors associated with wood decomposition and the related chemical change: (A) DC, (B) position, and (C) size (diameter and length). For the majority of data points (958 of 973), dead wood DC was reported along a conventional 1–5 scale, and was therefore included in our database as published while noting the DC scale employed. For nine data points where DC was reported as a two-category range (e.g. DC 1–2), the higher DC was used for analysis. In four data points, a multicategory DC was presented (e.g. DC 1–5); therefore, the middle DC estimate was used. In one paper, DC was reported along a 0–5 point scale (where DC 0 is clearly defined in the publication as dead and not live wood); here two data points where dead wood C was reported with a DC of 0 were classified as DC 1. Last, in a subset of papers the number of years since tree death (instead of DC) was reported. In these cases, years since death were converted to DC based on published decay-class transition matrices, for example, ref.

### Clarifications to the VSP 2011 operations manual. December 2013 revision [^115KFKQF]. CDC (2013). Medium credibility.

Clarification of hook length measurement — The rescue or shepherd's hook must be long enough to touch the bottom center of the deepest portion of the RWF plus 2 feet (0.6 meters) as measured from the closest edge without an obstruction, and this edge can only be used for measurement if someone could freely walk down both sides without an obstruction such as a waterfall, fountain, statue, etc. For a rectangular pool, the shorter distance would be from the long side of the rectangle as long as there are no obstructions, and the 2 feet (0.6 meters) is measured from where the shepherd's hook crosses the fill line of the RWF.

### Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures [^1115ZNSY]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

### Starting geometry creation and design method for freeform optics [^117QKnfy]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

For each potential geometry, the first step is to create a first-order unobscured layout (using only spherical surfaces) in a volume near what is desirable for the end result while minimizing the mirror tilts to the extent possible, as described earlier in this section. Then, the aberration FFDs for each potential unobscured geometry are evaluated. With spherical surfaces, the tilt-induced rotationally variant aberrations can be orders of magnitude greater than the rotationally invariant aberrations. The focus is placed on the potential for the rotationally variant aberrations to be corrected, because if they cannot be mitigated, the correction state of the rotationally invariant aberrations is inconsequential. Furthermore, at the appropriate time during optimization, the third-order rotationally invariant aberrations can be removed using a conic on each mirror.

### Symmetry breaking in optimal transport networks [^117Er866]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The main problem in network design is fundamentally different. We are given the density of population and we are looking for the network that minimizes some objective function involving some average time, in general (although other choices are possible, see for example). In this setting, there are usually two different transport modes, a slow one representing for example cars on the road network, and a fast one representing the subway or some rapid transit network. The natural framework here is then the one of multiplex networks comprising two different transportation networks, one known while the structure of the second one is to be determined (for multiplexes in the context of optimization see for example). A practical realization of this problem concerns the specific case of subways (for a network analysis of subways, see for example,–). In most large cities, a subway system has been built and later enlarged, with current total lengths varying from a few kilometers to a few hundred kilometers. The geometry of these networks, as its total length increases, varies from simple lines to more complex shapes with loops for larger networks. In particular, for the largest networks, convergence to a structure with a well-connected central core and branches reaching out to suburbs has been observed.

Algorithmic aspects of network design have been studied within computational geometry (e.g.chapter 9) and location science (e.g.and references therein), and some simpler problems of this type have been addressed previously. For instance, the problem of the quickest access between an area and a given point was discussed in. In network science, the optimization problem is traditionally recast as a navigation problem in lattices with long-range connections. However, our specific question – optimal network topologies as a function of population distribution and network length – is largely an open problem. In, some results were obtained in two-dimensional systems by comparing a priori defined optimal network configurations. First, it was shown that, if the goal is reaching a single point in the plane, then the optimal network is necessarily a tree. Second, the paper hinted at the possibility of the existence of transitions between optimal configurations when the length of the network changes. More precisely, it has been shown that as the length of the network increases resources go preferentially to radial branches and that there is a sharp transition at a critical value of the length where a loop appears.

### Minimum electric-field gradient coil design: theoretical limits and practical guidelines [^111BqnwA]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Regions A and B are geometrically symmetric about the z = 0 plane, with minimum energy solutions (assuming no E‐field constraint) yielding z‐symmetric field solutions and zero B 0 concomitant fields. Hence, the open diamond starting point (representing the minimum energy solution with no E‐field constraints) for the solid and dashed curves (in both black and green cases) coincide. The symmetry is broken by the addition of a patient model with an E‐field constraint.

The knee in the curves marks the point where magnetic energy, current density, and winding complexity increase rapidly as E max is driven to lower values. These complexities render unrealizable or impractical any gradient designs on the vertical portions of the curves to the left of the knee. Examination of winding patterns indicates that solutions that exhibit energy increases > 25% (or even less depending on coil type) above the global minimum energy become unrealizable (eg, demonstrating two or more "eyes" per half coil [four or more total eyes for an x or y coil] in the fingerprint wire patterns).

The red and purple dotted curves in Figure 2 represent two practical cases in which the primary coil currents are restricted to a single inner surface near the patient and the shield coil currents to an outer cylinder, while at the same time adding torque and eddy current constraints. Line segments acd of Figure 1 represent a primary winding surface consisting of a cone and a cylinder, whereas line segment ab represents its cylindrical shield winding; this yields designs similar to those proposed by previous literature 8, 22 and results in the red dotted curves in Figure 2. A second case is defined by restricting primary currents to the cylinder represented by line segment cd and shield currents to the cylinder ab; this yields designs similar to those proposed by previous literature 28 and produces the purple dotted curves in Figure 2. For both configurations, the eddy current surface is a 1‐m‐long, 620‐mm‐diameter cylinder, centered about the gradient isocenter and placed outside the shield winding of the gradient coil. The time = 0 eddy current error is constrained to a peak deviation less than 0.1% of the ideal gradient field on the surface of a 20‐cm‐diameter volume, corresponding to 100 µT for a 1 T/m step change in gradient strength. The torque constraint is set to zero for a uniform z‐directed B 0 main magnetic field. There is no net force for a perfectly uniform main B 0 field in all calculations.

### Arrays of individually controlled ions suitable for two-dimensional quantum simulations [^111brWzC]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

A precisely controlled quantum system may reveal a fundamental understanding of another, less accessible system of interest. A universal quantum computer is currently out of reach, but an analogue quantum simulator that makes relevant observables, interactions and states of a quantum model accessible could permit insight into complex dynamics. Several platforms have been suggested and proof-of-principle experiments have been conducted. Here, we operate two-dimensional arrays of three trapped ions in individually controlled harmonic wells forming equilateral triangles with side lengths 40 and 80μm. In our approach, which is scalable to arbitrary two-dimensional lattices, we demonstrate individual control of the electronic and motional degrees of freedom, preparation of a fiducial initial state with ion motion close to the ground state, as well as a tuning of couplings between ions within experimental sequences. Our work paves the way towards a quantum simulator of two-dimensional systems designed at will.

### Theory of branching morphogenesis by local interactions and global guidance [^112Ly9uw]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Comparison between analytical model and simulations

Importantly, Eq. (1) describing the probability of branch orientation attains a steady-state solution (∂ t P st (ψ, t) = 0) that is largely independent of the form of the external field, i.e. it applies generically to different geometries after defining the relative branch alignment with respect to the external field. This solution predicts that the alignment of angles with respect to the polarity of the external field will be determined by the von Mises distribution (circular normal distribution):with a concentration parameter given by ν ≡ μ f c / D, and I 0 (ν) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero. The fluctuations in the angular alignment as determined by the variance will thus follow a universal scaling approximately given by σ 2 ∝ D / μ f c that underlines the relative contribution of the local noise to the external guidance. For an axial (linear) field parallel to the horizontal axis, for instance, the above solution applies to the distribution of the local angles φ of the branch segments (Fig. 1 d). In a radial external field emerging from a central point of origin, however, the alignment of a branch is determined by the angle difference ψ ≡ φ − θ between its local angle φ and its angle θ with respect to the origin of the external field, and thus ψ, rather than φ, is predicted to follow the von Mises distribution (see Supplementary Figs. 4–9 for the alignment angles for different model assumptions). Comparing these analytical criteria with the numerical simulations led to excellent agreement without using any fit parameter (Fig. 1 d–f).

To summarize, the combination of analytical modelling and numerical simulations allows us to make a number of predictions for different topological and geometrical properties of branched structures: A key signature of external guidance is that branching angles should conform to a von Mises distribution while the overall branching structure in an axial field can adopt a well-defined conical domain in the absence of defined boundaries. Furthermore, a signature of the stochastic nature of branching and annihilating random walks is that even with external guidance, the local branch length or overall network size and shape should be highly variable to random branching events and local density-driven termination of tip growth.

The high values of Wo 2 = 50 to 500 explored here suggest plug-like flow profiles in the AC sections.

Significant pumping of E > 0.1 occurs forin the hundreds, when diodicity is observed to turn on for steady flow (Fig. 2 e).

### Stretchable glove for accurate and robust hand pose reconstruction based on comprehensive motion data [^113Qsa8M]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Implementation of the linear system model in joint angle estimation

The linear system model in Eq. 1 was based on two conditions. First, bias terms of the joint angles and the sensor signals were removed from the state and the observation. The joint angle bias refers to the non-zero thumb CMC abduction at the zero pose, and the sensor bias is the initial sensor signal that was used to estimate the bone lengths. By removing the initial sensor signal, the joint angle estimation was separated from the bone length estimation. Second, we assumed a linear sensor model. This assumption is grounded on the observation that the relationships between the sensor signals and their corresponding joint angles are approximately linear within the range of motion of the joint (Supplementary Fig. 4). However, since liquid-metal strain sensors display a hyperlinear behavior in large deformations, the gradient of the linear relationship must be modified to compensate the different levels of pre-stretching by different wearers. In this study, we categorized the subjects into small and large hands, and the system matrices (, Q, H, R) of each group were calibrated by fitting the sensor data and the ground-truth calibration dataset to Eq. 1 by the least-square method.

The sensor signals were processed and the joint angles were estimated using a Kalman filter. We evaluated the estimations using the test data (~65 s, Fig. 4b). Two subjects were tested in the self-calibration group (one male, one female, 26–27, with informed consent), and two subjects were tested in the non-calibration group (one male, one female, ages 25–29, with informed consent).

Test setup and procedures for prediction of fingertip position

The tests were conducted for two subjects (one male, one female, 26–27, with informed consent) with different hand sizes. Each subject was provided trajectories of a square with side lengths of 25 mm and 20 mm and instructed to follow the traces with their index finger and thumb, as shown in Fig. 5a. The sizes of the trajectories were selected based on the workspace of each subject's fingers. In addition, for uniform sampling of the test data for unbiased evaluation, the subjects were guided by periodic buzzer sound (every three seconds) between each stroke.

Subgroup analysis

In post hoc tests, Eg and Lp were significantly different between RP-R and HC (both p = 0.01; Supplementary Fig. S3). Regarding local measures, only Bc of the left precuneus was significantly higher in RP-R than in HC at the false discovery rate-adjusted p -value (Supplementary Tables S6 – S8; Supplementary Figs. S5 – S7). The total numbers of hubs were 27, 26, and 23 in RP-M, RP-R, and HC, respectively (Fig. 1B, E, F Supplementary Tables S10 – S12). In RP-M and RP-R, there were more hubs in DMN and CON, compared with HC (Fig. 1G). The mean Dc values of the hubs were significantly higher in RP-M and RP-R than in HC (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively; Fig. 1H). The minimum threshold for the three groups was similar to the threshold in the main analysis (i.e. 0.06; Fig. 2B, E, F). The AUC for network robustness to a targeted attack was significantly lower in RP-R than in HC (p = 0.011; Fig. 2G). The GCC began to exhibit instability when ~20%, ~35%, and ~40% of nodes were removed in RP-R, RP-M, and HC, respectively. With the removal of one node, the mean change in GCC was approximately −1, but this change increased to −1.7, −2.2, and −1.6 for RP-R, RP-M and HC, respectively, at the network disintegration point (Fig. 2H). We did not observe a significant difference in random failure among RP-M, RP-R, and HC (Fig. S8).

### A computerized red glass test for quantifying diplopia [^113z84e5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

The Hess test

A skilled technician carried out the Hess test. Briefly, the Hess test was performed on a 120 × 120 cm 2 screen, which was 1 m from the subject. The subject sat down in front of the Hess screen and wore red-green goggles. The red lens on the right eye was the fixating eye. Because of the red-green goggles, the subjects could see only red makers on the screen with the right eye, whereas they could see only green makers through the left eye with the green lens. While wearing the goggles, the subject used a laser pointer to indicate where a green line appears on the center of the red marker. The technician recorded and outlined those points. The patient repeated the exam with the green glass before the right eye and conducted the same process. Thus, the test evaluated the movement of each eye by dissociating binocular vision using red and green filters.

The degree of diplopia in the Hess test was quantified using the Hess score and the Hess area ratio (HAR). The Hess score provides both horizontal and vertical deviations and is calculated using the displacement of individual points from the center, inner, and outer zones. The deviations of 16 outer points (S o), inner points (S i), and the center point (S c) are summed, and each point is weighted with individual factors (F o, F i, and F c were 1, 4 and 8, respectively). The Hess score is calculated according to the following formula: Hess Score = F o S o + F i S i + F c S c. The HAR is the percentage of square area on the affected side compared to the healthy side. The HAR represents how the diplopic area is contracted and is calculated by measuring the length of the inter-horizontal plot and the inter-vertical plot on the 30-degree line of the Hess chart using the following equation: 100 × (A × B)/(A 1 × B 1) (%), where A is the affected side length between horizontal plots, B is the affected side length between vertical plots, A 1 is the healthy side length between horizontal plots, and B 1 is the healthy side length between vertical plots. Thus, high Hess score or low HAR indicate severe diplopia.

### Symmetry breaking in optimal transport networks [^114BD1Dv]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Real-world cities

In this section, we study the properties of the subway systems in Atlanta, Boston, and Toronto under the lens of our framework. We choose monocentric cities, fairly isolated from other major urban centers, with a tree-like subway structure. We identify the intersection point of the real subway lines in all three cases as the city center. We see that this point corresponds to the downtown area in the three cities.

First, we incorporate real population data in our model. We rely on a two-dimensional triangular lattice multiplex model; we use the population data and the appropriate coordinates reference systems to impose the triangular lattice structure onto the city landscape. Details on the data and modeling of the city population distribution can be found in the Methods section. We denote all quantities relative to the real physical system using the same notation as for the multiplex model, but we add a tilde on top of the corresponding symbol. For example, R indicates the radius of the lattice model, anddenotes the radius of the city. Overlaying a city on top of the triangular lattice allows us to associate a weightto each node n in the slow layer that reflects the real population density within the city. We use those weights in the objective function of Eq. (6), and then take advantage of the greedy algorithm to obtain approximate solutions to the optimization problem of Eq. (4). Similar to the previous sections, we obtain two classes of optimal fast-layer configurations for all the considered parameters. Results for the city of Toronto are displayed in Fig. 4, where we see that optimal configurations comprise k ✱ = 1 (Fig. 4 a) or k ✱ = 2 (Fig. 4 b) branches. Similar results are valid for Atlanta and Boston, where we observe optimal configurations with k * ≤ 3 branches (see Supplementary Information Figure 11). For k * > 1, we note that the branches have no identical length; this is caused by the fact that the weight associated with the various nodes of the system is not constant. A typical phase diagram for Toronto is displayed in Fig. 4 c, where we fix η = 0.5, but vary L and c. The diagram is qualitatively similar to the one of Fig. 3 e. For fixed c, k * increases as L grows; however, for fixed L, k * decreases as c grows. The values of the parameters where the transitions between the various phases emerge differ from those of Fig. 3 e; this is due to the non-homogeneous density of the population used in the model of the city. Similar results for Atlanta and Boston can be found in the Supplementary Information Figure 11.

### Distributional dual-process model predicts strategic shifts in decision-making under uncertainty [^112LPbLf]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

To empirically test our model and explore these nuanced interactions, we presented participants with four options (A, B, C, D) across three randomly assigned levels of reward variance: low variance (LV), moderate variance (MV), and high variance (HV). Rewards for each option were randomly drawn from a normal distribution with constant mean values (A = 0.65, B = 0.35, C = 0.75, D = 0.25) and the assigned variance level. The task consisted of two phases. In the first phase, participants underwent 150 training trials with feedback, selecting from either AB or CD pairs. In each pair, one option (i.e. A and C) yielded significantly higher rewards than the other (i.e. B and D). However, AB pairs were presented twice as often as CD pairs (i.e. 100 AB trials versus 50 CD trials), resulting in A providing more frequent rewards than C, despite having a lower average reward value (A: 0.65, C: 0.75). After the training phase, participants proceeded to the transfer phase, where they selected from the remaining combinations (i.e. AD, BD, CA, CB) without feedback. We were particularly interested in examining selections from the new CA pair to gauge participants' subjective evaluation of C versus A, as this pair presents a scenario where the more frequently rewarded option (A) has a lower average payoff than the other option (C).

We hypothesized that (1) EV in multivariable scenarios is better represented as an entropy-weighted sum of estimations from parallel distributional evaluative systems than a singular value generated by a fixed learning rule; (2) in our task, people's preference for the more frequent but less rewarding option, A, would increase with higher reward variance due to increased entropy — or reduced confidence — in value-based processing and the need to explore alternative evaluation strategies; (3) this shift in preference would be correlated with increased model-inferred weights on frequency-based processing and a corresponding decreased reliance in value-based processing.

### Early turbulence and pulsatile flows enhance diodicity of tesla's macrofluidic valve [^112EskQ8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Representative data are shown in Fig. 5 c for one set of A and f. The upper panel presents the flow speed averaged across the cross-section in the AC branch, where the sinusoidal oscillationsconform to the piston motions. The lower panel represents the measured section-averaged flow speed in the DC branch, and the inset shows the flow velocity profile furnished by PIV at two points in the cycle. At each time t, the two halves of the profile (bisectioned by the tube's axis) are averaged and axisymmetry is assumed to arrive at the section-averaged speed. Strikingly, the flow has a dominant DC component U DC, and the flow profiles remain unidirectional throughout the oscillation cycle. Thus the circuit achieves the goal of AC-to-DC conversion or pumping. The output flow also shows a weak AC component of amplitude Δ U. These ripple oscillations occur at twice the driving frequency f, as both half-strokes of the AC input contribute to the DC output.

To assess the pumping performance of the circuit more generally, we systematically vary the AC input parameters A and f and measure the section-averaged DC flow speed U DC, which is equivalent to volumetric flux (volume per unit cross-sectional area and time). Figure 6 a shows how U DC varies with A and f. Across all driving conditions, U DC > 0 and the system achieves AC-to-DC conversion. As expected, the output U DC increases with the inputs A and f. Less apparent in Fig. 6 a is that the response is nonlinear. To clarify this, we define the effectiveness of the pump as E = U DC /4 A f. This normalization is chosen such that ideal or perfect diodes yield E = 1: A volume of fluid proportional to the piston displacement 2 A is injected into the DC branch in each stroke of duration 1/2 f, with the two strokes in each cycle contributing equally. In Fig. 6 b we plot effectiveness E versus frequency f and dimensionless amplitude A / D. The fact that E < 1 for all conditions reflects the non-ideal nature or 'leakiness' of the diode. Interestingly, it is seen that E itself increases with both A and f, quantifying the nonlinear response of U DC. That is, doubling either A or f leads to disproportionately higher U DC. For the conditions studied here, we achieve E ≈ 0.5, and the trends suggest yet higher efficacy would be attained for stronger driving.

### Spatial distribution of B cells and lymphocyte clusters as a predictor of triple-negative breast cancer outcome [^1156qCsr]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Occupancy, fractal dimensions, and FD differences indicate that stromal B cells are more spread out in good outcome.

a – c Occupancy: a Example image showing how occupancy is computed. A grid of squares placed over the image. (Inset) 1's (0's) correspond to yes (no) answers to a binary question asked of each square, e.g. "Is there at least one B cell in the square?" Occupancy is fraction of squares with 1's. b Plot of CD20 + B cell occupancy in stroma vs. square size for good clinical outcome (blue), poor clinical outcome (red), normal breast tissue (black) and points randomly distributed according to a uniform Poisson process with a density of 3 × 10 2 points/mm 2 (cyan). Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. Good (blue) outcome curve is consistently higher than poor (red) outcome curve. c Plots showing occupancy area under the curve (AUC) for CD20 + B cells in stroma is higher for good (n = 24) vs. poor (n = 12) outcome (p = 0.05). Center line represents the median, box limits represent the upper and lower quartiles, whiskers indicate maximum and minimum values within 1.5 interquartile ranges of the upper and lower quartiles; individual points are outliers. d Fractal dimension determined from slope of the log-log plot of the number of squares with at least one stromal CD20 + B cell vs. the inverse box size (Logarithms are base e). The fractal dimension is larger for good clinical outcome vs. poor outcome at large length scales, but this trend is reversed at small length scales. At long length scales (200–600 μm on the left side of the plot), mean fractal dimension s (slope) is 1.3 for good outcome (blue), 1.11 for poor outcome (red), 0.92 for normal tissue (gray), and 2.08 for Poisson (black). The p value for good vs. poor outcome is 0.08 at long length scales. At short length scales (10–40 μm on the right side of the plot), the mean fractal dimension is 0.58 for good outcome, 0.65 for poor outcome, 0.30 for normal tissue, and 0.15 for Poisson. The p value for good vs. poor outcome is 0.5 at short length scales. Black dashed lines show least-squares linear regression fit at long and short length scales. Because different images have different overall areas, fractal dimension is calculated by normalizing the number n(L) of boxes with 1's with the total number N(L) of boxes with cells. Thus the y-axis values are negative. The error bars correspond to 95% confidence intervals. e Example illustrating how FD difference indicates whether cells are spread out or clustered. The left image with four quadrants shows four blue points that are spatially spread out in the upper two quadrants while the right image with four quadrants shows four clustered red points in the upper two quadrants. At long length scales (big boxes in left 2 quadrants), the big squares in the lower left quadrant have more 1 s in the left image than in the lower left quadrant of the right image because the blue points in the upper left quadrant are more spread out compared to the red points in the upper left quadrant of the right image, so the fractal dimension is larger in the left half of left image than in the left half of the right image. At small length scales (small boxes in 2 right quadrants), the upper right quadrants of both images have the same number of points and occupy the same number of squares; hence, the blue and red points have the same fractal dimension at small length scales. So the difference in fractal dimension between large and small length scales will be larger for the spatially dispersed blue points than for the clustered red points. f Plot showing that the FD difference for stromal CD20 + B cells is significantly higher in good outcome (p = 3 × 10 −3, ROC AUC = 0.77), indicating that B cells are more spatially dispersed in the stroma in good outcome. Center line represents the median, box limits represent the upper and lower quartiles, whiskers indicate maximum and minimum values within 1.5 interquartile ranges of the upper and lower quartiles; individual points are outliers. g RFS plot showing the clinical significance of the FD difference for stromal CD20 + B cells with a threshold value = 0.564 (see "Methods"). For all FD differences calculated in this paper, the large length scale range is 200–600 μm and the small length scale range is 10–40 μm. Patient cohorts for all plots in this figure are n = 24 for good outcome (blue) and n = 12 for poor outcome (red). P -values in box plots are determined by unpaired, two-tailed Student t -tests. ns: not significant; ✱ p < 0.05; ✱✱ p < 0.01; ✱✱ p < 0.001; ✱✱ p < 1 × 10 −4.

Control Condition: Size

On each trial, two squares were presented. As with the objects, each square was positioned in one of two nonvisible frames separated by 8 pixels, and rotated by a random number between 15° and 165°. The size of each square was trial unique and subtended horizontal and vertical visual angles ranging from 1.45°–13.83°. The position of the squares in the frame was jittered slightly so that the edges of the squares did not line up across horizontal or vertical planes. For Difficult nonmatch trials, the length of each side of the square was randomly varied from 67 to 247 pixels. The difference between the lengths of the two squares varied between 9 and 15 pixels (similar to). By means of several pilot experiments, the difficulty of this condition was designed to closely match that of the High Ambiguity Object condition. For Easy nonmatch trials, the length of each side was randomly varied from 40 to 268 pixels, and the difference between the lengths of the two different sides varied between 16 and 40 pixels. Through several pilot experiments, the difficulty of this condition was designed to closely match that of the Low Ambiguity conditions of the Object stimuli. For match trials, the two rotated squares were identical in size.

Behavioral Procedure

After obtaining informed consent, each of the four conditions (High Ambiguity Objects, Low Ambiguity Objects, Difficult Size, Easy Size) was administered in a fully blocked design, with 72 consecutive trials per condition (36 match trials, 36 nonmatch trials). No feedback was given. Before each condition a short practice (with feedback) of 6 trial-unique stimuli (3 match, 3 nonmatch) was administered. The different conditions were presented in a pseudorandom order, with half the participants receiving the High Ambiguity Object condition prior to the Low Ambiguity Object condition and half the participants receiving the Difficult Size condition prior to the Easy Size condition. The experiment was self-paced, with a maximum of 15 s allowed for each trial. Eye movements were measured using a SR Research Ltd. Eyelink 1000 eye-tracking desktop monocular system and sampled at 1,000 Hz with a spatial resolution of approximately 0.01°.

### Time-dependent diffusion in undulating thin fibers: impact on axon diameter estimation [^115iVFYD]. NMR in Biomedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

2.2 Characterizing the diffusion spectrum

Our first aim was to predict features of the diffusion spectra from the parameters of the undulating thin fiber model. Corresponding features of the diffusion spectrum for a straight cylinder were used for reference. Four spectral features were considered: the spectral width, the spectral height (, the spectral shape, and the low‐frequency behavior in terms of the power law exponent (Figure 1 E). An additional feature was also considered: the diffusivity at zero frequency (infinite diffusion times). However, this was trivially zero because the maximal mean square displacement is bounded by the outermost positions of the fiber trajectories in our fiber model.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

The current antibiotic resistance crisis has led to increased pressure to prioritize strategies to tackle the issue, with a strong focus being placed on the development of novel antimicrobials. However, one major obstacle that is often overlooked is persister cells, which are refractory to antibiotic treatment.

5.7 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3)]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.

Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].

5.8 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients

The use of OXAYDO in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.

Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: OXAYDO-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of OXAYDO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating OXAYDO and when OXAYDO is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].

Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.

### Microwave photons emitted by fractionally charged quasiparticles [^111NYpQF]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The fits (dashed lines on Fig. 3) agree very well with the data, surprisingly even in the fractional case although Eq. (2) has a priori no reason to be valid in this situation. We find V 0 = 35 ± 1.6 μV at ν = 3, V 0 = 80 ± 11 μV at ν = 4/3 and V 0 = 80 ± 17 μV at ν = 2/3. This difference is related to the difference in the quasiparticle charge q. The dynamics of quasiparticle transfer are governed by the frequency scale f J = qV dc / h, and photon emission at frequency f only occurs for f J ≥ f. From our determination of V 0, we obtain q = 0.89 ± 0.04 e at ν = 3, q = 0.34 ± 0.05 e at ν = 4/3 and q = 0.38 ± 0.08 e at ν = 2/3 in reasonable accordance with the low-frequency determination of q. The characteristic frequency scale f J = qV dc / h can be highlighted by rescaling the data by the factor q /(hf) on the vertical and horizontal axes, taking q = e for ν = 3 and q = e /3 for ν = 4/3 and ν = 2/3. As can be seen from Fig. 4a, all data collapse, within experimental error bars, on the same trace (black dashed line) given by Eq. (2) with a threshold f J / f = 1. In order to check the consistency of our results for various measurement frequencies f, we plot in Fig. 4b the emission thresholds extracted from all our data points as a function of f (see Supplementary Note 3 for additional measurements). In the integer case, the measured thresholds V 0 fall on the red dashed line representing electron transfer: V 0 = hf / e. In contrast, the thresholds measured in the fractional case fall on the blue dashed line V 0 = 3 hf / e corresponding to quasiparticle transfer with charge q = e /3.

### Skyrmion pinning energetics in thin film systems [^112a78Ut]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Micromagnetic simulation setup

To understand and support the experimental findings, nano-scale micromagnetic simulations are performed using the mumax3 simulation package. Similar to the experimental study of the skyrmion inside a small confinement, a single skyrmion is simulated inside a square box with open boundary conditions. The side length is chosen to be about four times the size of the largest simulated skyrmion such that effects of the sample edge are negligible in the central region of the sample. There, different domain wall pinning regions are exemplarily created by locally lowering the effective PMA strength K eff to 20%. The skyrmion size is tuned via an external OOP magnetic field. The system evolves under the finite temperature Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equation for 60 µs and is sampled every 1 ns. As in the experimental setup, the trackpy package is used for skyrmion detection based on greyscale images of the OOP magnetization.

Typical nano-scale sample parameters were employed for a 128 × 128 × 1 nm 3 sample –. A cell size of 1 × 1 × 1 nm 3 is used and the sample has a saturation magnetization of, exchange stiffness ofand Gilbert damping of α = 0.01. The demagnetization energy is accounted for by employing an effective PMA strength ofwith, which is equivalent to considering an infinite thin film and explicitly calculating the demagnetization field in the case of a homogeneous magnetization. In the presence of skyrmion-type magnetic spin structures, this formalism is however a well-established approximation for performance reasons, while furthermore not leading to boundary effects due to stray fields. The interfacial DMI strength is chosen towithand skyrmions are stabilized by applying external OOP magnetic fields of 0.05 T and 0.15 T for large and small skyrmions, respectively. The pinning areas have a size of 4 × 10 nm 2 and the temperature is set to 100 K.

### Resolution limit of cylinder diameter estimation by diffusion MRI: the impact of gradient waveform and orientation dispersion [^113h2Mkx]. NMR in Biomedicine (2017). Low credibility.

In this work, we introduce an analytical framework to predict the resolution limit for any gradient waveform. Prior approaches in this direction were fully numerical, and confined to the SDE and ODE sequences. 24 We analyse three cases: the first where axons are parallel, the second where there is full axonal orientation dispersion, and the third where there is partial alignment. We limit our investigation to estimation of the diameter from intra‐axonal water diffusion, assuming axons can be modelled by impermeable and straight cylinders. Provided this assumption holds, which can be debated, 27 our results can be used directly in the analysis of measurements on intra‐axonal metabolites. 44 For water measurements, contributions from extra‐axonal components must be incorporated in the analysis. Such components are often assumed to exhibit Gaussian diffusion, 20, 21 which may not be congruent with the physics of extracellular diffusion. 45 Accounting for time‐dependent diffusion outside axons is likely needed for accurate mapping of axonal characteristics, 46, 47 but investigating its impact on the resolution limit was beyond the scope of the present study. Our analysis nevertheless contributes with a lower bound on the resolution limit of the intra‐axonal component.

Non–gastric bypass surgically altered anatomy with biliary obstruction — initial approach and comparative outcomes: The ASGE suggests E-ERCP as the initial approach; if unsuccessful, the ASGE suggests EUS-BD or percutaneous biliary drainage (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence), and the panel voted that E-ERCP should be the preferred initial approach with subsequent consideration of EUS-BD or PTBD if E-ERCP failed. Our review identified 15 observational studies with three direct-comparison studies and twelve indirect, involving two hundred ninety-nine patients who underwent EUS-BD, ninety-two who underwent E-ERCP, and eighty-nine who underwent PTBD. Compared with E-ERCP, EUS-BD had better technical success (OR, 5.56; 95% CI, 1.04–9.16) and clinical success (OR, 4.08; 95% CI, 1.82–9.16) but higher AEs (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.33–7.90). When comparing EUS-BD and PTBD, pooled rates were similar for technical success (92.9% vs 87.6%, P = 0.26), clinical success (87.6% vs 80.8%, P = 0.44), need for reintervention (18.8% vs 29%, P = 0.63), and AEs (18.8% vs 29%, P = 0.11). Data on cost, cost-effectiveness, or patient values were not available; the panel recognized the importance of reviewing imaging to assess for dilated left hepatic ducts, verifying limb lengths using operative reports when feasible, and noted that these procedures are technically complex and may be best managed at tertiary referral centers. General concept: Review the operative report to identify the length of the Roux limb (if feasible).

### A British Society for Haematology guideline: diagnosis and management of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic microangiopathies [^113CdGt4]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, more specifically with respect to plasma exchange, BSH 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate plasma exchange with solvent/detergent-treated plasma with 1.5 plasma volume exchanges and reassess daily, reducing to 1.0 volume when the clinical picture and laboratory tests are stabilizing.

### Quantification of the shape of fiber tracts [^116DKMSS]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The fiber tracts generated using diffusion MRI are usually simply displayed and assessed visually for a specific clinical or medical research purpose. This paper proposes computational techniques that can be used to study the shape of the tracts and make interindividual comparisons. These methods make use of fundamental geometric invariants, such as curvatures and torsions, or Fourier descriptors, together with the link of a pair of curves. Intersubject comparisons only require that the starting and ending points of the tracts can be defined and do not require point-by-point correspondences such as obtained using image registration. Principal component analysis-based shape analysis is also investigated. The invariants are tested on simulations and in vivo datasets, and the scale dependence and noise sensitivity of the measures are assessed. The potential for these techniques to be used in neuroscience research and clinical applications is demonstrated.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113DKC3A]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes natural history and progression risk indicate that stage 1, defined by the presence of two or more autoantibodies and normoglycemia, carries a 5-year risk of developing symptomatic type 1 diabetes of ~44%. In stage 2, risk is ~60% by 2 years and ~75% within 5 years of developing a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. A consensus group provides expert recommendations on what should be monitored and how often these factors should be monitored in individuals with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116aFjD9]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbation follow-up and referral — after an exacerbation, the written asthma action plan should be reviewed, and maintenance asthma treatment can generally be reduced to previous levels 2–4 weeks after the exacerbation unless the history suggests long-term poorly controlled asthma, in which case a step up in treatment may be indicated. Patients with more than 1–2 exacerbations per year despite Step 4–5 therapy (or Step 4 therapy in children 6–11 years), or with several emergency department visits, should be referred to a specialist center, if available, for assessment and strategies to reduce their risk of future exacerbations and their risk of exposure to OCS.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111mhGyA]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to physical activity, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to advise most adult patients T1DM to engage in ≥ 150 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, spread over at least 3 days/week, with no more than 2 consecutive days without activity. Consider advising shorter durations (minimum 75 min/week) of vigorous-intensity or interval training for more physically fit patients.

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^116DeXeo]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for ventricular arrhythmias, more specifically with respect to patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (secondary prevention of SCD), ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to consider performing ICD placement or obtaining electrophysiologic testing for risk stratification for SCD in patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy who experienced syncope presumed to be due to VA and are not meeting indications for a primary prevention ICD, if the expected meaningful survival is > 1 year.
