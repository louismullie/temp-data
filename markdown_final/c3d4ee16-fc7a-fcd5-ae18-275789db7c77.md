## Question

Lifestyle modifications for fatty liver

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about lifestyle modifications for fatty liver disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease construct and why lifestyle is foundational. Then, I should verify weight-loss thresholds and their histologic correlates. Next, I will examine dietary specifics, including caloric targets and pattern preferences. After that, I need to check exercise prescriptions and whether benefits occur independent of weight loss. I will then consider special populations, including lean patients, those with advanced fibrosis, and children. Finally, I should review implementation barriers, multidisciplinary strategies, and how to integrate pharmacotherapy when lifestyle alone is insufficient, before summarizing a practical, staged plan with monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and the primacy of lifestyle therapy. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), now also termed metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), affects roughly a quarter of the global population and is tightly linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiometabolic risk; importantly, there are no FDA-approved drugs for NAFLD/NASH, so lifestyle modification remains first-line therapy across the spectrum, with benefits extending beyond the liver to cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes [^0337b628] [^ffdc7890] [^2a3e3ee5].

> Wait, let me verify the weight-loss thresholds tied to histologic improvement. I initially thought a 3–5% loss improves steatosis, 7–10% improves NASH, and ≥ 10% leads to fibrosis regression; hold on, I should double-check the exact cut points. The AGA and AASLD-aligned guidance states that ≥ 5% total body weight loss reduces steatosis, ≥ 7% leads to NASH resolution in many patients, and ≥ 10% is associated with fibrosis regression or stabilization, with dose–response benefits observed in histologic trials and expert reviews [^5e2c9050] [^9aab6a08] [^9b1ad7eb]. I should also note that even modest weight loss can be meaningful in some contexts, but the clearest histologic gains accrue with larger, sustained losses [^9b1ad7eb].

> Next, I should review dietary specifics. Let me think about caloric targets first. Clinically significant weight loss generally requires a hypocaloric diet of about 1,200–1,500 kcal/day or a 500–1,000 kcal/day deficit from baseline, with sex-specific targets of ~1,200 kcal/day for women and ~1,400–1,500 kcal/day for men; this magnitude of restriction is consistently linked to improvements in steatosis and insulin resistance when sustained [^88b29114] [^14db3825] [^c374e466]. Hold on, I should verify the preferred dietary pattern. Multiple guidelines converge on a Mediterranean-style pattern emphasizing unsaturated fats, high fiber, and limited refined carbohydrates and saturated fats; importantly, Mediterranean diets can reduce liver fat even without weight loss, though weight loss amplifies benefits [^05d57426] [^9abd2b42] [^c374e466]. I need to ensure I clarify fructose guidance: minimize commercially produced fructose and sugar-sweetened beverages, but whole fruits are not associated with harm and should not be restricted [^05d57426].

> I will now examine exercise prescriptions and their independence from weight loss. Let me verify the targets. Guidelines recommend 150–300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75–150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity activity, ideally spread over 3–5 sessions, with resistance training as a complementary adjunct; importantly, exercise confers hepatic and cardiometabolic benefits independent of weight change, including reductions in liver fat and improvements in insulin sensitivity, though histologic NASH and fibrosis benefits are more likely with concurrent weight loss [^26a18aad] [^047050df] [^1ca6d238]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied exercise alone reliably reverses fibrosis; I should correct that: while exercise alone improves steatosis and metabolic markers, fibrosis regression generally requires greater weight loss or combination strategies, so I need to be precise here [^e9f7da38] [^9b1ad7eb].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with lean NAFLD. I should confirm that weight-loss targets are lower but still relevant. In normal-weight patients, a 3–5% weight loss can resolve NAFLD in about half and a 7–10% loss in about 70%, with exercise and diet quality (for example, Mediterranean patterns and avoidance of sugar-sweetened beverages) yielding benefits even when BMI is normal; thus, modest caloric restriction and structured activity remain appropriate [^c875b2a2] [^11437503] [^4e8e033c]. Hold on, I should verify that exercise still helps when weight is stable; yes, activity reduces liver fat independent of weight change in lean patients as well, reinforcing its universal role [^4e8e033c].

> Next, I should review patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. I need to ensure I do not overstate contraindications to exercise. Even in compensated cirrhosis, mild-to-moderate exercise is safe and may reduce portal pressure, with weight loss of 10% or more associated with greater hemodynamic improvement; these patients warrant aggressive lifestyle intervention within a multidisciplinary framework and careful monitoring for decompensation [^812d7f69] [^75804847]. Let me reconsider the role of bariatric surgery; in those with obesity and significant fibrosis who fail lifestyle and pharmacotherapy, metabolic surgery can be considered in experienced centers given robust histologic and survival benefits in selected cohorts [^2a3e3ee5] [^75804847].

> I should confirm pediatric considerations. For children with NAFLD, first-line management is lifestyle modification targeting energy deficit, reduced sugar intake (especially sugar-sweetened beverages), and at least 60 minutes per day of moderate-to-vigorous activity with screen time limits; family engagement and structured programs improve adherence and outcomes, and while pediatric RCTs are limited, observational and interventional data show biochemical and imaging improvements with weight optimization [^06552c35] [^0f2f8314] [^fa151b59]. But wait, what if the child is already lean? Even in non-obese youth, reducing visceral adiposity and improving diet quality and activity still confer hepatic benefits, so the same principles apply with BMI-appropriate targets [^06552c35].

> Now, I need to address implementation and sustainability, because efficacy in trials often exceeds real-world success. Let me verify the magnitude of the adherence gap. Fewer than 10% achieve and maintain ≥ 10% weight loss at one year in routine care, and long-term maintenance remains challenging; therefore, structured programs, behavioral support, and multidisciplinary care are essential to close this gap [^9b1ad7eb] [^d78576d8]. I should double-check behavioral strategies: referral to registered dietitians, use of motivational interviewing, and integration of cognitive-behavioral techniques improve engagement and outcomes; digital tools and social support can augment adherence, though high-quality long-term data are still evolving [^8ce6627a] [^4775decc] [^f5ea7e0f].

> Hold on, I should verify how to integrate pharmacotherapy when lifestyle is insufficient. For adults with obesity and NAFLD/NASH who fail to achieve ≥ 5–10% weight loss with lifestyle, anti-obesity medications such as semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly or liraglutide 3 mg daily are reasonable adjuncts to improve weight, histology, and cardiometabolic risk; pioglitazone and vitamin E have disease-specific evidence in selected NASH patients, and GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors are preferred glucose-lowering choices when diabetes coexists due to weight and cardiovascular benefits [^793f1841] [^84aad53a] [^62059846]. I need to ensure I emphasize that medications are adjuncts, not replacements, for lifestyle therapy and should be individualized to comorbidity profile and risk stratification [^ffdc7890] [^2a3e3ee5].

> Let me synthesize a practical, staged approach and make sure it aligns with guidance. For all patients, initiate education on caloric deficit, Mediterranean-style eating, and a prescriptive exercise plan of 150–300 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity plus resistance training, with alcohol restriction and screening for metabolic comorbidities; set a weight-loss goal of ≥ 7–10% for those with overweight/obesity and 3–5% for lean patients, using structured programs when available [^ffdc7890] [^26a18aad] [^4ee7f78f]. For low-risk fibrosis, reinforce lifestyle alone and monitor every 2–3 years; for indeterminate or high-risk fibrosis, escalate intensity with multidisciplinary care, consider anti-obesity pharmacotherapy if BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² and lifestyle fails, and evaluate for bariatric surgery in eligible patients with obesity and significant fibrosis; throughout, monitor liver enzymes, noninvasive fibrosis markers, and cardiometabolic parameters at guideline-directed intervals [^793f1841] [^75804847] [^65a46add].

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways and correct any lingering misstatements. Lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of NAFLD/MASLD management across the spectrum, with weight loss of ≥ 7–10% conferring the most consistent histologic benefits, Mediterranean-style eating and caloric restriction yielding additive benefits, and exercise providing independent improvements in liver fat and metabolism; implementation requires structured, sustained, and multidisciplinary support, and pharmacotherapy or surgery should be reserved for appropriately selected patients who fail lifestyle alone, with pediatric and lean populations receiving tailored but principle-concordant care [^5e2c9050] [^9abd2b42] [^ffdc7890].

---

Lifestyle modifications are the cornerstone of fatty liver management, with **weight loss of 5–10%** [^5e2c9050] yielding the greatest histologic and metabolic benefits [^9b1ad7eb]. A **Mediterranean diet** [^05d57426] with caloric restriction and reduced saturated fat, plus **150–300 minutes/week** [^26a18aad] of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise and resistance training, is recommended [^047050df]. Alcohol should be minimized or avoided [^08716ed3], and structured, multidisciplinary programs improve adherence and outcomes [^8ce6627a]. Even modest weight loss improves steatosis, while ≥ 7% loss improves NASH and ≥ 10% can reverse fibrosis [^9aab6a08]; benefits are dose-dependent and sustained only with ongoing lifestyle change [^9b1ad7eb].

---

## Weight loss and dietary modifications

### Caloric restriction and weight loss targets

- **Caloric deficit**: Aim for 500–1,000 kcal/day reduction [^88b29114] or 1,200–1,500 kcal/day [^14db3825] to achieve 0.5–1 kg/week weight loss.
- **Weight loss targets**: 3–5% improves steatosis; 7–10% improves NASH and fibrosis [^5e2c9050]; ≥ 10% can reverse fibrosis [^c863cab7].
- **Sustainability**: Structured programs and behavioral support improve long-term success [^8ce6627a].

---

### Dietary composition

- **Mediterranean diet**: Emphasize unsaturated fats, high fiber, and limit saturated fats and refined carbs [^05d57426]; reduces liver fat even without weight loss [^c863cab7].
- **Macronutrients**: Limit saturated fats, trans fats, and added sugars; prioritize complex carbs and lean protein [^4ee7f78f].
- **Fructose**: Minimize commercially produced fructose; whole fruits are acceptable [^05d57426].

---

## Physical activity and exercise

### Aerobic exercise

For aerobic exercise, **duration and intensity** of 150–300 minutes/week of moderate-intensity (e.g. brisk walking, cycling) or 75–150 minutes/week of vigorous-intensity activity is recommended [^26a18aad]. Benefits include reduced hepatic steatosis, improved insulin sensitivity, and cardiovascular health, even without weight loss [^1ca6d238].

---

### Resistance training

For resistance training, **frequency and intensity** of 2–3 sessions/week of moderate-intensity resistance exercise is advised [^notfound]. Benefits include improved insulin sensitivity, reduced liver fat, and enhanced muscle mass [^notfound].

---

## Alcohol consumption

Alcohol should be **restricted** [^08716ed3] because even low intake increases liver-related adverse outcomes in NAFLD [^ad771eca]; abstinence is ideal, especially in advanced fibrosis [^notfound].

---

## Behavioral strategies and adherence

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Dietitians, exercise specialists, and behavioral therapists improve adherence and outcomes [^8ce6627a].
- **Behavioral therapy**: Cognitive-behavioral strategies and motivational interviewing enhance long-term adherence [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up and self-monitoring sustain lifestyle changes [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

### Lean NAFLD

In lean NAFLD, **modest weight loss** of 3–5% can improve steatosis and NASH [^c875b2a2]; emphasize diet quality and exercise [^4e8e033c].

---

### Advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis

In advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, **aggressive lifestyle change** with close monitoring is essential [^75804847]; consider bariatric surgery in eligible patients [^2a3e3ee5].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Intervention** | **Recommended approach** | **Expected benefits** |
|-|-|-|
| Weight loss | 5–10% of body weight | - Steatosis reduction <br/> - NASH resolution <br/> - Fibrosis regression [^5e2c9050] |
| Diet | Mediterranean diet; caloric restriction | - Reduced liver fat <br/> - Improved insulin sensitivity [^c863cab7] |
| Exercise | 150–300 min/week moderate-intensity aerobic + resistance | - Reduced steatosis <br/> - Improved insulin sensitivity <br/> - Cardiovascular health [^1ca6d238] |
| Alcohol | Restrict or abstain | Reduced liver-related adverse outcomes [^08716ed3] |
| Behavioral support | Multidisciplinary, structured programs | Improved adherence and sustained weight loss [^8ce6627a] |

---

Lifestyle modifications — particularly **weight loss, Mediterranean-style eating, and regular exercise** — are the foundation of fatty liver management, with benefits proportional to weight loss and sustained only with ongoing change [^5e2c9050].

### Why Do lifestyle recommendations fail in most patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease? [^d78576d8]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has been recognized as a major health burden. The efficacy and safety profile of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease remains uncertain; therefore, lifestyle modification is the first line of treatment. Based on available data, patients should optimally achieve at least a 5% to 10% weight reduction for histologic improvement. There is no clear consensus on the optimal diet or exercise regimen. Sustainability of any intervention is key to success; however, compliance has been a major issue in clinical trials. This finding underscores the importance of multidisciplinary strategies to achieve targeted weigh loss.

Purpose Of Review

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of liver disease in the United States and is strongly associated to the metabolic syndrome. In this review, we will discuss the evidence behind the current recommendations on lifestyle modifications and available treatment options for NAFLD.

Recent Findings

The unrelenting rise in obesity and diabetes epidemic has led to a large healthcare burden from NAFLD and it is projected to continue to grow over the next two decades. Lifestyle modification that leads to weight loss is effective at treating NAFLD, but these modifications require a multidisciplinary approach for success in the real world. Multiple pharmacologic treatment options have been studied with promising results, but none have been approved for treatment in the United States. Clinical trials are on-going to study further pharmacologic treatment alternatives.

Summary

NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease in United States, and an independent risk factor for mortality. Implementation of lifestyle modifications through a multidisciplinary approach and careful selection of patients for pharmacologic interventions will be essential for successful management of NAFLD.

Introduction

Severe liver disease has significant effects on an individual's quality of life (QOL) as well as their life expectancy. The treatment of many of these conditions involves multi-drug regimens which can be associated with a variety of side effects. Although therapy with prescription medication is often unavoidable, maximizing lifestyle interventions can play a key role in maintenance of overall health augmenting medical therapy in patients with chronic liver disease. Recently published studies have advanced our understanding of how various lifestyle interventions may improve the pathology and symptoms related to specific liver diseases, thereby improving quality of life for these patients.

Lifestyle modifications are strongly recommended for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as patients who have undergone liver transplantation. Even when efficacious pharmacologic interventions are identified, lifestyle changes will likely represent an adjuvant treatment because new drugs are inevitably expensive and may have unanticipated adverse effects after prolonged use. These lifestyle modifications typically encompass both dietary intervention and physical activity goals. Unfortunately, these straightforward goals are surprisingly hard to achieve in an environment of copious amounts of high-calorie food and busy daily routines that seem to preclude time for exercise. Many of these difficulties can only be overcome by a culture change that values wholesome foods and regular exercise over the convenience of prepared foods and sedentary activities. In the following sections we will discuss the current evidence for non-pharmacological, lifestyle interventions in the management of some of the most common causes of chronic liver disease including NAFLD, chronic HCV infection, as well as in the liver transplant population.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease, with global public health impact affecting more than 25% of the global population. NAFLD is associated with significant morbidity and mortality from cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, solid organ malignancies, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and obstructive sleep apnea, resulting in significant health care resource use and decreased health-related quality of life. NAFLD cirrhosis is a leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States. Lifestyle modification to achieve weight loss remains a first-line intervention in patients with NAFLD. We summarize evidence-based interventions for lifestyle modification in the treatment of NAFLD and provided best practice advice statements to address key issues in clinical management.

### Lifestyle interventions for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in adults: a systematic review [^554a206c]. Journal of Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a serious and growing clinical problem. Despite lifestyle modification, i.e. diet and physical activity, being the recommended therapy, there are currently no systematic evaluations of its efficacy. This review applies a systematic approach to evaluating lifestyle modifications studied to date. Medline (Pubmed), Scopus, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched for studies and study groups assessing the effect of diet, physical activity, and/or exercise modification in adult populations with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The outcome markers of interest were indicators of steatosis, histological evidence of inflammation and fibrosis, and glucose control/insulin sensitivity. We identified 23 studies for inclusion; seven had control groups, but only six were randomised. Eleven groups received diet-only interventions, two exercise-only, and 19 diet and physical activity/exercise. Studies consistently showed reductions in liver fat and/or liver aminotransferase concentration, with the strongest correlation being with weight reduction. Of the 5 studies reporting changes in histopathology, all showed a trend towards reduction in inflammation, in 2 this was statistically significant. Changes in fibrosis were less consistent with only one study showing a significant reduction. The majority of studies also reported improvements in glucose control/insulin sensitivity following intervention. However, study design, definition of disease, assessment methods, and interventions varied considerably across studies. Lifestyle modifications leading to weight reduction and/or increased physical activity consistently reduced liver fat and improved glucose control/insulin sensitivity. Limited data also suggest that lifestyle interventions may hold benefits for histopathology.

Lifestyle modification

Lifestyle modification aimed at weight loss and increased physical activity is vital in managing all patients with NAFLD irrespective of their underlying liver histology. Patients should be encouraged to avoid a sedentary lifestyle by increasing daily activities, undertaking regular exercise and eating healthily. Overall, lifestyle interventions including behavioural, dietary and exercise changes can be very effective in reducing body weight. In one study, patients who received dietary advice and undertook 200 min moderate physical activity per week for 48 weeks had an overall 9.3% reduction in body weight (versus 0.2% in the control arm) and had improvement in hepatic steatosis and inflammation on liver biopsy.

### Clinical care pathway for the risk stratification and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^a30dfba6]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease — management of patients at low risk of advanced fibrosis emphasizes lifestyle measures: Low risk is defined as having a FIB-4 score < 1.3, LSM < 8.0 kPa by transient elastography, or a liver biopsy fibrosis stage of F0–F1; for these patients, we recommend therapeutic lifestyle interventions, and specific pharmacologic treatment targeting liver steatosis is not necessary; management should focus on lifestyle interventions to modify unfavorable cardiometabolic risk factors, with particular efforts to promote weight loss in overweight or obese patients; all patients should receive education about nutritional strategies, regular physical activity, and avoiding excess alcohol intake; given that even low alcohol intake is associated with increased risks for advanced liver disease and cancer in individuals with NAFLD, adults with NAFLD should restrict alcohol consumption to reduce liver-related events; there are no large, long-term behavioral modification or pharmacotherapy studies regarding weight loss in NAFLD, but weight loss of any magnitude should be encouraged, and reversal of steatosis may be observed with even modest weight loss (approximately 5%), although most studies suggest that a greater decrease (up to 10%) is needed to improve steatohepatitis or fibrosis.

### Standardisation of diet and exercise in clinical trials of NAFLD-NASH: recommendations from the liver forum [^e89c720c]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle modification is the foundation of treatment recommendations for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The design of clinical trials in NASH may be impeded by the lack of a systematic approach to identify and evaluate how lifestyle changes and/or modifications influence clinical trial outcomes and associated endpoints. Furthermore, there are additional uncertainties regarding the methods that can be utilised to better characterise and quantify lifestyle variables - which can influence disease activity and alter trial endpoints - to allow for comparisons of trial outcomes across different phases of research and/or within drug-classes. This summary by the Liver Forum's Standard of Care Working Group reviews currently available clinical data, identifies the barriers and challenges associated with the standard of care in NAFLD/NASH clinical trials, defines available assessments of lifestyle changes, and proposes approaches to better understand and define the influence of diet and exercise on NASH treatment in the context of different pharmacologic interventions. The ultimate objective is to propose tangible solutions which enable investigators, sponsors, and regulatory authorities to meaningfully interpret clinical trial outcomes and the impact of lifestyle modification on such outcomes as they pertain to phase I-IV clinical trials.

### AGA clinical practice update on lifestyle modification using diet and exercise to achieve weight loss in the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: expert review [^ffdc7890]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Lifestyle modification and weight loss for NAFLD — Best Practice Advice 1 states that lifestyle modification using diet and exercise to achieve weight loss is beneficial for all patients with NAFLD, and adds that lifestyle modification centered on diet and physical activity to achieve weight loss as well as the avoidance of alcohol are the foundations of treatment for all patients with NAFLD, regardless of histologic type. It also notes that lifestyle modification including significant weight loss through hypocaloric diet and exercise is considered as a first-line intervention for the treatment of NAFLD, while medications, bariatric endoscopy, and surgery to achieve weight loss may be considered for select subsets of patients with severe obesity, co-existing diabetes mellitus, and/or biopsy-proven NASH with, at a minimum, stage 2 fibrosis.

### Nutrition and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: current perspectives [^dd5d333a]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis are diseases in their own right as well as modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. With expanding knowledge on NAFLD pathogenesis, insights have been gleaned into molecular targets for pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. Lifestyle modifications constitute a cornerstone of NAFLD management. This article reviews roles of key dietary macronutrients and micronutrients in NAFLD pathogenesis and their effects on molecular targets shared with established or emerging pharmacotherapies. Based on current evidence, a recommendation for a dietary framework as part of the comprehensive management strategy for NAFLD is provided.

Principles of management of NAFLD

Management of patients with NAFLD depends largely on the stage of disease, emphasising the importance of careful risk stratification. There are four main areas to focus on when thinking about management strategies in NAFLD: lifestyle modification, targeting the components of the metabolic syndrome, liver-directed pharmacotherapy for high risk patients and managing the complications of cirrhosis (figure 1).

Figure 1
Management strategies in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

All patients with NAFLD require advice about lifestyle modification aimed at weight loss and increased physical activity, as well as treatment of any associated metabolic risk factors (diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia). For patients with simple steatosis, which carries a relatively benign liver-related prognosis, this can be done in a primary care setting. Patients with steatohepatitis and fibrosis are at highest risk of developing progressive liver disease so require more aggressive lifestyle modification and if this fails can be considered for liver-directed pharmacotherapy with pioglitazone or vitamin E. For patients who have progressed to cirrhosis, surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is essential and some treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of HCC. Interventions for the treatment of NAFLD are summarised in table 1.

### Physical activity: an essential component of lifestyle modification in NAFLD [^edfd21fb]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Medium credibility.

NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver diseases pertaining to fat accumulation in the liver in the absence of significant alcohol consumption. NASH is the most clinically relevant subset of NAFLD, and patients with NASH have an increased risk of progression to cirrhosis or developing liver cancer. No pharmacotherapy is currently approved for NAFLD, and lifestyle modification via diet and exercise is most commonly recommended. The optimal physical activity regimen in terms of both effectiveness and compliance remains to be determined and is the focus of this Review.

### Non-pharmacological management options for MAFLD: a practical guide [^04b766b0]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle changes should be the main basis for any treatment for metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), aiming to increase energy expenditure, reduce energy intake and improve the quality of nutrients consumed. As it is a multifactorial disease, approaches such as physical exercise, a better dietary pattern, and possible pharmacological intervention are shown to be more efficient when used simultaneously to the detriment of their applications. The main treatment for MAFLD is a lifestyle change consisting of diet, activity, exercise, and weight loss. The variables for training prescription such as type of physical exercise (aerobic or strength training), the weekly frequency, and the intensity most indicated for the treatment of MAFLD remain uncertain, that is, the recommendations must be adapted to the clinical conditions comorbidities, and preferences of each subject in a way individual. This review addresses recent management options for MAFLD including diet, nutrients, gut microbiota, and physical exercise.

### Therapeutic landscape for NAFLD in 2020 [^d09c9b0a]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle modifications focused on healthy eating and regular exercise are the primary recommendations for patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, for multiple societal, psychological, physical, genetic, and epigenetic reasons, the ability of people to adopt and sustain such changes is challenging and typically not successful. To end the epidemic of NASH and prevent its complications, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, pharmacological interventions are now being evaluated in clinical trials. Treatments include drugs targeting energy intake, energy disposal, lipotoxic liver injury, and the resulting inflammation and fibrogenesis that lead to cirrhosis. It is likely that patients develop the phenotype of NASH by multiple mechanisms, and thus the optimal treatments of NASH will likely evolve to personalized therapy once we understand the mechanistic underpinnings of NASH in each patient.

### Non-pharmacological management options for MAFLD: a practical guide [^952ea5be]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle changes should be the main basis for any treatment for metabolic dysfunction–associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), aiming to increase energy expenditure, reduce energy intake and improve the quality of nutrients consumed. As it is a multifactorial disease, approaches such as physical exercise, a better dietary pattern, and possible pharmacological intervention are shown to be more efficient when used simultaneously to the detriment of their applications. The main treatment for MAFLD is a lifestyle change consisting of diet, activity, exercise, and weight loss. The variables for training prescription such as type of physical exercise (aerobic or strength training), the weekly frequency, and the intensity most indicated for the treatment of MAFLD remain uncertain, that is, the recommendations must be adapted to the clinical conditions comorbidities, and preferences of each subject in a way individual. This review addresses recent management options for MAFLD including diet, nutrients, gut microbiota, and physical exercise.

AASLD NAFLD practice guidance — lifestyle intervention (weight loss) states that weight loss of 3%–5% improves steatosis, but greater weight loss (> 10%) is generally required to improve NASH and fibrosis. Few patients (< 10%) achieve effective weight loss despite structured interventions at 1 year, and fewer than half of these maintain the weight lost 5 years after intervention. Sustained weight loss reduces adipose tissue stress and improves peripheral insulin sensitivity, although achieving and sustaining weight loss is challenging.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to treatment [^3838b61b]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects up to a third of the population in many developed countries. Between 10% and 30% of patients with NAFLD have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that can progress to cirrhosis. There are metabolic risk factors common to both NAFLD and cardiovascular disease, so patients with NASH have an increased risk of liver-related and cardiovascular death. Management of patients with NAFLD depends largely on the stage of disease, emphasising the importance of careful risk stratification. There are four main areas to focus on when thinking about management strategies in NAFLD: lifestyle modification, targeting the components of the metabolic syndrome, liver-directed pharmacotherapy for high risk patients and managing the complications of cirrhosis.

### Treatment of NAFLD with diet, physical activity and exercise [^c863cab7]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Lifestyle intervention can be effective when treating non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) patients. Weight loss decreases cardiovascular and diabetes risk and can also regress liver disease. Weight reductions of ⩾10% can induce a near universal non-alcoholic steatohepatitis resolution and fibrosis improvement by at least one stage. However, modest weight loss (> 5%) can also produce important benefits on the components of the NAFLD activity score (NAS). Additionally, we need to explore the role of total calories and type of weight loss diet, micro- and macronutrients, evidence-based benefits of physical activity and exercise and finally support these modifications through established behavioural change models and techniques for long-term maintenance of lifestyle modifications. Following a Mediterranean diet can reduce liver fat even without weight loss and is the most recommended dietary pattern for NAFLD. The Mediterranean diet is characterised by reduced carbohydrate intake, especially sugars and refined carbohydrates (40% of the calories vs. 50–60% in a typical low fat diet), and increased monounsaturated and omega-3 fatty acid intake (40% of the calories as fat vs. up-to 30% in a typical low fat diet). Both TV sitting (a reliable marker of overall sedentary behaviour) and physical activity are associated with cardio-metabolic health, NAFLD and overall mortality. A 'triple hit behavioural phenotype' of: i) sedentary behaviour, ii) low physical activity, and iii) poor diet have been defined. Clinical evidence strongly supports the role of lifestyle modification as a primary therapy for the management of NAFLD and NASH. This should be accompanied by the implementation of strategies to avoid relapse and weight regain.

### Efficacy of dietary and physical activity intervention in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review [^de043678]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, with prevalence above 30% in many adult populations. Strongly associated with obesity, weight loss through diet and physical activity is the mainstay of its management. Weight loss can be difficult to achieve and maintain however, and uncertainty exists as to which lifestyle changes are most effective.

Objective

The aim of this work was to systematically evaluate randomised controlled trials assessing diet, exercise or combination interventions aimed at reducing steatosis or markers of NAFLD activity.

Design

Medline, Scopus and Cochrane databases were searched from 1 January 1980 through to 31 July 2016, for intervention trials assessing the effects of diet, weight loss, exercise or any combination thereof, on NAFLD disease markers in human adults. Risk of publication bias and study quality was assessed using the American Dietetic Association Quality Criteria Checklist.

Results

From a total of 1710 identified records, 24 articles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria; 6 assessed weight loss using dietary restriction, 10 assessed exercise and 8 were combination interventions. While all of the trials demonstrated significant reduction in steatosis and/or markers of NAFLD activity, combination interventions appear to be the most effective at improving NAFLD. Results suggest that 5–10% weight loss using a modestly hypocaloric diet of 500 kcal less per day than calculated energy requirement, in combination with 30–60 min exercise on 3–5 days per week should be recommended.

Conclusions

We conclude this amount of weight loss is achievable in the trial setting but is challenging in the clinical environment. High-intensity, multidisciplinary intervention in specialist clinics is likely to be required in order to manage NAFLD by lifestyle modification alone. This systematic review protocol was registered prospectively at PROSPERO as CRD42016032764.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^9abd2b42]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) lifestyle management — diet, exercise, and coffee intake: Patients who are overweight or obese should be prescribed a diet that leads to a caloric deficit, and when possible, diets with limited carbohydrates and saturated fat and enriched with high fiber and unsaturated fats (e.g. Mediterranean diet) should be encouraged due to their additional cardiovascular benefits. To support physical activity, patients should be encouraged to exercise as much as possible, and individualized prescriptive exercise recommendations may increase sustainability and have benefits independent of weight loss. Weight loss improves hepatic steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and hepatic fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner, and the necessary support to manage comorbid disease and foster the adoption of liver protective health behaviors is best achieved using a multidisciplinary approach. Coffee consumption (caffeinated or not) of at least 3 cups daily is associated with less advanced liver disease.

Lifestyle modification and weight loss for NAFLD — Best Practice Advice 2 indicates that among patients with NASH, weight loss of ≥ 5% total body weight (TBW) can decrease hepatic steatosis, weight loss of ≥ 7% TBW can lead to NASH resolution, and weight loss of ≥ 10% TBW can result in fibrosis regression/stability. Supporting trial data reported that although the control had no significant change in weight, the ILI group lost, on average, 9.3% TBW, and that patients with ≥ 7% TBW loss had significant improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and NAFLD activity score, although no change in fibrosis was seen.

### Prospective histopathologic evaluation of lifestyle modification in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a randomized trial [^1b8eedc7]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now recognized as part of the metabolic syndrome, and is specifically related to obesity and insulin resistance. Lifestyle modification is advocated for the treatment of NAFLD, but few studies have evaluated its impact on liver histology. The purpose of this study was to investigate which, if any, specific diet and exercise recommendations are associated with histopathologic changes.

Methods

A total of 56 participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 lifestyle modification subgroups for 6 months: standard care, low-fat diet and moderate exercise, moderate-fat/low-processed-carbohydrate diet and moderate exercise, or moderate exercise only. All subjects had biopsy-proven NAFLD, to include nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and received a repeat 6-month biopsy to detect histopathologic changes. Other measures included blood assay of liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase), fasting glucose, serum insulin, lipid panel, body weight, dietary intake, fat mass, and fitness level.

Results

Among the 41 participants who completed the study (88% with NASH), a significant change was found in pre- to post-NAFLD activity score in the group as a whole (p < 0.001) with no difference detected between subgroups (p = 0.31). Our results confirm that lifestyle modification is effective in improving NAFLD and NASH.

Conclusions

Regardless of intervention group, lifestyle modification improved liver histology, as verified by repeat biopsy, after a 6-month intervention. This study reinforces the importance of lifestyle modification as the primary treatment strategy for patients with NAFLD.

### Community-based lifestyle modification programme for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a randomized controlled trial [^bb25a4fc]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Healthy lifestyle is the most important management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study aimed at assessing the efficacy of a community-based lifestyle modification programme in the remission of NAFLD.

Methods

This was a parallel group, superiority, randomized controlled trial. 154 adults with NAFLD identified during population screening were randomized to participate in a dietitian-led lifestyle modification programme at 2 community centres or receive usual care for 12 months. The primary outcome was remission of NAFLD at month 12 as evidenced by intrahepatic triglyceride content (IHTG) of less than 5% by proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Results

74 patients in the intervention group and 71 patients in the control group completed all study assessments. In an intention-to-treat analysis of all 154 patients, 64% of the patients in the intervention group and 20% in the control group achieved remission of NAFLD (difference between groups 44%; 95% CI 30–58%; p < 0.001). The mean (SD) changes in IHTG from baseline to month 12 were -6.7% (6.1%) in the intervention group and -2.1% (6.4%) in the control group (p < 0.001). Body weight decreased by 5.6 (4.4) kg and 0.6 (2.5) kg in the two groups, respectively (p < 0.001). While 97% of patients with weight loss of more than 10% had remission of NAFLD, 41% of those with weight loss of 3.0–4.9% could also achieve the primary outcome.

Conclusions

The community-based lifestyle modification programme is effective in reducing and normalizing liver fat in NAFLD patients.

### A narrative review of lifestyle management guidelines for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [^f5ea7e0f]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease management guidelines have been published worldwide; we aimed to summarize, categorize, and compare their lifestyle intervention recommendations.

Approach and Results

We searched metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease/NAFLD management guidelines published between January 1, 2013, and June 31, 2024, through databases including PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane, and CINAHL. In total, 35 qualifying guidelines were included in the final analysis. Guideline recommendations were categorized into 5 domains (ie, weight reduction goals, physical activity, nutrition, alcohol, and tobacco smoking) and were ranked based on how frequently they appeared. A recommendation was defined as widely adopted if recommended in ≥ 24 (≥ 66.6%) of the guidelines. These included increasing physical activity; reducing body weight by 7%-10% to improve steatohepatitis and/or fibrosis; restricting caloric intake; undertaking 150–300 or 75–150 minutes/week of moderate or vigorous-intensity physical activity, respectively; and decreasing consumption of commercially produced fructose. The least mentioned topics, in ≤ 9 of the guidelines, evaluated environmental determinants of health, mental health, referring patients for psychological or cognitive behavioral therapy, using digital health interventions, and assessing patients' social determinants of health.

Conclusions

Most guidelines recommend weight reduction through physical activity and improving nutrition, as these have proven positive effects on health outcomes when sustained. However, gaps regarding mental health and the social and environmental determinants of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease were found. To optimize behavioral modifications and treatment, we recommend carrying out studies that will provide further evidence on social support, environmental factors, and mental health, as well as further exploring digital health interventions.

In adults with normal-weight NAFLD, a 3%–5% TBW loss can also result in NAFLD resolution in 50% and a 7%–10% TBW loss results in resolution of NAFLD in 70%, and liver stiffness assessed by transient elastography also improved in patients with normal-weight NAFLD who participated in the lifestyle intervention compared with those in the control arm.

### Current therapeutic strategies in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^6ec24ed2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of disease ranging from simple steatosis through steatohepatitis (NASH) to increasing fibrosis and eventual cirrhosis. NAFLD is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and has now become the most common cause of liver disease in Western countries, with the more advanced stages of disease being associated with an increased risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality. The optimal management of patients with NAFLD remains a clinical challenge. The aim of this study is to describe established and emerging strategies for the treatment of NAFLD. Relevant research and review articles were identified by searching PubMed. Selected articles referenced in these publications were also examined. Good quality randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the need for multifaceted lifestyle interventions in patients with NAFLD including the need for diet, exercise and behavioural counselling. Despite several trials of pharmacological agents, no highly effective treatment yet exists, with surgery representing the mainstay for advanced disease. A multidisciplinary approach, with a major focus on lifestyle change, represents best treatment pending the development of new therapeutic options.

Therapeutic approaches

Lifestyle measures by diet adaptation

There is a general consensus that 5–10% weight loss will reduce the majority of risk factors leading to glucose disturbance, hepatic fat accumulation, and CVD. – It is also long known that a calorie-restricted diet rapidly decreases liver fat and can completely normalize hepatic insulin sensitivity in obese individuals with or without T2D. Macronutrient composition of the diet, high versus low carbohydrate, high versus low fat and high versus low protein, seems to be of less importance than total caloric deficit in determining fat loss. Among different macronutrient diets, no differences were noted in body composition, abdominal or hepatic fat loss. A more recent trial found that both a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet and an intermittent calorie-restrictive diet were more effective compared with general lifestyle advice from a hepatologist.

The current American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines recommend weight loss achieved by hypocaloric diets in conjunction with increased physical activity for treatment of NAFLD/NASH. While lifestyle modification consisting of diet, exercise, and weight loss is advocated to treat patients with NAFLD/NASH, such modifications are difficult for subjects to sustain in long term. Moreover, weight loss alone may not always suffice for the majority of patients, particularly those with advanced hepatic fibrosis, and as it is known from obesity management, challenges exist with implementing lifestyle recommendations.

Many studies exist that analyzed the effects of lifestyle and weight loss on NAFLD and the risk of subsequent NASH, including MRI spectroscopy studies. Results in overweight patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD could confirm initial findings, also offering the opportunity to assess important changes in inflammation, lobular changes, and fibrosis. Improvements in lifestyle can have immediate and sometimes significant effects on the liver in NAFLD patients, and may contribute to the high rate of 'placebo response' observed in NASH trials. Lifestyle modification remains key to managing NASH even after medical interventions become available.

### Diagnosis… [^84782338]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

- Weight loss is key to managing NAFLD and NASH; lifestyle interventions, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, and bariatric surgery all improve liver disease. From the AFP Editors. Management Management of NAFLD is primarily focused on lifestyle changes. A few medications have disease-oriented evidence of benefit but have not been studied for their effect on patient outcomes. LIFESTYLE Weight loss proportionally reduces hepatic steatosis. In a study of a 52-week intensive lifestyle program in patients with NASH, 90% of patients who lost more than 10% of initial body weight had resolution of NASH, and 45% had regression of fibrosis. The Mediterranean and calorie-restricted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diets appear beneficial. Exercise appears consistently beneficial, especially when paired with dietary changes. MEDICATIONS Pioglitazone increases resolution of NASH, especially in patients with advanced fibrosis.

Pioglitazone commonly causes weight gain and heart failure and carries a small risk of bladder cancer. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists increase the resolution of steatohepatitis. Whether this improvement is due to the medication or the weight loss is unknown. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors improve hepatic steatosis on imaging, but no biopsy evidence is available. Metformin does not appear to improve steatohepatitis or fibrosis. Little evidence exists to guide treatment of NAFLD in children. Lifestyle advice has been shown to improve steatohepatitis and fibrosis in some children, whereas others worsened. Metformin and vitamin E do not improve steatohepatitis in children with NASH. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists are recommended based on evidence of reducing obesity. Do we need another reason to encourage lifestyle changes, and will this diagnosis be the motivating factor.

The benefit of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors may simply be tied to the weight loss they cause. The evidence for pioglitazone is more complicated. With only disease-oriented evidence from five trials including just more than 500 patients, the authors of the meta-analysis referenced by the guideline note that trials were too small to allow assessment for adverse events.

Regarding pharmacologic weight loss, in one trial orlistat did not improve body weight or liver histology, and another trial could not evaluate histologic effects because most patients did not undergo a follow-up biopsy.

THERAPY

The rationale for therapeutic approaches is centred on the concept that while simple steatosis has not been associated with morbidity, NASH is associated with a more than 10-fold increased risk of liver-related death (2.8 vs. 0.2%) and a doubling of cardiovascular risk; at the time of diagnosis, 25–33% of patients with NASH have advanced fibrosis, including cirrhosis. After adjustment for confounders, NASH has a similar fibrotic potential to that of chronic hepatitis C. Pooled data suggest that about 21% of patients with NASH will have some regression of fibrosis while 38% of patients will progress over 5.3 years' follow-up, results that have recently been confirmed in a dual-biopsy Northern European population.

Lifestyle modifications

Weight reduction is recommended as the initial step in management of NASH. Pharmacological agents such as orlistat may help achieve weight loss; however, whether these confer additional independent benefit beyond that due to weight loss is unclear. Lifestyle modification therefore remains the primary therapy for weight reduction, particularly in the absence of approved pharmacotherapy; it encompasses diet, physical activity (aerobic and resistance) and behavioural change, or a combination of all three. Trial evidence shows that weight reduction more than 7% sustained over 48 weeks is associated with significant reduction in histological severity of NASH. A systematic review of the available evidence for lifestyle modifications in NAFLD has recently been conducted. Less than 50% of patients achieve the necessary weight loss goal of more than 7% in the trial setting, and many have questioned the sustainability of this type of intervention. Resistance training, which is less burdensome on the cardiovascular system, shares the metabolic improvements seen in more strenuous aerobic exercise and may be more sustainable. Nevertheless, in the many patients that fail to implement lifestyle changes or have advanced disease (bridging fibrosis) on index biopsy, specific liver-directed pharmacotherapy may be needed. No drugs are currently licensed specifically for treating NASH; there is an urgent need for well designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with appropriate endpoints to narrow this gap. Table 1 summarizes the current evidence for therapies in NASH.

Therapies of potential value for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis

Very few large RCTs have been published on which evidence-based treatment for NASH is recommended. Therapies with potential benefit in NASH include thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and vitamin E.

### Lifestyle modifications for nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease: a network meta-analysis [^1f6d25dd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) varies between 19% and 33% in different populations. NAFLD decreases life expectancy and increases the risks of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and requirement for liver transplantation. There is uncertainty surrounding the relative benefits and harms of various lifestyle interventions for people with NAFLD.

Objectives

To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different lifestyle interventions in the treatment of NAFLD through a network meta-analysis, and to generate rankings of the different lifestyle interventions according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until February 2021 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with NAFLD.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in people with NAFLD, whatever the method of diagnosis, age, and diabetic status of participants, or presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We planned to perform a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and to calculate the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HRs), odds ratios (ORs), and rate ratios (RaRs) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) based on an available-participant analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. However, the data were too sparse for the clinical outcomes. We therefore performed only direct comparisons (head-to-head comparisons) with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods.

Main Results

We included a total of 59 randomised clinical trials (3631 participants) in the review. All but two trials were at high risk of bias. A total of 33 different interventions, ranging from advice to supervised exercise and special diets, or a combination of these and no additional intervention were compared in these trials. The reference treatment was no active intervention. Twenty-eight trials (1942 participants) were included in one or more comparisons. The follow-up ranged from 1 month to 24 months. The remaining trials did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. The follow-up period in the trials that reported clinical outcomes was 2 months to 24 months. During this short follow-up period, clinical events related to NAFLD such as mortality, liver cirrhosis, liver decompensation, liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality were sparse. This is probably because of the very short follow-up periods. It takes a follow-up of 8 years to 28 years to detect differences in mortality between people with NAFLD and the general population. It is therefore unlikely that differences by clinical outcomes will be noted in trials with less than 5 years to 10 years of follow-up. In one trial, one participant developed an adverse event. There were no adverse events in any of the remaining participants in this trial, or in any of the remaining trials, which seemed to be directly related to the intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effects of the lifestyle interventions compared with no additional intervention (to general public health advice) on any of the clinical outcomes after a short follow-up period of 2 months to 24 months in people with nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease. Accordingly, high-quality randomised clinical trials with adequate follow-up are needed. We propose registry-based randomised clinical trials or cohort multiple randomised clinical trials (a study design in which multiple interventions are trialed within large longitudinal cohorts of participants to gain efficiencies and align trials more closely to standard clinical practice), comparing aerobic exercise and dietary advice versus standard of care (exercise and dietary advice received as part of national health promotion). The reason for the choice of aerobic exercise and dietary advice is the impact of these interventions on indirect outcomes which may translate to clinical benefit. The outcomes in such trials should be mortality, health-related quality of life, decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver transplantation, and resource use measures including costs of intervention and decreased healthcare use after a minimum follow-up of eight years, to find meaningful differences in the clinically important outcomes.

### Management of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease [^55d0faaf]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), previously known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is the most common cause of liver disease in the world. Its prevalence is over 30% and is becoming the most common cause of liver transplants. Rates are rising along with obesity-related diseases. Risk factors for MAFLD include adverse lifestyles, genetic variations, advancing age, male sex, and alterations in the gut microbiota. Extrahepatic complications include cardiovascular disease, renal dysfunction, and colorectal cancer. As there are no currently approved medications for MAFLD, management mainly focuses on lifestyle modifications.

### Lifestyle changes for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a review of observational studies and intervention trials [^49765e63]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is emerging as a major public health problem because of its association with increased cardiovascular and liver-related morbidity and mortality. Both genetic factors and lifestyle contribute to the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Lifestyle, including dietary habits and physical activity, is a modifiable risk factor and thus represents the main target for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. In this review, we summarize the evidence regarding nutritional aspects (i.e. total energy intake, saturated fat and carbohydrates intake, certain foods or drinks and dietary patterns as a whole) in the treatment of NAFLD. In addition, we analyze the evidence concerning the independent effect of physical activity, including aerobic and resistance training, in the treatment of NAFLD. A therapeutic algorithm according to results from intervention trials is also provided for clinicians and other healthcare professionals involved in the management of NAFLD.

AGA NAFLD lifestyle — Best Practice Advice 6 (specific hypocaloric diets) notes that the effect of specific hypocaloric diets, such as low-carbohydrate/high-protein diets, meal-replacement protocols, intermittent fasting, and vitamin supplementation, on histologic NAFLD is largely unknown; however, there are potential benefits of certain hypocaloric diets to treat patients with NAFLD, which should be tailored to individual preferences before prescribing. Studies of meal-replacement diets for the treatment of NAFLD have been limited by small size and have failed to demonstrate a benefit in NAFLD. Intermittent fasting, also known as time-restricted eating, limits the hours or days that calories are consumed and should be individualized, with one study showing weight loss and improvement in lipid parameters but no change in liver stiffness by transient elastography and another showing a reduction in the fatty liver index in adults with and without diabetes mellitus. Low-carbohydrate, high-protein diets have limited data in NAFLD, with one study showing weight loss and improvement in liver enzymes but no data on radiographic or histologic improvement, and another showing greater decreases in intrahepatic triglyceride at 48 hours but no difference after 11 weeks; thus, a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet cannot yet be considered as the preferred diet for the treatment of NAFLD.

### Improving prevention strategies for cardiometabolic disease [^b2a02850]. Nature Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

There is a growing burden of cardiometabolic disease in many parts of the world. Despite some progress in its prevention, more can be done to tackle risks of its development in the community and in different specialty clinics. Currently, the identification and management of those at elevated risk of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes or with conditions such as fatty liver disease remains fragmented and is not linked to constructive lifestyle advice. In this Perspective, we argue for a more consistent weight-management approach, alongside a holistic assessment of the risk for developing cardiometabolic diseases, offering patients a range of simple or more-intensive evidence-based lifestyle options in an empathetic manner, with encouragement for repeated attempts and a willingness to embrace failure.

Management

Challenges in non-pharmacological management

The increasing incidence of NAFLD requires an amplified effort to detect the disease early in its course and reduce its progression. Diet and exercise are the mainstay of management in patients with NAFLD. In a prospective study of patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH, a 10% loss in body weight led to a histological benefit in improved fibrosis of the liver. The benefit of weight loss has also been demonstrated in a trial that randomized dietician-reinforced lifestyle intervention vs. general recommendations for weight loss. The study observed a 64% resolution in liver fibrosis in the intervention group compared with 20% in the control group. A recent meta-analysis showed that exercise, alone or combined with dietary intervention, improves serum levels of liver enzymes and liver fat or histology in NAFLD patients. Furthermore, resolution of liver fibrosis has therapeutic implications, since fibrosis has been shown to be a main predictor of disease progression and liver cirrhosis.

The ideal diet for patients is yet to be determined; however, certain lifestyle dietary habits have potential associations with NAFLD. A Mediterranean diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and fiber during a 6-week crossover study resulted in a significant reduction in hepatic steatosis. It remains to be seen whether the short-term improvement in steatosis has long-term benefits in reducing disease progression. A recent study reported that optimal sleep (defined as sleep hours ≥ 7 and ≤ 9/day) in addition to a diet comprising high consumption of low-fat dairy products, vegetables, and fish, was beneficially associated with insulin resistance and liver stiffness in NAFLD patients, independently of body weight status and energy intake. Other studies have underscored the value of optimal sleep and its associSation with NAFLD.

A study comparing the effects of mild-, moderate- and high-intensity exercise regimens in patients with hepatic fat found that the highest exercise intensity program (> 250 min per week) led to a significant reduction in hepatic fat. While exercise alone improves hepatic steatosis in patients with NAFLD, it does not improve liver fibrosis. Current guidelines recommend a combination of dietary changes with exercise in the management of NAFLD.

Diet and weight loss are challenging, especially as regards keeping patients motivated. Usually, patients are told by healthcare providers to make lifestyle changes without being given much support. Most of these challenges arise from lack of behavioral knowledge and motivational techniques among healthcare providers. It is imperative that issues dealing with weight loss and dietary lifestyle changes are patient-centered and maintained to achieve the desired effects.

### Change lifestyle modification plan / transtheoretical model in non-alcoholic simple fatty liver disease: a pilot randomized study [^5bb9d52d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive hepatic fat accumulation in the absence of any secondary causes including excessive alcohol consumption, use of steatogenic medication, viral infection, or hereditary disorders. NAFLD is progressive and has a wide spectrum of histological characteristics from steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by inflammation and fibrosis. Once NASH has developed, progressive fibrosis may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Non-alcoholic simple fatty liver disease is the mildest disease state of hepatocyte steatosis in the course of pathological development of NAFLD. Once simple fatty liver disease develops to the stage of fatty liver hepatitis, the related death rate could reach 11.77 cases in every 1,000 people each year. At the simple fatty liver disease stage, appropriate nursing interventions, combined with diet and exercise instruction, psychological care, and health education are of great significance to the progression and treatment of NAFLD. Such early intervention in the simple fatty liver disease stage is essential to prevent its further development into fatty liver hepatitis, cirrhosis and even liver cancer. However, most patients and some clinicians do not have sufficient awareness of the dangers of the disease.

Epidemiological surveys have shown that NAFLD patients have very low compliance with almost all types of physical activities recommended by the guidelines. Therefore, it is difficult to promote and maintain patients' behavior changes. The Transtheoretical Model and Stages of Change was proposed by the American psychologist Prochaska. It focuses on the subject's psychological needs and the process of behavior change, and believes that behavior change is a phased, spiral, and gradual development process. Individualized interventions are given according to the patient's behavior transition stage to ensure that the patient's self-management ability is spirally increased and maintained. A transtheoretical model-oriented lifestyle modification plan awakens the patient's consciousness in the pre-intention stage, enables the patient to have a clear understanding of their own disease, thereby generating emotions for positive changes. The core of its behavioral intervention is the change of philosophy, which is consistent with the processes of "concept-behavior" and "passive-active", thereby enhancing patients' health beliefs.

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of management on a lifestyle modification plan for patients with simple fatty liver disease based on the transtheoretical model promoted behavior change and related physiological and biochemical indicators during 12 months follow-up.

Exercise in NAFLD — Exercise, independent of weight loss, has hepatic and cardiometabolic benefit and should be routinely recommended and tailored to patient preferences and physical abilities; some studies demonstrate that regular moderate exercise at least 5 times per week for a total of 150 minutes per week or an increase in activity level by more than 60 minutes per week can prevent or improve NAFLD.

### The role of lifestyle changes in the management of chronic liver disease [^6cda86ab]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The prevalence of obesity worldwide has dramatically increased during the last three decades. With obesity comes a variety of adverse health outcomes which are grouped under the umbrella of metabolic syndrome. The liver in particular seems to be significantly impacted by fat deposition in the presence of obesity. In this article we discuss several liver conditions which are directly affected by overweight and obese status, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic infection with hepatitis C virus and post-liver transplant status. The deleterious effects of obesity on liver disease and overall health can be significantly impacted by a culture that fosters sustained nutritional improvement and regular physical activity. Here we summarize the current evidence supporting non-pharmacological, lifestyle interventions that lead to weight reduction, improved physical activity and better nutrition as part of the management and treatment of these liver conditions.

The current approach to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis treatment

Nonpharmacological options

Currently, lifestyle modification is the first-line recommendation for treatment of NASH. In this context, lifestyle modification should lead to sustained weight loss. Although diet and exercise can lead to weight loss, less than 15% of patients can maintain the weight loss in the long run. Furthermore, a small amount of weight loss (3–5%) can lead to improvement of hepatic steatosis. On the other hand, 7–10% weight loss is required to see improvement of necroinflammation and fibrosis in NASH. Additionally, exercise may also play a beneficial role. It was recently shown that either aerobic or resistance exercise, in moderate intensity, 3–4 times a week, 20–40 min per session is ideal for fat mobilization from the liver. It should be noted that increased physical activity should be accompanied by a healthier diet in order to achieve the desired goals. As noted previously, the sustainability of weight loss through lifestyle modification is quite limited.

The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes

Weight loss and cardiovascular risk reduction are critical components of the management of patients with both NAFLD and T2DM. There is robust evidence to demonstrate the cardiovascular benefit of specific classes of glucose lowering agents, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). In addition, both classes of agent promote weight loss and may have a beneficial impact on the liver. In line with published guidance, we would advocate a low threshold for the preferential use of agents that lower weight and reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with NAFLD to treat their diabetes. Accordingly, in people with NAFLD and type 2 diabetes, treatment with glucose lowering agents that promote weight loss and reduce cardiovascular risk should be considered (recommendation 30, Table 1).

Service considerations

Research and clinical trials

Patients with NAFLD should be considered for research studies and offered the opportunity to participate in clinical trials where available (Recommendation 31, Table 1). It is recognised in other disease areas that increased participation in research is associated with improved clinical outcomes for patients. NAFLD is a relatively recently described entity with substantial unmet need in terms of understanding of its natural history, diagnostic tests, and treatment to prevent disease progression. These needs can only be addressed through the engagement of people with NAFLD with research. Where research studies are available, these should be offered to appropriate patients to consider participation.

Multidisciplinary care for people with NAFLD

Given the strong relationship between NAFLD and the metabolic syndrome, patients with fatty liver frequently have associated metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidity and a holistic approach to their management is advised. Comprehensive management of NAFLD requires expertise in clinical hepatology for the diagnosis, staging of NAFLD and management of hepatic comorbidity. Diabetes is often present in advanced NAFLD and this, with optimisation of cardio-metabolic risk factors requires relevant expertise. Lifestyle intervention and health promotion are required to assist sustainable health improvement. International guidelines highlight the multi-disciplinary nature of interventions in NAFLD, and the feasibility and utility of a multi-disciplinary clinic has been demonstrated. Therefore, management of patients with advanced NAFLD in secondary care should be by multidisciplinary teams with expertise in clinical hepatology, management of diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors, lifestyle intervention and health promotion (diet and exercise/physical activity) (Recommendation 32, Table 1).

### The diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^fa151b59]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Pediatric NAFLD lifestyle modification — In an open-label study in 84 Italian children with biopsy-proven NAFLD, > 20% body weight reduction over 12 months resulted in improvement in serum ALT and steatosis by ultrasonography in most children; 94% of the 70 enrolled subjects achieved this weight loss goal, but because liver biopsies were not performed at the end of the study, the effect on liver histology could not be determined. In another study, 53 children with biopsy-proven NAFLD were randomized to lifestyle modification plus antioxidant therapy or lifestyle modification and placebo; antioxidant therapy did not improve liver histology, while children in both groups who had already reduced their weight showed significant improvement in steatosis, inflammation, ballooning, and the NAS. In a separate study of 51 children with severe obesity (BMI z-score > 3.5) and NAFLD, intensive lifestyle modification offered sustained biochemical benefits in comparison to usual care. No information exists on recommending any particular type of diet or exercise.

### Clinical care pathway for the risk stratification and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^84aad53a]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) at indeterminate risk of advanced fibrosis — definition and care — includes risk thresholds, further evaluation, lifestyle, and therapeutic options. An estimated 30%–40% of patients screened based on Steps 1–4 will have an indeterminate risk defined as an FIB-4 score between ≥ 1.3 and 2.67 and/or an LSM between 8.0 and 12.0 kPa on transient elastography among those unable or unwilling to obtain a liver biopsy. We also recommend further workup and efforts to confirm the stage of hepatic fibrosis, and in some cases proprietary plasma biomarker tests for fibrosis staging or additional imaging-based fibrosis measurement (ie, magnetic resonance elastography) may be used to guide patient care. As with both low- and high-risk patients, lifestyle modification is key to successful long-term management, with weight loss recommended if patients are overweight or obese, and we recommend that clinicians educate patients on improving lifestyle habits and deciding on the need for structured weight-loss programs, anti-obesity medications, or bariatric surgery. Diabetes medications with RCT-proven efficacy on liver histology in NASH (ie, pioglitazone or GLP-1RAs) should be preferred for diabetes care, and in patients without diabetes, we recommend the patient and physician should choose the best management strategy. Vitamin E improves steatohepatitis in patients with NASH without diabetes, and RCTs involving pioglitazone, liraglutide, and semaglutide have reported histologic improvement in patients with NASH without diabetes. A liver biopsy is currently the only reliable means to diagnose NASH and is the reference standard for fibrosis staging, although it may not be feasible to obtain in a significant number of patients.

### The diagnosis and management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guideline by the American Gastroenterological Association, American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, and American College of Gastroenterology [^a19bbee2]. Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) — lifestyle modification may reduce aminotransferases and improve hepatic steatosis measured by ultrasound or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and spectroscopy, with studies reporting a significant reduction in liver fat by an average of ∼40% (ranging from 20% to 81%) and generally requiring a body weight loss between ∼5 to 10%. Exercise without dietary modification was investigated in four MR spectroscopy studies in which programs consisted of 2–3 sessions a week of 30–60 minutes over a period of 6 to 12 weeks, and in all but one study liver fat content diminished without a significant change in body weight. Weight loss generally reduces hepatic steatosis, achieved either by hypocaloric diet alone or in conjunction with increased physical activity. (Strength – 1, Evidence – A) Loss of at least 3–5% of body weight appears necessary to improve steatosis, but a greater weight loss (up to 10%) may be needed to improve necroinflammation. (Strength – 1, Evidence – B) Exercise alone in adults with NAFLD may reduce hepatic steatosis but its ability to improve other aspects of liver histology remains unknown. (Strength – 1, Evidence – B)

Lifestyle modifications

Diet and/or exercise: Despite adequate evidence supporting the effect of weight loss (achieved either by diet or exercise) in decreasing the hepatic triglyceride content of patients with NAFLD, there are few data on the role of such interventions for the management of NASH. Weight loss of 5–10% from baseline has repeatedly been shown to decrease hepatic steatosis by approximately 50% but its effect on inflammation or fibrosis has not been adequately studied. In addition, it is not known which dietary intervention or type of exercise is more beneficial for patients with NASH. The majority of clinical trials in this area are characterized by small sample size, short duration and variable outcomes, the majority of which (e.g. transaminases, steatosis on imaging) are not predictive of liver disease progression. The highlights of these studies are discussed below.

### The role of lifestyle changes in the management of chronic liver disease [^2d6c735c]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Individuals with chronic liver disease have lower QOL than the general population, with and without associated chronic illness. A decline in physical health is particularly apparent. When these conditions are present in patients who are also overweight or obese, QOL declines even further, along with an increased risk of other potential medical and hepatic complications. As we have discussed in detail in this review, lifestyle interventions including healthy eating, exercise and controlled weight loss have been shown to improve liver damage related to hepatic steatosis and other complications of obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle changes should be an important adjuvant to medical therapies for patients with HCV infection, liver transplant status, and NAFLD as well as other chronic hepatic conditions. Interventions related to diet and exercises are also our best first-line therapy for patients with hepatic steatosis related to underlying obesity. Future research should focus on identifying modifiable factors that affect QOL and can be targeted for improvement. The independent inverse relationship between chronic liver disease and physical health merits further evaluation. The association between these entities warrants additional attention as these patients will increasingly be co-managed by internists, endocrinologists, and hepatologists.

### AGA clinical practice update on lifestyle modification using diet and exercise to achieve weight loss in the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: expert review [^ad771eca]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Alcohol use in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is quantified and guidance is provided. 9–20 g of daily general alcohol use or 0–9 g of daily nonwine alcohol use doubled the risk for adverse liver-related outcomes compared with lifetime abstainers. Only among never smokers was alcohol use (up to 49 g daily) associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular events and death. Therefore, adults with NAFLD should restrict alcohol consumption to reduce liver-related events and smokers (current or prior) should avoid alcohol entirely.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and associated dietary and lifestyle risk factors [^169b9db7]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2018). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as the most common chronic liver disease worldwide with a reported prevalence ranging 20–30% depending on the studied populations. The high prevalence of NAFLD is probably due to the contemporary epidemics of obesity, unhealthy dietary pattern, and sedentary lifestyle. NAFLD patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular and liver related mortality. The cornerstone of any treatment regimen for patients with NAFLD is lifestyle modification focused on weight loss, exercise, and improving insulin sensitivity. The purpose of this review is to outline the effect of diet and lifestyle factors on developing NAFLD.

### Management of cardiometabolic complications in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a review of the literature with recommendations [^e6363aab]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) comprises a spectrum of liver conditions characterized by significant lipid deposition within hepatocytes. As an overarching diagnosis, NAFLD contains a continuum of progressive liver diseases ranging from isolated liver steatosis to necroinflammatory states leading to end-stage liver disease. Nonalcoholic fatty liver and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis are distinguished by their histologic patterns, with the former exhibiting steatosis without fibrosis or inflammation. This important distinction provides clinicians a timeline within the NAFLD staging to target appropriate interventions against modifiable risk factors. NAFLD is likely formed in response to metabolic imbalances that damage the livers adaptive capacity. Metabolic conditions leading to steatosis mirror common cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Acknowledging the common risk factors for development and progression of NAFLD, it is unsurprising the first-line management focuses on the treatment of metabolic syndrome with an emphasis on weight reduction in obese populations. The purpose of this review is to provide a detailed summary of the literature as well as outline the current treatment recommendations for patients with NAFLD with a detailed focus on pharmacologic antiobesity interventions.

### Effects of mediterranean diet, exercise, and their combination on body composition and liver outcomes in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^e63dd0d5]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Its prevalence in the adult population ranges from 32% to 37%, with even higher rates in individuals with obesity (up to 75%) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) (56%). As metabolic diseases continue to become more widespread, the prevalence of MASLD is expected to rise at an alarming rate. Previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), MASLD is a complex and heterogeneous condition characterized by abnormal hepatic fat accumulation unrelated to alcohol consumption or specific liver toxins. The clinical spectrum of MASLD is broad, encompassing simple steatosis and progressing to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which may lead to fibrosis and, ultimately, hepatocellular carcinoma.

Various pharmacological and nutraceutical interventions have been explored; however, their application in clinical settings remains constrained due to concerns about their efficacy, the limited number of high-quality research, and potential side effects. In view of this and given that MASLD is highly prevalent in overweight/obesity patients, and it is associated with cardiometabolic risk, there is growing interest in lifestyle interventions to address steatotic liver disorders. Moreover, interventions in diet and physical activity are considered to be the cornerstone of management in the whole MASLD spectrum. Current guidelines recommend weight loss through dietary modifications, increased physical activity, or both combined in MASLD patients. Evidence suggests that achieving a 7–10% reduction in body weight through a low-fat, hypocaloric diet combined with regular exercise can effectively resolve steatosis, reduce inflammation, and regress fibrosis in MASLD. However, there is no consensus on the most effective lifestyle strategy.

### Effect of weight loss on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^86f96e5c]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most common causes of liver disease worldwide and has grown proportionately with the rise in obesity. The prevalence of NAFLD is now thought to be around 20% to 40% of the entire population in industrialized Western countries. Insulin resistance, a product of obesity, is central to the pathogenesis of NAFLD, and is improved with weight loss, making this modality the primary goal of therapy. A combination of dietary modifications and increased physical activity, although hard to maintain, is thought to have significant long-term benefits, although further study is required to determine the best and most effective approaches to lifestyle modification. Alternatively, for those individuals who are unable to lose weight despite aggressive efforts, bariatric surgery, which has been shown rather convincingly to improve underlying fatty liver disease, may offer a solution. This review discusses dietary modification, exercise, weight loss pharmacotherapy, and surgical intervention as potential options for patients with NAFLD.

NAFLD — Disease modifying interventions emphasize diet, physical activity, and selective use of bariatric surgery. Overweight or obese patients should be prescribed a diet leading to a caloric deficit, with preference for diets limited in carbohydrates and saturated fat and enriched with high fiber and unsaturated fats such as a Mediterranean diet due to cardiovascular benefits. Patients should be strongly encouraged to increase activity, with prescriptive exercise potentially improving compliance and benefiting independent of weight loss. Bariatric surgery should be considered for eligible patients as it effectively resolves NAFLD or NASH in most patients without cirrhosis and reduces mortality from cardiovascular disease and malignancy.

### Effects of mediterranean diet, exercise, and their combination on body composition and liver outcomes in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^da9be0b0]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings provide insights into the potential benefits of lifestyle interventions, specifically the MD and aerobic exercise, for the management of MASLD. The observed improvements in body weight, BMI, waist circumference, and ALT levels suggest that these interventions may offer clinically meaningful benefits in reducing hepatic fat content and inflammation. Given the rising global prevalence of MASLD, these lifestyles strategies represent accessible and effective non-pharmacological options for disease management. However, further research is needed to optimize intervention protocols, including the type, intensity, and duration of dietary and exercise regimens. Long-term studies are crucial to assess the sustainability of these interventions and their impact on liver histology and other clinical outcomes. As the evidence base expands, lifestyle interventions are expected to play an increasingly central role in the management of MASLD, offering a promising avenue for improving liver health and reducing the risk of progression to more severe liver conditions.

Introduction

Obesity has been on the rise since several decades and it is a major contributor to mortality across the globe. Globally, approximately 38% of adults are estimated will be overweight [Body Mass Index (BMI) above 25 kg/m²] by 2030. In parallel, obesity-associated disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), metabolic syndrome, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are increasingly prevalent, as well. NAFLD can be regarded as the liver component of the metabolic syndrome and it is defined as at least 5% of fat deposit in hepatocytes. Driven by insulin resistance, it typically develops in a subset of obese patients. Currently, it is estimated that 25% of the global population has some degree of NAFLD and this number is expected to increase further with the increase of obesity and T2DM. The first stage of the NAFLD disease spectrum, simple steatosis, is generally believed to be rather benign in terms of liver and cardiovascular prognosis. Yet, a subset of patients develop progressive NAFLD stages, that is, inflammation [non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)] and liver fibrosis. These progressive stages are associated with an increase in mortality and morbidity, both directly in regards to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as cardiovascular and overall mortality. – Since NAFLD and its advanced stages are caused by a set of metabolic dysfunctions, metabolic-dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is now suggested as a new definition for the condition. In this review, the term NAFLD is still used.

There are several factors that drive obesity and NAFLD, such as a sedentary lifestyle and overnutrition. Genetic background and the gut microbiome have also been implicated in the development of NAFLD and NASH. Lifestyle has a major role in shaping the metabolic fluxes in key metabolically active organs such as the liver, adipose tissue and muscles. Obesity and NAFLD are, for a large part, lifestyle-induced diseases, and thus, lifestyle modifications have been recommended as a treatment. – The two main elements of lifestyle modification are exercise and nutritional interventions and these both focus on weight management and reduction for patients with NAFLD or obesity. A 5–7% weight reduction is recommended to be achieved by a net calorie restriction of 500–1000 kcal/day through diet modifications alone or by combination of dietary calorie restriction and increased physical activity.

In conclusion, this systematic review highlighted the benefit of nutritional modification in improving dyslipidemia in patients with NAFLD. Moreover, our findings emphasize the gap in identification of optimal diet and potential need for implementing individualized dietary approaches in NAFLD.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have a higher risk of cardiovascular events than the general population
Lifestyle modifications, including nutritional changes, exercise, and weight loss are the cornerstone of NAFLD management
Adherence to the Mediterranean diet might intermediate the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level in patients with NAFLD

What the new findings are:

Nutritional modifications may improve serum triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) in patients with NAFLD
There is more benefit to intermediate TG, TC and LDL from low-calorie standard diet intervention with a shorter than 3 months follow up, especially in young and obese patients
Our findings emphasize the gap in the identification of optimal diet and the potential need for implementing individualized dietary approaches in patients with NAFLD

Lifestyle and behavioral support for NAFLD — Reducing caloric intake can also be associated with counterproductive reductions in metabolic energy disposal. Psychological barriers can impede the implementation of a successful dietary and exercise plan; therefore, engagement with a health psychologist can be an invaluable tool for selected patients. A multidisciplinary approach, inclusive of patient support systems and family engagement, with behavioral medicine specialists, dieticians, and/or nutritionists, can optimize success.

### 2024 UPDATE: the Brazilian diabetes society position on the management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in people with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes [^7751296e]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common liver disease affecting 30% of the world's population and is often associated with metabolic disorders such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and cardiovascular disease. This review is an update of the Brazilian Diabetes Society (Sociedade Brasileira de Diabetes [SBD]) evidence-based guideline for the management of MASLD in clinical practice.

Methods

The methodology was published previously and was defined by the internal institutional steering committee. The SBD Metabolic Syndrome and Prediabetes Department drafted the manuscript, selecting key clinical questions for a narrative review using MEDLINE via PubMed with the MeSH terms [diabetes] and [fatty liver]. The best available evidence was reviewed, including randomized clinical trials (RCTs), meta-analyses, and high-quality observational studies related to MASLD.

Results and Conclusions

The SBD Metabolic Syndrome and Prediabetes Department formulated 9 recommendations for the management of MASLD in people with prediabetes or T2D. Screening for the risk of advanced fibrosis associated with MASLD is recommended in all adults with prediabetes or T2D. Lifestyle modification (LSM) focusing on a reduction in body weight of at least 5% is recommended as the first choice for these patients. In situations where LSMs are insufficient to achieve weight loss, the use of anti-obesity medications is recommended for those with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 27 kg/m². Pioglitazone and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) monotherapy are the first-line pharmacological treatments for steatohepatitis in people with T2D, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may be considered in this context. The combination of these agents may be considered in the treatment of steatohepatitis and/or fibrosis, and bariatric surgery should be considered in patients with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², in which the combination of LSM and pharmacotherapy has not been shown to be effective in improving MASLD.

### Change lifestyle modification plan / transtheoretical model in non-alcoholic simple fatty liver disease: a pilot randomized study [^ce4ff517]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

To sum up, the implementation of the transtheoretical model-oriented lifestyle modification and intervention for simple fatty liver disease patients can significantly improve their health belief and behavior, leading to improvements in blood lipids and decreased BMI and waist circumference. These health improvements are likely to prevent NAFLD progression or improve liver function by decreasing liver steatosis.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease and the most common liver condition worldwide. It is mainly related to an unhealthy diet, inactivity, and overweight. NAFLD prevalence is on the increase, and it is a significant public health concern. It is estimated that 20–30% of the adult population of the world and Iran suffers from this condition, and it is more prevalent among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and severe obesity. NALFD includes a spectrum of liver pathologies from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is essential to treat and manage NAFLD because excessive liver fat is an independent risk factor in developing other conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, making NAFLD a significant health problem worldwide. Moreover, it is expected that, by 2030, NAFLD will be the leading cause of liver disease-related death, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, none of which has a definitive treatment. The progression of NAFLD not only imposes a clinical burden on patients but also affects their survival rate and quality of life. It is estimated that annually, 10,000 Iranians suffer from liver failure, and 5000 of them lose their lives. Despite the large number of studies being conducted to treat NAFLD, there is an absence of practical advice to develop services and provide suitable care for this disease. Besides that, until now, no confirmed medication has been introduced to treat this disease. Changes in diet, more physical activity and exercise to lose weight, and lifestyle modification have been the principal therapeutic and management recommendations for this condition. In clinical practice, patients with NASH and NAFLD manage this condition by making and sustaining the necessary lifestyle changes. Studies have demonstrated that lifestyle interventions have a significant clinical impact on reducing liver fat and inflammation in patients with NAFLD. Liver inflammation and fibrosis can be improved or reversed with weight loss of 7–10%.

Lifestyle factors

Diet, weight loss and physical activity are the cornerstone of every treatment for NAFLD and are recommended by both the American and European associations for the study of the liver. Reducing calorie intake by at least 500–1000 kcal has been shown to reduce hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Energy restriction and exclusion of NAFLD‐promoting components (i.e. processed food, products high in added fructose) are recommended by the EASL‐NAFLD guidelines and generally speaking a "Mediterranean diet" should be recommended to all NAFLD patients.

Dieting ultimately leads to weight loss and weight loss per se has been a major link to achieving improvements in liver histology and even resolution of NASH or fibrosis. In a 12‐month lifestyle intervention program in patients with type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis and incident NAFLD was significantly reduced. Most importantly, a study including 261 NAFLD patients with paired liver biopsies before and after lifestyle changes aiming at inducing weight loss found that a greater extent of weight loss is associated with improvement in histologic features of NASH with the highest rates of NAS reduction (100%), NASH resolution (90%) and fibrosis regression (45%) occurring in those patients with at least ≥ 10% of weight lost. Nevertheless, it needs to be noted that only 30% of all subjects have lost at least ≥ 5% of their weight at week 52 (end of the study) — and this very much represents the real‐life issue of a few patients achieving weight‐loss targets. Finally, a large systemic review and meta‐analysis have shown that weight loss (≥ 7%) generally is safe and improves liver histology and cardiometabolic profile in NAFLD patients.

Regarding physical activity, current guidelines recommend 150–200 min/week of moderate‐intensity aerobic physical activities in three to five sessions. Importantly, it needs to be emphasized that also in patients with advanced chronic liver disease (i.e. cirrhosis) mild‐to‐moderate exercise is safe, reduces the degree of portal hypertension and was not associated with an increased risk for variceal bleeding or other hepatic decompensation. Most recently, a study investigating an intervention consisting of a hypocaloric diet and 60 min/week supervised physical activity in compensated cirrhosis with portal hypertension and a BMI > 26 showed a significant decrease in the degree of portal hypertension after 16 weeks of intervention, with a weight‐loss of > 10% being associated with an even greater decrease in portal pressure. Of note, no episode of clinical decompensation occurred during the intervention.

### Weight loss for patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease… [^7014befb]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Is weight loss an effective treatment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Evidence-Based Answer There are insufficient high-quality studies to determine patient-oriented outcomes of weight loss for the treatment of fatty liver disease. Nonetheless, weight loss remains a reasonable goal because it may reduce liver inflammation and improve comorbidities. In two of the studies reviewed, liver enzyme levels were essentially halved in patients who lost weight with lifestyle changes. Weight loss currently has the most supporting evidence for improving liver enzyme levels, compared with other therapies. 1, 4 This Cochrane review analyzed seven randomized trials that investigated weight loss as a treatment for fatty liver disease. One study examined children; the other studies focused on adults.

The intensity of lifestyle changes in the intervention groups and counseling in the placebo groups differed among studies. All but one trial were judged to be at high risk of bias, and comparisons were hindered by different end points. Only one trial reported histologic changes. Statistically significant reductions in alanine transaminase levels were seen in the treatment arms of two of the four lifestyle intervention trials that measured liver enzyme levels. In these trials, lifestyle changes were associated with reductions in ALT levels, as well as appreciable weight loss.

Consensus guidelines on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease have been published in the Journal of Digestive Diseases and by the American Gastroenterological Association. 4, 6 The AGA recommends that the initial target weight loss be 10 percent of baseline weight at a rate of 1 to 2 lb per week. An algorithm for the workup of mildly elevated liver enzyme levels can be found at https: //www. aafp. org/afp/2005/0315/p1105. html#afp20050315p1105-f1.

### The impact of dietary patterns and nutrition in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^3f5a6524]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. The prevalence of NAFLD has grown proportionally with the rise in obesity, sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy dietary patterns, and metabolic syndrome. Currently, in the absence of approved pharmacologic treatment, the keystone of treatment is lifestyle modification focused on achieving a weight loss of 7%-10%, cardiovascular exercise, and improving insulin sensitivity. The primary aim of this review is to outline the effect of different dietetic approaches against NAFLD and highlight the important micronutrient components in the management of NAFLD.

### A fad too far? Dietary strategies for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD [^fac44b07]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major health problem, and its prevalence has increased in recent years, concurrent with rising rates of obesity and other metabolic diseases. Currently, there are no FDA-approved pharmacological therapies for NAFLD, and lifestyle interventions, including weight loss and exercise, remain the cornerstones for treatment. Manipulating diet composition and eating patterns may be a sustainable approach to NAFLD treatment. Dietary strategies including Paleolithic, ketogenic, Mediterranean, high-protein, plant-based, low-carbohydrate, and intermittent fasting diets have become increasingly popular because of their purported benefits on metabolic disease. This review highlights what is currently known about these popular dietary approaches in the management of NAFLD in clinical populations with mechanistic insight from animal studies. It also identifies key knowledge gaps to better inform future preclinical and clinical studies aimed at the treatment of NAFLD.
