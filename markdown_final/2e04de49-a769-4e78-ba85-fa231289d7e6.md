## Question

What is the recommended process for discharging a patient with a malignant effusion?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a discharge plan for patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the target population and the guideline foundation. Then, I should define the core discharge actions including community nursing referral and its scope. Next, I will review drainage frequency protocols and how to individualize them with patient preferences. After that, I need to cover patient and caregiver education. I will then establish escalation criteria and follow-up pathways. Finally, I should individualize recommendations by performance status and support systems, and coordinate with oncology and palliative care to ensure holistic management [^1121QxK2] [^1152cwcA] [^111q4f6C].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context to avoid drifting from the evidence. We are dealing with symptomatic MPE in patients discharged with an IPC for ongoing ambulatory drainage, a strategy endorsed as a first-line definitive option alongside talc pleurodesis in appropriately selected patients, particularly when non-expandable lung is present or pleurodesis has failed or is unsuitable [^114spNKD] [^1152cwcA] [^116Tg58S]. Hold on, I should verify that the general principles align across societies; yes, contemporary guidelines emphasize definitive palliation with IPCs or talc over repeated thoracenteses, guided by patient factors and preferences, which frames the discharge planning that follows [^1152cwcA] [^1121QxK2] [^111q4f6C].

> Next, I should review the core discharge requirement to ensure continuity of care. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) 2023 guideline explicitly recommends referral to the community nursing team upon discharge for patients with IPCs, and this should be initiated before or at discharge to prevent gaps in wound assessment, drainage support, and symptom control [^111JT1bK]. Wait, let me verify the timing; the guidance is clear that this referral is part of discharge planning, not a delayed outpatient arrangement, which is critical for early post-procedural stabilization at home [^111JT1bK].

> I will now examine the scope of community nursing to be specified in the referral so we do not overlook key safety elements. The BTC 2023 guidance lists early wound site assessment, symptom control, support with IPC drainage, and timely suture removal as responsibilities, with escalation to pleural or palliative teams as needed for symptom burden or complications [^111JT1bK] [^115McX1r]. I need to ensure infection risk and technique are addressed; IPC-related infections occur in a minority of patients and generally respond to antibiotics without catheter removal when managed promptly, which underscores the need for sterile technique reinforcement and early review of any erythema, discharge, fever, or pain at the site [^115P1A8E] [^114JHSEp].

> Now, drainage frequency: I should double-check the recommendation strength and how to present patient choice. BTS 2023 recommends daily IPC drainage to maximize pleurodesis rates and expedite catheter removal, and this is supported by randomized data from the ASAP trial showing higher autopleurodesis with daily versus every-other-day drainage, without excess adverse events [^116Ff15x] [^11567Cb5]. But wait, patient-centered care matters; the optimal frequency should ultimately reflect patient preferences after discussing trade-offs in convenience, clinic supply needs, and the likelihood of earlier catheter removal, which BTS also highlights along with real-world data that about half of patients can achieve autopleurodesis by three months with daily drainage [^112UrKC7] [^112oygLZ] [^111ng8mq].

> Patient and caregiver education must be explicit; let me think about the essentials to reduce complications at home. Training should cover sterile drainage technique, dressing changes, valve handling, safe disposal, and a clear log of drainage volumes and characteristics, with instructions to report reduced output with dyspnea, increased pain, fever, cloudy fluid, or blood in the effusion promptly; this aligns with best practice guidance for ambulatory IPC care and infection mitigation [^111q4f6C] [^115P1A8E]. Hold on, I should verify activity guidance; avoiding traction or kinking of the catheter and securing the line appropriately should be reinforced to prevent malfunction or dislodgment [^111q4f6C].

> Next, I should review escalation criteria and follow-up to prevent delayed recognition of complications. Patients should have 24/7 contact details and explicit triggers for urgent reassessment by the primary pleural team, including infection refractory to community measures, suspected drain fracture or valve malfunction, non-draining catheter with persistent breathlessness suggesting blockage or loculation, and any life-threatening symptoms; formal follow-up should reassess drainage efficacy, performance status, and whether pleurodesis criteria are met to consider IPC removal when appropriate [^112Z7V2B] [^112oygLZ]. I need to check infection management specifics; guidelines suggest treating IPC-associated infections with antibiotics while attempting to retain the catheter, reserving removal for nonresponders, which should be stated in the plan [^114JHSEp].

> I should now individualize the plan by performance status, lung expandability, home supports, and comorbidities. For severe impairment (ECOG 3–4), IPCs are favored to minimize hospitalization and procedural burden, provided adequate home support exists; where supports are limited, augmenting community nursing participation is essential to maintain safe drainage at home [^113mUmqa] [^115P1A8E]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pleurodesis candidacy; in non-expandable lung, BTS and ATS favor IPC over talc pleurodesis, with pleural aspiration used initially to assess symptomatic response, whereas in likely expandable lung, either IPC, talc pleurodesis, or combined approaches can be discussed with shared decision-making based on patient goals and logistics [^116Tg58S] [^113nJ4qm] [^1152cwcA]. I need to ensure we account for practical contraindications; anticoagulation, extensive malignant skin involvement at the site, or cognitive impairment may complicate IPC placement or care and should prompt tailored precautions or alternative strategies where needed [^111CLoca] [^114QgbD3].

> Coordination with oncology and palliative care should be explicit in the discharge summary; let me verify that IPCs do not preclude systemic therapy. Systemic anticancer therapy should not be delayed for pleural interventions, and concurrent chemotherapy with IPCs is generally safe without increased infection risk, while early palliative care input optimizes symptom control and advance care planning in a condition with median survival typically ranging from 3 to 12 months depending on tumor type and prognostic indices [^114qS4wE] [^115McX1r] [^114oc9Nw]. But wait, I should confirm that pleural management aims remain palliative and patient-centered; all sources converge on symptom relief, reducing procedures, and minimizing admissions as core goals, which should be reflected in the counseling at discharge [^111q4f6C].

> Troubleshooting non-draining or septated effusions needs a clear pathway; hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought BTS had no specific recommendation for loculated MPE management, but let me verify that carefully. In fact, BTS 2023 advises considering intrapleural fibrinolytics via IPC when flushing with normal or heparinized saline fails to improve drainage, which aligns with broader guidance that fibrinolytics can be an option in selected septated cases, reserving surgery for highly selected patients with good prognosis and performance status [^1139cUvg] [^114EuZTg] [^111aZP8k]. I should double-check that this is framed as a step-up approach after simple measures fail; yes, saline flushes precede fibrinolytics, and all such decisions should be communicated to the pleural team promptly at signs of catheter blockage or symptomatic loculation [^1139cUvg] [^112Z7V2B].

> To summarize the discharge approach I need to ensure nothing critical is missed. Discharge with an IPC should include a same-day referral to community nursing with explicit responsibilities (wound assessment, symptom control, drainage support, suture removal), a daily drainage protocol unless patient choice dictates otherwise after informed discussion, clear education on sterile technique and red flags, a 24/7 contact and stepwise escalation plan back to the pleural team, individualized adjustments for performance status and supports, and proactive coordination with oncology and palliative care; these steps collectively support safe home transition, symptom relief, and timely autopleurodesis where feasible [^111JT1bK] [^116Ff15x] [^112UrKC7] [^112Z7V2B] [^115McX1r] [^11567Cb5].

Discharge planning for malignant effusion centers on **symptom control** and **patient preference** [^114QgbD3]. For expandable lung, offer talc pleurodesis or an **indwelling pleural catheter (IPC)** [^1121QxK2]; for non-expandable lung, **IPC is preferred** [^114spNKD]. Provide clear **home care instructions**, arrange community nursing for IPC support [^111JT1bK], and ensure **early follow-up** with the pleural team [^112Z7V2B]. Educate on signs of infection, blockage, or rapid reaccumulation, and give a 24-hour contact [^114JHSEp]. Coordinate with oncology and palliative care [^115McX1r], and document the plan and patient understanding [^1112o75r].

---

## Pre-discharge clinical assessment

- **Confirm diagnosis and symptom burden**: Ensure malignant effusion is confirmed and symptoms are controlled [^1125RV2Z].

- **Assess lung expandability**: Use imaging or pleural manometry to guide intervention choice [^1118BRxy].

- **Evaluate performance status**: Use ECOG to tailor interventions and follow-up [^113mUmqa].

---

## Definitive interventions prior to discharge

- **Expandable lung**: Talc pleurodesis or IPC [^1152cwcA] based on patient preference and clinical factors [^1121QxK2].

- **Non-expandable lung**: IPC is preferred [^114spNKD]; consider pleural aspiration first to assess response [^113nJ4qm].

- **Loculated effusions**: Consider intrapleural fibrinolytics [^114EuZTg] if IPC drainage is inadequate [^1139cUvg].

---

## Patient and caregiver education

Patient and caregiver education should include **IPC care** (aseptic technique, appropriate drainage frequency [^112UrKC7], and basic troubleshooting) [^115Egzdx]. It should also cover **symptom monitoring** for signs of infection, blockage, or rapid reaccumulation, and include an emergency plan with a 24-hour contact for urgent issues [^114JHSEp].

---

## Home care and community support

Arrange **community nursing** for early assessment, wound care, symptom control, and IPC support [^111JT1bK], and coordinate **palliative care** for ongoing symptom management and support [^115McX1r] [^112oygLZ].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Schedule **early follow-up** with the pleural team to assess symptom control and complications [^112Z7V2B], and maintain **regular monitoring** to track symptom control, IPC function, and complications [^116Ff15x].

---

## Documentation and communication

The **discharge summary** should record diagnosis, interventions, home care, and follow-up, and ensure **multidisciplinary communication** with oncology, palliative care, and community teams [^1112o75r].

---

## Special considerations

- **Non-expandable lung**: IPC preferred [^114spNKD]; avoid pleurodesis [^116Tg58S].

- **Loculated effusions**: Consider fibrinolytics if drainage is inadequate [^1139cUvg] [^111aZP8k].

- **Poor performance status**: Prioritize symptom control and palliative care [^114z2neK].

---

Discharge planning for malignant effusion should be **individualized**, emphasizing symptom control, patient preference, and coordinated care [^111q4f6C].

Some patients prefer IPCs over talc pleurodesis because of reduced hospital visits, fewer pleural interventions, and flexible at-home drainage. In contrast, talc pleurodesis may suit patients who prioritize a shorter, intensive regimen or pursue pleurodesis as an important treatment goal. IPC drainage frequency can be symptom-guided or fixed and adapted depending on the treatment goal. The ASAP, AMPLE2, and OPTIMUM trials demonstrated that daily drainage schedules are tolerated by many patients and enhance pleurodesis rates compared with symptom-guided or every-other-day drainage.

There is alternatively the middle-ground option of combined IPC-talc pleurodesis treatment via instillation of talc slurry through the IPC. Combined approaches may maximize the advantages of both treatments, thereby minimizing the time required to achieve pleurodesis. Another major driver of treatment choice is the potential effect of treatment on QOL. In a randomized controlled trial, in which patients were allowed to choose their preferred management strategy for MPE, those who selected IPCs were significantly more likely to report improvements in QOL than those who chose talc pleurodesis. However, no significant differences in QOL outcomes were found in the large TIME2 and AMPLE randomized controlled trials comparing IPCs and talc pleurodesis. Similar findings were observed in the OPTIMUM trial, with no significant difference reported in self-reported overall QOL after 30 days. However, QOL scores improved significantly in both groups.

The effect of each treatment on QOL varies from patient to patient, which needs to be considered when choosing the appropriate strategy.

Anticancer treatment

Controversy surrounds the effect of chemotherapy on malignant pleural effusion (MPE). Although some oncologists believe that targeted therapies or chemotherapy can resolve MPE, no randomized controlled trials have compared them with treatments such as intrapleural catheters (IPC) and/or talc pleurodesis. Clinical observations and case reports have suggested that chemotherapy may reduce pleural effusion. However, the European Respiratory Society (ERS), Spanish Society of Clinical Pharmacology (SECT), and British Thoracic Society (BTS) all recommend not delaying treatment for MPE until after systemic anticancer treatment. This is due to the lack of strong evidence that systemic anticancer treatments improve MPE, while treatments for MPE are both safe and effective. Studies highlight the need for early pleural intervention regardless of tumor type or intended treatment; therefore, treatment for MPE should be initiated as early as possible.

Some oncologists are concerned that the risk of infection is increased when IPCs are used simultaneously with chemotherapy, whereas others worry about unknown interactions between anticancer treatments and IPCs. However, evidence does not support these concerns. IPCs do not increase the risk of infection in most cases; therefore, chemotherapy should not be withheld from patients with an IPC. Furthermore, the infection rate is similar in patients with or without neutropenia receiving chemotherapy; thus, neutropenia should not contraindicate simultaneous treatment with chemotherapy and IPC. Drugs can cause adverse pulmonary effects, including pulmonary damage or pleural effusion, but these are rare and can be monitored for early identification and management.

Regarding specific circumstances for pleural effusion, more specifically with respect to patients with malignant pleural effusion (intrapleural fibrinolytics), the BTS 2023 guidelines recommend considering administering intrapleural fibrinolytics to patients with malignant pleural effusion and septated effusion who have an indwelling pleural catheter. This approach aims to improve drainage if flushing the indwelling pleural catheter with normal saline or heparin saline does not yield satisfactory results.

In the case of patients with malignant pleural effusion, the 2018 ATS/STR/STS guidelines recommend considering large-volume thoracentesis. This procedure is particularly advised if there is uncertainty about whether the patient's symptoms are related to the effusion or if the lung can expand. The latter consideration is crucial if pleurodesis is contemplated, as it assists in assessing lung expansion.

### The rate of pleural fluid drainage as a criterion for the timing of chest tube removal: theoretical and practical considerations [^113Cwq3Q]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Clinicians place chest tubes approximately 1 million times each year in the United States, but little information is available to guide their management. Specifically, the use of the rate of pleural fluid drainage as a criterion for tube removal is not standardized. In the absence of such tubes, pleural fluid drains primarily through parietal pleural lymphatics at rates approaching 500 mL of fluid per day or more for each hemithorax. Early removal of tubes does not appear to be harmful. A noninferiority randomized trial currently in progress, comparing removal without considering the drainage rate to a conservative threshold (2 mL/kg body weight in 24 hours), may better inform tube management.

### Efficacy and safety of tunneled pleural catheters in adults with malignant pleural effusions: A systematic review [^115wP29N]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

As detailed in Figure 1, the literature search identified 1,011 potentially eligible reports. After review of the title, abstract, or complete manuscript, 986 reports were excluded based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Only two studies, that appeared to meet other criteria, were excluded due to non-English language; the authors of one of these later published their experience in English, and this study is included. Of the remaining 25 eligible reports, 6 were excluded due to overlap with patients reported in other studies.

- **Figure 1: Article selection process**. Abbreviations: WoS, Web of Science; VATS, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery

The 19 included reports (Table 2) were all consecutive case series of patients with MPE who received a TIPC, except one randomized controlled trial of doxycycline pleurodesis versus TIPC; only the group receiving the TIPC is included in this analysis. Three meeting abstracts and one letter were eligible and presented sufficient data to be included in the analysis. Eight studies were conducted outside the United States. All except one study employed the Pleurx® tunneled pleural catheter system, initially manufactured by Denver Biomedical (Golden, Colorado), a company that was acquired by Cardinal Health (Dublin, Ohio) in 2006. The oldest study, published in 1994, used a tube known as the Tenckhoff catheter, which is also a small-bore flexible catheter that was tunneled into the pleural space. One study employed a reusable plastic pump to drain pleural fluid instead of the standard vacuum drainage bottles designed for use with the Pleurx®.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^111q4f6C]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is common in individuals with cancer and typically reflects advanced disease. Most cases are symptomatic, with dyspnea and pain severely affecting the patient's quality of life (QOL). The management of MPE aims to relieve symptoms, improve QOL, prevent repeated pleural interventions, and minimize hospital admissions.

Common treatments for MPE that provide symptomatic relief include thoracentesis, chemical (talc) pleurodesis, or indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs). Talc pleurodesis and IPCs are the mainstay of treatment but represent very different treatment strategies. Talc pleurodesis is an inpatient procedure, whereas IPCs are an ambulatory strategy. Given their similar efficacy, treatment decisions in MPE are often determined by other factors such as the patient's clinical characteristics, individual treatment goals, and preferences for hospital-based or home-based care.

We provide a summary of the evidence for different interventions for treating MPE and compare recommendations from the major American, European, British, and Spanish guidelines regarding when to consider each treatment. We highlight specific challenging treatment scenarios and key clinical considerations that may influence treatment decisions for different patients.

Barriers to accessing and receiving evidence-based care exist. Patients with symptomatic MPE would benefit from early referral from oncology teams to pleural services. We provide best practice recommendations for optimal referral and coordination of care to ensure that patients receive maximum benefit.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^111aZP8k]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Loculated malignant pleural effusion (MPE) involves multiple fluid collections in separate pockets, often requiring a chest tube in each pocket to achieve successful drainage. Loculations can prevent complete drainage of the pleural space and limit lung re-expansion, often contraindicating talc pleurodesis or resulting in insufficient symptomatic relief from indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs). Loculations and septations may coexist, and up to 14% of patients with MPE develop symptomatic loculations. Septated effusions may progress to loculated forms.

- **Treatment recommendations**: The guidelines differ regarding loculated MPE treatment. The ATS recommends IPC over talc pleurodesis because IPC may enable further drainage of fluid, alleviate symptoms, avoid admission, and require fewer subsequent procedures. The guideline also emphasizes the heterogeneity within the loculated effusion group, suggesting that patients with few loculations may still benefit from talc pleurodesis. Minimally invasive decortication may be considered for patients with a good performance status and a low LENT score.

The ERS/EATC and SECT guidelines lack strong recommendations, noting that a nonexpandable lung contraindicates pleurodesis and that IPCs may fail to completely drain the pleural space, limiting symptom improvement. Both guidelines suggest intrapleural fibrinolytics, acknowledging their limited effects on dyspnea or pleurodesis success. The ERS/EATC guideline adds that thoracic surgery may be needed for multiple loculations, particularly near the mediastinum, with limited options for surgically ineligible patients. BTS guidelines provide no specific recommendations.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^113mUmqa]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Spanish guidelines systematically consider the ECOG performance status in treatment decisions. For patients with severe impairment (ECOG 3–4), IPCs are recommended as a first-line option, with or without talc slurry pleurodesis. If IPC placement is not feasible, therapeutic thoracentesis is recommended. For patients with mild to moderate impairment (ECOG 0–2), talc slurry pleurodesis (provided that the lung is expandable) or IPC is recommended as the first-line treatment. If talc slurry pleurodesis fails, IPC is advised instead of repeated pleurodesis. When IPC placement is not feasible, talc poudrage pleurodesis is recommended.

All four guidelines mention that performance status can be helpful in planning treatment. Although Spanish guidelines systematically apply performance status to guide decisions, in other regions it is considered as additional information to assess patient prognosis. Under all four guidelines, if a patient has a very poor performance status and therefore poor prognosis, they will likely not benefit from definitive treatments (chemical pleurodesis, IPC, or surgery) and will be offered best supportive care, including thoracentesis.

- **Shared decision making**: Patient involvement in the decision-making process is crucial to ensure the best treatment option for a particular person. Patients should be provided with clear information in their preferred format (e.g. spoken, written, via a translator, website links) about each treatment so that they can make informed choices based on their own preferences, treatment goals, and the risk-benefit profile of the options available.

### British thoracic society guideline for pleural disease [^114Cr9Kd]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

For patients with malignant pleural effusion, specifically those with a non-expandable lung, the British Thoracic Society 2023 guidelines recommend considering decortication surgery to improve the success of pleurodesis. It is important to discuss the risks and benefits of both indwelling pleural catheter and surgical treatment with the patient and tailor the treatment to individual circumstances, such as the patient's fitness to undergo thoracic surgery.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^111CLoca]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Treatment decisions for malignant pleural effusion hinge on clinical factors, such as nonexpandable lungs. With pleurodesis contraindicated in nonexpandable lung cases, an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) becomes the sole therapeutic option, emphasizing the need for accurate prediction. Pleural manometry aids in predicting whether the lung will expand based on elastance (change in pleural space pressure in cm H₂O/L of fluid removed). Elastance over 14.5 cm H₂O/L suggests a nonexpandable lung, whereas elastance over 19 cm H₂O/L indicates an increased risk of pleurodesis failure. Similarly, thoracic ultrasound is an established noninvasive technique in pleural medicine, and the M-mode measure can assess lung movement. A recent study found that M-mode movement at the lung bases of less than 0.94 cm was indicative of a nonexpandable lung.

Other patient characteristics that can determine treatment choice include extensive malignant skin lesions, which can prevent safe insertion and maintenance of an IPC. Thrombosis treated with anticoagulants may prevent IPC insertion unless anticoagulants are temporarily discontinued to allow IPC installation. Confusion (e.g. due to dementia) can also exclude patients from having IPCs due to the risk of pulling on the catheter. Conversely, the absolute contraindications for talc pleurodesis include empyema, pregnancy, and uncorrectable bleeding. Pleural infection is a relative contraindication, and talc pleurodesis may be performed in rare cases, such as in patients with a short expected survival.

For the management of dyspnea in patients with malignant pleural effusion, the 2018 guidelines from ATS/STR/STS recommend considering either indwelling pleural catheter placement or chemical pleurodesis as the first-line definitive intervention. This applies to patients with suspected or confirmed expandable lung and no prior definitive therapy if the symptoms are attributable to the effusion.

### Malignant pleural effusions: Treatment with tunneled long-term drainage catheters [^114hiA9y]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion is a significant cause of morbidity and a poor prognostic indicator. Traditional treatments have variable success and significant drawbacks, including a lengthy hospital stay. Alternatively, a tunneled pleural catheter permits long-term drainage as an outpatient, cost-effectively controlling the effusion and related symptoms in over 80 to 90% of patients. Advantages include the ability to treat trapped lungs and large locules. Spontaneous pleurodesis may occur in over 40% of patients, and the catheter can be used to administer sclerosant or antineoplastic agents. Complications tend to be minor and easily managed. A tunneled pleural catheter should be considered for all patients with malignant pleural effusion having a reasonable expectancy of being an outpatient.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^112oygLZ]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Installation of an IPC is usually an ambulatory procedure involving the insertion of a tube attached to a one-way valve into the pleural space, allowing fluid to be drained from the pleural cavity as needed. Community nurses and caregivers are typically assigned to undertake regular fluid drainage at the patient's home. Approximately 50% of patients achieve autopleurodesis after three months of treatment with daily drainage using an IPC.

Surgical interventions have similar efficacy to talc pleurodesis but are much more invasive; therefore, surgery is typically reserved for unusual cases in which talc pleurodesis or IPC placement is not possible.

The management of MPE aims to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life (QOL), prevent repeated pleural interventions, and minimize hospital admissions. There are no differences in the mean efficacy between talc pleurodesis and IPCs in reducing breathlessness. In the TIME2 trial, Davies et al. randomly assigned patients to receive IPC or inpatient talc slurry pleurodesis and found no significant difference in the primary outcome of dyspnea scores at six weeks. Similarly, the AMPLE randomized controlled trial found that IPC or talc slurry resulted in sustained improvements in breathlessness and QOL scores, with no difference between the two treatment arms. Furthermore, the OPTIMUM trial found no significant differences in patient-reported global health status (measured by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30) at one month between IPC and talc slurry pleurodesis.

### British Thoracic Society guideline for pleural disease [^116Tg58S]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for pleural effusion, specifically in patients with malignant pleural effusion, the British Thoracic Society 2023 guidelines recommend considering the placement of an indwelling pleural catheter rather than performing talc pleurodesis. This is advised for patients with a radiologically significant (> 25%) non-expandable lung who require intervention for symptomatic malignant pleural effusion.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions. An official ATS/STS/STR clinical practice guideline [^11253BBL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

This guideline, a collaborative effort from the American Thoracic Society, Society of Thoracic Surgeons, and Society of Thoracic Radiology, aims to provide evidence-based recommendations to guide contemporary management of patients with a malignant pleural effusion (MPE).

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel developed seven questions using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes) format. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach and the Evidence to Decision framework were applied to each question. Recommendations were formulated, discussed, and approved by the entire panel.

- **Results**: The panel made weak recommendations in favor of:
1. Using ultrasound to guide pleural interventions.
2. Not performing pleural interventions in asymptomatic patients with MPE.
3. Using either an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) or chemical pleurodesis in symptomatic patients with MPE and suspected expandable lung.
4. Performing large-volume thoracentesis to assess symptomatic response and lung expansion.
5. Using either talc poudrage or talc slurry for chemical pleurodesis.
6. Using IPC instead of chemical pleurodesis in patients with nonexpandable lung or failed pleurodesis.
7. Treating IPC-associated infections with antibiotics and not removing the catheter.

- **Conclusions**: These recommendations, based on the best available evidence, can guide management of patients with MPE and improve patient outcomes.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^113gjwK7]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Low credibility.

The guidance is more nuanced for cases of MPE with known or likely expandable lungs. ATS recommends IPCs or talc (slurry or poudrage) pleurodesis when no previous definitive therapy has been administered. As a second-line treatment for patients with failed pleurodesis, ATS recommends IPCs over talc pleurodesis. Combined treatment with IPCs and talc slurry pleurodesis may also be considered. Patients with good performance status and a low LENT score (a score of 0–1 based on criteria including pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and tumor type), indicative of a relatively good survival prognosis in MPE, may be considered for minimally invasive decortication. Any decision to use IPCs should be based on patient-specific considerations and the support network available for IPC drainage. ERS and EACTS consider both talc pleurodesis (slurry or poudrage) and IPCs to be highly effective but make no recommendations for combined treatment. In the United Kingdom, BTS advises offering patients with known or likely expandable lung a choice between IPCs, talc pleurodesis, or combined treatment as a first-line intervention. The guideline explicitly states that relative risks and benefits should be discussed with patients to choose an optimal treatment strategy, taking into account inpatient versus ambulatory management and the need for further interventions. Patients preferring inpatient strategies are offered talc pleurodesis, whereas those favoring…

For patients with malignant pleural effusion, particularly regarding pleurodesis, the BTS 2023 guidelines recommend administering talc via an indwelling pleural catheter. This is advised for patients with an expandable lung where the clinician or patient considers achieving pleurodesis and removing the indwelling pleural catheter to be important.

### Efficacy and safety of tunneled pleural catheters in adults with malignant pleural effusions: a systematic review [^112s7rkf]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Interpretation and application of these results must be done with caution given the limitations of our study. Most importantly, the data come almost exclusively from uncontrolled, often retrospective, case series. In the widely used GRADE system, case series are categorized as very low-quality evidence. These studies were not blinded, patients were not randomized to treatment, and outcomes were inconsistently reported. Even among the outcomes that were reported with some regularity, degree or severity was often not delineated. There is also potential for publication bias, especially at less-experienced centers that have used the TIPC without as much success.

Furthermore, although most of the largest studies in this review explicitly stated that they included consecutive patients who received the TIPC, 9 of the 19 studies did not state this, thus raising the possibility that some patients may not have been included in their series. Potential confounding factors, such as concurrent treatment with opioids or chemotherapy, were not reported. Finally, there is potential for bias in the way our systematic review was conducted. We attempted to minimize this by using a protocol for study inclusion and exclusion and by having two authors separately abstract the data.

While this study provides a suggestion that the TIPC may be useful in the treatment of patients with MPE, there is little evidence comparing the TIPC to traditional pleurodesis, and the patient population in which the TIPC could be best utilized remains undefined.

### Efficacy and safety of tunneled pleural catheters in adults with malignant pleural effusions: A systematic review [^1139pRDB]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions (MPE) occur in up to 15% of patients with advanced malignancies and contribute significantly to dyspnea and discomfort at the end of cancer patients' lives. The standard of care for MPEs that reaccumulate after percutaneous drainage is pleurodesis. Pleurodesis, using chemical and physical agents, has been the mainstay of treatment for decades, but questions have been raised about its safety. Talc, the most effective and commonly used pleurodesis agent, has been shown to have multiple complications, including respiratory failure, pneumonia, and treatment-related death. There is evidence that these serious risks are reduced through the use of more carefully regulated talc particles. However, pleurodesis is also associated with fever, pain, and often necessitates general anesthesia and a several-day hospitalization.

Since its approval by the FDA in 1997, the tunneled indwelling pleural catheter (TIPC) has increasingly been used as an alternative therapy. The indwelling catheter is inserted percutaneously and allows for intermittent drainage at home through an easily managed tube. Shortly after FDA approval, Putnam and colleagues published the only randomized trial at the time of writing comparing pleurodesis to TIPC for MPE. They found that TIPC patients experienced fewer in-hospital complications and a similar improvement in quality of life when compared with pleurodesis, but a lower rate of spontaneous pleurodesis and higher rates of late complications. Since Putnam's publication, the use of these drainage systems has become more widespread.

### Treatment options for malignant pleural effusion [^114R2BKo]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is associated with 30% of lung cancer cases, often leading to devastating symptoms such as dyspnea and cough, significantly impacting patients' quality of life. MPE typically indicates a poor prognosis with a life expectancy of less than six months, except in cases involving breast and ovarian cancer. Consequently, the primary therapeutic goal is palliation rather than cure.

- **Recent findings**: Chest tube insertion and sclerotherapy continue to be the standard treatments for MPE. However, emerging therapeutic options, such as medical pleuroscopy and indwelling pleural catheters, present cost-effective alternatives that facilitate outpatient care for patients with MPE.

- **Summary**: This review explores the medical, economic, and social aspects of various management options for MPE.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^114oc9Nw]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) affects up to 15% of patients with cancer, and its incidence and prevalence are increasing. Most cases are symptomatic; the most common symptoms include dyspnea due to compression of the lung parenchyma, impaired chest wall movement, and, particularly, diaphragmatic dysfunction. MPE typically represents advanced or metastatic disease, with a median survival of 3–12 months depending on the primary cancer site and other prognostic factors.

The most common treatments for MPE that provide symptomatic relief are therapeutic thoracentesis, chemical pleurodesis (talc slurry), or insertion of an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) at bedside. Chemical pleurodesis, such as talc poudrage, tetracycline, doxycycline, or bleomycin, or mechanical pleurodesis can also be performed during surgery. Pleurectomy or abrasion pleurodesis is performed in rare cases.

Therapeutic thoracentesis involves ultrasound-guided insertion of a catheter-over-needle into the pleural space to extract as much pleural fluid as possible. Following thoracentesis, fluid reaccumulates in more than 50% of patients, necessitating multiple thoracentesis procedures. Therefore, thoracentesis is not considered a long-term treatment option. In contrast, talc pleurodesis and IPCs are considered definitive therapies. Talc pleurodesis is typically conducted as an inpatient procedure and involves the delivery of graded talc into the pleural cavity via thoracoscopy (poudrage) or chest tube (slurry) following complete drainage of the MPE and lung re-expansion.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^113qmtyJ]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is common in individuals with cancer and typically reflects advanced disease. Most cases are symptomatic, with dyspnea and pain severely affecting the patient's quality of life (QOL). The management of MPE aims to relieve symptoms, improve QOL, prevent repeated pleural interventions, and minimize hospital admissions. Common treatments for MPE that provide symptomatic relief include thoracentesis, chemical (talc) pleurodesis, and indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs). Talc pleurodesis and IPCs are the mainstay of treatment but represent very different treatment strategies: talc pleurodesis is an inpatient procedure, whereas IPCs are an ambulatory strategy. Given their similar efficacy, treatment decisions in MPE are often determined by other factors, such as the patient's clinical characteristics, individual treatment goals, and preferences for hospital-based or home-based care.

We provide a summary of the evidence for different interventions for treating MPE and compare recommendations from the major American, European, British, and Spanish guidelines regarding when to consider each treatment. We highlight specific challenging treatment scenarios and key clinical considerations that may influence treatment decisions for different patients. There are barriers to accessing and receiving evidence-based care. Patients with symptomatic MPE would benefit from early referral from oncology teams to pleural services. We provide best practice recommendations for optimal referral and coordination of care to ensure that patients receive maximum benefit.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^114EuZTg]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

- **Challenging scenarios: Septated MPE**: Septated malignant pleural effusion (MPE) describes the presence of fibrinous strands within the effusion, often due to inflammatory-mediated changes in procoagulant and fibrinolytic activity. Septations are common. In a retrospective analysis of 540 consecutive patients undergoing medical thoracoscopy, septations were observed in 60% of the cases and obstructed two-thirds or more of the view in 15% of the cases, correlating with a greater pleural tumor burden and shorter median survival.

Septations do not necessarily prevent drainage of the effusion, and usual care can be applied. However, non-draining septated fluids are more challenging due to a lack of treatment options in this group and require a personalized approach based on the patient's clinical characteristics.

Treatment strategies for symptomatic septated MPE vary among guidelines, reflecting the limited evidence for any single intervention. The ATS guidelines offer no specific recommendations, whereas the ERS guidelines suggest breaking septations during thoracoscopy. The British guidelines propose intrapleural fibrinolytics, such as urokinase through an IPC, for draining septated MPE if initially flushing the IPC with normal or heparinized saline does not improve drainage. Fibrinolytics may be considered in non-draining cases, reserving surgery for very select patients with significantly septated symptomatic MPE who have a favorable prognosis and performance status.

In contrast, the Spanish guidelines and ERS/EACTS task force highlight that, although intrapleural fibrinolytics may improve radiological appearance, their use should be reserved for specific cases.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^1112o75r]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Clinical practice varies between hospitals. Guidelines should be used to aid treatment decisions, and treatment should be dictated by patient factors rather than by the preferences of individual teams. Patients should be made aware of the benefits and risks of each treatment option so they can make informed treatment choices. Referral pathways differ by center setup, and a sample referral pathway is illustrated in Figure 1.

- **Example referral pathway**: We unanimously recommend that patients with malignant, symptomatic pleural effusions be referred from oncology teams to pleural services as early as possible to enable them to obtain maximal quality of life (QOL) benefits from malignant pleural effusion (MPE) treatment. Where treatment involves an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC), pleural services can also coordinate home visits for IPC drainage. Furthermore, patients do not have to be referred by oncology teams; they may also be referred to pleural services directly from primary care. It has often been suggested that early intervention reduces the risk of later non-expandable lung development, though to our knowledge, this benefit has yet to be validated empirically. At the very least, early intervention will provide earlier symptom relief for patients, as will early referral to palliative care services when other symptoms affect their QOL, such as pain.

Ideally, every hospital should have a pleural service or a dedicated MPE unit. For hospitals without such services, the Expert Committee recommends that clinicians map the availability of local specialist units/services to identify gaps in patient care pathways.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^115P1A8E]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Both IPCs and talc pleurodesis entail adverse events. A meta-analysis found no significant overall differences in the frequency of adverse events between treatments; however, distinct adverse event profiles exist for each. IPCs pose a higher risk of infection due to prolonged foreign body insertion, with skin or pleural fluid infections occurring in approximately 8% of cases. Although IPC-related infections have attracted attention, they typically respond to treatment without IPC removal. Antibiotics, guided by local sensitivities, can be used to manage infections with case-specific escalation such as intravenous antibiotics, hospital admission, and IPC removal if the infection worsens. Pleural infections can sometimes result in autopleurodesis. Other minor IPC-related complications include catheter obstruction (approximately 5%) and septa development (< 15%).

Adverse events associated with graded talc pleurodesis include pain, dyspnea, infection, postprocedural fever, tube blockage, and tube displacement. These adverse events occur in less than 10% of patients. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a feared complication due to small talc particles. This complication is avoided by using graded talc.

Both IPCs and talc pleurodesis necessitate close monitoring and management of adverse events to ensure optimal patient outcomes.

### Management of malignant pleural effusion [^111zPbMC]. Current Oncology Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) often presents in patients with cancer at an advanced stage and thus carries a poor prognosis. This review updates the knowledge on the management of MPE, focusing on recent literature about the efficacy and safety of the most common methods, including pleurodesis by either thoracoscopy with talc insufflation or thoracostomy with talc slurry, use of an indwelling pleural catheter, and intrapleural chemotherapy. Talc remains the agent of choice in pleurodesis, although the use of alternative agents continues to be explored. The choice of procedure to achieve pleurodesis depends on careful patient selection based on predictive factors and individual characteristics. Talc pleurodesis is relatively well-tolerated and safe, as is an indwelling pleural catheter, in an appropriate patient population. Because MPE is a common problem in cancer patients, future research with more randomized, prospective designs and innovative interventions is needed.

### Efficacy and safety of tunneled pleural catheters in adults with malignant pleural effusions: A systematic review [^114TLyzE]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Although the results are limited by the low quality of the available evidence, our systematic review suggests that the TIPC may improve symptoms for patients with MPE and does not appear to be associated with major complications. Symptom relief was variably defined in the studies that reported it, with only one study using validated scales. When combined, 628 out of 657 patients (95.6%) experienced some degree of improvement in their symptoms, although the magnitude of improvement cannot be determined. Spontaneous pleurodesis occurred in 430 out of 943 patients (45.6%); this is not the primary goal of TIPC placement, but does allow removal of the catheter and may contribute to symptom relief.

Complications of TIPC use were also not reported uniformly, and summary statistics could not be performed for each outcome. For combined outcomes that were described in the same way in the primary studies, we found that serious complications (those that may require an additional invasive procedure or hospital admission) were rare. Empyema was reported in 33 out of 1,168 patients (2.8%) and unspecified infection in 7 out of 346 patients (2.0%). Pneumothorax requiring a chest tube was reported in 3 out of 51 patients (5.9%), and unspecified pneumothorax in 17 out of 439 patients (3.9%). The most common minor complications were cellulitis (32 out of 935 patients, 3.4%), obstruction/clogging (33 out of 895 patients, 3.7%), or unspecified malfunction of the catheter (11 out of 121 patients, 9.1%). More catheters were removed due to the achievement of spontaneous pleurodesis (381 out of 808 patients, 47.1%) than due to complications (54 out of 633 patients, 8.5%).

### Management of malignant pleural effusion in Italian clinical practice: A nationwide survey [^112DMwTf]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Pleural disease (PD) includes a wide spectrum of pathological entities with different etiologies, prognoses, and treatment options. Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is one of the most prevalent causes of PD, and its relative burden is expected to steadily increase worldwide over the next few years. Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for MPE management usually require hospitalization, resulting in considerable costs for healthcare systems. In this context, a personalized, cost-effective management approach is essential to optimize healthcare resources. There is growing evidence that dedicated outpatient pleural services may serve as a valuable alternative to hospitalization in a significant proportion of cases, allowing for proper and timely management with a more favorable cost-benefit ratio.

Recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic options have significantly contributed to simplifying MPE management. In particular, the widespread adoption of thoracic ultrasound (TUS) has made interventions such as pleural biopsy, tube placement, and thoracoscopy feasible in an outpatient setting with a personalized approach. Moreover, in the pandemic era, outpatient services offer the advantage of easier and safer access to healthcare systems for more vulnerable patients, such as those with MPE, most of whom are immunocompromised and at greater risk for infections.

The main aims of pleural services are, therefore, to promote hospital admission avoidance and to provide universally accessible and valuable care.

Malignant pleural effusions (MPE) are a frequent cause of dyspnea and discomfort at the end of cancer patients' lives. The tunneled indwelling pleural catheter (TIPC) was approved by the FDA in 1997 and has been investigated as a treatment for MPE.

- **Objective**: To systematically review published data on the efficacy and safety of the TIPC for treatment of MPE.

- **Design**: We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science databases to identify studies published through October 2009 that reported outcomes in adult patients with MPE treated with a TIPC. Data were aggregated using summary statistics when outcomes were described in the same way among multiple primary studies.

- **Main measures**: Symptomatic improvement and complications associated with use of the TIPC.

- **Key results**: Nineteen studies with a total of 1,370 patients met criteria for inclusion in the review. Only one randomized study directly compared the TIPC with the gold standard treatment, pleurodesis. All other studies were case series. Symptomatic improvement was reported in 628/657 patients (95.6%). Quality of life measurements were infrequently reported. Spontaneous pleurodesis occurred in 430/943 patients (45.6%). Serious complications were rare and included empyema in 33/1,168 patients (2.8%), pneumothorax requiring a chest tube in 3/51 (5.9%), and unspecified pneumothorax in 17/439 (3.9%). Minor complications included cellulitis in 32/935 (3.4%), obstruction/clogging in 33/895 (3.7%), and unspecified malfunction of the catheter in 11/121 (9.1%). The use of the TIPC was without complication.

### Pleurodesis for malignant pleural effusions: Current controversies and variations in practices [^113iWQ6R]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions are common, and pleurodesis remains the most effective method to control the re-accumulation of pleural fluid. However, there are limited randomized controlled trials studying the optimal management of malignant pleural effusions. A recent international survey on pleurodesis practice has highlighted variations in how pleurodesis is performed worldwide. Future research should target these areas of variation to determine the best practice protocols.

- **Selection of pleurodesing agents**: The choice of pleurodesing agents remains controversial. Talc is more effective but is associated with more adverse effects. Talc pleurodesis is followed by systemic and pulmonary inflammation, which is likely related to systemic embolization of talc following its intrapleural administration, although other potential causes may also play a role.

The practice of pleurodesis varies considerably among individual pulmonologists and across different countries, particularly in most technical aspects. This review serves to highlight some of these variations in practice, as well as reviewing the literature on pleurodesis practice.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^112baGcT]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

- **Clinical considerations**: Pleural biopsy may be required to confirm the diagnosis of unilateral pleural effusion with pleural malignancy. The BTS guidelines recommend that patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE) undergoing thoracoscopic biopsy should receive talc poudrage during the biopsy procedure. The Spanish guidelines also highlight, though do not explicitly recommend, that pleurodesis or indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) insertion can be performed during video thoracoscopic biopsy. Given the difficulties in distinguishing between MPE and pleural tuberculosis on thoracoscopy in areas with high tuberculosis prevalence, we recommend initiation of treatment for MPE only after definitive confirmation of the diagnosis.

- **Treatment goals**: Life expectancy guides treatment goals; for patients with a very short prognosis, treatment goals may shift from long-term control to palliative care. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) emphasizes that predicting the prognosis of a patient is challenging for clinicians. Consequently, life expectancy serves only as a rough guide, and care should be individualized on a case-by-case basis.

In most cases, treatment choice is driven by patient preference and suitability for an ambulatory home-based strategy (IPC) or a shorter, more intensive inpatient strategy (talc pleurodesis). In the AMPLE trial, participants randomly assigned to IPC spent fewer days in the hospital than those randomly assigned to talc slurry pleurodesis (median, 10.0 vs. 12.0 days; p = 0.03), and fewer patients in the IPC group required further invasive pleural drainage (4.1% vs. 22.5%).

### Impact of a pleural care program on the management of patients with malignant pleural effusions [^112M2GRT]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2023). High credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) are common and associated with a poor prognosis. Many patients face suboptimal management characterized by repeated, non-definitive therapeutic procedures and potentially avoidable hospital admissions.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective comparison of patients who underwent a definitive palliative intervention for MPE (indwelling pleural catheter or pleurodesis) at our center, before and after the implementation of a pleural care program. Targeted interventions included staff education, establishment of formal pleural drainage policies, a pleural clinic with weekday walk-in capacity, and a rapid access pathway for oncology patients. Outcomes assessed were the proportion of emergency room (ER) presentations, hospitalizations, number of non-definitive pleural procedures, and time-to-definitive palliative procedure.

- **Results**: A total of 144 patients were included: 69 in the pre-intervention group and 75 in the post-intervention group. Although there was no difference in the proportion of ER presentations before and after interventions (43.5% vs. 38.7%, P = 0.56), hospital admissions declined significantly (47.8% vs. 24.0%, P = 0.003). The proportion of patients undergoing chest drain insertion decreased significantly (46.4% vs. 13.3%, P < 0.001), with a stable low number of non-definitive procedures per patient (1.6 ± 1.1 vs. 1.3 ± 0.9, P = 0.32). A 7-day decrease in median time from presentation-to-definitive palliative procedure (P = 0.05) was observed.

- **Conclusion**: A targeted pleural care program improved MPE palliation by reducing hospital admissions and invasive procedures and shortening the time to a definitive palliative procedure.

### Identification and management of pleural effusions of multiple aetiologies [^115qgTr2]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Historically, pleural effusions have been attributed to a single cause. There is growing recognition that a substantial proportion of pleural effusions may have more than one underlying cause. This review aims to summarize recent findings regarding the diagnosis and treatment of effusions secondary to more than one aetiology.

A recent prospective study identified that 30% of pleural effusions had more than one underlying aetiology. With a rising prevalence of cardiovascular and malignant disease, the incidence of the complex pleural patient is increasing. The use of biomarkers, including pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, has been suggested as a method for identifying contributing disease processes.

Understanding the potential for multiple causes of a pleural effusion is vital in establishing diagnoses of multiple underlying aetiologies. New diagnostic pathways, with increasing use of biomarkers, will be required to identify the complex pleural effusion. Further studies on whether targeting separate aetiologies improves outcomes will help in the development of future management strategies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of malignant pleural effusion: A systematic literature review and new approaches [^111hpNUH]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion is a frequent complication in many types of tumors, and its presence indicates short expected survival. This review updates the knowledge about diagnosis and management of malignant pleural effusion. In recent years, progress has been made in diagnosis through the use of new pathologic and radiologic approaches, such as the introduction of positron emission tomography-computed tomography, immunohistochemical marker combinations, and genetic studies to identify malignant cells.

Treatment is always palliative. New promising drugs have been tested, but, awaiting randomized studies, talc pleurodesis is still the treatment of choice, although doubts remain about its safety. A long-term indwelling pleural catheter could be a valid alternative to talc pleurodesis in selected patients with trapped lung syndrome — which is characterized by a lung that fails to reexpand after drainage of pleural effusion — and short life expectancy. However, the correct treatment depends on several factors such as performance status, expected survival, presence of lung reexpansion following pleural drainage, and comorbidities.

### A pleural effusion of multiple causes [^112c9s79]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Multiple medical disorders can lead to the development of pleural effusions. Most effusions are given a single diagnosis in clinical practice. However, the cause of the effusion can change during the disease course, and concomitant yet distinct causes are often underrecognized. We highlight this by reporting a complex case of pleural effusions with different predominant causes during the disease course. Five causes for the pleural effusion were diagnosed, namely malignant pleural effusion, empyema, chylothorax, transudative pleural effusion secondary to hypoalbuminemia, and esophagopleural fistula. This case serves as a reminder to clinicians that pleural effusion, even within the same pleural space, can arise from different causes and, whenever clinically appropriate, reinvestigation of the pleural effusion may be needed.

The leading causes of pleural effusion in adults are heart failure, infection, malignancy, and pulmonary embolism. The patient's history and physical examination should guide evaluation. Small bilateral effusions in patients with decompensated heart failure, cirrhosis, or kidney failure are likely transudative and do not require diagnostic thoracentesis. In contrast, pleural effusion in the setting of pneumonia (parapneumonic effusion) may require additional testing.

Multiple guidelines recommend early use of point-of-care ultrasound in addition to chest radiography to evaluate the pleural space. Chest radiography is helpful in determining laterality and detecting moderate to large pleural effusions, whereas ultrasonography can detect small effusions and features that could indicate complicated effusion (i.e. infection of the pleural space) and malignancy. Point-of-care ultrasound should also guide thoracentesis because it reduces complications.

Computed tomography of the chest can exclude other causes of dyspnea and suggest complicated parapneumonic or malignant effusion. When diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated, Light's criteria can help differentiate exudates from transudates. Pleural aspirate should routinely be evaluated using Gram stain, cell count with differential, culture, cytology, protein, l-lactate dehydrogenase, and pH levels.

### Malignant pleural effusion: Presentation, diagnosis, and management [^114XqEt3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions are common in patients with cancer. Most malignant pleural effusions are secondary to metastases to the pleura, most often from lung or breast cancer. The presence of malignant effusion indicates advanced disease and poor survival; in lung cancer, the presence of malignant effusion upstages the cancer to stage 4. Usually presenting as a large, unilateral exudative effusion, most patients with malignant pleural effusion experience dyspnea.

Prior to intervention, diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion and exclusion of infection should be made. Thoracic imaging is typically performed, with computed tomography considered by many to be the gold standard. Thoracic ultrasound is also useful, particularly if diaphragmatic or pleural thickening and nodularity can be identified. Cytology should then be obtained, typically via pleural fluid aspiration or pleural biopsy.

Treatment focuses on palliation and relief of symptoms. Numerous interventions are available, ranging from drainage with thoracentesis or indwelling pleural catheter to more definitive, invasive options such as pleurodesis. There is no clear best approach, and a patient-centered approach should be taken.

### Assessing factors that may impact physician-based decisions for placing indwelling pleural catheters [^111JJ2ps]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2024). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion is a common finding in patients with advanced cancer and is a frequent cause of dyspnea. Guidelines indicate thoracentesis for symptomatic patients, while indwelling pleural catheters (IPC) are recommended for patients who develop pleural fluid re-accumulation. IPC maintenance, however, requires a significant level of financial and social support. This study aims to analyze potential influencing factors that may play a role in the decision for placing IPCs in patients with recurrent malignant pleural effusions.

- **Methods**: This study retrospectively collected baseline sociodemographic and laboratory data in patients who underwent thoracentesis for malignant pleural effusion from August 2016 to October 2021. It selected patients who presented with re-accumulation of pleural fluid within 30 days or had a pulmonary physician's note documenting that IPC is a potential management option. Of these selected patients (IPC candidates), we stratified patients who underwent IPC placement and those who did not, and performed statistical analysis between these two groups.

- **Results**: One hundred seventy-six patients who underwent thoracentesis were regarded as IPC candidates. Almost all baseline sociodemographic characteristics, including ethnicity (P = 0.637), sex (P = 0.655), and marital status (P = 0.773), were similar between the two groups. However, significantly higher ECOG scores (P = 0.049) were noted in the IPC group. No statistically significant differences were noted in age, body mass index, platelet count, PTT, international normalized ratio, or other parameters.

### Pleural effusions as markers of mortality and disease severity: A state-of-the-art review [^115W9y8F]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Pleural effusions are common and result from various etiologies. Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is known for its high mortality; however, there is increasing evidence that patients with benign pleural effusions also have a poor prognosis. This review discusses the most recent literature on mortality and prognostication in patients with pleural effusion.

- **Recent findings**: Survival in patients with MPE is influenced by many factors, the most significant of which are underlying tumor type, performance score, and markers of systemic inflammation. Prognostic models have been developed for patients with both MPE and those with pleural infection to aid treatment decision-making and patient counseling. Patients with benign pleural effusions may benefit from more definitive treatment of their pleural effusion, as opposed to repeated thoracentesis.

- **Summary**: Both benign and MPEs are associated with high mortality. Prognostic models and studies comparing treatment modality effects on survival will continue to guide the management of these complex problems.

### Malignant pleural effusion: Tumor-host interactions unleashed [^115UiJQd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) poses a significant clinical problem. The non-etiologic management of MPE is suboptimal in terms of efficacy and safety. In light of recent research progress, we propose herein a new view of MPE development, which may rapidly translate into meaningful changes in therapeutics. In addition to tumor-induced impairment of pleural fluid drainage, pertinent findings point toward another pathway to MPE formation: a vicious loop of interactions between pleural-based tumor cells and the host vasculature and immune system that results in increased net fluid production via enhanced plasma extravasation into the pleural space. The ability of tumor cells to trigger this cascade likely rests on a specific and distinct transcriptional repertoire, resulting in important vasoactive events in the pleural space.

Although the characterization of tumor-derived factors responsible for MPE development is in progress, an additional, indirect path to MPE was recently demonstrated: tumor cells recruit and co-opt host cells and mediators, which, in turn, amplify tumor cell-primed fluid leakage and impact tumor cell functions. Importantly, recent evidence suggests that the biological events that culminate in clinical MPE are likely amenable to therapeutic inhibition and even prevention.

In this perspective, the scientific basis for an update of concepts of MPE formation is highlighted. Key questions for future research are posed. Finally, a vision for novel, effective, safe, and convenient treatment modalities that can be offered to outpatients with MPE is set.

### Emerging paradigms in the management of malignant pleural effusions [^116HPoT3]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions (MPE) are a common clinical problem in patients with neoplastic disease. The development of MPEs in advanced malignancies can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Predominant symptoms, such as dyspnea, cough, and chest discomfort, are usually debilitating. Given the poor prognosis of the majority of these patients, palliation is more desirable than the cure of an individual complication. Despite multiple new therapies, the placement of a chest tube with sclerotherapy remains the standard of care. The purpose of this article is to review the emerging therapeutic options for MPE management.

### Randomized trial of pleural fluid drainage frequency in patients with malignant pleural effusions. The ASAP trial [^11567Cb5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Patients with malignant pleural effusions often experience significant dyspnea and a reduced life expectancy. Indwelling pleural catheters provide a method for patients to manage pleural fluid drainage at home, potentially leading to autopleurodesis. However, the optimal drainage frequency to achieve autopleurodesis and facilitate eventual catheter removal has not been established.

The study aimed to ascertain whether an aggressive daily drainage strategy surpasses the standard every other day drainage of pleural fluid in achieving autopleurodesis. To this end, patients were randomized into either an aggressive drainage cohort (daily drainage; n = 73) or a standard drainage cohort (every other day drainage; n = 76), utilizing a tunneled pleural catheter.

The primary outcome measured was the incidence of autopleurodesis following the indwelling pleural catheter placement. Notably, the aggressive drainage group exhibited a higher rate of autopleurodesis, defined by complete or partial response based on symptomatic and radiographic changes, compared to the standard drainage group (47% vs. 24%; P = 0.003). Additionally, the median time to autopleurodesis was shorter in the aggressive group (54 days; 95% confidence interval, 34–83) than in the standard group (90 days; 95% confidence interval, 70 to nonestimable). There were no significant differences observed in the rate of adverse events, quality of life, or patient satisfaction between the two groups.

In conclusion, for patients with malignant pleural effusion, daily drainage of pleural fluid through an indwelling pleural catheter resulted in a higher rate and a quicker time to achieve autopleurodesis, facilitating earlier catheter independence.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^114z2neK]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

- **Review of guidelines**: In asymptomatic patients with known or suspected malignant pleural effusion (MPE), the general consensus is that therapeutic pleural interventions should not be performed.

- **Symptomatic MPE with nonexpandable lung**: Approximately 30% of patients with symptomatic MPE exhibit nonexpandable lungs, which are defined as an inability to occupy over 75% of the chest cavity after drainage. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) advises against chemical (talc) pleurodesis in the setting of known nonexpandable lungs, highlighting its rare effectiveness, and instead recommends indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) as the treatment of choice. For nonexpandable lung cases with a predicted very short survival, ATS recommends palliative care for dyspnea, involving repeat thoracentesis, oxygen, and morphine. Similarly, the European Respiratory Society (ERS), European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS), and Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery (SECT) advocate for IPCs in MPE cases with nonexpandable lung.

- **British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines**: In contrast, the 2023 BTS guidelines propose stratified treatment based on the extent of lung re-expansion. For patients with radiologically significant (> 25%) nonexpandable lungs, IPCs are favored over talc pleurodesis, whereas those with < 25% nonexpandable lungs may obtain quality of life (QOL) benefits from talc slurry pleurodesis or IPCs. Surgical intervention is generally not recommended; however, in highly selected patients with trapped lungs, where expandable lungs are a key priority, decortication can be considered. Although BTS acknowledges thoracentesis as an option, it should be considered within the context of patient-specific factors and treatment goals.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions [^111MZ4dC]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a common cause of breathlessness indicative of advanced disease. Treatment approaches focus on relief of breathlessness and optimizing quality of life. A number of recent, high-impact publications give further insight into the advantages of different treatment options. This article provides a summary of the most up-to-date evidence in this area.

- **Recent findings**: Recent publications have demonstrated comparable pleurodesis outcomes of talc slurry to talc poudrage and explore strategies to combine the advantages of indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) with a chemical pleurodesis. A daily IPC drainage regime improves the chances of pleurodesis success and early IPC removal in patients without significant trapped lung.

- **Summary**: MPE is a diverse condition, with no one strategy representing the 'best' approach for all. Management decisions should be made in conjunction with the patient, taking their views and preferences into consideration.

### To drain or not to drain: An evidence-based approach to palliative procedures for the management of malignant pleural effusions [^114Q2abT]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2012). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions are often symptomatic and diagnosed late in the course of cancer. The optimal management strategy is controversial and includes both invasive and non-invasive strategies. Practitioners have the option of invasive procedures such as intermittent drainage or more permanent catheter drainage to confirm malignancy and palliate symptoms. Because these effusions are often detected late in the course of disease in patients with a limited life expectancy, procedural management may be associated with harms that outweigh benefits.

We performed a literature review to examine the available evidence for catheter drainage of malignant pleural effusions in advanced cancer and reviewed alternative management strategies for the management of dyspnea. We provide a clinical case within the context of the research evidence for invasive and non-invasive management strategies. Our intent is to help inform decision-making for patients and families in collaboration with their health care practitioners and interventionists by weighing the risks and benefits of catheter drainage versus alternative medical management strategies for malignant pleural effusions.

### Efficacy and safety of tunneled pleural catheters in adults with malignant pleural effusions: A systematic review [^1114kfJi]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The presence of a malignant pleural effusion (MPE) portends a poor prognosis for cancer patients, with a median survival of 4.0 months; the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for lung cancer has recently been revised to reflect this. Given the limited life expectancy, treatment for MPE is often individualized to each patient's clinical characteristics and goals of care. While repeated therapeutic thoracentesis may provide sufficient symptomatic relief in some patients, others have a pleural effusion that is so large and rapidly accumulating that a more permanent intervention is required.

Due to his high operative risk, the patient with metastatic lung cancer described in the case presentation was not a good candidate for chemical or mechanical pleurodesis, the traditional standard of care for MPE. Data on the use of the tunneled intrapleural catheter (TIPC) for the treatment of MPE have been accumulating over the past 15 years. Prior reviews of the TIPC have included only a few select articles and focus on the data from the largest centers. To our knowledge, this report, which draws studies from multiple databases and includes a total of 1,370 patients, is the most rigorous and complete review published on this topic.

### Efficacy and safety of tunneled pleural catheters in adults with malignant pleural effusions: A systematic review [^112p2BLq]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science databases for all relevant articles published through October 2009. The search strategy was created together with a research librarian and designed to capture all terms that may be used to describe malignant pleural effusions and pleural catheters. Complete search terms for each database are included in Table 1. We also manually searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for additional studies not detected by the electronic literature searches.

	- **Table 1**: Search strategy used to identify studies describing the use of tunneled indwelling pleural catheters in the treatment of malignant pleural effusions.

- **Study selection**: Studies with and without a control group were eligible if they included at least eight consecutive adult patients with an effusion in the setting of malignancy who received an indwelling, tunneled pleural catheter. Criteria for exclusion were studies of non-malignant effusions, empyema, or chylothorax; studies of large bore chest tubes or non-tunneled catheters; studies in which all patients underwent thoracoscopy, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), or pleurodesis; studies not published in the English language; and studies without primary data. If data appeared to be duplicated in multiple publications, only the study with the most complete data set was included, and studies excluded for this reason are explicitly noted. If a study was otherwise eligible but contained an identifiable subset of patients with excluded types of effusions.

### Do concomitant ascites influence the effectiveness of palliative surgical management of pleural effusion in patients with malignancies [^1157kVeb]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Both pleural and peritoneal effusions are associated with a dismal prognosis for patients with malignancies. Pleural effusion often requires surgical palliative management to relieve symptoms. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of concomitant ascites on the success rate of surgical management of pleural effusion in patients with solid malignancies.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively identified 33 patients with different primary malignancies who underwent palliative surgical treatment for pleural effusion with concomitant ascites. The success rate of pleural effusion management was compared to that of a control group of patients with pleural effusion without ascites.

- **Results**: Ovarian and breast cancer were the most common primary sites in the group of patients with pleural and peritoneal effusions. Thoracocentesis was performed in 30 patients with concomitant ascites and in 29 patients without ascites. The median number of thoracocentesis procedures was two in both groups of patients. Talc pleurodesis was performed in 57.6% and 63.3% of patients with and without ascites, respectively. The success rate of pleurodesis was 68.4% and 71.9% for patients with and without concomitant ascites, respectively (P = 0.92). There was no significant difference in the median length of time for chest tube placement between the two groups (with ascites, 6 days; without ascites, 5 days, P = 0.38). The overall survival was 5.6 months for patients with ascites and 7.8 months for patients without ascites (P = 0.51).

- **Conclusion**: Our results suggest that concomitant ascites do not significantly affect the effectiveness of palliative surgical management of pleural effusion in patients with malignancies.
