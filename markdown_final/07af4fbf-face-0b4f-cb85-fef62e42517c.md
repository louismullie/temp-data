## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Preparation for extracorporeal perfusion in adults (priming fluid)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for preparing extracorporeal perfusion in adults, specifically the priming fluid for cardiopulmonary bypass. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why priming is necessary. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about priming composition and volume. Next, I will examine anticoagulation dosing, including heparin in the prime and systemic bolus. After that, I should review alternatives like dextran 40 and when they are appropriate. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, reference-aligned recommendation and note special situations and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why priming matters. Extracorporeal perfusion circuits must be filled with a non-blood fluid to displace air and establish a safe, functional loop before cannulation; this priming step inevitably causes hemodilution and can contribute to coagulopathy, so the choice of priming fluid and additives influences both hemodynamics and bleeding risk during and after bypass [^65c1af13] [^57d381ee].

> I need to check what contemporary guidelines recommend for priming composition and volume. The 2024 EACTS/EACTAIC/EBCP guideline states that standard adult practice is to prime with a clear, non-blood fluid, most commonly a crystalloid electrolyte solution, and that minimizing priming volume reduces hemodilution and transfusion exposure; it also notes that while colloids have been explored, hydroxyethyl starch should not be used in priming due to potential renal harm, and albumin has not shown clear clinical advantages in large RCTs, though a recent meta-analysis suggested less bleeding and better platelet preservation with albumin, so the signal is mixed and use remains conditional rather than routine [^2385efbb] [^1c68446e] [^44a49836] [^dea5c099].

> Wait, let me verify typical priming volumes and whether there is a consensus target. The guideline emphasizes minimizing priming volume but does not prescribe a single universal volume; observational and trial reports commonly cite total prime volumes around 1,200–1,500 mL in adults, with many centers achieving lower volumes using modern miniaturized circuits or retrograde autologous priming, which is specifically recommended to reduce hemodilution and transfusion when feasible [^2385efbb] [^1c68446e] [^7bd10760].

> Next, I should review anticoagulation in the prime and systemic dosing. I initially thought heparin is always added to the prime, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; some centers add heparin to the prime while others do not, and the key is ensuring adequate systemic anticoagulation before cannulation. The FDA labeling for heparin in cardiovascular surgery supports an initial systemic dose of not less than 150 units/kg, with common practice of 300–400 units/kg depending on expected bypass duration, and many centers target an ACT of 400–480 seconds before initiating CPB; surveys show most practitioners target 400 or 480 seconds, and individualized heparin management systems can refine dosing but have not consistently changed bleeding outcomes in RCTs [^2b7e6f1b] [^8ff90ca9] [^d6190d14] [^0bd46ec0].

> I should double-check examples of heparin dosing in the prime from trials to anchor practice. Several studies describe adding 5,000–10,000 IU of heparin to the pump prime alongside crystalloid, with systemic loading of 300–400 IU/kg to achieve ACT targets; for example, a randomized trial used 10,000 IU in 1,200 mL acetated Ringer's with 350 IU/kg systemic loading, and another trial added 5,000 IU to the prime with 300 IU/kg systemic dosing, which aligns with common practice patterns [^65c1af13] [^15f39d25] [^b59e3450].

> Let me consider colloid alternatives, especially dextran 40, and verify dosing and safety. The FDA labeling for low-molecular-weight dextran (dextran 40) indicates that for extracorporeal perfusion, 10–20 mL/kg of a 10% solution (i.e., 1–2 g/kg) can be added to the circuit, with a usual total not exceeding 2 g/kg; however, a randomized trial comparing dextran-based prime to crystalloid showed measurable negative effects on hemostasis markers at 2 hours without a clinically significant increase in bleeding or transfusion, and allergic reactions to dextran remain a concern, so if used, it should be with caution and patient selection matters [^9100be1f] [^43d382b8] [^2385efbb].

> I will now examine special strategies that reduce hemodilution and transfusion. Retrograde autologous priming displaces crystalloid prime with the patient's own blood and is a Class I recommendation for blood conservation when feasible; minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation (MiECC) designs further reduce prime volume and have evidence for reducing red cell transfusion without increasing adverse outcomes, though implementation requires institutional readiness and training [^7bd10760] [^1c68446e].

> But wait, what if the patient is high risk for bleeding or renal injury; should I avoid certain primes. Yes, I should confirm that hydroxyethyl starch is not recommended for priming due to renal risk, and while albumin has shown signals of less bleeding in meta-analyses, large guideline syntheses rate the evidence as low to moderate and do not endorse routine albumin priming; thus, crystalloid remains the default, with albumin or dextran considered selectively based on patient risk and institutional protocol [^2385efbb] [^44a49836] [^dea5c099].

> Let me synthesize a practical, reference-aligned recommendation. For a standard adult CPB setup, a reasonable priming approach is 1,000–1,500 mL of a balanced crystalloid (e.g., lactated Ringer's or acetated Ringer's) with the addition of 5,000–10,000 IU of unfractionated heparin to the prime, combined with a systemic heparin bolus of 300–400 IU/kg to achieve a pre-bypass ACT of at least 400–480 seconds, adjusting for patient size, circuit characteristics, and institutional assay; if pursuing blood conservation, employ retrograde autologous priming and consider MiECC to reduce hemodilution and transfusion exposure [^2385efbb] [^2b7e6f1b] [^7bd10760] [^1c68446e].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring and titration details so I don't miss safety steps. ACT should be checked before cannulation and periodically during bypass, with many centers targeting 400–480 seconds; if ACT is inadequate after the expected systemic dose, assess for heparin resistance and consider antithrombin concentrate or fresh frozen plasma per institutional protocol, and if using protamine for reversal, consider titrated dosing strategies to avoid excess protamine, which itself can impair coagulation [^8ff90ca9] [^5c48db4e] [^57d381ee].

> Finally, I need to ensure I note special situations. In patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or refractory heparin resistance, direct thrombin inhibitors such as bivalirudin or argatroban are alternatives; bivalirudin is typically dosed with a 1 mg/kg IV bolus, 2.5 mg/kg/h infusion, and 50 mg added to the pump prime, with ACT targets around 2.5× baseline or > 300 seconds when ecarin clotting time is unavailable, recognizing there is no reversal agent and meticulous management of stagnant blood is required [^2a916d75] [^ac17ac40].

For adult extracorporeal perfusion, the **standard priming volume is 1,200–1,500 mL** of a balanced crystalloid (e.g. lactated Ringer's or Plasma-Lyte) [^2385efbb] [^65c1af13], with **heparin 5,000–10,000 IU** added to the prime to achieve an ACT > 400 seconds before initiation [^8ff90ca9] [^65c1af13]. Albumin is not routinely recommended for priming due to lack of outcome benefit and potential harm [^86349b2f] [^44a49836], and hydroxyethyl starch should be avoided because of renal risk [^2385efbb]. Minimizing prime volume and using retrograde autologous priming reduce hemodilution and transfusion needs [^1c68446e] [^7bd10760].

---

## Composition of priming fluid

### Crystalloid solutions

- **Standard crystalloids**: Lactated Ringer's, Plasma-Lyte, or acetated Ringer's are standard priming fluids [^2385efbb] [^65c1af13].
- **Volume**: Typical adult prime volumes are 1,200–1,500 mL, but minimizing volume reduces hemodilution and transfusion [^1c68446e] [^7bd10760].
- **Additives**: Mannitol (10–20 g) and sodium bicarbonate (25–50 mL of 8.4%) are commonly added to promote diuresis and buffer acidosis [^b59e3450] [^bf403061].

---

### Colloid solutions

- **Albumin**: Not routinely recommended; large RCTs show no mortality or renal benefit and possible harm, so use is conditional at best [^86349b2f] [^44a49836].
- **Hydroxyethyl starch (HES)**: Avoid due to increased risk of renal injury and coagulopathy [^2385efbb].
- **Gelatin**: Limited use; no clear advantage over crystalloids and potential allergy risk [^2385efbb].

---

### Anticoagulation

Heparin is added to the prime at **5,000–10,000 IU** to coat circuit surfaces and reduce thrombosis; systemic heparin is dosed separately to achieve target ACT [^65c1af13] [^15f39d25]. ACT targets of **> 400 seconds** (commonly 400–480 seconds) are standard before initiating bypass [^8ff90ca9] [^d6190d14].

---

## Strategies to minimize hemodilution

### Minimized priming volume

Modern circuits and oxygenators enable **priming volumes as low as 800–1,000 mL**, reducing hemodilution and transfusion [^notfound]. Short, small-diameter tubing and eliminating open reservoirs further reduce prime volume [^notfound].

---

### Retrograde autologous priming (RAP)

RAP displaces crystalloid prime with patient blood, **reducing hemodilution and transfusion** without adverse hemodynamic effects [^7bd10760] [^15f39d25].

---

### Autologous blood priming

In anemic patients, **adding 1–2 units of autologous blood** to the prime maintains acceptable hematocrit and oxygen-carrying capacity [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with priming fluid choices

| **Outcome** | **Crystalloid** | **Albumin** | **Hes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mortality | No difference | No difference | No difference |
| Renal function | No difference | No difference | Worse (AKI risk) |
| Bleeding | No difference | Possible reduction | Increased |
| Transfusion | No difference | No difference | Increased |
| Fluid balance | More positive | Less positive | Less positive |

---

Overall, **crystalloids remain standard**; albumin offers no clear outcome benefit and HES is harmful, so it should be avoided [^86349b2f] [^2385efbb].

---

## Special considerations

### Patient-specific factors

In renal impairment, **avoid HES** and use the lowest effective crystalloid volume [^2385efbb]. In coagulopathy, **minimize hemodilution** and consider blood-priming or RAP [^1c68446e] [^7bd10760]. In obesity, **individualize prime volume** to body size and perfusion needs [^notfound].

---

### Procedural factors

For long bypass times, **higher heparin doses** may be needed to maintain ACT [^8ff90ca9]. For complex surgeries, **consider RAP or blood-priming** to limit dilution and transfusion [^1c68446e] [^7bd10760].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

- **Crystalloids**: Standard priming fluids; minimize volume when possible [^2385efbb] [^1c68446e].
- **Albumin**: Not routinely recommended; use only if clinically justified [^86349b2f] [^44a49836].
- **HES**: Avoid due to renal risk [^2385efbb].
- **Heparin**: Add 5,000–10,000 IU to prime; maintain ACT > 400 seconds [^65c1af13] [^8ff90ca9].
- **RAP**: Recommended when feasible to reduce hemodilution and transfusion [^7bd10760] [^1c68446e].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard priming fluid**: 1,200–1,500 mL balanced crystalloid (lactated Ringer's or Plasma-Lyte).
- **Heparin**: 5,000–10,000 IU added to prime; systemic heparin dosed to ACT > 400 seconds.
- **Avoid**: Routine albumin or HES in priming.
- **Minimize**: Prime volume and use RAP when feasible to reduce hemodilution and transfusion [^1c68446e] [^7bd10760].

---

The standard adult extracorporeal perfusion prime is **1,200–1,500 mL of a balanced crystalloid** with 5,000–10,000 IU heparin, targeting ACT > 400 seconds; minimize volume and use RAP to reduce hemodilution and transfusion, and avoid albumin and HES in routine priming [^2385efbb] [^65c1af13] [^1c68446e] [^86349b2f].

### Dextran 40 (Lmd in dextrose) [^9100be1f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

LMD (dextran 40) is administered by I.V. infusion only.

Dextran 1 should be administered prior to administration of clinical dextran solutions.

In shock, it is suggested that total dosage not exceed 20 mL/kg for adults and adolescents, during the first 24 hours. The first 10 mL/kg may be infused as rapidly as necessary to effect improvement. It is strongly recommended that central venous pressure be monitored frequently during the initial infusion of the drug. Should therapy continue beyond 24 hours, subsequent dosage should not exceed 10 mL/kg per day and therapy should not continue beyond five days.
In extracorporeal perfusion, the dosage of LMD used will vary with the volume of the pump oxygenator. LMD can serve as a sole primer or as an additive to other priming fluids. For adults and adolescents, generally 10 to 20 mL of a 10% solution (1 to 2 g) of LMD per kilogram of body weight are added to the perfusion circuit. Usually total dosage should not exceed 2 g/kg of body weight.
In prophylaxis of venous thrombosis and thromboembolism, the dosage of LMD for adults and adolescents, should be chosen according to the risk of thromboembolic complications, e.g., type of surgery and duration of immobilization. In general, treatment should be initiated during surgery; 500 to 1,000 mL (approximately 10 mL/kg of body weight) should be administered on the day of operation. Treatment should be continued at a dose of 500 mL daily for an additional two to three days; then, according to the risk of complications, 500 mL may be given every second or third day during the period of risk, for up to two weeks.
Infants may be given 5 mL per kg body weight and children 10 mL per kg.

Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation of patients supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is challenging because of a high risk of both bleeding and thrombotic complications, and often empirical. Practice in anticoagulation management is therefore highly variable. The scope of this guidance document is to provide clinicians with practical advice on the choice of an anticoagulant agent, dosing, and the optimal anticoagulant monitoring strategy during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support in adult patients.

2.1 Preparation for Administration

Confirm the selection of the correct formulation and strength prior to administration of the drug.

This product should be administered by intravenous infusion.

Do not use Heparin Sodium in 5% Dextrose Injection as a "catheter lock flush" product.

Do not admix with other drugs.

Discard unused portion.

Do not use plastic containers in series connection.

This product should not be infused under pressure.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact.

2.2 Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety

Adjust the dosage of heparin sodium according to the patient's coagulation test results. When heparin is given by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation time approximately every 4 hours in the early stages of treatment. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during the early stages of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is 1.5 to 2 times the normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value.

Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy.

2.3 Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose
Heparin

The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosage must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines:

Table 1: Recommended Adult Full-Dose Heparin Regimens for Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect

2.4 Pediatric Use

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients:

2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery

Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes.

### 2024 EACTS / EACTAIC / EBCP guidelines on cardiopulmonary bypass in adult cardiac surgery [^2d7fbb93]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Research results in the area of SMB management are difficult to interpret. On the one hand, the results often come from smaller, single-centre RCTs; on the other hand, the diversity in the quality of the studies is tremendous. Furthermore, it is unfortunate that no relevant review article has been published so far.

Emergency (re)institution of cardiopulmonary bypass

Perfusionists regularly work in urgent/emergency situations. They should always be prepared to institute and reinstitute CPB in life-saving settings, whether for an urgent or emergency procedure or for reinstitution on CPB after weaning. Perfusionists can be best trained periodically for these emergencies through protocols and/or team simulation sessions.

Description of the evidence

No scientific evidence is available regarding the reinstitution of CPB in emergency situations, but common sense must prevail. For emergency procedures, it is always prudent to have a sterile set-up ready, primed or dry. For reinstitution on CPB after weaning, it is advisable to keep the ECC operable, with sterile tubing on the operating table, until the patient's sternum has been closed. In case of urgent institution or reinstitution of CPB, it is vital to make sure that the patient is adequately anticoagulated such that sufficient heparin has been administered at the earliest point after the decision to reopen is made. National guidelines mention a few recommendations for emergency procedures. Every hospital must consider how recommendations on dry or wet storage of CPB circuits can best be implemented regarding sterility and local regulations. After reviewing the available literature and the documents of national societies, the task force is in consensus that a 72-h storage time for primed circuits and a 30-day storage time for dry circuits should be considered as an institutional policy. A recent German guideline on ECC for cardiac and circulatory failure also suggests extracorporeal life support (ECLS) for cardiocirculatory failure after cardiac surgery.

Protamine after separation from CPB — dosing guidance and adverse effects: "Protamine is often administered after separation from CPB to reverse the anticoagulant effects of heparin". In the absence of randomized trials, suggested dosing is "a protamine-to-heparin ratio of 0.6 to 1.0 based on initial heparin dosing (usually 400 IU/kg to achieve activated clotting time of > 400 sec), not exceeding a ratio of 1.0 (1 mg of protamine to 100 IU of heparin)". Reported safety concerns include that "Pulmonary hypertension and hemodynamic deterioration are well-recognized adverse effects of protamine".

### The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists, and the American society of extraCorporeal technology: clinical practice guidelines-anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass [^ebc7c2f2]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Despite more than a half century of "safe" cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the evidence base surrounding the conduct of anticoagulation therapy for CPB has not been organized into a succinct guideline. For this and other reasons, there is enormous practice variability relating to the use and dosing of heparin, monitoring heparin anticoagulation, reversal of anticoagulation, and the use of alternative anticoagulants. To address this and other gaps, The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists, and the American Society of Extracorporeal Technology developed an Evidence Based Workgroup. This was a group of interdisciplinary professionals gathered to summarize the evidence and create practice recommendations for various aspects of CPB. To date, anticoagulation practices in CPB have not been standardized in accordance with the evidence base. This clinical practice guideline was written with the intent to fill the evidence gap and to establish best practices in anticoagulation therapy for CPB using the available evidence. To identify relevant evidence, a systematic review was outlined and literature searches were conducted in PubMed using standardized medical subject heading (MeSH) terms from the National Library of Medicine list of search terms. Search dates were inclusive of January 2000 to December 2015. The search yielded 833 abstracts, which were reviewed by two independent reviewers. Once accepted into the full manuscript review stage, two members of the writing group evaluated each of 286 full papers for inclusion eligibility into the guideline document. Ninety-six manuscripts were included in the final review. In addition, 17 manuscripts published before 2000 were included to provide method, context, or additional supporting evidence for the recommendations as these papers were considered sentinel publications. Members of the writing group wrote and developed recommendations based on review of the articles obtained and achieved more than two thirds agreement on each recommendation. The quality of information for a given recommendation allowed assessment of the level of evidence as recommended by the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines. Recommendations were written in the three following areas: (1) heparin dosing and monitoring for initiation and maintenance of CPB; (2) heparin contraindications and heparin alternatives; and (3) reversal of anticoagulation during cardiac operations. It is hoped that this guideline will serve as a resource and will stimulate investigators to conduct more research and to expand on the evidence base on the topic of anticoagulation therapy for CPB.

### Anticoagulation management and heparin resistance during cardiopulmonary bypass: a survey of Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists members [^1c887d3d]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite its longevity of use for anticoagulation during cardiac surgery, significant variability in heparin dosing and monitoring has been reported. A 1993 survey of members of the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists and American Society of Extracorporeal Technology demonstrated that, although the activated clotting time was used by 99% of respondents, acceptable values for the conduct of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) ranged from 240 to 1000 seconds. A survey of 54 North American institutions administered in 2008 by the Duke Clinical Research Institute and published by Lobato et alreported a similarly wide range of target activated clotting times, with values of 400–480 seconds being used by approximately 70% of respondents. Variability in anticoagulation practices is likely the result of a gap in evidence and any formal recommendations. Only recently have the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists, American Society of Extracorporeal Technology, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons released clinical practice guidelines for CPB anticoagulation.

Decreased heparin responsiveness, frequently termed "heparin resistance", is an area that lacks consensus in either diagnosis or treatment. The reported incidence during CPB use ranges from 4% to 26%and is highly dependent on the initial bolus dose of heparin and the desired activated clotting time target for CPB initiation. Therapies for heparin resistance include antithrombin concentrates, fresh frozen plasma, and the administration of additional heparin. The 2011 blood conservation guidelines from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists recommend administration of antithrombin concentrates in preference to fresh frozen plasma in instances of antithrombin-mediated heparin resistance. However, the acceptance and impact of this recommendation remain unknown. In the report by Lobato et al, fresh frozen plasma was the predominant treatment for heparin resistance in 85% of US and Canadian centers.

Recently, Miles et alconducted a global survey of CPB priming practices and reported that 72.7% of respondents used an activated clotting time target between 400 and 500 seconds for initiation of CPB. That particular survey, however, asked only 1 question regarding activated clotting time values and contained no items related to heparin dosing or responsiveness. We conducted the present survey to describe both (1) current practice of anticoagulation for initiation and maintenance of CPB and (2) clinician attitudes on heparin resistance and their current use of antithrombin concentrates. In addition, since 2018 Society of Thoracic Surgeons/Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists/American Society of Extracorporeal Technology CPB anticoagulation guidelines have just been released, we wanted to use the collected survey data to determine what percentage of practitioners are already compliant with these recommendations.

### Pump priming practices and anticoagulation in cardiac surgery: results from the global cardiopulmonary bypass survey [^2f4ede2e]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Regional patterns of practice in cardiopulmonary bypass remain poorly understood with conflicting evidence regarding the best choices in pump priming preferences with respect to colloid and crystalloid and different types of fluid within these categories. In light of the variation in the literature, we hypothesized there would be considerable regional differences in cardiopulmonary bypass practice, particularly with respect to the type of fluid used to prime the extracorporeal circuit.

Methods

A 16-question, Internet-based survey was distributed by various regional specialist societies, targeting adult cardiac anesthesiologists. One question was directly relevant to activated clotting time and 5 concerned pump priming choices with respect to crystalloid and colloid types and additives. The remaining questions concerned cardioplegia choices. The survey remained open from June 2015 to May 2016.

Results

A total of 923 responses were analyzed. Estimated response rates from Europe, North America, Australia/New Zealand, and South America were 19.77%, 8.06%, 16.30%, and 1.68%, respectively. The majority of respondents worldwide considered an activated clotting time of < 400 seconds as unsafe for bypass (92.5%). Crystalloid as a sole fluid type remains the most common priming solution worldwide (38.1%) although combinations with colloid (23.8%) were also popular. Retrograde autologous priming was used by 17.9% of respondents. Heparin was the most frequently used prime additive (43.0%) followed by mannitol (35.2%). Variation was demonstrated within some of these categories reflective of differences in regional practices.

Conclusions

Differences exist in some specific areas between regional cardiopulmonary bypass techniques with respect to pump priming and anticoagulation practices. The significance of these differences with respect to patient outcome is uncertain and requires further study.

Cardiopulmonary Bypass

The CPB machine (Stöckert S5, LivaNova, Germany) was primed with 1,200 mL acetated Ringer's solution and 10 000 IU heparin. No mannitol or hydroxyethyl starch was used in the CPB prime.

The patients received a CPB flow rate of 2.4 l · min –1 · m –2 (standard flow) or 2.9 l · min –1 · m –2 (high flow) according to randomization. Cannula sizes, ranging between 20 and 24 French, were selected in accordance with clinical practice and the manufacturer´s recommendation to ensure that the pressure drop did not exceed 80 mmHg for the chosen pump flow rate. Before insertion of the cannulas in the aortic root and inferior ± superior caval vein, a heparin bolus of 350 IU/kg was given, with an activated clotting time goal of more than 480 s before the start of CPB. The target hematocrit during CPB was 25 to 30% and the temperature was kept between 33° to 36°C. Hyperkalemic blood cardioplegia was given as an induction dose of 800 to 1,000 mL with a blood:cardioplegia ratio of 4:1 followed by intermittent bolus doses during the surgery at the surgeon's request. The target MAP during CPB was 60 to 80 mmHg using a vasopressor (norepinephrine) or a vasodilator (nitroprusside) if needed. The perfusionists maintained a safety fluid level of 150 mL in the venous reservoir. When deemed needed, vacuum on the venous reservoir was used. If there was a need to administer extra volume into the circuit during CPB, the patients received acetated Ringer's solution or albumin. The use of red blood cells was restricted and given only when necessary to maintain hematocrit level above 24%. During CPB, target arterial P 2 was 20 kPa and partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (pCO 2) was kept between 5.0 to 6.0 kPa. After weaning from CPB, the heparin effect was reversed with protamine 0.8 mg per 100 IU heparin, with an activated clotting time goal of less than 130 s.

2.8 Converting to Warfarin

To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)].

2.9 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin

For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered.

2.10 Extracorporeal Dialysis

Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^ccf9f5cc]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Patient blood management — perfusion interventions specify that retrograde autologous priming of the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit should be used whenever possible. Reduced priming volume in the CPB circuit reduces hemodilution and is indicated for blood conservation. Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is a reasonable method to reduce bleeding and transfusion. Minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation is reasonable to reduce blood loss and red cell transfusion as part of a combined blood conservation approach. Use of modified ultrafiltration may be reasonable for blood conservation and reducing postoperative blood loss in adult cardiac operations using CPB.

In addition to the classic calculation of the required UFH dose based on body weight, patient-specific heparin management systems and approaches are available to achieve the required ACT target value. Methods of individualized heparin management are a more patient-specific approach to determine heparin doses. One option is the Hepcon Haemostasis Management System (HMS, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA), a point-of-care system that considers body weight, height, gender and information on the CPB circuit (priming volume, amount of UFH added). The method is based on determining a patient's response to UFH (heparin-dose response) by exposing a blood sample to different amounts of UFH. During CPB, the heparinized blood is titrated with protamine in the Hepcon system to determine the current heparin concentration. Finally, after CPB and protamine reversal, the patient's blood is titrated again with low doses of protamine to detect residual heparin. Using a combination of the Hepcon, thromboelastography and the PFA-100 platelet function analyser in CABG did not reveal a difference in postoperative blood loss between patients with individual heparin titration and patients without, as shown in an RCT with 102 patients. One study investigated how Hepcon-based heparin management influenced heparin doses compared to a conservative anticoagulation strategy in patients having CABG surgery. The study showed no differences in total heparin doses between groups, and there were no differences in PRBC transfusion requirements. Similarly, another study assessing a Hepcon-based anticoagulation strategy revealed no differences in heparin dosing or in postoperative haemostasis or bleeding compared to ACT-based dosing.

Priming — Composition, volume and autologous priming (antegrade and/or retrograde)

The standard procedure in adult cardiac surgery involves priming the CPB circuit with a clear, non-blood fluid before initiation. This step introduces new obstacles, namely haemodilution and the risk of coagulopathy. The most commonly used priming fluid is a crystalloid electrolyte solution with additives. However, considerable research has been performed to investigate colloid-based priming solution. The interest in minimized perfusion circuits in recent years led to several studies on the feasibility and possible advantages of reducing the amount of priming volume, shortening the circuit or autologous priming. Autologous priming (antegrade and retrograde) is achieved by allowing blood to displace the prime into an external reservoir. This external reservoir is then excluded from the circuit.

Description of the evidence

Despite a wealth of studies, no consensus has been reached on the optimal composition of the priming solution According to recent surveys, crystalloids are the preferred priming solution in European centres and are exclusively used in Australian centres. The goal of adding colloids to the priming solution has been to reduce fluid balance and oedema formation. Although this was feasible in some studies, a meta-analysis showed no difference in colloid osmotic pressure, HCT and transfusion requirements between hydroxyethyl starch and crystalloid solutions. Moreover, a negative effect of hydroxyethyl starch on kidney function has been suggested; thus its use in priming solutions cannot be recommended.

The use of albumin as a colloid did not reduce adverse events in a large RCT.

Recently, the use of a dextran 40-based priming solution has been advocated. A recent RCT on the use of hyperoncotic dextran 40 showed better preservation of colloid oncotic pressure compared to crystalloids. However, in another RCT, dextran had a deleterious impact on variables related to the haemostatic function, but no clinically relevant effect, for example, on bleeding was found. Furthermore, allergic reactions to dextran, as well as to other colloids, should be considered.

### Positive impact of retrograde autologous priming in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^15f39d25]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass circuit

Anesthesia was initiated using an intravenous technique with propofol, fentanyl and pancuronium bromide on demand. After initiation anaesthesia was performed as balanced anesthesia, administered as low fresh gas flow with inhalational sevoflurane over the ventilator or the oxygenator of the CPB system; additional fentanyl was administered intravenously. Normothermic extracorporeal circulation was accomplished in all patients with an open non-heparin-coated system including a poly-2-methoxyethyl-acrylate (PMEA) coated hollow-fiber membrane oxygenator (CAPIOX® FX15) with integrated arterial filter, and reservoir (Terumo). The CPB system was primed with 850 mL Jonosteril® and 10.000 IU of porcine heparin. Management of CPB included systemic temperature of 36 °C, α-stat pH management, target mean perfusion pressure between 50 and 70 mmHg, and pump flow rates of ≥ 2.4 l/min/m 2. Myocardial protection was achieved with intermittent antegrade warm cardioplegia according to Calafiore's protocol. All patients received an intraoperative infusion of tranexamic acid (bolus of 2 g after the administration of the initial heparin bolus and another 2 g were given into the CPB circuit during reperfusion). In all patients, a cell saver (Medtronic autoLog™ or Sorin Xtra®) was used to collect wound blood prior to CPB, blood from the pleural space and CPB volume, which could not be reinfused before protamine administration. This blood was processed if the collected volume exceeded 600 ml.

Retrograde autologous priming

The only structural difference to the standard CPB circuit is a RAP bag (CE, Terumo, Belgium). Before RAP started, mean arterial pressure was elevated to approximately 80 mmHg using small doses of i.v. noradrenaline. Then priming fluid in the arterial line of the heart-lung-machine was displaced with patient's blood using arterial pressure, the venous line was drained by slowly rotating the arterial pump. The priming fluid of the CPB circuit was slowly drained into the RAP bag. The RAP bag stayed connected with the venous reservoir for crystalloid fluid replacement during CPB. The retrograde priming procedure took approximately 3 to 5 min.

Cardiopulmonary bypass technique

All patients were treated with moderately hypothermic CPB (27°C to 36°C). The CPB circuit consisted of an Avant oxygenator (Sorin Group, Mirandola, Italy), an HVR Evo hard-shell reservoir (Sorin Group) in London and a closed CVR 1200 soft-shell reservoir (Sorin Group) in Gent, Belgium. The hardware consisted of a Stöckert S5 heart-lung machine (Sorin Group) and a Stöckert Heater Cooler System 3T (Sorin Group).

Priming solutions consisted of 1,400 mL of Hartmann's solution and 10,000 IU of heparin (London site) and 1,200 mL of gelatine (1,000 mL), 15% mannitol (200 mL) and 2,500 IU of heparin (Gent site). No hydroxyethyl starch was used for priming the circuit or as additional fluid during CPB. Cardioplegic solution was a 4:1 ratio of cold blood cardioplegia (St. Thomas's solution) at an induction dose of 1,000 mL, with subsequent 200-mL doses every 20 minutes of (London site) and 800- to 1000-mL single-dose Saint Thomas II crystalloid cardioplegia with additional doses if considered necessary by the surgeon (Gent site). Pump flow was settled at 2.4 to 2.8 L/minute/m 2 at the outset of CPB and subsequently adjusted according to the patient's core temperature (usually a 20% decrease for core temperatures between 30°C and 34°C and an additional 10% decrease for core temperatures < 30°C). A Hb value less than 6 to 7 g/dL during CPB was considered the trigger point for PRC transfusion. All patients received tranexamic acid according to the routine protocol of each institution, and no aprotinin was used.

### Revised algorithm for heparin anticoagulation during continuous renal replacement therapy [^d4f60bab]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Premature clotting of the circuit is the most common reason for unplanned interruptions in renal replacement therapy (RRT) and discrepancies between the prescribed and delivered dose of RRT. The recent guideline from the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) working group recommended citrate as the first-line anticoagulant for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). For patients with contraindications to citrate, either unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin was recommended.

Worldwide, unfractionated heparin is the most commonly used anticoagulant to maintain circuit patency. The potential risks including bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia are well known. In 2010, we designed an algorithm to enable the nursing staff to manage heparin during CRRT effectively and safely. In response to new knowledge and changes in clinical practice, we have revised the algorithm (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Algorithm for heparin anticoagulation during CRRT. APTTr activated partial thromboplastin time ratio, CRRT continuous renal replacement therapy, HIT heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, INR international normalised ratio

The main principles of the algorithm are maintained as follows:
The indication for heparin should be reviewed daily. Heparin should be avoided in patients with an increased bleeding risk.
Unfractionated heparin is administered via the circuit unless the patient needs systemic anticoagulation for other reasons.
The dose of heparin is based on actual body weight.
Dosing of heparin is "individualised" depending on the patient's risk of bleeding and previous circuit life.
There is no target activated partial thromboplastin time ratio (APTTr) but APTTr ≤ 2 is maintained to prevent overanticoagulation.
Nonpharmacological methods should be considered regularly to maintain circuit patency.

The main changes to the algorithm are the following:
We previously suggested adding heparin to the circuit priming solution before the blood is in contact with plastic surfaces to coat the surfaces of the filter membrane and circuit tubing. It has since been brought to our attention that a randomised controlled cross-over study in 11 patients on CRRT showed no beneficial effect of heparin rinse on the thrombogenicity of the circuit, complement activation or blood leukocyte counts. Therefore, instead of using 10,000 IU heparin in 1 l of 0.9% saline to prime a circuit with total volume ~270 ml, we suggest administering a bolus of 2500 IU heparin on connection.
Following the withdrawal of activated protein C, a reference to this drug has been removed from the algorithm.

The systemic effects of heparin are a potential drawback of CRRT. We hope that our proposed algorithm reduces this risk and allows effective and safe anticoagulation.

Alternatives to heparin

Heparin and protamine are the mainstays of current practice in anticoagulation and reversal for CPB. However, there are conditions under which anticoagulation should be changed to heparin alternatives, such as DTIs. The most common cause is HIT, which in this context should be perceived as an immune-mediated inflammatory process resulting in thrombotic sequelae and consumption of platelets, not just the presence of platelet factor-4 antibodies. The timing of the operation in HIT is based on expert opinion, but it should preferentially be deferred until the patient has negative functional assays, typically after 100 days. In case of an urgent operation, DTIs should be used for anticoagulation during CPB, primarily bivalirudin, but in case of renal impairment, argatroban is preferred.

Bivalirudin is given as an intravenous bolus of 1 mg/kg, followed by a continuous infusion of 2.5 mg/kg/h. A bolus of 50 mg of bivalirudin is typically added to the pump prime. The plasma concentration of bivalirudin should be 12–15 μg/ml, but drug measurement is unavailable in the clinical setting. Anticoagulation should preferentially be monitored by ecarin clotting time. Still, since this method is also not routinely available, most cardiac centres rely on ACT, with a target of an ACT 2.5 times baseline, typically > 300 s. Of note, the plasma bivalirudin concentration only correlates with ACT and aPTT in the lower ranges (< 5 μg/ml for ACT), and plateaus for aPTT despite an increasing plasma concentration of the drug. When used for anticoagulation during CPB, the main challenges are stagnant blood and timing the cessation of an infusion, because no reversal agent is available. Bivalirudin does not prevent clotting in stagnant blood, so closed shunts on the heart-lung machine should be recirculated regularly every 15–20 min. Separating cardiotomy suction or processing stagnant blood in the venous reservoir may be necessary. Bivalirudin is mainly dependent on renal clearance. Clearance decreases by 20% in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30–59, 60% in patients with an eGFR of 10–29 and 80% in patients on dialysis. The bolus dose remains the same in patients with renal impairment, but infusion rates should be reduced. The authors of a recent systematic review concluded that bivalirudin is a safe and effective anticoagulant for CPB, especially for patients with HIT or heparin resistance.

### Safely and effectively. see full prescribing information for SKYTROFA… [^25d3647b]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

When SKYTROFA is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, lipoatrophy may result. Rotate injection sites when administering SKYTROFA to reduce this risk. In pediatric patients with GHD, following subcutaneous dose administration of 0. 24 mg/kg/week SKYTROFA, the observed mean steady-state peak serum concentration of lonapegsomatropin-tcgd was 1230 ng hGH/mL, and the median time to reach maximum concentrations was 25 hours. For released somatropin, Cmax was 15. 2 ng/mL with a median Tmax of 12 hours. The mean somatropin exposure over the one-week dose interval was 500 hng/mL. Following subcutaneous dose administration of 0. 24 mg/kg/week SKYTROFA, mean Cmax of the methoxypolyethylene glycol carrier was
13. 1 mcg/mL with a median Tmax of 36 hours. In adult patients with GHD, following subcutaneous administration of 6.

3 mg/week SKYTROFA, the estimated median steady-state Cmax of lonapegsomatropin-tcgd was
69. 3 ng hGH/mL, and the Tmax was 31 hours. For released somatropin, the estimated median Cmax was 2. 47 ng/mL with a median Tmax of 13 hours. The median somatropin exposure over the one-week dose interval was 75. 4 hng/mL. Following subcutaneous dose administration of 6. 3 mg/week SKYTROFA, the estimated median Cmax of the methoxypolyethylene glycol carrier was
4. 60 mcg/mL with a median Tmax of 34 hours. In adult patients with GHD, the median steady-state apparent volume of distribution of lonapegsomatropin-tcgd after subcutaneous administration of 6. 3 mg/week SKYTROFA was
0. 13 L/kg. A similar distribution pattern as observed for daily somatropin is expected once somatropin is released from lonapegsomatropin-tcgd.

### Lepirudin as an alternative to "heparin allergy" during cardiopulmonary bypass [^3f695165]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The initial short half-life of the drug (10 min) and the leaking to the extravascular space makes estimation of the correct dosage difficult. The post-lepirudin INR in the above case was initially excessive (10.0). It fell rapidly to 1.9 i.e. to within the recommended levels (2.0–2.5) before CPB was commenced. On initiation of CPB the INR again rose, presumably due to the pump-prime drug dose. This pump-prime lepirudin dose (0.5 mg/kg) was the upper limit of that recommended. The resulting high INR results (> 10) that were maintained for approximately one hour of CPB may indicate that the pump -prime dose of lepirudin could be reduced in future cases. The maintenance infusion should be adjusted when INR results exceed the target range during CPB. The INR fell to within this recommended range by 30 mins post-CPB and remained low throughout the entire post-op period. The later post-op bleeding may be a "heparin- rebound "(lepirudin rebound in this case) type effect of the extravascular space Lepirudin re-entering the vascular system post-operatively. However one would expect to see a simultaneous increase in the INR if this were the case. This did not occur. The severe post -operative coagulopathy experienced in this case, (also reported by other groups), requiring the transfusion of a large number of blood products, highlights the difficulties of using Lepirudin as a systemic anticoagulant for CPB, especially when ECT is not available. The prompt transfusion of appropriate blood products in adequate amounts may also be necessary in the post-operative period. Fibrinogen assaying and cryoprecipitate transfusions should be used where indicated.

### Optimal perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass: an evidence-based approach [^98a6eb4f]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

In this review, we summarize the best available evidence to guide the conduct of adult cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to achieve "optimal" perfusion. At the present time, there is considerable controversy relating to appropriate management of physiologic variables during CPB. Low-risk patients tolerate mean arterial blood pressures of 50–60 mm Hg without apparent complications, although limited data suggest that higher-risk patients may benefit from mean arterial blood pressures > 70 mm Hg. The optimal hematocrit on CPB has not been defined, with large data-based investigations demonstrating that both severe hemodilution and transfusion of packed red blood cells increase the risk of adverse postoperative outcomes. Oxygen delivery is determined by the pump flow rate and the arterial oxygen content and organ injury may be prevented during more severe hemodilutional anemia by increasing pump flow rates. Furthermore, the optimal temperature during CPB likely varies with physiologic goals, and recent data suggest that aggressive rewarming practices may contribute to neurologic injury. The design of components of the CPB circuit may also influence tissue perfusion and outcomes. Although there are theoretical advantages to centrifugal blood pumps over roller pumps, it has been difficult to demonstrate that the use of centrifugal pumps improves clinical outcomes. Heparin coating of the CPB circuit may attenuate inflammatory and coagulation pathways, but has not been clearly demonstrated to reduce major morbidity and mortality. Similarly, no distinct clinical benefits have been observed when open venous reservoirs have been compared to closed systems. In conclusion, there are currently limited data upon which to confidently make strong recommendations regarding how to conduct optimal CPB. There is a critical need for randomized trials assessing clinically significant outcomes, particularly in high-risk patients.

### Fresh frozen plasma for cardiovascular surgery [^7b963edb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is a blood component containing procoagulant factors, which is sometimes used in cardiovascular surgery with the aim of reducing the risk of bleeding. The purpose of this review is to assess the risk of mortality for patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery who receive FFP.

Objectives

To evaluate the risk to benefit ratio of FFP transfusion in cardiovascular surgery for the treatment of bleeding patients or for prophylaxis against bleeding.

Search Methods

We searched 11 bibliographic databases and four ongoing trials databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 3, 2015), MEDLINE (OvidSP, 1946 to 21 April 2015), EMBASE (OvidSP, 1974 to 21 April 2015), PubMed (e-publications only: searched 21 April 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP and the ISRCTN Register (searched 21 April 2015). We also searched the references of all identified trials and relevant review articles. We did not limit the searches by language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in patients undergoing major cardiac or vascular surgery who were allocated to a FFP group or a comparator (no plasma or an active comparator, either clinical plasma (any type) or a plasma-derived blood product). We included participants of any age (neonates, children and adults). We excluded studies of plasmapheresis and plasma exchange.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors screened all electronically derived citations and abstracts of papers identified by the review search strategy. Two authors assessed risk of bias in the included studies and extracted data independently. We took care to note whether FFP was used therapeutically or prophylactically within each trial.

Main Results

We included 15 trials, with a total of 755 participants for analysis in the review. Fourteen trials compared prophylactic use of FFP against no FFP. One study compared therapeutic use of two types of plasma. The timing of intervention varied, including FFP transfusion at the time of heparin neutralisation and stopping cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (seven trials), with CPB priming (four trials), after anaesthesia induction (one trial) and postoperatively (two trials). Twelve trials excluded patients having emergency surgery and nine excluded patients with coagulopathies. Overall the trials were small, with only four reporting an a priori sample size calculation. No trial was powered to determine changes in mortality as a primary outcome. There was either high risk of bias, or unclear risk, in the majority of trials included in this review. There was no difference in the number of deaths between the intervention arms in the six trials (with 287 patients) reporting mortality (very low quality evidence). There was also no difference in blood loss in the first 24 hours for neonatal/paediatric patients (four trials with 138 patients; low quality evidence): mean difference (MD) -1.46 ml/kg (95% confidence interval (CI) -4.7 to 1.78 ml/kg); or adult patients (one trial with 120 patients): MD -12.00 mL (95% CI -101.16 to 77.16 ml). Transfusion with FFP was inferior to control for preventing patients receiving any red cell transfusion: Peto odds ratio (OR) 2.57 (95% CI 1.30 to 5.08; moderate quality evidence). There was a difference in prothrombin time within two hours of FFP transfusion in eight trials (with 210 patients; moderate quality evidence) favouring the FFP arm: MD -0.71 seconds (95% CI -1.28 to -0.13 seconds). There was no difference in the risk of returning to theatre for reoperation (eight trials with 398 patients; moderate quality evidence): Peto OR 0.81 (95% CI 0.26 to 2.57). Only one included study reported adverse events as an outcome and reported no significant adverse events following FFP transfusion.

Authors' Conclusions

This review has found no evidence to support the prophylactic administration of FFP to patients without coagulopathy undergoing elective cardiac surgery. There was insufficient evidence about treatment of patients with coagulopathies or those who are undergoing emergency surgery. There were no reported adverse events attributable to FFP transfusion, although there was a significant increase in the number of patients requiring red cell transfusion who were randomised to FFP. Variability in outcome reporting between trials precluded meta-analysis for many outcomes across all trials, and there was evidence of a high risk of bias in most of the studies. Further adequately powered studies of FFP, or comparable pro-haemostatic agents, are required to assess whether larger reductions in prothrombin time translate into clinical benefits. Overall the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the safety and efficacy of prophylactic transfusion of FFP for cardiac surgery is insufficient.

### Minimally invasive cardiopulmonary bypass: does it really change the outcome? [^26e0c8a6]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation was established with an initial dose of 300 IU per kilogram of body weight of porcine intestinal heparin injected into a central venous line 10 minutes before the initiation of CPB and with a target activated clotting time (ACT) of 480 seconds. At the end of CPB, heparin was reversed by protamine chloride at a 1:1 ratio of the loading dose, regardless of the total heparin dosage.

In the MICPB group, a closed circuit with a collapsible venous reservoir receiving blood from the venous cannulation and from a gravity venting from the aortic root was applied, and suction blood from the surgical field was actively drained into a hard-shell reservoir and never readmitted to the systemic circulation unless processed with a cell saver. All CPB surfaces were treated with a biocompatible coating (phosphorylcholine). This system, which has been published by our group, is manufactured on request by Dideco and is known as 'intraoperative ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation)'. Anticoagulation was established with a target ACT of 300 seconds. The heparin loading dose was settled using the Hepcon HMS (Medtronic, Inc.).

No difference between groups existed with respect to the pump flow and pressure policy, the oxygenator, the priming nature, and the protamine administration protocol. In both groups, a cell saver was used throughout the surgical procedure. Tranexamic acid (15 mg/kg before CPB and 15 mg/kg after protamine) was used in all patients.

Data collection and definitions

Using the Institutional Database for Cardiac Surgery, which follows the guidelines of the National Societies of Cardiothoracic Surgery and Cardiothoracic Anesthesia, we collected and analyzed the following preoperative data: demographics (age in years, gender, weight in kilograms, and height in centimeters), preoperative cardiovascular profile (ejection fraction, recent [30 days] myocardial infarction, unstable angina, use of antiplatelet agents [salycilates or clopidogrel/ticlopidine], congestive heart failure, previous vascular surgery, previous cardiac surgery, and use of intra-aortic balloon pump [IABP]), presence of comorbidities (chronic renal failure, diabetes on medication, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], and cerebrovascular accident), and laboratory assays (serum creatinine value in milligrams per deciliters, serum bilirubin value in milligrams per deciliters, and hematocrit [HCT] percentage).

### Safety and efficacy of albumin for pump priming in cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis [^dea5c099]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of albumin as pump priming fluid in cardiac surgery.

Design

Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

Setting

Each study was conducted in a surgical center or intensive care unit.

Participants

Adult and pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass who received circuit priming fluids.

Interventions

Extracorporeal circuit priming with either albumin or crystalloid.

Measurements and Results

Fourteen eligible randomized controlled trials with 741 patients were included in the present meta-analysis. Albumin prime had lower bleeding (CI -202.20 to -142.88 mL, p < 0.00001) and showed a greater advantage in preserving platelet counts (CI 14.85–21.48 × 10 3 mm -3, p < 0.00001), maintaining colloid osmotic pressure and sustaining negative fluid balance. No significant differences were found in the remaining study outcomes.

Conclusions

Albumin was shown to be safe and efficacious in extracorporeal circulation perfusion. However, its clinical advantages were not clearly highlighted, as there were no significant differences in the number of deaths, length of hospital stay, or intensive care unit duration. The results should be interpreted cautiously, as most included studies were small in scale, and the total number of participants was limited.

### Lepirudin as an alternative to "heparin allergy" during cardiopulmonary bypass [^5db82bff]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Lepirudin regime for CPB

The use of lepirudin, to systemically anticoagulate a patient during CPB, instead of heparin has important implications. It renders the standard ACT testing, inadequate. Moreover, lepirudin cannot be reversed, as with the heparin-protamine combination, therefore it's use may result in greater peri-operative bleeding.

A low dose of lepirudin is usually recommended for the treatment of HIT and higher doses are required for patients with HIT and established thrombosis or patients requiring CPB procedure.

The dosage regime of the drug for CPB used for this case was a 0.5 mg/kg intravenous (IV) bolus with 0.5 mg/kg added to the pump prime and a maintenance dose of 0.15 mg/kg/hr given by infusion. Variations in dosage regimes for Lepirudin use during CPB have been described by different authors. The most common dosage regime is 0.25–0.4 mg/kg I.V bolus, 0.20 mg/kg in the pump prime and 0.15 mg/kg/hr maintenance dose given by infusion when the monitoring tests fall below acceptable limits.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^1c68446e]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) priming volume and minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation (MiECC) — recommendations and evidence: Reduced priming volume in the CPB circuit reduces hemodilution and is indicated for blood conservation (Class I, Level B-NR), and minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation is reasonable to reduce blood loss and red cell transfusion as part of a combined blood conservation approach (Class IIA, Level B-R). Registry data link prime volume to transfusion risk and show reduced hemodilution with decreased prime volume. MiECC denotes a combined strategy including CPB circuit features designed to minimize hemodilution and optimize biocompatibility. Meta-analyses provide evidence for blood conservation benefits with MiECC, report reduced RBC transfusion, and no differences in 30-day mortality, myocardial infarction, renal, and cerebral outcomes; additional randomized trials support decreased RBC transfusion requirements with MiECC.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^7bd10760]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Retrograde autologous priming (RAP) of the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit — recommendation and evidence: Retrograde autologous priming of the CPB circuit should be used wherever possible (Class I, Level B-R). Randomized studies and a meta-analysis indicate RAP decreases intraoperative and postoperative transfusion rates, with fewer intraoperative and total transfusions than controls, while improvements in mortality and complication rates are not confirmed when RAP is the sole difference in therapy. Trials noted no significant differences in bleeding, mortality, reexploration, or thromboembolic events, and hemodynamic stability is achieved by physical or pharmacologic means; no recent studies show increased risk from intraoperative RAP, and the risk/benefit ratio is significantly in favor of RAP for patients at risk.

### Risk factors for postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing heart valve surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass [^bad1bb8e]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Before performing intubation, 4 mg/kg of heparin sodium was given intravenously, and 30 mg of heparin sodium was added to the CPB prime solution to wet the tube. After 5 min of intravenous heparinization, activated clotting time (ACT) was monitored, with ACT > 480 s allowing the start of intubation and extracorporeal circulation. During extracorporeal circulation, ACT was recorded every 60–90 min and maintained at ≥ 480 s; 50–100 mg of heparin sodium was added when ACT < 480 s. For nonpulsatile CPB with mild hypothermia, crystalloid St. Tomas cardioplegic solution was prepared and perfused into the body at a ratio of 1:4 with oxygenated blood, with a total amount of 20 ml/kg for the first perfusion, and with the dose of body surface area (BSA)×2.0–2.5 L/min to keep the O 2 flow within 2–2.5 L for maintaining perfusion. The body temperature was monitored by dual channels, and nasopharyngeal and bladder temperatures were both maintained at 32–36 ℃. With bladder temperature as reference, the difference between nasopharyngeal temperature and bladder temperature was maintained at < 2 ℃ during rewarming. CPB flow rate was kept at 2.2–2.8 L/(min·m 2). Invasive mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 50–80 mmHg, arterial partial pressure of oxygen of 150–250 mmHg and partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 35–45 mmHg were maintained throughout CPB.

Anesthetic procedures

Anesthetic procedures were standardized and consisted of an opioid-based anesthetic supplemented with volatile anesthetic and muscle relaxants. All interventions were performed by the same surgical team with wide experience in these surgical interventions. All patients were preoperatively monitored with a pulmonary artery continuous thermodilution catheter (Edwards Lifesciences LLC, Irvine, CA, USA). Neither heparin-coated circuits nor leukocyte filters were used. The extracorporeal circuit consisted of a hardshell membrane oxygenator (Optima XP; Cobe, Denver, CO, USA, or Quantum Lifestream International, Inc. Woodlands, TX, USA), a Tygon™ (Dideco s.r.l. Mirandola, Italy) extracorporeal circuit, and a Medtronic™ Biopump (Medtronic, Inc. Minneapolis, MN, USA) centrifugal pump. Below hypothermic temperatures of 28°C to 30°C, the pump flow was adjusted to maintain a mean arterial pressure of greater than 60 mm Hg and a flow index of 2.2 L/minute per square meter. Myocardial protection was achieved using antegrade, cold, St. Thomas 4:1 sanguineous cardioplegia. The circuit was primed with 30 mg of heparin followed by an initial dose of 3 mg/kg and further doses when necessary to achieve and maintain an activated clotting time of 480 seconds. To reverse the effect of heparin, protamine was used based on blood heparin levels measured by Hepcon ® (Medtronic, Inc.). A blood salvage device (Cobe BRAT2™, Cobe Cardiovascular Inc.TX. USA) was used in all patients. The transfusion trigger was a hemoglobin threshold of less than 8 g/dL, PT of less than 50%, and platelets of less than 50,000/mm3. Fluid management was carried out to achieve 8 to 12 mm Hg of central venous pressure or 12 to 15 mm Hg of pulmonary artery occlusion pressure at zero positive end-expiratory pressure by infusions of crystalloids and colloids. Following our routine practice, we used Ringer Lactate or Saline 0.9% in the intra-operative period. After patient admission to ICU, crystalloids were mainly used and when colloids were infused we most commonly used HES 130/0.4 (Voluven ®), not exceeding 1000 mL in 24 hours.

### Hydroxyethyl starch 6%, 130 / 0.4 vs. a balanced crystalloid solution in cardiopulmonary bypass priming: a randomized, prospective study [^a8db9cc6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Preoperative acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/day was continued in all patients prior to the day of surgery. All patients were premedicated with 10 mg of oral diazepam. Anesthesia was induced with etomidate 2 mg/kg, fentanyl 1 μg/kg, vecuronium 1 mg/kg; isofluorane 1 MAC was used for anesthesia maintenance. Intraoperative arterial and central venous pressure monitorization were done.

The cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit was primed with 1,500 mL of determined solution. In both groups 5,000 units of heparin was added. After anticoagulation with heparin (300 U/kg), activated clotting time (ACT) was kept over 400 seconds. CPB was established using a roller pump with a membrane oxygenator (Dideco Compactflo Evo, Sorin Group, Mirandola Modena, Italy). The average flow rate varied from 2.3 to 2.4 l/min/m 2. Surgery was performed under mild hypothermia (33°C). Mean arterial pressure was kept between 45 to 70 mm Hg. All patients were rewarmed to 37°C (nasopharyngeal temperature) before weaning from CPB. Heparin was neutralized with 1:1 protamine sulfate.

Cold (4–8°C) blood cardioplegia of 1000 mL (25 mEq/l potassium) was administered after aortic cross clamping, and 500 mL repeat doses were given every 15 to 20 minutes (antegrade and from venous bypass grafts, retrograde in patients with left main coronary disease). Terminal warm blood cardioplegia (36–37°C) was given prior to aortic clamp release.

The operation room temperature was kept at 20–21°C.

In postoperative period rate of fluid infusions were adjusted according to hemodynamic measurements. Central venous pressure was maintained between 8–12 mm Hg.

Packed red blood cell was given if the hematocrit level fell below 25%. Fresh frozen plasma and platelet concentrates were administered in cases of documented postoperative coagulation abnormalities (international normalized ratio > 1.5, activated partial thromboplastin time > 60 s and platelet count < 80,000/mm 3) or suspected postoperative platelet dysfunction and factor deficiency.

We surveyed Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists members regarding anticoagulation practices for cardiopulmonary bypass and attitudes on heparin resistance. Of 550 respondents (18.5% response rate), 74.9% (95% CI, 71.3%–78.5%) used empiric weight-based dosing of heparin, and 70.7% (95% CI, 66.9%–74.5%) targeted an activated clotting time of either 400 or 480 seconds to initiate cardiopulmonary bypass. Of note, 17.1% (95% CI, 13.9%–20.2%) of respondents reported activated clotting time targets lower than those recommended by recent 2018 Society of Thoracic Surgeons/Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists/American Society of Extracorporeal Technology guidelines or failed to monitor heparin effects at all. When heparin resistance was encountered, 54.2% of respondents (95% CI, 50.0%–58.4%) administered antithrombin concentrates as a first-line therapy.

Bar graphs of (A) percentage of respondents indicating either empiric weight-based dose or a calculated dose based on heparin dose–response (HDR) curve, which is typically administered before the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and (B) percentage of respondents indicating what the maximum dose of heparin they would give before administering additional therapy to achieve the desired level of anticoagulation for CPB. Doses are given in U/kg. Error bars indicate Wald 95% CIs of the proportion.

For those respondents who used an activated clotting time to determine adequate anticoagulation for CPB initiation, either with or without a heparin level (538 of 550), an activated clotting time value of 480 or 400 seconds was used by 70.7% (95% CI, 66.9%–74.5%). The full range of activated clotting time targets for initiation and maintenance of CPB is provided in Figure 2. Of the 550 respondents, 17.1% (95% CI, 13.9%–20.2%) provided answers inconsistent with 2018 Society of Thoracic Surgeons/Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists/American Society of Extracorporeal Technology guidelines regarding activated clotting time targets for initiation and/or maintenance of CPB.

Specific answers to questions regarding heparin resistance are provided in the Table. In terms of frequency, about half of respondents felt that they encountered it in 1%–10% of the CPB cases they performed. More clinicians administered antithrombin concentrate as a first-line treatment (54.2%; 95% CI, 50.0%–58.5%) compared to those who administered fresh frozen plasma as a first-line treatment (38.4%; 95% CI, 34.3%–42.4%). The majority of respondents were in agreement with the 2011 Society of Thoracic Surgeons/Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists recommendation to use antithrombin concentrate, although about one-third rarely or never utilized it in cases of heparin resistance. The primary reason antithrombin concentrates were not used in this situation was cost being too high and antithrombin concentrates not being on the hospital formulary.

Anticoagulation management

The most commonly used anticoagulant during CPB is unfractionated heparin (UFH). Heparin binds to AT, thereby potentiating the inactivation of thrombin and factor Xa by antithrombin up to 1000-fold. The ACT assesses the effect of heparin on the coagulation system. This is a point-of-care whole-blood coagulation test for the intrinsic coagulation system that is influenced by patient and surgical factors, including temperature, haemodilution, AT levels and platelet counts. Individualized heparin treatment and protamine titration are essential aspects of anticoagulation during CPB. Both of these are discussed in the following sections. As outlined in section 9.3.3, some situations require alternatives to heparin as an anticoagulant.

Individualized heparin treatment and heparin dosage

During CPB, the interaction between blood and artificial surfaces requires systemic anticoagulation to reduce the risk of clotting and thromboembolism. UFH is the most common anticoagulant used for systemic anticoagulation in CPB; its effect depends on sufficient amounts of AT. The current practice for anticoagulation during CPB procedures indicates that an ACT value of > 480 s is considered an appropriate threshold. Therefore, an ACT above 480 s during CPB should be considered in CPB with uncoated equipment and cardiotomy suction. An ACT target before the start of CPB of 480 s with a range of 400–500 has been the recent survey result of current practice among Australian hospitals. However, CPB circuits and different ACT assays can lead to various target values, which are suggested to prevent heparin overdosing during CPB.

METHODS

Survey Creation and Validation

The authors used SurveyMonkey online software (San Mateo, CA) to create a pilot survey, which was administered to members of the Division of Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology at Emory University. Answers pertaining to heparin dosing and antithrombin concentrate usage were compared to known institutional protocols to ensure that the survey instrument was accurately capturing actual clinical practice. The final iteration of the survey had 20 questions and is provided in Supplemental Digital Content 1, Survey. The survey was reviewed and approved by the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesio logists's Research Committee and the Emory School of Medicine's Institutional Review Board. The requirement for written informed consent was waived by both entities.

Survey Distribution

The target population was members of the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists at the "Active" and "Associate" levels, representing licensed physicians actively taking care of cardiac surgical patients. Members at the "Fellow/Resident" and "Career Scientist" levels were excluded. The Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists membership office distributed an electronic link to the survey to all eligible members via an initial e-mail communication on August 2, 2017. Members had approximately 2 months to complete the survey, with follow-up reminder e-mails sent on August 24, 2017 and September 29, 2017. The survey closed on October 1, 2017. Members were asked to complete the survey only once.

Determination of Guideline Compliance

The recent Society of Thoracic Surgeons/Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists/American Society of Extracorporeal Technology guidelines for CPB anticoagulation contain items related to "Heparin dosing for initiation and maintenance of CPB". The recommendations state that a clotting time should be measured and demonstrate "adequate anticoagulation" before initiation and at regular intervals during CPB. Guidance on minimal acceptable activated clotting time values is given as either > 480 or > 400 seconds when whole blood is maximally activated or microcuvette technology is used. Thus, respondents who either did not use activated clotting times or targeted activated clotting times < 400 seconds either before initiation of CPB or during CPB (survey questions 8, 9, and 11) were considered not compliant with these recommendations.

Completion Incentive

Responses were anonymous, but participants had the option of entering an e-mail address into a random drawing for 1 of 10 Amazon gift cards valued at $125 and 1 of 5 annual memberships to the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists (value of $270).

### Avoidance of systemic anticoagulation during intermittent haemodialysis with heparin-grafted polyacrilonitrile membrane and citrate-enriched dialysate: a retrospective cohort study [^d12558be]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Haemodialysis treatment requires anticoagulation or antithrombotic treatment to prevent clotting of the extracorporeal circuit. Strategies which induce systemic anticoagulation should however be avoided in patients with bleeding risks. In this setting, the European Best Practice Guidelines recommend haemodialysis without systemic anticoagulation by using either regular saline flushing or regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA).

Heparin-free haemodialysis with saline flushes requires removal of all air from dialyzer and lines during priming, prevention of air introduction in the extracorporeal system during dialysis and a high blood flow rate. After rapidly increasing extracorporeal blood flows, saline flushes are administered every 15–30 minutes into the pre-dialyzer limb. Saline boluses vary between 25 to 200 mL administered every 15 to 30 minutes. Coagulation in the circuit has been reported with a variable frequency, 5 to 50%, with early termination of the dialysis session in 5 to 7%. Mean treatment duration varied between 3 and 4 hours. Previous reports documented preserved clearance efficiency in haemodialysis using intermittent saline flushes. The recent prospective and randomized HepZero study in maintenance dialysis patients has shown that only half of the 127 patients in the control group, receiving saline flushes of 100–300 mL every 30 minutes or predilution infusion of 1–2 litres per hour in haemodiafiltration, were able to complete 4 hours of dialysis without reaching one of the clotting-related events of the composite endpoint. RCA uses the calcium inhibiting actions of trisodium citrate, infused into the arterial line of the dialyzer, to block the coagulation cascade. Calcium-citrate complexes are cleared into the dialysate and calcium-infusion in the venous return line restores plasma calcium concentration and prevents hypocalcaemia. This strategy is a safe and feasible option for intermittent haemodialysis (IHD) in children and adults with increased bleeding risk. As an alternative approach, a citrate containing dialysate was developed by replacing some of the acetate with citrate. The use of a low-concentrated citric acid (0.8 mmol/L) dialysate does not require additional calcium supplementation, has been proven to be safe, to improve dialyzer clearance and to decrease heparin requirements. The use of a heparin-grafted dialyzer has also been shown to reduce heparin requirements but is less efficient in terms of clotting of the extracorporeal circuit and dialysis efficacy than RCA. A recent prospective and controlled trial showed that use of the heparin-grafted polyacrilonitrile (AN69ST) dialyzer in the absence of systemic anticoagulation was complicated by circuit coagulation in 31.5% of 4-hour dialysis sessions. Our hypothesis is that the combination of a heparinized dialyzer membrane with citrate-enriched dialysate might further reduce clotting risk of the extracorporeal circuit in the absence of systemic anticoagulation. This approach has not been previously investigated, but has been used routinely for IHD of patients considered at increased bleeding risk during admission at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of our institution. The primary endpoint of the present retrospective study was to determine the incidence rate of extracorporeal circuit clotting during haemodialysis sessions with the heparin-grafted AN69ST dialyzer in combination with a citrate-enriched dialysate.

### Managing the coagulopathy associated with cardiopulmonary bypass [^be3041cc]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has allowed for significant surgical advancements, but accompanying risks can be significant and must be expertly managed. One of the foremost risks is coagulopathic bleeding. Increasing levels of bleeding in cardiac surgical patients at the time of separation from CPB are associated with poor outcomes and mortality. CPB-associated coagulopathy is typically multifactorial and rarely due to inadequate reversal of systemic heparin alone. The components of the bypass circuit induce systemic inflammation and multiple disturbances of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems. Anticipating coagulopathy is the first step in managing it, and specific patient and procedural risk factors have been identified as predictors of excessive bleeding. Medication management pre-procedure is critical, as patients undergoing cardiac surgery are commonly on anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. Important adjuncts to avoid transfusion include antifibrinolytics, and perfusion practices such as red cell salvage, sequestration, and retrograde autologous priming of the bypass circuit have varying degrees of evidence supporting their use. Understanding the patient's coagulation status helps target product replacement and avoid larger volume transfusion. There is increasing recognition of the role of point-of-care viscoelastic and functional platelet testing. Common pitfalls in the management of post-CPB coagulopathy include overdosing protamine for heparin reversal, imperfect laboratory measures of thrombin generation that result in normal or near-normal laboratory results in the presence of continued bleeding, and delayed recognition of surgical bleeding. While challenging, the effective management of CPB-associated coagulopathy can significantly improve patient outcomes.

Introduction: Colloids are widely used for volume resuscitation. Among synthetic colloids, hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is commonly administered. In cardiac surgery, priming of the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit with colloids minimizes resuscitation volume and results in less pulmonary fluid accumulation. However, the use of HES has been associated with a higher incidence of renal damage and a higher occurrence of coagulopathy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of low dose (5–10 ml/kg) HES 6% (130/0,4) in CPB pump priming on fluid balance, blood loss, transfusion requirement and occurrence of acute kidney injury.

Methods: In a pre-post design, data from 1120 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB were analyzed. In 560 patients, priming solution consisted of 1250 mL balanced crystalloids, 250 mL mannitol 15%, tranexamic acid 2g and 500 I.E. heparin. For the other 560 patients, 500 mL of the crystalloids were replaced with HES 6% (130/0.4), the other components were the same. Patients were matched 1:1 with propensity score method. The primary endpoint was intraoperative fluid balance. Secondary endpoints were perioperative blood loss, transfusion requirement and the occurrence of acute kidney injury.

Results: In total, 866 patients were analyzed. The HES group showed less positive fluid balance than the crystalloid group (p < 0.001). There was no difference in intraoperative blood loss (p = 0.426) and transfusion requirement (p = 0.442). The occurrence of acute kidney injury was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0,147).

Conclusions: Low-dose administration of 5–10 ml/kg HES 6% (130/0.4) to CPB pump priming decreased intraoperative fluid accumulation without increasing perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirement. There was no effect on the incidence of acute kidney injury. Priming CPB pumps with a low-dose of HES 6% (130/0.4) is an important component for a restrictive volume strategy and might safely be used in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^0b3815c4]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

However, as is increasingly recognized now in adults, it has long been argued that the optimal quantity of dialysis for children cannot be characterized by a single numerical measurement. In addition to the desirable clinical outcomes shared with adults, the therapeutic goals for children and adolescents receiving dialysis include achievement of normal growth, bone maturation and social development, along with avoidance of cardiac compromise and disrupted education. The increasing evidence that dialysis dose and schedule is able to improve cardiac function and outcomes in many of these domains argues for a broader concept of "adequacy" which might best be assessed using a constellation of clinical outcomes, as well as biochemical targets.

Augmented dialysis, with increased frequency in particular, is therefore increasingly advised by clinicians, and despite the obvious drawback of treatment burden, does not seem to reduce quality of life, even in adolescents. It is possible that augmented schedules are optimal for all children, but some groups seem particularly likely to benefit, including those with cardiac dysfunction and those on a liquid diet, in whom it might otherwise be difficult to achieve safe fluid control.

Safe limits appropriate to body size are advocated for many aspects of the extracorporeal circuit, such as a blood flow rate of 5-7ml/min/kg, which is often adequate to achieve dialysis dose with double needles, with arterial aspiration pressures below 200mmHg, to limit endothelial trauma. For single-needle dialysis the highest blood flow rate is obtained using a double pump system (venous flow higher than arterial) monitored by pressure (time pressure regulation), with clamp techniques used to achieve an acceptable compromise between recirculation and blood flow. Consumables appropriate to body size should be selected so that total extracorporeal volume is less than 10% of blood volume, to reduce the volume load with wash-back at the end of the session. System priming with albumin or even blood may sometimes be required for babies and small infants.

### Heparin sodium injection (Heparin sodium) [^6b0e4f45]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients:

2.5 Cardiovascular Surgery

Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes.

2.6 Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism

The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma.

2.7 Blood Transfusion

Add 450 to 600 USP units of heparin sodium per 100 mL of whole blood to prevent coagulation. Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood.

Preoperative care

Eligible patients will receive standard care preoperatively as per local practice.

Anaesthesia and perioperative care

Local protocols for anaesthesia and perioperative care will be used. Anaesthetic maintenance may use either volatile or intravenous anaesthetic agents or both in combination.

Cardiopulmonary bypass will be managed according to local practice. It is expected that patients will undergo non-pulsatile CPB (28°C–35°C), using either a standard or closed venous reservoir, a roller pump, a hollow fibre oxygenator and a non–heparin-bonded circuit. Target flows will be 2.4–2.7 L/min/m 2, with mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) maintained between 60 and 80 mm Hg. Circuit prime will not be standardised; however, volumes and types of colloid and crystalloid solutions administered will be recorded. Intermittent or continuous, antegrade and/or retrograde blood cardioplegic arrest will be performed. Haematocrit will be maintained > 23. Target activated clotting time of > 400 s will be achieved with heparin (300 U/kg as a loading dose) for bypass. Heparin reversal will be achieved with the administration of protamine sulfate in a 1:1 ratio as per standard practice.

Haemodynamic support

The use of inotropes or vasopressors will be at the discretion of the attending physician. Blood products will be transfused using existing unit protocols. Fluid replacement therapy will be as directed according to local practice.

Postoperative care

Intravenous glycopyrolate, atropine, atrial or dual chamber epicardial pacing will be used to achieve a target heart rate (70–110 bpm). The use of inotropes or vasopressors will be at the discretion of the attending physician. Postoperative oliguria, defined as a urine output < 0.5 mL/kg/h for four consecutive hours, will be treated initially with fluid boluses to maintain the central filling pressure > 12 mm Hg, and then inotropes (enoximone, dobutamine, epinephrine) or pressor agents (norepinephrine or vasopressin) as indicated to maintain adequate perfusion pressure (ie, MABP > 80 mm Hg or within 10% of preoperative MABP), or cardiac output (ie, cardiac index > 2.1 L/min/m 2) as determined by appropriate invasive monitoring. Persistent oliguria resistant to these measures may be managed by forced diuresis, using, for example, furosemide. Decisions about discharge from intensive care unit (ICU), high dependency unit (HDU) and from hospital will be made on the basis of existing institutional protocols.

### Perioperative considerations in management of the severely bleeding coagulopathic patient [^57d381ee]. Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiac Surgery with CPB

CPB generates well-described hemostatic activation and acquired coagulopathy that can be complicated by life-threatening bleeding. Up to 10% of cardiac surgical patients will experience major bleeding, and 20 to 40% will receive transfusions, especially if the procedure is a reoperation or complex procedure, or is complicated by numerous other patient and procedural-related factors.–

The etiology of CPB coagulopathy is multifactorial and complex, and may result from interrelated factors. First, hemodilution from CPB circuit prime immediately reduces all factors in the blood, including coagulation factors, inhibitors, and activation biomarkers by 30 to 40%. Second, whole blood loss from surgical bleeding can result in acquired coagulopathy, consumption, and loss of coagulation factors and fibrinogen. Third, tissue factor release into the circulation from exposure to surgical trauma and air activates consumption of coagulation factors and platelets as well as increased fibrinolysis. Fourth, contact activation of the hemostatic system due to the nonendothelial circuit components depletes coagulation factors. If not otherwise contraindicated, systemic heparin is commonly administered as the standard systemic anticoagulant during CPB to bind and activate antithrombin and inhibit thrombin formation. However, thrombin is resistant to the effects of heparin when it is bound to soluble and circuit-bound fibrin, thus necessitating high-intensity dosing of heparin for circuit anticoagulation. Fifth, hyperfibrinolysis from CPB stimulation of endothelial cell release of tissue plasminogen activator leads to plasmin generation, fibrinolysis, and clot lysis. Conversely, a hypofibrinolytic state can also occur postoperatively as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 variably increases into the first postoperative day, predisposing some patients to thrombosis instead of hemorrhage. Sixth, reduced platelet count and function arise from platelet binding via glycoprotein-IIb/IIIa receptors to fibrinogen bound to the CPB circuit. CPB also stimulates platelet activation via protease-activated receptor-1 and -4. Excess plasmin also can partially inactivate platelets through cleavage of their glycoprotein-Ib receptor. Seventh, inflammation may be exacerbated by multiple mechanisms. Surgical trauma and the CPB circuit may upregulate inflammatory cytokines, which cause coagulation factor activation and dysregulated fibrinolysis. A systemic inflammatory response and a procoagulant state also result from activation of neutrophils and monocytes, increasing tissue factor expression while decreasing protein C activity. Factor XII and contact activation contribute to bradykinin release and complement activation, and propagate the systemic inflammatory response. Pericardial blood also contains activated leukocytes, high levels of tissue factor, and cell-derived microparticles generated from multiple cell types and can contribute to a procoagulant state. Residual heparinization from systemic administration during CPB that is not adequately reversed with protamine or heparin rebound after administration can contribute to bleeding. Of note, protamine given in higher dosages than necessary to reverse actual heparin concentrations impairs coagulation. This condition is the basis for measuring heparin levels when using a protamine titration assay such as the Hepcon heparin management system (Medtronic, USA). Clinically, titrated protamine dosing appears to translate in reduced postoperative blood loss and transfusion rates. Thus, potential aggregate mechanisms contributing to inadequate hemostasis after separation from CPB in a bleeding patient may include disturbances in platelet function and thrombin generation, factor depletion, hypofibrinogenemia, and hyperfibrinolysis.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^44a49836]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence Summary

A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs in pediatric and adult patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery was performed. We identified 43 randomized studies (N = 3,862), comparing albumin with gelatin, starches, or crystalloid solutions for priming the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, volume expansion, or both. The majority of the trials were conducted in patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery, with the exception of two RCTs conducted in patients undergoing off-pump cardiac surgery.

Albumin infusion did not result in a lower mortality rate when compared with other fluids (risk difference, 0.00; 95% CI, –0.01 to 0.01; N = 2,711). No differences were found for the rates of kidney failure (risk difference, 0.01; 95% CI, –0.01 to 0.03; N = 1,703), blood loss (mean difference [MD], –0.04 L; 95% CI, –0.04 to 0.01 L), ICU length of stay (MD, –0.12 days; 95% CI, –0.31 to 0.06 days; N = 1,371), hospital length of stay (MD, 0.02 days; 95% CI, –0.95 to 1.00 days; N = 870), blood component use (MD, 0.03 L; 95% CI, –0.03 to 0.08 L; N = 1,547), or cardiac index (MD, 0.07 L/min/m 2; 95% CI, –0.10 to 0.25 L/min/m 2; N = 499). Fluid balance was lower with albumin compared with alternative solutions (MD, –0.55 L; 95% CI, –1.06 to –0.40 L; N = 450). The largest trial enrolled 1,386 patients and compared 4% albumin (20% albumin diluted in Ringer's lactate) with Ringer's lactate for both the pump prime and for fluid resuscitation; albumin-treated patients showed higher rates of bleeding, resternotomy, and infection.

2.2	Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety

Adjust the dosage of HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injections.

Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION therapy, regardless of the route of administration.

2.3	Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin

The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines:

2.4	Pediatric Use

Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants.

There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients:

2.5	Cardiovascular Surgery

Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes.

2.6	Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism

The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma.

### Finding a common definition of heparin resistance in adult cardiac surgery: communication from the ISTH SSC subcommittee on perioperative and critical care thrombosis and hemostasis [^b3a6cf86]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Ensuring adequate anticoagulation for patients requiring cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is important due to the adverse consequences of inadequate anticoagulation with respect to bleeding and thrombosis. When target anticoagulation is not achieved with typical doses, the term heparin resistance is routinely used despite the lack of uniform diagnostic criteria. Prior reports and guidance documents that define heparin resistance in patients requiring CPB and guidance documents remain variable based on the lack of standardized criteria. As a result, we conducted a review of clinical trials and reports to evaluate the various heparin resistance definitions employed in this clinical setting and to identify potential standards for future clinical trials and clinical management. In addition, we also aimed to characterize the differences in the reported incidence of heparin resistance in the adult cardiac surgical literature based on the variability of both target-activated clotting (ACT) values and unfractionated heparin doses. Our findings suggest that the most extensively reported ACT target for CPB is 480 seconds or higher. Although most publications define heparin resistance as a failure to achieve this target after a weight-based dose of either 400 U/kg or 500 U/kg of heparin, a standardized definition would be useful to guide future clinical trials and help improve clinical management. We propose the inability to obtain an ACT target for CPB of 480 seconds or more after 500 U/kg as a standardized definition for heparin resistance in this setting.

Conclusions

In this prospective randomized study, we did not document any difference between HES and crystalloid solutions used for CPB priming regarding postoperative outcomes like postoperative bleeding, renal functions and the use of blood and FFP. The number of used PC was less and the hospital length of stay and ICU stay were shorter in HES group. The results may differ in high risk patient groups and further studies with increased number of patients should be made particularly on patients with renal failure and coagulation disorders.

### Low flow extracorporeal COremoval in ARDS patients: a prospective short-term crossover pilot study [^f3c98a20]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Extracorporeal CO 2 removal

Veno-venous ECCO 2 R was performed with the Abylcap® (Bellco®) device, mounted on a "Bellco" extracorporeal therapy machine. The Lynda® with a theoretical maximal Qb of 400 mL/min was used in the first 7 patients and the Amplya ™ with a theoretical maximal Qb of 500 mL/min in the others.

A dedicated team of intensivists, dialysis nurses, ICU nurses, and perfusionists managed the extracorporeal therapy.

The Abylcap® device contains the Lilliput 2 (LivaNova) oxygenator; this is a polymethylpentene hollow fiber oxygenator, phosphorylcholine coated, with a surface of 0.67m 2 and a priming volume of 90 mL. The priming volume of the entire heparin-coated set without oxygenator is 109 mL. Venous access was obtained preferentially via the femoral vein with a 24 cm, 13.5 French double lumen catheter (Niagara ™, Bard). Blood was pumped through the oxygenator via a non-occlusive roller pump.

Anticoagulation was performed with unfractionated heparin (UFH). After an initial bolus dose of 10 IU UFH/kg, heparin infusion was titrated to achieve an activated clotting time (ACT) of 180–220 s. ACT was measured every 30 to 60 min and once heparin titration was stable, every 4 h. ACT was monitored with the Medtronic ACT plus® system or the Hemochron ® signature elite.

Mechanical ventilation

During the first six hours of the study period, the treating physicians were advised not to change the MV settings. This allowed evaluating the effects of ECCO 2 R alone during this initial study period. From the start of the second "on"-period, MV was left at the discretion of the treating physician; with the only recommendation that of ventilating the patient as lung-protective as possible. Practically, MV settings were aimed toward P PLAT < 25cmH2O and V T < 6 mL/PBW. The "higher FiO 2 and lower PEEP" protocol of the ALVEOLI study was proposed. We recommended setting of respiratory rate lower than 30/min. Inversed ratio was not allowed.

### Anticoagulation management and heparin resistance during cardiopulmonary bypass: a survey of Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists members [^1a1423ec]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our survey of Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists members regarding anticoagulation practices for CPB consisted mostly of clinicians in North America but included a balanced distribution of small-, medium-, and large-volume centers, as well as a close split between programs with and without trainees. Like the survey conducted in 2008 by Lobato et al, we found that empiric dosing of heparin with activated clotting time targets of 400 or 480 seconds is used by the majority of practitioners. Of note, however, is that > 15% of respondents reported using anticoagulation therapy falling outside of recent 2018 Society of Thoracic Surgeons/Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists/American Society of Extracorporeal Technology guidelines; it may be useful to use this number as a starting point to gauge adoption of these recommendations. It is also interesting to note that more clinicians now use antithrombin concentrate in cases of heparin resistance compared to 10 years ago. In conclusion, while anticoagulation targets for CPB, as determined by the activated clotting time, have remained steady over the past decade, antithrombin concentrate utilization has increased when those targets are felt to be inadequately met.

2.6 Converting to Warfarin

To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from HEPARIN SODIUM to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

2.7 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than
Warfarin

For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered.

2.8 Extracorporeal Dialysis

Follow equipment manufacturer's operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available.

### Trends and updates on cardiopulmonary bypass setup in pediatric cardiac surgery [^6cea9b99]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Perfusion strategies for cardiopulmonary bypass have direct consequences on pediatric cardiac surgery outcomes. However, inconsistent study results and a lack of uniform evidence-based guidelines for pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass management have led to considerable variability in perfusion practices among, and even within, institutions. Important aspects of cardiopulmonary bypass that can be optimized to improve clinical outcomes of pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery include extracorporeal circuit components, priming solutions, and additives. This review summarizes the current literature on circuit components and priming solution composition with an emphasis on crystalloid, colloid, and blood-based primes, as well as mannitol, bicarbonate, and calcium.

### Dose estimation for bivalirudin during pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass [^33e094bb]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

A typical adult-based bivalirudin regimen during cardiopulmonary bypass uses a loading dose of 1 mg kg -1 and a circuit prime (volume L × 13 mg) with a subsequent intravenous infusion 2.5 mg h -1 kg -1. Dose in children remains unknown. We wished to determine a practical bivalirudin dosing schedule for children undergoing surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.

Methods

Published pharmacokinetic parameters in children who were anticoagulated for cardiac catheterization using bivalirudin were compared to adult by scaling for size using allometry. An infusion regimen suitable for children was determined using a bivalirudin target concentration (13 mg L -1) common in adults for effect during cardiopulmonary bypass. Predicted bivalirudin infusion rates in children were compared to regimens published as case reports.

Results

Current pediatric bivalirudin infusion rates are based on those used in adults with titration during cardiopulmonary bypass to achieve activated clotting times longer than 400 s. Bivalirudin clearance (mL min -1 kg -1) can be estimated in children by scaling adult parameters using allometry. Clearance decreases through childhood and higher infusion rates in children would achieve target concentration rapidly without the need to titrate initial infusion rate. An infusion rate of 4.5 mg h -1 kg -1 in a 10 kg infant, 4 mg h -1 kg -1 in a 20 kg child and 3.5 mg h -1 kg -1 in a child 30–40 kg will target an activated clotting time slower than 400 s. Adult regimens could be used in those children heavier than 50 kg.

Conclusion

Bivalirudin infusion in children should be started after loading dose at rates greater than those used in adults. Dose in neonates remains uncertain because neither pharmacokinetics nor coagulation pharmacodynamics have been adequately characterized.

In contrast, the use of a Hepcon-based strategy increased heparin dosing in valve surgery compared to an ACT-based strategy. In the Hepcon group, fewer patients showed more than 450 mL blood loss 24 h following surgery. A small study showed that the increase in heparin dosing during a Hepcon-based strategy did not result in less haemostatic activation or postoperative bleeding compared to ACT-based management. In another RCT, Hepcon was compared with calculated heparin doses. This study found higher doses of heparin with Hepcon but no significant benefits in thrombin generation or reduction of bleeding in the postoperative period.

A completely different approach was taken in a study based on the assumption that higher doses of heparin can prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation. The RCT with 269 patients showed that there was no difference in the bleeding rate when comparing groups with higher (450 IU/kg) and lower heparin doses (300 IU/kg) and with HMS-guided dosing. In another RCT (n = 31), significantly higher anti-factor Xa levels were found in the study group with a higher heparin dose (600 IU vs 300 IU) during CPB (anti-factor Xa: 9.38 U/ml vs 5.04 U/ml, P = 0.001). This study was also unable to identify any advantages of higher heparin doses.

For anticoagulation with heparin, it must always be considered that heparin resistance may be present. If sufficient ACT cannot be achieved despite having exhausted all measures, such as the administration of further doses of heparin, AT concentrate or plasma, alternatives must be considered. These would be alternative surgical procedures such as operating without a heart-lung machine or with MiECC.

In summary, individual heparin bolus doses before initiation of and during CPB should be guided by appropriate ACT increases. If patient-specific heparin management systems are available, these can be used to manage more individualized heparin doses. Given the absence of primary end points for perioperative bleeding and transfusion rates in these studies, larger multicentre studies are necessary to evaluate the benefits of individual heparin management in contemporary practice.

VA-ECMO anticoagulation — unfractionated heparin (UFH) dosing, monitoring targets, and event rates are detailed as follows: The most widely used anticoagulant is UFH, with "an initial bolus of 50–100 U/kg" recommended at cannulation, and the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) "recommend[s] an ACT range of 180–220 seconds". In conjunction with activated clotting time (ACT), "target aPTT 1.5–2.5 times baseline and anti-Xa levels of 0.3–0.7 IU/mL may be used", and "Lower goals may be considered with high bleeding risk". Thrombotic events "were reported with anti-Xa levels of 0.09 (0.06–0.25) IU/mL compared with patients with no thrombotic complications at levels of 0.36 (0.26–0.44) IU/mL". For heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), "bivalirudin or argatroban should be considered — heparin must be avoided", and with hemodynamic instability "conservative initial doses and judicious monitoring are warranted". A systematic review/meta-analysis reported major bleeding and thromboembolic events by strategy: "no anticoagulation (0%−91% and 0%−45%)", "a target ACT of less than 180 seconds (0%−35% and 0%−35%)", "a target ACT of more than 180 seconds (0%−9% and 0%−47%)", "an aPTT at target value (32%−38% and 0%−16%)", and "mixed methods of anticoagulation (7%−40% and 0%−15%)", with "Major bleeding events… highest in the postcardiotomy (0%−91%) and eCPR (10%−38%) groups". In postcardiotomy shock treated with VA-ECMO, "central cannulation is associated with increased risks of bleeding and in-hospital mortality compared with peripheral cannulation".

### Hydroxyethyl starch versus ringer solution in cardiopulmonary bypass prime solutions (a randomized controlled trial) [^e2d66c0c]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The heart-lung machine and the corresponding lines must be prepared before beginning the cardiopulmonary bypass procedure. To fill the venous reservoir and the lines with fluid and to sweep away the air particles in the lines from the system, approximately 1500–2000 mL fluid is needed. Balanced electrolyte solutions, starch solutions, gelatin or mixtures of these solutions with predetermined ratios are used.

Prime solutions are solutions which are used to prepare the extracorporeal perfusion line in cardiopulmonary bypass applications. It is prepared with balanced electrolyte solutions with pH and ionic distribution similar to those of the plasma, and sometimes starch solutions, which generally do not contain erythrocytes, are added. In adults, the amount of prime solution is approximately two liters. Blood is not used in prime solutions, except for those used in anemic patients or the infants. Initial experiences with prime solutions which were prepared only with blood were unsuccessful and caused homologous blood syndrome characterized with accumulation of blood in splenic bed and a shock scene.

30% reduction in the renal blood flow accompanies the renal vascular resistance during the cardiopulmonary bypass. Ischemia caused by this condition disturbs the glomerular and tubular functions. Hemodilution has considerable beneficial effects on this situation. It enhances renal blood and plasma flow, free water and creatine clearance, glomerular filtration and the urine volume. It causes significant restoration in the blood flow of renal outer cortex.

Disadvantage of the haemodilution is that it reduces the intravascular osmotic pressure and subsequently, interstitial edema develops. The excessive expansion of the interstitial fluid can have some drawbacks. The foremost drawbacks are the disturbance of the lymphatic drainage and the increase of the interstitial fluid volume. Consequently, malfunctioning of many organs, especially lungs, decrease in pulmonary compliance, hypoxia, peripheral edema, edema in muscles and gastrointestinal system and disturbance of the tissue oxygenation can occur.

This study is aimed to evaluate the effects of the excessive expansion of the interstitial fluid through administering the colloidal HES 130–0,4 instead of the classic method of crystalloid Ringer solution as the prime solution and its leading to interstitial edema and to interrogate the concepts of the increase in bleeding tendency by utilizing similar starch solutions and the unfavorable effects on renal functions.

Argatroban is also a DTI, mainly undergoing hepatic elimination and, therefore, the preferred anticoagulant in patients with renal impairment. Argatroban is typically given intravenously as a bolus of 0.1 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 5–25 μg/kg/min, but the rate can be increased up to 40 μg/kg/min. A bolus of 4 mg argatroban can be added to the prime. Similar to the situation with bivalirudin, monitoring should preferentially be done with ecarin clotting time, but ACT targets of > 450–500 s have been reported. However, both ACT and aPTT responses depend on the reagent and the method. Previous studies have demonstrated increased bleeding and use of blood products after CPB. In contrast to bivalirudin, the removal of argatroban by haemofiltration and HA is negligible.

Alternatives to bivalirudin, such as plasmapheresis or heparin anticoagulation after the administration of platelet antagonists, are used less frequently. Intraoperative therapeutic plasma exchange before re-exposure to heparin in patients with HIT has been described in 24 patients and was not strongly associated with HIT-related thrombosis or death after cardiac surgery with CPB. Furthermore, the use of cangrelor with heparin in patients with HIT was described in a small case series of 3 patients, where it was found to be convenient, safe and an effective alternative intraoperative anticoagulation strategy providing acceptable outcomes.

In conclusion, alternatives to heparin include mainly bivalirudin. Indications for their use are primarily in patients with HIT. The major drawbacks of DTIs are the challenges associated with proper monitoring and the lack of a reversal agent after CPB.

Systemic arterial blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass

Targeting a sufficient MAP during CPB is vital in order to maintain appropriate perfusion pressures in all end-organs, particularly the kidneys, the brain and the gastrointestinal tract. Vasoplegic syndrome during CPB may derive from the release of proinflammatory cytokines, anaesthetic drugs, active endocarditis, systemic inflammatory reaction syndrome and the preoperative use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Hypertension during CPB may be caused by an inadequate level of anaesthesia/analgesia, a release of catecholamines, vasoconstriction due to hypothermia and others.

### Lepirudin as an alternative to "heparin allergy" during cardiopulmonary bypass [^e8b00b93]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Lepirudin might well be recommended to be available in all centers that perform cardiac surgery. Lepirudin, however, is not the ultimate anticoagulant for CPB to replace unfractionated heparin. It requires renal clearance, increases bleeding diathesis and it is also antigenic. It is almost the same size molecule as both protamine and aprotinin. Both of these agents are known for their antigenicity. As per Song et al lepirudin, being a foreign amino acid, will produce its own incidence of allergic reactions.

Bivalirudin could have possibly been alternative therapy especially following increasing evidence on its safety and efficacy. However the current evidence regarding the properties of bivalirudin where not known at the time of the reported case. Retrospectively, taking into account the increased possibility of anaphylaxis after exposure to lepirudin, the unavailability of the ecarin clotting time (ECT) test in some European institutions, and the difficulties we faced in terms of monitoring anticoagulation and postoperative excessive bleeding we would consider bivalirudin rather than lepirudin, in a similar case in the future.

In summary, lepirudin provides effective CPB anticoagulation but induces a higher postoperative blood loss than heparin, especially when ECT test is unavailable. Lepirudin should be restricted to patients undergoing CPB who cannot be exposed to heparin. For future such cases we would endeavor to use the ECT test, in conjunction with aPTT/INR testing for optimal monitor blood lepirudin levels peri-operatively. The drug dose, particularly in the pump prime, should be reduced to the lower recommended level of 0.20 mg/kg. The lepirudin infusion should be adjusted to maintain the INR within the recommended limits. The use a cell-saver post-operatively, in order to process residual pump blood and shed chest-drain blood, should also be considered. This would reduce the post-operative lepirudin levels in transfused blood.

Finally, being adequately prepared for future cardiac surgical patients requiring systemic alternative to heparin anticoagulation, is particularly important, as the incidence of HIT in these patients is expected to increase. This maybe due to the increasing number of hospitalized patients in cardiac wards, awaiting surgical intervention, many of whom would be on Heparin therapy with an increased risk of developing HIT.

### Hydroxyethyl starch versus ringer solution in cardiopulmonary bypass prime solutions (a randomized controlled trial) [^bf403061]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Methods

140 patients have been studied, who were subjected to elective CPB interventions at our Department between February and December 2006. Written informed consent for participation was obtained, and the hospital ethics committee approved the protocol.

Patients with renal insufficiency preoperatively were excluded from this study. The study of 140 subjects with no demographic differences was arranged by separating them as Group 1 consisting of 70 subjects (Ringer solution) and Group 2 consisting of 70 subjects (HES 130–0.4).

To begin the cardiopulmonary bypasses on 70 subjects of Group 1, 1500 mL Ringer solution + 200 mL mannitol + 60 mL sodium bicarbonate + 150 IU/kg heparin was used as the prime solution. On the other hand, to begin the cardiopulmonary bypasses on 70 subjects of Group 2, 1500 mL HES 130–0,4 (Voluven ®; Fresenius Kabi Deutschland GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany) + 200 mL mannitol + 60 mL sodium bicarbonate + 150 IU/kg heparin was used as the prime solution.

Subjects were introduced to the cardiopulmonary bypass by applying 2.2 l/min/m 2 total systemic blood flow at moderate hypothermia of 26–31°C. The hematocrite value of the subjects was kept at 20–25 during the process of cardiopulmonary bypass.

To ensure standardization between the groups, subjects were classified according to age, sex, cross-clamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass duration, coronary bypass number, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, preoperative coronary lesions, executed coronary bypass number and LIMA (Left Internal Mammary Artery) usage. In the morning of the operation day, 12 derivation electrocardiograms of the subjects were executed.

### Postoperative microcirculatory perfusion and endothelial glycocalyx shedding following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass [^b59e3450]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

A Sorin Stockert C5 or a S5 heart‐lung machine with a centrifugal blood pump and a heater‐cooler device (Sorin Stockert Instrumente GMBH, Munich, Germany) was used for bypass with a phosphorylcholine‐coated extracorporeal circuit (P.h.i.s.i.o. The Sorin Group, Mirandola, Italy). The circuit was primed with 1000 mL modified fluid gelatine (Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany), 500 mL lactated Ringer's solution (Baxter BV, Utrecht, the Netherlands), 100 mL 20% mannitol (Baxter BV, Utrecht, the Netherlands), 50 mL sodium bicarbonate 8.4% (Braun Melsungen AG, Germany), 5000 IU bovine heparin and 1 g cefazolin. Cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated after heparin administration (3–5 mg.kg −1) when target activated clotting time (ACT) exceeded 480 s, and supplemental doses were administered if necessary. Myocardial protection was accomplished using 4°C crystalloid cardioplegia solution (St. Thomas cardioplegic solution). Blood flow during bypass was non‐pulsatile and was kept between 2.2 l.min −1.m −2 and 2.6 l.min −1.m −2 with mild hypothermia (34–36°C). At the end of surgery, anticoagulation with heparin was reversed using protamine in a 1:1 ratio to achieve normal activated clotting time and a further 2 g of tranexamic acid was given.

2.7	Converting to Warfarin

To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

2.8	Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin

For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered.

2.9	Extracorporeal Dialysis

Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available.

Fresh frozen plasma transfusions. FFP during CPB has the sole indication of supplementing AT in patients with poor responsiveness to heparin. However, RCTs demonstrated that AT concentrate is more effective than FFP in restoring heparin responsiveness and allows a reduction in FFP transfusions and volume overload, which is also summarized in existing guidelines. Prophylactic use of FFP to decrease perioperative bleeding is ineffective and should be abandoned.

Blood purification

Haemoadsorption (HA) is a method of blood purification based on the adsorption principle of mass separation, utilizing a solid substance. A typical HA device consists of a single-use cartridge used during CPB. Blood is circulated continuously through the device and can theoretically facilitate the elimination of both pro- and anti-inflammatory substances. Circulation through the device is limited to a maximum of 24 h before the device must be replaced.

A notable increase in the number of RCTs and observational studies investigating the efficacy and safety of these devices in cardiac surgery has been seen. These investigations are designed to assess potential advantages in the CPB setting, similar to those previously reported in patients with sepsis in the ICU.

### Heparin versus normal saline for patency of arterial lines [^012b9b25]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

For most patients who require intensive care, the success of clinical decision making and interventions is dependent on the accuracy of different physiological variables measured or obtained from samples using an arterial catheter. Maintaining the patency of these catheters is therefore essential for obtaining accurate measures, minimizing patient discomfort and reducing expenses incurred when an occluded catheter requires replacement. Uncertainty exists amongst clinicians as to best practice surrounding the contents of the arterial catheter flush solution (heparin or saline). The use of heparin is more expensive and is accompanied by significant risks such as haemorrhage, hypersensitivity and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

Objectives

The objective of this review was to evaluate whether normal saline is as efficacious and safe as heparin in maintaining the patency of arterial intravascular catheters in adult patients without a haematological disorder.

Search Methods

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were identified through electronic database searches: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2013, Issue 1, part of The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (Ovid, 1966 to March 2013); EMBASE (Ovid, 1988 to March 2013) and CINAHL (1988 to March 2013), using specific strategies as advised by the Cochrane Anaesthesia Group search specialist. We contacted trial authors to ask for additional information as needed.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized studies irrespective of blinding or language that compared an arterial catheter flush solution comprising any dose of heparin versus an infusion of normal saline only.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened for methodological quality and extracted data from all identified studies that met the protocol inclusion criteria.

Main Results

A total of seven studies (606 participants) met the inclusion criteria and measured the primary outcome of interest. All studies were at unclear to high risk of bias. Given the high degree of clinical and statistical heterogeneity of the included studies, no meta-analysis was completed. The results from individual studies that compared heparin at a dose of 1 to 2 IU/mL under continuous pressure were imprecise and do not provide definitive evidence of a difference. The observed difference with a dose of heparin increased to 4 IU/mL came from only one study of 30 participants, and the quality of the reported data was poor. Similarly. consistency in assessment and reporting of adverse events such as haematoma, insertion site infection and limb ischaemia was poor. Further research with well-defined primary and secondary outcome measures using a stratified sampling process that accommodates for the different heparin doses commonly used in clinical practice is needed to confirm the trends seen in research results now reported in the literature.

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence is of poor quality because of risk of bias and does not provide sufficient information to support the effects of adding heparin (1 to 2 IU/mL) to a maintenance solution (pressurized to deliver 3 mL of flush solution per hour) of 0.9% normal saline in maintaining the patency and functionality of arterial catheters.

Regarding medical management for disseminated intravascular coagulation, more specifically with respect to intravenous heparin, BCSH 2009 guidelines recommend to consider administering continuous infusion UFH in patients with perceived coexisting high risk of bleeding. Consider administering weight adjusted doses (such as 10 mcg/kg/hour) without the intention of prolonging the aPTT ratio 1.5–2.5 times the control. Observe clinical signs of bleeding because monitoring the aPTT in these patients may be complicated.

### Hemostatic effects of a dextran-based priming solution for cardiopulmonary bypass: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^43d382b8]. Thrombosis Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intravascular fluids administered to patients may influence hemostasis. In patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, the heart-lung machine is primed with 1300 mL of fluid. We assessed postoperative coagulation and platelet function in patients randomized to two different priming solutions, one colloid-based (dextran 40) and one crystalloid-based.

Materials and Methods

Eighty-four elective cardiac surgery patients were randomized to either a dextran-based prime or Ringer's acetate with added mannitol. Blood samples were collected before, and 2 and 24 h after cardiopulmonary bypass. Coagulation was assessed by standard coagulation tests and rotational thromboelastometry. Platelet function was assessed with impedance aggregometry. Bleeding volumes and transfusion requirements were recorded.

Results

Comparing the groups 2 h after bypass, the dextran group showed lower hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, platelet count, and fibrinogen concentration, and higher INR and aPTT, as well as longer clot formation time (+41 ± 21% vs. +8 ± 18%, p < 0.001) and a larger reduction in fibrinogen-dependent clot strength (-37 ± 12% vs. -7 ± 20%, p < 0.001). Adenosine diphosphate-dependent platelet activation was reduced in the dextran group but not in the crystalloid group 2 h after bypass (-14 ± 29% vs. -1 ± 41%, p = 0.041). No significant between-group differences in hemostatic variables remained after 24 h, and no significant differences in perioperative bleeding volumes, re-explorations for bleeding, or transfusion rates were observed.

Conclusions

Compared to a crystalloid solution, a dextran-based prime had measurable negative impact on hemostatic variables but no detectable increase in bleeding volume or transfusion requirements in cardiac surgery patients.

2.4 Recommended Dosage for Peritoneo veno us Shunt Scintigraphy in Adults

The recommended activity for peritoneovenous shunt scintigraphy in adult patients is 37 MBq to 111 MBq (1 mCi to 3 mCi) by intraperitoneal injection and the number of particles per single injection should be 200,000 to 700,000 with the recommended number of approximately 350,000. Depending on the activity added and volume of the final radiolabeled product, the volume of the dose may vary from 0.2 mL to 1.9 mL. For calculation of the number of particles to be administered, see Recommended Dosage for Lung Perfusion Scintigraphy in Adult Patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Protamine dosing for heparin reversal after cardiopulmonary bypass: a double-blinded prospective randomized control trial comparing two strategies [^16739d4b]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Drug shortages are a frequent challenge in current clinical practice. Certain drugs (e.g., protamine) lack alternatives, and inadequate supplies can limit access to services. Conventional protamine dosing uses heparin ratio-based calculations for heparin reversal after cardiopulmonary bypass and may result in excess protamine utilization and potential harm due to its intrinsic anticoagulation. This study hypothesized that a fixed 250-mg protamine dose would be comparable, as measured by the activated clotting time, to a 1:1 (1mg for every 100 U) protamine-to-heparin ratio-based strategy for heparin reversal and that protamine would be conserved.

Methods

In a single-center, double-blinded trial, consenting elective adult cardiac surgical patients without preexisting coagulopathy or ongoing anticoagulation and a calculated initial heparin dose greater than or equal to 27,500 U were randomized to receive, after cardiopulmonary bypass, protamine as a fixed dose (250mg) or a ratio-based dose (1 mg:100 U heparin). The primary outcome was the activated clotting time after initial protamine administration, assessed by Student's t test. Secondary outcomes included total protamine, the need for additional protamine, and the cumulative 24-h chest tube output.

Results

There were 62 and 63 patients in the fixed- and ratio-based dose groups, respectively. The mean postprotamine activated clotting time was not different between groups (-2.0s; 95% CI, -7.2 to 3.3s; P = 0.47). Less total protamine per case was administered in the fixed-dose group (-2.1 50-mg vials; 95% CI, -2.4 to -1.8; P < 0.0001). There was no difference in the cumulative 24-h chest tube output (difference, -77ml; 95% CI, 220 to 65ml; P = 0.28).

Conclusions

A 1:1 heparin ratio-based protamine dosing strategy compared to a fixed 250-mg dose resulted in the administration of a larger total dose of protamine but no difference in either the initial activated clotting time or the amount postoperative chest-tube bleeding.

RRT in the context of multi-organ support

The 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline did not address utilization of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R), and left or right ventricular assist device. Several issues remain unresolved: the optimal approach to patient selection, techniques, and timing/indications; circuit integration; and monitoring for ECLS and concomitant blood-purification techniques. Several observational studies on this theme warrant analysis and interpretation. –

Decisions regarding how to combine RRT with ECLS devices will depend on local expertise, technology, and human resources. Such combined treatment should be based on a multidisciplinary approach to patient care and shared decision-making. More studies are needed to define the best strategy for training and practice.

Although different RRT modalities can be used to support patients during ECLS, and comparative studies are not available, because of hemodynamic status, continuous RRT is more appropriate in this setting. It would be useful to develop a registry focused on patients receiving ECLS-RRT, to understand the epidemiology, technology, indications, and complications associated with current practice.

There is no clear evidence that usual RRT indications should vary according to the presence or absence of an ECMO/ECCO2R circuit. Nonetheless, patients for whom ECMO or ECCO2R is required are very sensitive to fluid overload. Therefore, in patients with versus without ECMO/ECCO2R, earlier RRT may be required for preventing and managing fluid overload. A registry of patients combining ECMO/ECCO2R and RRT could improve understanding of current practice for initiating RRT in patients (adults and children) with ECMO/ECCO2R and fluid management. Respiratory dialysis (ECCO2R and ECMO) with modified dialysis solutions is currently limited to in vitro and experimental studies, – and research focused on this technical aspect is needed.

The anticoagulation of RRT circuits when ECMO/ECCO2R is already running is not standardized. The administration of heparin may depend on patient factors (e.g. risk of bleeding), circuit set-up (e.g. connection to patient or to ECMO), and institutional protocols.– It is possible to have RRT circuits without dedicated heparin in this setting, unless excessively frequent clotting is observed. Studies are needed to compare different anticoagulation strategies in this setting. Citrate anticoagulation during RRT added to ECMO/ECCO2R is possible. Its feasibility and performance compared with other forms of anticoagulation remain untested, and thus comparative studies of citrate anticoagulation are recommended.

### Pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic model for unfractionated heparin dosing during cardiopulmonary bypass [^63dd24bf]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Background

High-dose heparin is used during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to prevent thrombosis in the circuits used for extracorporeal circulation. The aim of this study was, initially, to develop a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model to assess the variability of PK/PD parameters and their correlation with the results of the routine haemostatic test activated clotting time (ACT) and thereafter to develop a Bayesian estimator enabling an individualized dosing strategy.

Methods

Fifty consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB were included in the study. Heparin was administered as an initial bolus of 300IU kg -1 followed by additional boluses of 5000IU to maintain ACT < 400s. In total, 361 blood samples were collected. The PK and PD data were analysed using a non-linear mixed effect model.

Results

A two-compartment model with a linear elimination link to an E max model best described heparin anti-factor Xa activities and ACT. Covariate analysis showed that body weight was positively correlated with clearance and central compartment volume. Inclusion of body weight with these parameters decreased their variability by 11 and 15%, respectively. The Bayesian estimator performed well in predicting individual parameters in an independent group of patients.

Conclusions

A population PK/PD analysis of heparin during CPB, using a routine haemostatic test, shows that Bayesian estimation might help to predict ACT on the basis of only one or two blood samples.

### Continuous postoperative pericardial flushing to reduce the risk of postoperative bleeding after elective adult cardiac surgery-a study-level meta-analysis [^4f35ab16]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our meta-analysis, we see comparable demographics and risk scores amongst the CPPF and the conventional care group. The CPPF group had significantly lower rates of post-operative blood loss at 12 h (p-value < 0.00001) and total mean blood loss (p-value < 0.00001), with a reduced rate of surgical re-intervention by 4.7% (p-value 0.10). This is possibly attributable to the higher incidence of anti-platelet and anti-coagulant use in the standard care group compared to the CPPF group, despite having no statistical significance. However, this demonstrates promising results for the safety and feasibility of using CPPF in order to improve bleeding outcomes in the immediate post-operative period.

The post-operative blood loss never exceeded four hundred millilitres in either study, however, Manshanden et al. demonstrated a higher blood loss in both groups compared to the other studies suggesting a role of surgeon dependent haemostasis in the requirement for CPPF vs. standard care chest drainage. Additionally, whether one or both pleural cavities were opened can prolong chest drainage, and the duration of drains in situ could clarify whether clot retention in the pleural cavities could have caused a larger drainage compared to the other studies.

The CPPF group received fewer blood products despite having a lower pre-operative haemoglobin, which could be a result of blood priming rather than crystalloid priming of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit for these patients to pre-emptively control blood loss. Moreover, surgeons may have opted against using cell-salvage for lower risk cases to prevent impaired coagulation as a result of residual heparin which would necessitate post-operative blood product usage.

Moreover, point of care testing of active clotting time (ACT) for heparin reversal, thromboelastography (TEG) and intra-operative rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), can independently predict high blood loss and guide reversal of coagulopathy post cardiac surgery, and perhaps additional doses of protamine and platelets were administered but not included in the final analysis in these studies. Intraoperative ROTEM for example, can identify those patients at high risk of post-operative bleeding who may confer a much greater benefit from CPPF.

### Effects of mannitol on cardiac function and postoperative arrhythmias after coronary artery bypass grafting: a randomized controlled trial [^7cd1a936]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

A post hoc power analysis for the secondary outcome of ventricular fibrillation (VF) was conducted, revealing a power of 55% (Cohen's h = 0.43, n = 45 per group, α = 0.05), indicating the study was underpowered for VF. Approximately 85–100 patients per group would be needed for 80% power. This limitation is acknowledged, as the sample size was calculated for the primary renal endpoint. Consequently, 45 participants were allocated to each group (totaling 90 participants). We acknowledge this as a limitation, since postoperative arrhythmias were analyzed as secondary outcomes in the present study. Random allocation sequence was generated using random number tables. Ninety patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio using sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes to either the intervention or control group, resulting in 45 patients in each group. Prior to patient admission to the operating room, envelopes were opened by an individual solely responsible for preparing the priming solution and randomizing participants. Before surgery, 200 mL of a Mannitol 20% solution were prepared for the Mannitol group, while 200 mL of lactated Ringer's solution were prepared for the control group; the bottles were covered with opaque tape to maintain blinding.

The pump prime for the Mannitol group comprised 200 mL of a Mannitol 20% solution, 900 mL of Ringer's lactate solution, 50 mL of sodium bicarbonate, and 5000 units of sodium heparin. In contrast, the pump prime for the control group consisted of 1100 mL of Ringer's lactate solution, supplemented with 50 mL of sodium bicarbonate and 5000 units of sodium heparin. Cardiopulmonary bypass was performed using the INSPIRE ® membrane oxygenator in conjunction with a roller pump heart-lung machine (Stöckert S5 ®).

The study utilized non-pulsatile flow at a rate of 2.4 mL.m² and moderate hypothermia, maintaining a temperature range of 28–32 °C. The maximum allowable volume of fluid for compensating fluid deficit during cardiopulmonary bypass was set at 1000 mL of Ringer's lactate solution. To ensure cardiac protection, tepid St. Thomas cardioplegia solution was administered. Throughout the procedure, the patient's blood pressure was maintained between 50 and 80 mmHg, while the hematocrit level was kept around 24%.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation / Heart Failure Society of America guideline on acute mechanical circulatory support [^b94b17cf]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Acute mechanical circulatory support — UFH and low-molecular-weight heparin considerations include an activated clotting time (ACT) threshold during suspected device thrombosis. The document states, "Although the use of purge solution without heparin in acute MCS devices is desired, suspected device thrombosis warrants strict compliance with ACT levels of more than 160 seconds". On-page abbreviations define UFH as unfractionated heparin and ACT as activated clotting time.

### Potential drug sequestration during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: results from an ex vivo experiment [^1f14a578]. Intensive Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Using an ex vivo simulation model we set out to estimate the amount of drug lost due to sequestration within the extracorporeal circuit over time.

Design

Simulated closed-loop extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuits were prepared using a 1.5-m2 silicone membrane oxygenator. Group A consisted of heparin, dopamine, ampicillin, vancomycin, phenobarbital and fentanyl. Group B consisted of epinephrine, cefazolin, hydrocortisone, fosphenytoin and morphine. Drugs were tested in crystalloid and blood-primed circuits. After administration of a one-time dose of drugs in the priming fluid, baseline drug concentrations were obtained (P0). A simultaneous specimen was stored for stability testing at 24 h (P4). Serial post-membrane drug concentrations were then obtained at 30 min (P1), 3 h (P2) and 24 h (P3) from circuit fluid.

Measurements and Results

One hundred and one samples were analyzed. At the end of 24 h in crystalloid-primed circuits, 71.8% of ampicillin, 96.7% of epinephrine, 17.6% of fosphenytoin, 33.3% of heparin, 17.5% of morphine and 87% of fentanyl was lost. At the end of 24 h in blood-primed extracorporeal circuits, 15.4% of ampicillin, 21% of cefazolin, 71% of voriconazole, 31.4% of fosphenytoin, 53.3% of heparin and 100% of fentanyl was lost. There was a significant decrease in overall drug concentrations from 30 min to 24 h for both crystalloid-primed circuits (p = 0.023) and blood-primed circuits (p = 0.04).

Conclusions

Our ex vivo study demonstrates serial losses of several drugs commonly used during ECMO therapy. Therapeutic concentrations of fentanyl, voriconazole, antimicrobials and heparin cannot be guaranteed in patients on ECMO.

Table 2.4A — Centrimag anticoagulation outlines timing and targets: After device insertion using cardiopulmonary bypass, anticoagulation is not recommended for 6–12 hours until clotting profile is normalized; after device insertion not utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass, a target activated clotting time (ACT) goal of 200–250 seconds is recommended. Once chest tube drainage is low per institutional protocol for 2–3 hours, anticoagulation with intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) is recommended to target a goal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 60–80 seconds and/or ACT 160–180 seconds; by approximately postoperative day 4, the target aPTT is 70–90 seconds and/or ACT 190–210 seconds. Antiplatelet therapy with 81–325 mg of aspirin per day should be initiated when indicated by improved platelet function, and thromboelastography (TEG) may be used once per day to evaluate antiplatelet needs.
