## Question

What is the role of fluids in acute pancreatitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of fluids in acute pancreatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiologic rationale for fluids in acute pancreatitis. Then, I should verify the historical evolution from aggressive to moderate, goal-directed strategies. Next, I will examine the pivotal randomized trial and meta-analyses. After that, I need to review guideline positions and reconcile any apparent discrepancies. Then, I should define a practical, evidence-based protocol with monitoring and safety checks. Finally, I will consider special populations, summarize the evidence gaps, and synthesize a bottom-line recommendation with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic rationale before jumping to dosing. In acute pancreatitis, third-spacing into the retroperitoneum and peritoneal cavity produces relative hypovolemia, pancreatic microcirculatory failure, and ischemia that can worsen necrosis and organ failure; early isotonic crystalloids aim to restore effective circulating volume and perfusion while avoiding both under-resuscitation and fluid overload, which themselves drive complications like abdominal compartment syndrome and pulmonary edema [^1139JBPT] [^116pv8FU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "more is better". Historically, aggressive early hydration was widely adopted, but emerging data have shifted practice toward moderate, goal-directed resuscitation; the WATERFALL trial, stopped early for safety, showed no improvement in progression to moderately severe or severe disease with aggressive resuscitation and a markedly higher rate of fluid overload (20.5% vs 6.3%), supporting a more conservative approach in most patients [^115n3A9i] [^1119KAhp].

> I should double-check the magnitude and direction of harm signals. Multiple meta-analyses corroborate that aggressive hydration increases fluid-related complications and, in severe disease, may increase mortality; for example, pooled analyses show higher mortality in severe AP with aggressive strategies and two- to threefold higher risks of fluid overload across severities, reinforcing the need for judicious, individualized resuscitation rather than fixed high-rate protocols [^1174KNk7] [^117WvuQt] [^116j7NHh].

> Next, I should review guideline positions and reconcile them. The ACG 2024 guideline recommends moderately aggressive isotonic crystalloid early, with lactated Ringer's preferred over normal saline, frequent reassessment, and caution in patients with cardiac or renal comorbidity; the AGA 2018 guideline supports goal-directed therapy but does not specify fluid type due to low-quality evidence, while advising against hydroxyethyl starch; WSES 2019 emphasizes early crystalloids with frequent hemodynamic reassessment to avoid overload, aligning with a moderate, individualized approach rather than aggressive fixed-rate infusions [^116GHhhq] [^115JvzZw] [^116L3JYz] [^112Q74ZD] [^114989z9].

> Wait, let me verify the fluid type nuance because I initially thought normal saline might be equivalent. Small randomized trials and meta-analyses suggest lactated Ringer's may reduce SIRS, ICU admission, and local complications compared with saline, likely due to less hyperchloremic acidosis and a modest anti-inflammatory effect; however, the overall quality of evidence is low, so the preference for LR is conditional rather than absolute, and NS remains acceptable if LR is unavailable or contraindicated [^117XnEzt] [^116JwP4C] [^116omxCr] [^116L3JYz].

> I will now translate this into a practical, evidence-based protocol, but I need to ensure it is adaptable to severity and comorbidity. Start early, ideally within the first 24 hours; for normovolemic adults without shock, use LR at about 1.5 mL/kg/h with no routine bolus; for hypovolemia, give a 10 mL/kg bolus and then 1.5–2 mL/kg/h; reassess frequently — vital signs, urine output, lung exam, and labs including BUN, hematocrit, and creatinine at 6–8 hour intervals initially; titrate to normalize BUN and hematocrit while avoiding over-resuscitation, and de-escalate promptly once perfusion targets are met; in severe AP with shock, follow septic shock principles with 30 mL/kg crystalloid boluses and early vasopressors as needed, while closely monitoring for fluid responsiveness and complications [^115eXLhn] [^114kcCwV] [^114toRGR] [^1139JBPT].

> But wait, what if the patient is high risk for fluid overload. I need to ensure safety checks are explicit: in older adults, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, favor lower starting rates, smaller boluses, earlier vasopressor support if hypotensive, and consider dynamic assessment or point-of-care ultrasound to guide volume; monitor for intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome, and if intra-abdominal pressure is elevated, prioritize abdominal perfusion pressure targets and avoid excessive fluids [^115kccSY] [^116vXcyX] [^1139JBPT].

> Let me consider special populations. In pediatrics, expert consensus supports crystalloids (LR or NS) with 10–20 mL/kg boluses for compromise and 1.5–2 times maintenance thereafter with urine output monitoring, acknowledging that direct comparative data for LR versus NS are limited in children; in pregnancy, use LR preferentially and maintain a higher index of suspicion for severe disease given physiologic changes; in chronic liver disease, avoid over-resuscitation and consider albumin selectively only if severe hypoalbuminemia with shock persists despite crystalloids [^113ZTm1Z] [^1114qnXo] [^116omxCr].

> I should confirm the strength of evidence and remaining uncertainties. High-quality randomized data remain limited; the WATERFALL trial is pivotal but was stopped early and excluded many severe cases, and most meta-analyses carry low to very low certainty; thus, ongoing questions include optimal infusion rates by severity, precise biochemical endpoints, and whether subgroups (e.g., hypertriglyceridemia pancreatitis) require tailored strategies, underscoring the need for larger, multicenter RCTs and harmonized guideline implementation [^115n3A9i] [^1174KNk7] [^117WvuQt] [^114b4Xg5].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and balanced. Fluids remain foundational in acute pancreatitis to correct hypovolemia and support perfusion, but the strategy has shifted from aggressive to moderate, goal-directed resuscitation using isotonic crystalloids — preferably lactated Ringer's — with frequent reassessment and rapid de-escalation; avoid hydroxyethyl starch, tailor volumes to comorbidity and severity, and escalate to vasopressors rather than excessive crystalloids in refractory shock, as overly aggressive hydration increases fluid overload and may worsen outcomes, especially in severe disease [^116GHhhq] [^115JvzZw] [^115n3A9i] [^1174KNk7] [^117WvuQt].

---

Fluids are the cornerstone of early acute pancreatitis care [^114atUSu] because they **correct hypovolemia** and **preserve pancreatic perfusion**, thereby reducing the risk of necrosis and organ failure [^114atUSu]. Early, moderately aggressive resuscitation with **lactated Ringer's** [^116omxCr] is preferred over saline [^116GHhhq] and should be titrated to clinical and laboratory targets (urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/h, MAP ≥ 65 mmHg, falling BUN/Hct) [^1157R6eE] to avoid both under-resuscitation and fluid overload [^113u9SpL]. Aggressive fluids are harmful, especially in severe disease, increasing fluid overload and respiratory complications without improving outcomes [^116j7NHh]. Fluids should be reassessed frequently within the first 24–48 hours [^114kcCwV] and adjusted to patient response and comorbidities [^115RGnS9].

---

## Pathophysiological rationale for fluid resuscitation

Acute pancreatitis causes **third-space losses** and **pancreatic hypoperfusion**, which can progress to necrosis and organ failure [^1157R6eE]. Early isotonic crystalloids restore intravascular volume, improve microcirculation, and mitigate systemic inflammation [^115RGnS9].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting fluid resuscitation

- **Early hydration**: Early IV hydration reduces morbidity, organ failure, and necrosis [^116miLgj].
- **WATERFALL trial**: Moderate resuscitation (10 mL/kg bolus if hypovolemic, then 1.5 mL/kg/h) [^115n3A9i] reduced fluid overload without worsening outcomes vs aggressive regimens.
- **Meta-analyses**: Aggressive fluids increase fluid overload and respiratory complications without mortality benefit [^1174KNk7] [^116j7NHh].

---

## Recommended fluid type and composition

Lactated Ringer's is preferred over saline because it is a **balanced crystalloid** [^116omxCr] that lowers SIRS, ICU admission, and local complications [^116omxCr] [^117XnEzt]; **normal saline** is acceptable if LR is unavailable but is more often associated with hyperchloremic acidosis and renal injury with large volumes [^116omxCr].

---

## Optimal timing and rate of fluid administration

Start fluids **early**, ideally within 24 hours of presentation [^112oXEQW], and use a **moderately aggressive** approach — 10 mL/kg bolus if hypovolemic, then 1.5 mL/kg/h — titrated to clinical response [^115n3A9i].

---

## Clinical targets and monitoring parameters

Use **goal-directed therapy** [^115f5bKS] with the following targets and monitoring:

| **Parameter** | **Target** | **Monitoring frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| Urine output | ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/h | Every 2–4 hours |
| Mean arterial pressure (MAP) | ≥ 65 mmHg | Continuous |
| Heart rate | < 100 bpm | Continuous |
| Hematocrit (Hct) | 35–44% | Every 6–12 hours |
| Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) | Decreasing trend | Every 12–24 hours |
| Central venous pressure (CVP) | 8–12 cm H2O (if available) | Continuous |

---

Frequent reassessment within the first 24–48 hours [^114kcCwV] enables timely adjustment to avoid overload or under-resuscitation [^114toRGR].

---

## Risks and complications of inadequate or excessive fluid administration

Inadequate fluids increase the risk of **pancreatic necrosis**, organ failure, and mortality [^113KL8R5], whereas **excessive fluids** increase the risk of fluid overload, pulmonary edema, abdominal compartment syndrome, and respiratory failure, especially in severe disease [^1174KNk7] [^115n3A9i].

---

## Special considerations and patient-specific factors

- **Comorbidities**: Use caution in cardiac/renal disease; monitor closely for overload [^115kccSY].
- **Severity**: Tailor volume to disease severity and response; avoid aggressive fluids in severe AP [^116j7NHh].
- **Etiology**: Fluid strategy should consider cause (e.g. biliary, alcoholic, hypertriglyceridemia) [^notfound].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

- **ACG 2024**: Moderately aggressive isotonic crystalloids (prefer LR); reassess frequently; avoid overload [^116GHhhq] [^116omxCr].
- **AGA 2018**: Goal-directed fluids; no recommendation on NS vs LR due to low-quality evidence [^116L3JYz].
- **WSES 2019**: Early isotonic crystalloids with frequent reassessment; avoid overload [^112Q74ZD] [^114989z9].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Aspect** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Fluid type | Lactated Ringer's preferred; normal saline acceptable |
| Timing | Early, within 24 hours |
| Rate | Moderately aggressive: 10 mL/kg bolus if hypovolemic, then 1.5 mL/kg/h |
| Monitoring | Frequent reassessment of urine output, MAP, Hct, BUN |
| Targets | Urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/h, MAP ≥ 65 mmHg, falling BUN/Hct |
| Caution | Avoid aggressive fluids, especially in severe AP or comorbidities |

---

Fluids are essential in early acute pancreatitis to restore perfusion and limit necrosis, but **moderate, goal-directed resuscitation** with LR, frequent reassessment, and avoidance of overload is the evidence-based approach [^113KL8R5].

### Intravenous fluid resuscitation in the management of acute pancreatitis [^114atUSu]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the absence of proven effective pharmacologic therapy in acute pancreatitis, and given its simplicity, wide availability, and perceived safety, intravenous fluid resuscitation remains the cornerstone in the early treatment of acute pancreatitis. Herein, we will review the rationale of fluid therapy, critically appraise the published literature, and summarize recent studies.

Recent Findings

Several observational studies and small clinical trials have raised concern about the efficacy and safety of aggressive fluid resuscitation. Early aggressive fluid therapy among acute pancreatitis patients with predicted mild severity appears to have the highest benefit, whereas aggressive resuscitation in patients with predicted severe disease might be futile and deleterious. Lactated Ringer's solution is the preferred fluid type based on animal studies, clinical trials, and meta-analyses. There is a wide variation of fluid resuscitation approaches in current guideline recommendations, quality indicators, and worldwide practice patterns.

Summary

There is lack of high-quality data that supports the use of early aggressive fluid resuscitation. Large, well designed, multicenter randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the optimal timing, fluid type, volume, rate, and duration of fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis.

### Fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis [^116pv8FU]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is a common inflammatory disorder of the pancreas resulting in considerable morbidity and a mortality rate of approximately 5%. Although there are no pharmacologic treatments known to improve important outcomes, aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation generally is recommended in all patients. However, few human investigations have been performed and several important questions have not been answered. For example, what is the optimal resuscitative fluid? Is there a role for colloid solutions? To what clinical marker should resuscitation be targeted? When is the best time to start such fluids and in which group of patients? This review describes the microcirculation of the pancreas and the pathophysiologic alterations caused by acute pancreatitis. Previous animal experiments are described, as are the limited human studies specifically addressing fluid resuscitation. Finally, current recommendations and goals for further investigation are highlighted. It is our hope that this review will stimulate interest in this often overlooked subject and lead to carefully designed human clinical trials using varying fluid solutions and rates, with an emphasis on patient monitoring and safety, in the near future.

### Advances in management of acute pancreatitis [^112zBwog]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

This article reviews advances in the management of acute pancreatitis. Medical treatment has been primarily supportive for this diagnosis, and despite extensive research efforts, there are no pharmacologic therapies that improve prognosis. The current mainstay of management, notwithstanding the ongoing debate regarding the volume, fluid type, and rate of administration, is aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation. Although antibiotics were used consistently for prophylaxis in severe acute pancreatitis to prevent infection, they are no longer used unless infection is documented. Enteral nutrition, especially in patients with severe acute pancreatitis, is considered a cornerstone in management of this disease.

### Fluid therapy in acute pancreatitis: anybody's guess [^114uRQKj]. Annals of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to systematically review and evaluate the quality of current evidence about fluid therapy (FT) in acute pancreatitis (AP).

Background

Intravenous FT is thought to be important in the early management of patients with AP. Clinically relevant questions remain regarding the type of fluid, the rate of administration, and the goal of FT.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search for human studies was performed using online databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library). The quality of the entire body of evidence was then graded according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group guidelines in relation to 3 key areas: type of fluid, rate of fluid administration, and goal-directed FT.

Results

The initial search yielded 410 studies, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria. Only 2 randomized studies compared types of fluids. Nine studies looked at aggressive versus nonaggressive resuscitation protocols, of which 4 concluded that an aggressive approach yielded better outcomes and 5 concluded that a nonaggressive approach was better. Two studies investigated goal-directed FT, using different goals; one demonstrating benefit and the other none. Analysis of the body of evidence as per the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group revealed that the majority of evidence was of low or very low quality.

Conclusions

FT is considered a cornerstone of the early management of patients with AP and yet the evidence on which it is based remains paltry and of poor quality. This systematic review has demonstrated the equipoise necessary for the design of randomized controlled trials to answer pressing questions relating to the type of fluid, the rate of administration, and how FT should be guided.

A great deal of progress has been made in the last 50 years in the diagnosis and treatment of acute pancreatitis. Many landmark studies have been published and have focused on the classification of acute pancreatitis, markers of severity, important roles of imaging and endoscopy, and improvements in our treatment. This report will review several landmark studies, describe ongoing controversies in management decisions including standards of early fluid resuscitation and appropriate use of enteral feeding, and outline what will be required in the future to improve the care of patients with acute pancreatitis.

### Fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis [^11411mFS]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of the review is to critically evaluate the evidence from the literature to establish the current perspective on fluid resuscitation (FR) in acute pancreatitis (AP). We will review the rationale, type of fluid, rate of administration, total volume, duration, monitoring, ideal outcomes to be studied in clinical trials and recommendations for future studies.

Recent Findings

FR remains the key component of supportive therapy in AP. The paradigm has shifted from administration of aggressive fluid resuscitation towards more moderate FR strategies. Lactated Ringer's remains the preferred fluid for resuscitation. There remain critical gaps in knowledge regarding the end point(s) to indicate adequate resuscitation, and accurate assessments of fluid sequestration and intravascular volume deficit in AP.

Summary

There is insufficient evidence to state that goal-directed therapy, using any of the parameters to guide fluid administration, reduces the risk of persistent organ failure, infected pancreatic necrosis, or mortality in AP, as well as the most appropriate method for the same.

### Current controversies in fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis: a systematic review [^116LM2vd]. Pancreas (2012). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common inflammatory disorder of the pancreas resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality. Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation generally is recommended in all patients with AP and remains the cornerstone of management of these patients. However, the optimal rate, type, and the goal of resuscitation remain unclear. The purpose of this review was to give an insight about the pathophysiologic alterations in the pancreatic microcirculation that occur in AP, the markers for early recognition of severity of pancreatitis, the optimal fluid, and timing and extent of fluid resuscitation. An early elevated hematocrit, blood urea nitrogen, or creatinine should prompt clinicians to institute more intensive early resuscitation measures. Crystalloids are the currently recommended fluids for management of these patients. Current studies are underway to determine the optimal end points of fluid resuscitation that determine outcome.

### Gaps and uncertainties in the management of acute pancreatitis: a scoping review and quality assessment of clinical practice guidelines [^112w68d8]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Further, there were no recommendations highlighted in the palliation domain across the different CPGs. Although AP is often considered a self-limiting condition, patients with severe or necrotising disease may experience a high symptom burden, prolonged hospital stays, and significant morbidity. In such cases, a palliative approach that is focussed on symptom management, quality of life, and supportive care may be needed. For instance, pain management remains a cornerstone of treatment, particularly in patients with persistent abdominal pain despite resolution of the acute episode. In addition to opioids and adjunctive analgesics, multimodal pain relief strategies, including regional anaesthesia and non-pharmacological interventions, should be considered. Nutritional support also plays a role in palliation, especially for patients who develop pancreatic insufficiency or experience recurrent AP episodes that impact their nutritional status. Early enteral feeding is recommended in severe cases, but in patients with long-term complications, dietary modifications and enzyme supplementation may be required to maintain nutritional balance and prevent weight loss. In rare cases where acute pancreatitis progresses to multisystem organ failure, discussions regarding goals of care and end-of-life decision-making may be necessary. For patients with refractory AP or those at high risk of mortality, palliative care services can provide holistic support, addressing not only symptom relief but also psychological and family-centred concerns. While palliation is not a primary focus of AP management, incorporating symptom-based supportive care principles in severe or chronic cases may improve overall patient well-being. Further research is needed to explore the role of palliative care in AP, particularly in patients with recurrent or treatment-resistant disease.

The majority of recommendations exist for in-hospital management or treatment. Despite this, historical shifts in recommendations for fluid resuscitation and antibiotic use offer a compelling case study illustrating guideline variability driven by evolving evidence. One of the most debated areas is early fluid resuscitation. Earlier guidelines often recommended aggressive fluid resuscitation to prevent hypoperfusion-related pancreatic necrosis; however, more recent evidence suggests that excessive fluid administration may contribute to complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome and increased mortality. As a result, some recent guidelines advocate for a more conservative, goal-directed fluid resuscitation strategy. Similarly, the use of prophylactic antibiotics in AP remains controversial. Initial recommendations favoured broad antibiotic use to prevent infected pancreatic necrosis, but subsequent randomised controlled trials failed to demonstrate a mortality benefit. Consequently, more recent guidelines recommend selective antibiotic use based on clinical deterioration rather than routine prophylaxis. These changes highlight the importance of continuously updating guidelines to reflect the latest evidence, ensuring that recommendations are both safe and effective.

### What's new in the management of severe acute pancreatitis? [^112posCB]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

What is new in therapy?

Several interventions have been identified as critical within 48 h, here in particular fluid resuscitation, analgesia and nutritional support.

Fluid therapy

Sustainable scientific and in particular clinical data on how to guide fluid therapy in this disease are still scarce. A recent review underlined the concept of early aggressive resuscitation, guided by the clinical estimation, and the assessment of BUN and haematocrit levels. Recent results from a small retrospective single-centre cohort study seem to support such an aggressive approach in severe AP, whereas data from another, but prospective study reported that excessive hydration (10–15 ml/kg/h), where the goal was set to obtain a haematocrit of 35%, resulted in increased organ failure, respiratory insufficiency and mortality. Whether guiding fluid therapy by cardiac output measurements and/or assessment of fluid responsiveness will lead to improvements in the management of this important therapeutic action with positive effects of outcome, as shown in recent experimental studies, needs to be confirmed in clinical settings.

Analgesia

Because of the severity of pain in severe AP, opioids are widely used. However, there is still uncertainty whether their side effect of inducing spasms of the smooth muscles may hide the resolution of the disease or even induce additional pain. Data of a recent Cochrane analysis do not support those concerns, but, as stated by the authors, this analysis is founded only on a very limited number of heterogeneous trials (Cochrane Database Syst Rev Jul 26;7:CD009179).

Epidural anaesthesia, which by far would be most effective in pain control, seems to beneficially influence the course of disease by improving pancreatic microcirculation and tissue oxygenation. However, concerns with regard to concomitant derangements of coagulation and systemic inflammation so far have prevented its broader clinical use.

### Editorial: fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis: striking the right balance [^111FWNnW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Fluid resuscitation is a key component of the early management of acute pancreatitis. Current clinical practice guidelines recommend aggressive fluid resuscitation despite limited prospective data. In this month's issue of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, de-Madaria et al. present findings from a prospective cohort study that evaluate the relationship between early resuscitation parameters and several important outcome measures. Their findings challenge several of our long held beliefs regarding the benefits of vigorous fluid resuscitation in the early phase of acute pancreatitis. Findings from this study along with several others now suggest that a more tailored approach to resuscitation is needed.

### Early management of acute pancreatitis: a review of the best evidence [^1153uDeL]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2017). Low credibility.

In the 20th century early management of acute pancreatitis often included surgical intervention, despite overwhelming mortality. The emergence of high-quality evidence (randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses) over the past two decades has notably shifted the treatment paradigm towards predominantly non-surgical management early in the course of acute pancreatitis. The present evidence-based review focuses on contemporary aspects of early management (which include analgesia, fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, nutrition, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) with a view to providing clear and succinct guidelines on early management of patients with acute pancreatitis in 2017 and beyond.

### Effect of aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation versus nonaggressive fluid resuscitation in the treatment of acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1174KNk7]. Pancreas (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Despite the need for active fluid therapy, fluid management of most acute pancreatitis (AP) cases is still supportive. The aim of this review is to compare the effect of aggressive versus nonaggressive intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation in the treatment of acute pancreatitis.

Methods

A systematic search of medical databases, such as Medline, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Cochrane Central, was conducted for publication until April 2022. We included randomized controlled trials or cohort (prospective and retrospective) studies reporting the outcomes of AP in patients that were managed with aggressive and nonaggressive IV fluid resuscitation. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality.

Results

Fourteen trials involving 3423 acute pancreatitis patients were included in the review. We did not observe any differences in the risk of mortality, persistent organ failure, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome in both study groups. However, there was an increased risk of development of pancreatic necrosis, renal failure, and respiratory failure in the aggressive fluid therapy group compared with nonaggressive therapy. The funnel plot showed no publication bias.

Conclusions

Aggressive fluid therapy did not improve mortality rates in acute AP patients and was associated with an increased risk of acute renal failure, and respiratory failure.

### The "golden hours" of management in acute pancreatitis [^113wTtMW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

In the past decade, a significant amount of active and enthusiastic research has changed the way we treat acute pancreatitis (AP) within the first 24 hours of presentation. We highlight the importance of rapid initiation of treatment to help prevent the considerable morbidity and mortality that can occur when interventions are delayed. We review recent data that validate simple and accurate tools for prognostication of AP to replace the older, more tedious methods that relied on numerous factors and required up to 48 hours to complete. Additionally, we aim to provide evidence-based guidelines and end points for fluid resuscitation. Finally, we hope to bring clarification to two previously controversial topics in AP treatment: the use of prophylactic antibiotics and early endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

### Management of severe acute pancreatitis [^11261Tni]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

The risks, measurements of severity, and management of severe acute pancreatitis and its complications have evolved rapidly over the past decade. Evidence suggests that initial goal directed therapy, nutritional support, and vigilance for pancreatic complications are best practice. Patients can develop pancreatic fluid collections including acute pancreatic fluid collections, pancreatic pseudocysts, acute necrotic collections, and walled-off necrosis. Several randomized controlled trials and cohort studies have recently highlighted the advantage of managing these conditions with a progressive approach, with initial draining for infection followed by less invasive techniques. Surgery is no longer an early intervention and may not be needed. Instead, interventional radiologic and endoscopic methods seem to be safer with at least as good survival outcomes. Newly developed evidence based quality indicators are available to assess and improve performance. Development and clinical testing of drugs to target the mechanisms of disease are necessary for further advancements.

Acute pancreatitis initial management — We suggest moderately aggressive fluid resuscitation for patients with AP and note that additional boluses will be needed if there is evidence of hypovolemia (Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest using lactated Ringer solution over normal saline for intravenous resuscitation in AP (Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on Initial management of acute pancreatitis [^116L3JYz]. Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) — AGA guideline recommendation 1A states that in patients with AP, the AGA suggests using goal-directed therapy for fluid management, with a conditional recommendation and very low quality evidence, and the AGA makes no recommendation whether normal saline or Ringer's lactate is used. The technical review identified a total of 7 randomized trials on fluid resuscitation, with 4 primarily addressing goal-directed targeted therapy, and goal-directed therapy is defined as titrating intravenous fluids to targets such as heart rate, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, urine output, blood urea nitrogen concentration, and hematocrit. Compared to non-targeted therapy, goal-directed therapy did not result in significantly improved mortality, prevention of pancreatic necrosis, or decrease in the rate of persistent multiple organ failure, and the panel issued a conditional recommendation suggesting the use of judicious goal-directed fluid therapy over other methods while recognizing potential harms of overly aggressive fluid therapy including respiratory complications and abdominal compartment syndrome. Due to the lack of randomized controlled trial evidence addressing the optimal initial rate, volume, and duration of fluid resuscitation, the panel was unable to make specific recommendations on these parameters, and it could not make a recommendation regarding use of Ringer's lactate versus normal saline for resuscitation based on the low quality of evidence.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^115JvzZw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) — initial intravenous hydration: We suggest moderately aggressive fluid resuscitation for patients with AP, with additional boluses if there is evidence of hypovolemia (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence), and we suggest using lactated Ringer solution over normal saline for intravenous resuscitation in AP (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). While we suggest all patients receive moderately aggressive isotonic crystalloid, caution is needed if cardiovascular and/or renal comorbidity exists and patients should be monitored for volume overload. Fluid resuscitation is likely more important early in the disease (within the first 24 hours), and fluid volumes need to be reassessed within 6 hours of presentation and for the next 24–48 hours with a goal to decrease the blood urea nitrogen (BUN). There is a general consensus that treating a patient with mild disease early in the course with early aggressive or moderately aggressive hydration is beneficial.

Abstract

Acute pancreatitis and management of its complications is a common consult for the acute care surgeon. With the ongoing development of both operative and endoscopic treatment modalities, management recommendations continue to evolve. We describe the current diagnostic and treatment guidelines for acute pancreatitis through the lens of acute care surgery. Topics, including optimal nutrition, timing of cholecystectomy in gallstone pancreatitis, and the management of peripancreatic fluid collections, are discussed. Although the management severe acute pancreatitis can include advanced interventional modalities including endoscopic, percutaneous, and surgical debridement, the initial management of acute pancreatitis includes fluid resuscitation, early enteral nutrition, and close monitoring with consideration of cross-sectional imaging and antibiotics in the setting of suspected superimposed infection. Several scoring systems including the Revised Atlanta Criteria, the Bedside Index for Severity in Acute Pancreatitis score, and the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grade have been devised to classify and predict the development of the severe acute pancreatitis. In biliary pancreatitis, cholecystectomy prior to discharge is recommended in mild disease and within 8 weeks of necrotizing pancreatitis, while early peripancreatic fluid collections should be managed without intervention. Underlying infection or ongoing symptoms warrant delayed intervention with technique selection dependent on local expertise, anatomic location of the fluid collection, and the specific clinical scenario. Landmark trials have shifted therapy from maximally invasive necrosectomy to more minimally invasive step-up approaches. The acute care surgeon should maintain a skill set that includes these minimally invasive techniques to successfully manage these patients. Overall, the management of acute pancreatitis for the acute care surgeon requires a strong understanding of both the clinical decisions and the options for intervention should this be necessary.

### Pharmacologic management and prevention of acute pancreatitis [^113u9SpL]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present article will focus in pharmacologic agents that have been studied to improve acute pancreatitis outcomes, and to prevent the disease at different levels.

Recent Findings

Too little and too much early fluid resuscitation can be harmful. The optimal volume, rate, and duration of intravenous fluid therapy is still unknown. Nonopioid analgesics should be the first line of analgesia in patients with acute pancreatitis. A few pharmacologic agents evaluated in acute pancreatitis have resulted in positive pilot trials; however, larger randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are needed before final conclusions. Statin use is associated with lower incidence of acute pancreatitis in the general population and ongoing studies are evaluating its preventive role in acute pancreatitis recurrences. The preventive role of rectal indomethacin in post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis is indisputable, with subject selection and timing of administration requiring further investigation.

Summary

There is still no proven effective disease-specific pharmacologic therapy that changes the natural history of acute pancreatitis. New therapeutic targets and pharmacologic agents are in the horizon. Careful refinement in study design is needed when planning future RCTs. There is also a need for drug development aiming at reducing the incidence of the disease and preventing its sequelae.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis of currently existing RCTs indicates that aggressive intravenous hydration protocols increased the mortality risk in severe AP and the fluid-related complication risk in both severe and non-severe AP. Our findings highlighted the clinical importance of a more conservative approach to fluid therapy for AP in order to mitigate excessive risk of avoidable side effects and mortality.

### Initial management of acute pancreatitis [^116er2aE]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

The initial management of acute pancreatitis (AP) is continually evolving. Goal-directed moderate fluid resuscitation is now preferred over more aggressive strategies. Antibiotics should be administered only when there is a proven or highly probable infection rather than for prophylactic purposes. Urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography would be beneficial for patients with acute cholangitis. Same-admission cholecystectomy for mild biliary PA is safe, efficiently prevents relapse, and is associated with lower costs compared with interval cholecystectomy. Ongoing research into novel pharmacologic treatments and strategies is essential for further advancements in AP management.

### Evaluating the efficacy of different volume resuscitation strategies in acute pancreatitis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117F37CN]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Even though physicians continue to recommend low-, moderate-, and high-rate fluid resuscitation to patients, the study concluded that high fluid infusion rates accorded the best clinical outcomes for patients with pancreatitis. High versus low rates were associated with reduced SIRS risk incidence and shortened hospital length of stay among the patients. Low certainty evidence also supported moderate fluid administration as a starting point for pancreatitis patients with initial manifestations.

Generally, owing to the lack of robustness of studies that vividly and analytically provided a uniform comparison between low vs. moderate vs. high fluid therapy, this study recommends further research, including studies with high methodological quality, to validate the findings of this study. Specifically, there is a need for studies reporting clinical outcomes with low, moderate, and high fluid infusion rates in patients with different AP severity to assess any potential relationship between fluid infusion rate and disease severity. In addition, future studies investigating the effect of different types of fluids in AP are required.

### Evaluating the efficacy of different volume resuscitation strategies in acute pancreatitis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115eWMtd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an acute inflammation of the pancreas and one of the leading global causes of hospitalization for gastrointestinal complications. Heckler et al. indicated that approximately 20% of AP cases usually progress to severe pancreatitis, leading to pancreatic necrosis and multi-organ failure; hence, the reason for the continued increase in mortality rate is currently estimated to be 40%. For instance, pancreatic necrosis is mainly characterized by fluid loss due to hypoperfusion, splanchnic vasoconstriction, and reduced blood flow into the pancreas. Accordingly, reduced blood flow premediates compromised microcirculation within the pancreas, which plays a significant role in the development of necrotizing pancreatitis.

Over the years, fluid resuscitation or adequate fluid resuscitation has been labeled as the main management approach for the early onset of acute pancreatitis, coupled with early oral feeding and pain management. For instance, with its significant role in minimizing mortality, scholars have suggested that early fluid resuscitation seamlessly prevents and limits pancreatic necrosis, inhibits prevalent multi-organ failure, minimizes the systemic inflammatory response, and enhances microcirculation in the pancreas.

### National survey of fluid therapy in acute pancreatitis: current practice lacks a sound evidence base [^116ts124]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Fluid therapy (FT) is a critical intervention in managing acute pancreatitis (AP). There is a paucity of evidence to guide FT and virtually no data on current prescribing practice. This survey aims to characterize current practice and opinion with regard to FT in AP throughout New Zealand.

Methods

Information was collected on fluid selection, administration, and goal-directed FT. The survey was distributed online and in print to all doctors employed in General Surgery Departments in New Zealand on 1 May 2012. Monthly email reminders were sent for 6 months.

Results

The overall response rate was 47% (n = 190/408). Crystalloids were the preferred initial fluid for all categories of severity; however, colloid use increased with severity (p < 0.001). Fluid volume also increased with severity (p = 0.001), with 74% of respondents prescribing > 4 L for AP with organ failure (OF). Clinicians treating 26–50 patients per year with AP were less likely to prescribe colloid for AP with OF (8 vs 43%) (p = 0.001). Rate of fluid administration in AP with OF varied according to physicians' seniority (p = 0.004); consultants prescribed > 4 L more than other groups (83 vs 68%). Only 17% of respondents reported the use of guidelines.

Conclusions

This survey reveals significant variation in prescription of FT for AP, and aggressive FT is commonly prescribed for AP with OF. There is little adherence to published guidelines or best available evidence.

Intensive care unit

Questions:
Which are the indications for intensive care unit (ICU) admission?
When is fluid resuscitation indicated and which fluid should be used? What is the optimal fluid infusion rate and response measurement for initial resuscitation? What is the preferred pharmacologic approach to persistent shock?
What is the correct approach for pain control?
Which are the indications for mechanical ventilation?
What is the medical approach to the abdominal compartment syndrome? What is the role of medications such as Gabexate Mesilate and somatostatin analogues?
Enteral nutrition: which are the indications, what type of nutrition should be used, and which is the best way to administer enteral nutrition?

Statement (monitoring)

Continuous vital signs monitoring in high dependency care unit is needed if organ dysfunction occurs. Persistent organ dysfunction or organ failure occurrence despite adequate fluid resuscitation is an indication for ICU admission (1C).

Discussion

The worldwide heterogeneity in intensive and intermediate care unit settings makes it difficult to define universal pathways. There is no single marker able to define the severity of the illness. Several scoring system should be used to assess the severity in a different phase, place, and patient.

Extensive fluid administration, adequate pain management with potentially harmful strategies, and organ function evaluation during initial treatment are the reason why continuous vital signs monitoring is crucial, whatever the setting is. Persistent organ dysfunction despite adequate fluid resuscitation needing specific organ support is usually delivered only in ICUs.

Statement (fluid resuscitation)

Early fluid resuscitation is indicated to optimize tissue perfusion targets, without waiting for hemodynamic worsening. Fluid administration should be guided by frequent reassessment of the hemodynamic status, since fluid overload is known to have detrimental effects. Isotonic crystalloids are the preferred fluid (1B).

Discussion

The decrease in mortality observed over the last decade might be due to the prevention of pancreatic necrosis by maintenance of microcirculation due to more extensive fluid resuscitation. Data on the amount of fluid needed to prevent necrosis or to improve outcome are contradictory and the volume must be adjusted to the patient's age, weight, and pre-existing renal and/or cardiac conditions.

Hematocrit, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate are laboratory markers of volemia and adequate tissue perfusion, and should be monitored. Ringer's lactate may be associated with anti-inflammatory effect, but the evidence for superiority of Ringer's lactate vs. normal saline based on randomized trials is weak. It could be better in correcting the potassium level. The value of early goal-directed therapy in patients with acute pancreatitis remains unknown.

### Evaluating the efficacy of different volume resuscitation strategies in acute pancreatitis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115y6Y62]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite fluid resuscitation showing phenomenal treatment outcomes, there are yet exorbitant uncertainties in choosing the most appropriate fluid type and volumetric rates that maximize patient outcomes when administered. Blood products, colloids such as albumin, gelatin solutions, hydroxyethyl starch, and crystalloids, including normal saline and Ringer's lactate, are considered fluid types for achieving fluid resuscitation. Generally balanced crystalloid such as Ringer's lactate is considered ideal for aggressive fluid replacement therapy for critically ill patients including those with AP.

Notwithstanding, the rate of fluid resuscitation is the epitome of controversy since literature has witnessed the administration of either low, moderate, or high rates of fluid resuscitation, which contribute to different clinical outcomes. Proponents of high fluid therapy position that high-rate fluid resuscitation therapy significantly reduces mortality in patients with pancreatitis. On the other hand, opponents of the latter argue that high-rate fluid therapy potentially causes fluid overload, further worsening or precipitating respiratory and cardiac failure. Moreover, studies investigating the clinical outcomes of low-rate fluid resuscitation reported better clinical outcomes, including bolstered tissue perfusion, minimized mortality, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and reduced hospital stay. The discrepancy in infusion rates of intravenous resuscitation fluid therapy is also evident across some of the major guidelines of the international association. For instance, renowned guidelines, IAP/APA evidence-based guidelines for managing acute pancreatitis, and American College of Gastroenterology guidelines for managing acute pancreatitis also show contradictions concerning fluid therapy infusion rates. Similarly, systematic reviews have highlighted the uncertainties and discrepancies attributed to fluid resuscitation administration rates in patients with acute pancreatitis.

Owing to its perceived safety, wide and ready availability, low cost, and simplicity, intravenous fluid therapy in the treatment of acute pancreatitis, this study sought to address the knowledge gap pertaining to the lack of conclusive evidence for an informed fluid resuscitation infusion rate that maximizes clinical outcomes for patients with pancreatitis. In this context, the current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to systematically collate and appraise evidence through outcome assessments on the efficacy of low, moderate, or high infusion rates of fluid resuscitation to inform on the most appropriate infusion choice for acute pancreatitis patients.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes between aggressive and non-aggressive intravenous hydration for acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111MCj13]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is one of the most frequent and critical gastrointestinal diseases resulting in hospital admissions worldwide. The global incidence and mortality of acute pancreatitis is estimated at 34 cases per 100,000 person-years and 1.6 deaths per 100,000 person-years, respectively, and the incidence has been reported to be rising in recent years. Appropriate initial management decisions for AP can significantly affect the disease course and hospitalization duration.

According to a number of international guidelines, early fluid resuscitation with predominantly isotonic crystalloid (i.e. normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution) is widely indicated for AP management to prevent hypovolemia and organ hypoperfusion, without waiting for hemodynamic worsening. However, the guidelines for the design of fluid resuscitation protocols remain inconsistent when it comes to the infusion rate. For example, the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines suggest that aggressive intravenous hydration (250–500 ml/hour) should be given to all patients with AP in the first 12–24 h unless cardiovascular and/or renal comorbidities exist. For severe AP, the Italian Association for the Study of the Pancreas (AISP) suggests early aggressive hydration at 2 ml/kg/h, with an initial bolus of 20 ml/kg within 30–45 min in the first 24 h. However, the guidelines of the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and experts from ACG's Acute Pancreatitis Task Force suggest a goal-directed fluid therapy, but are unable to make specific recommendations on the optimal initial rate of fluid resuscitation in AP, due to the paucity of evidence.

### Management of acute pancreatitis [^111makFR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The early management of patients with AP depends on vigilance and early moderately aggressive IV hydration guided by Do Not Miss the Goal Therapy. We strongly advocate for the importance of close monitoring vital signs and avoid a rising BUN, HCT, and/or the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Managing patients with AP requires careful identification of risk factors of severe disease, initiation of moderately aggressive IV hydration, and frequent, thoughtful, reassessment of the patient, especially in the first 48 hours.

### Management of acute pancreatitis in the first 72 hours [^116Rxvou]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute pancreatitis is a common condition that affects patients with varying degrees of severity and may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. The present article will review the current paradigm in acute pancreatitis management within the first 72h of diagnosis.

Recent Findings

Patients presenting with acute pancreatitis should be evaluated clinically for signs and symptoms of organ failure in order to appropriately triage. Initial management should focus on fluid resuscitation, with some data to support Ringer's lactate over physiological saline. Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in acute pancreatitis is not recommended, nor is urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the absence of concomitant acute cholangitis. Early oral feeding should be encouraged, not avoided, and use of parenteral nutrition is discouraged. Cholecystectomy during the same admission of biliary pancreatitis should be performed in order to prevent future acute pancreatitis episodes. Patients with acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol should receive alcohol counseling. Finally, there is ongoing interest in the development of prognostic laboratory tests in acute pancreatitis and pharmacological therapies to reduce the inflammation that occurs in acute pancreatitis.

Summary

Acute pancreatitis is a common and heterogeneous condition with the potential for significant morbidity. Best practices in acute pancreatitis management focus on triage, hydration and enteral feeding.

### Acute pancreatitis: new developments and strategies for the hospitalist [^114jNcE3]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) remains the most common reason for hospital admission of all the gastrointestinal illnesses in the United States. Since the last narrative review in the Journal of Hospital Medicine in 2010, new developments in regard to diagnosis and classification, fluid resuscitation, antibiotic use, nutritional support, and management of complications have helped refine the approach and improve outcomes in this disease. Whereas there is still no proven pharmacologic therapy to specifically combat the inflammatory consequences of AP, recent interventions have led to increased survival, shorter length of stay, and more appropriate transfer criteria for pancreatitis patients. This case-oriented review will highlight these developments and emphasize the primary role of the hospitalist in managing AP over the course of the admission. It will focus on when to coordinate with subspecialists, how to deliver effective yet efficient hospitalized care, and how to optimize appropriate discharge planning.

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis poses a significant health risk due to the potential for pancreatic necrosis and multi-organ failure. Fluid resuscitation has demonstrated positive effects; however, consensus on the ideal intravenous fluid type and infusion rate for optimal patient outcomes remains elusive.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar for studies published between 2005 and January 2023. Reference lists of potential studies were manually searched to identify additional relevant articles. Randomized controlled trials and retrospective studies comparing high (≥ 20 ml/kg/h), moderate (≥ 10 to < 20 ml/kg/h), and low (5 to < 10 ml/kg/h) fluid therapy in acute pancreatitis were considered.

Results

Twelve studies met our inclusion criteria. Results indicated improved clinical outcomes with low versus moderate fluid therapy (OR = 0.73; 95% CI [0.13, 4.03]; p = 0.71) but higher mortality rates with low compared to moderate (OR = 0.80; 95% CI [0.37, 1.70]; p = 0.55), moderate compared to high (OR = 0.58; 95% CI [0.41, 0.81], p = 0.001), and low compared to high fluids (OR = 0.42; 95% CI [0.16, 1.10]; P = 0.08). Systematic complications improved with moderate versus low fluid therapy (OR = 1.22; 95% CI [0.84, 1.78]; p = 0.29), but no difference was found between moderate and high fluid therapy (OR = 0.59; 95% CI [0.41, 0.86]; p = 0.006).

Discussion

This meta-analysis revealed differences in the clinical outcomes of patients with AP receiving low, moderate, and high fluid resuscitation. Low fluid infusion demonstrated better clinical outcomes but higher mortality, systemic complications, and SIRS persistence than moderate or high fluid therapy. Early fluid administration yielded better results than rapid fluid resuscitation.

### Aggressive or moderate fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis [^115n3A9i]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Early aggressive hydration is widely recommended for the management of acute pancreatitis, but evidence for this practice is limited.

Methods

At 18 centers, we randomly assigned patients who presented with acute pancreatitis to receive goal-directed aggressive or moderate resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution. Aggressive fluid resuscitation consisted of a bolus of 20 mL per kilogram of body weight, followed by 3 mL per kilogram per hour. Moderate fluid resuscitation consisted of a bolus of 10 mL per kilogram in patients with hypovolemia or no bolus in patients with normovolemia, followed by 1.5 mL per kilogram per hour in all patients in this group. Patients were assessed at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours, and fluid resuscitation was adjusted according to the patient's clinical status. The primary outcome was the development of moderately severe or severe pancreatitis during the hospitalization. The main safety outcome was fluid overload. The planned sample size was 744, with a first planned interim analysis after the enrollment of 248 patients.

Results

A total of 249 patients were included in the interim analysis. The trial was halted owing to between-group differences in the safety outcomes without a significant difference in the incidence of moderately severe or severe pancreatitis (22.1% in the aggressive-resuscitation group and 17.3% in the moderate-resuscitation group; adjusted relative risk, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 2.18; P = 0.32). Fluid overload developed in 20.5% of the patients who received aggressive resuscitation and in 6.3% of those who received moderate resuscitation (adjusted relative risk, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.36 to 5.94, P = 0.004). The median duration of hospitalization was 6 days (interquartile range, 4 to 8) in the aggressive-resuscitation group and 5 days (interquartile range, 3 to 7) in the moderate-resuscitation group.

Conclusions

In this randomized trial involving patients with acute pancreatitis, early aggressive fluid resuscitation resulted in a higher incidence of fluid overload without improvement in clinical outcomes.

### Current concepts in severe acute and necrotizing pancreatitis: an evidence-based approach [^114TnKi1]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

The incidence of acute pancreatitis continues to rise, inducing substantial medical and social burden, with annual costs exceeding $2 billion in the United States alone. Although most patients develop mild pancreatitis, 20% develop severe and/or necrotizing pancreatitis, requiring advanced medical and interventional care. Morbidity resulting from local and systemic complications as well as invasive interventions result in mortality rates historically as high as 30%. There has been substantial evolution of strategies for interventions in recent years, from open surgery to minimally invasive surgical and endoscopic step-up approaches. In contrast to the advances in invasive procedures for complications, early management still lacks curative options and consists of adequate fluid resuscitation, analgesics, and monitoring. Many challenges remain, including comprehensive management of the entire spectrum of the disease, which requires close involvement of multiple disciplines at specialized centers.

There are 2 overlapping phases of AP, early and late; the early phase takes place in the first 2 weeks after disease onset, and the late phase can last weeks to months thereafter. Because of the focus on initial treatment of AP, questions on late complications (e.g., management of pancreatic fluid collections) are beyond the scope of this guideline, and it states it will not address diagnostic questions such as the use of laboratory tests or radiographic studies to establish the diagnosis of AP.

### Management of acute pancreatitis [^111JiSut]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

DO NOT MISS THE GOAL THERAPY

This clinical scenario highlights 2 of the most important factors of managing patients with AP: fluid resuscitation and vigilance. While most patients with AP have a mild course, approximately 20% of patients will develop a complicated course. It is impossible to predict which patients will develop acute organ failure or necrosis early in the course of AP. However, there are many risk factors for developing severe disease that should have been identified by the clinicians caring for this patient, including comorbidities (cardiac and renal disease), obesity, and the elevated BUN. This patient would have benefited from a monitored bed and closer observation, better vigilance. Evaluating vital signs more frequently and repeating the BUN and HCT at 6 hours after admission would have assisted in identifying and, by adjusting intravenous (IV) hydration, correcting the subsequent hypovolemia as it progressed.

While there is ongoing debate on exact rates and volumes for the initial resuscitation, IV hydration is critical to the management of acute pancreatitis. This patient is likely trapped in the cycle of pancreatic inflammation causing fluid extravasation, relative pancreatic ischemia, followed by worsened pancreatitis and fluid extravasation, all in the setting of hypovolemia from the third spacing (Figure 2). The only treatment of this is restoring pancreatic perfusion with early moderately aggressive IV hydration. Although "Goal-Directed Fluid Resuscitation" had been recommended, the problem as shown by this case study is that too often the goal of normalizing vital signs, preventing the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and decreasing BUN and HCT are not met. Clinicians should focus on "Do Not Miss the Goal Therapy" in preventing the development of moderately severe or severe AP.

### Gaps and uncertainties in the management of acute pancreatitis: a scoping review and quality assessment of clinical practice guidelines [^115HQHQW]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a gastrointestinal condition that affects up to three million patients each year around the world. The incidence of AP has increased over the past decade and is one of the most common emergency presentations requiring hospital admission around the world. Approximately 10% of patients present with severe AP and up to one-in-ten patients die during their hospital admission. Common causes for acute pancreatitis include gallstones and excess alcohol intake. These risk factors are increasingly common in patients from poor socioeconomic statusand the overall burden remains high with the aging population. In the UK, acute pancreatitis impacts 40,000 patients and annual costs to the healthcare system in managing these patients are as high as £200 million. AP is a relatively neglected area of clinical researchand the evidence deficit was highlighted by the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are tools used to translate research evidence into clinical practice. They are defined as recommendations based on a rigorous review of evidence and an evaluation of alternative care options. It is considered good practice to demonstrate adherence to clinical guidelines and evidence-based recommendations, which are associated to improved outcomes in patients. At present, CPGs are often developed with a focus on treatment and cost-effectiveness, without regard for a whole systems approach to maximise universal health coverage. Therefore, clinical recommendation may not always be applicable or beneficial to patients in their entire clinical pathway, extending to rehabilitation or recovery. There is growing emphasis on measuring how care is provided across the spectrum of service utilisation. CPGs therefore need to provide comprehensive recommendations on disease management across this spectrum, from prevention to palliation, to ensure high-quality care. The management of AP is intricately linked to its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, including pancreatic inflammation, necrosis, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). These processes influence decisions regarding early fluid resuscitation, nutritional support, and antibiotic administration. Understanding how current guidelines address–or fail to address–these fundamental aspects of disease progression is crucial to optimising treatment strategies. Despite presence of multiple CPGs on AP, there remains a knowledge gap around understanding best practices to implement. This inherently leads to variation in clinical practice globally, affecting patient outcomes, and resource use across health systems.

Importance

In the United States, acute pancreatitis is one of the leading causes of hospital admission from gastrointestinal diseases, with approximately 300 000 emergency department visits each year. Outcomes from acute pancreatitis are influenced by risk stratification, fluid and nutritional management, and follow-up care and risk-reduction strategies, which are the subject of this review.

Observations

MEDLINE was searched via PubMed as was the Cochrane databases for English-language studies published between January 2009 and August 2020 for current recommendations for predictive scoring tools, fluid management and nutrition, and follow-up and risk-reduction strategies for acute pancreatitis. Several scoring systems, such as the Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II tools, have good predictive capabilities for disease severity (mild, moderately severe, and severe per the revised Atlanta classification) and mortality, but no one tool works well for all forms of acute pancreatitis. Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation and early enteral nutrition are associated with lower rates of mortality and infectious complications, yet the optimal type and rate of fluid resuscitation have yet to be determined. The underlying etiology of acute pancreatitis should be sought in all patients, and risk-reduction strategies, such as cholecystectomy and alcohol cessation counseling, should be used during and after hospitalization for acute pancreatitis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Acute pancreatitis is a complex disease that varies in severity and course. Prompt diagnosis and stratification of severity influence proper management. Scoring systems are useful adjuncts but should not supersede clinical judgment. Fluid management and nutrition are very important aspects of care for acute pancreatitis.

### Modern management of acute pancreatitis [^111qGvnL]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

There is a rising incidence of acute pancreatitis in the United States. Numerous clinical prognostic scoring systems have been developed, including the BISAP score. Vigorous fluid resuscitation remains a cornerstone of early management of acute pancreatitis. Cross-sectional imaging in the early phase of evaluation has not been associated with improvement of outcomes. There is no role for prophylactic antibiotics in early management. However, there is growing emphasis on the identification and treatment of extrapancreatic infections. Enteral nutrition in severe acute pancreatitis has reduced mortality, systemic infection, and multiorgan dysfunction compared to parenteral nutrition. Conservative management consisting of percutaneous drainage and delayed surgical intervention is now favored for local complications, such as infected necrosis. These developments have contributed to improved outcomes for patients with acute pancreatitis.

Fluid management

Fluid resuscitation has widely been considered a quintessential part of the management of AP, but the optimal type and volume of fluid have only recently been addressed. Wu et al published a randomized controlled trial in 2011 in which 40 patients were randomized to one of four treatment arms: (1) goal-directed fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution (LR), (2) goal-directed fluid resuscitation with normal saline (NS), (3) standard resuscitation with LR, or (4) standard resuscitation with NS. They found a significant reduction in SIRS and C reactive protein (CRP) levels after 24 hours among patients resuscitated with LR compared with NS. The authors suggested that NS is detrimental for AP because of hyperchloremic acidosis. A subsequent randomized controlled trial found similar results and suggested that NS, when compared with LR, is associated with a pro-inflammatory effect in patients with AP. The WATERFALLwas a randomized trial to address the volume of fluid used in resuscitation of patients with AP. However, the trial was halted after preliminary analysis revealed that the early aggressive fluid resuscitation cohort had a higher incidence of fluid overload without any improvement in clinical outcomes. A meta-analysisthat included 11 studies found no significant difference in mortality between patients receiving aggressive intravenous fluid (IVF) resuscitation (n = 1229) and those receiving non-aggressive IVF (n = 1397). Patients receiving aggressive IVF therapy had a higher risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Those receiving aggressive IVF therapy were more than two times more likely to develop AKI (relative risk (RR) 2.17; 95% CI 1.66 to 2.83). Renal vascular congestion, with a pathophysiology similar to that seen in cardiorenal syndrome, is believed to cause direct injury to the glomeruli. The authors found no significant difference in the overall incidence of SIRS, persistent organ failure, or pancreatic necrosis when comparing both study groups. These studies led to a strong recommendation for more judicious, goal-directed fluid resuscitation in AP — that is, until the FLIP (Fluid Resuscitation in Pancreatitis) study was published last year. The FLIP studyfound that the effect of IVF volume on mortality differed significantly depending on the severity of pancreatitis. In patients with severe pancreatitis, increased IVF volume was associated with significant reductions in mortality (OR 0.655; 95% CI 0.459 to 0.936; p = 0.020). The study concluded that more aggressive fluid resuscitation was associated with decreased mortality in severe pancreatitis but found the opposite result in cases with milder disease. For years, we have recognized that the incidence of abdominal compartment syndrome and respiratory failure increases with aggressive resuscitation regimens in other inflammatory disease processes. As a result, we are now more likely to use vasopressors for blood pressure support rather than excessive volumes of intravenous crystalloid fluids. Our current approach involves continued surveillance and strict attention to assessing intravascular volume using point-of-care ultrasound. This paradigm shift from aggressive hydration with NS to goal-directed hydration with a balanced salt solution such as LR or plasmalyte is an important change.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes between aggressive and non-aggressive intravenous hydration for acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1134qCAW]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Early goal-directed therapy has recently been suggested to titrate the intravenous fluid to specific clinical and biochemical targets of perfusion (e.g. heart rate, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, urine output, BUN, and Hct). The treatment benefits of goal-directed therapy in AP, compared to non-targeted therapy, remain inconsistent according to the findings of previous RCTs, but the AGA guidelines included a conditional recommendation suggesting the use of goal-directed fluid therapy versus other methods. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we replicated the analyses by only including RCTs using early goal-directed therapy in intravenous hydration protocols, and the results remained consistent to those from the main analyses. We found that aggressive intravenous hydration protocols were still associated with a higher risk of mortality and fluid-related complications in AP, even with the goal-directed fluid strategy. Our findings provided further robust evidence supporting the use of conservative intravenous hydration protocols for AP.

The recent landmark Waterfall trial highlights the importance of close monitoring, vigilance in AP. This study included check points at 3 hours in patient with AP, close monitoring to determine the volume of IV hydration. This was shown to be more important than dogmatically providing large volumes of fluids. While this can be challenging in busy clinical settings, close monitoring is often only needed for the first 24–48 hours as thereafter patients typically will either start to improve or begin to show signs of severe disease.

This case also shows the need to partner with our emergency department colleagues to ensure vigilance (mainly ensuring the principles of moderately aggressive IV hydration) are followed even in busy emergency rooms. We also need to work with the intensive care unit and hospital administration to advocate for patients with AP with multiple risk factors of severe disease being placed in a monitored setting with a safe nursing ratio and frequent vitals.

Sensitivity analyses

Recent practice guidelines from AGA and the expert consensus of the ACG Acute Pancreatitis Task Force have highlighted the importance of goal-directed fluid therapy for AP, defined as the titration of intravenous fluids to specific clinical and biochemical perfusion targets (e.g. heart rate, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, urine output, BUN and Hct levels). We therefore replicated all analyses by including only RCTs with goal-directed fluid therapy as a sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of our results.

Two independent reviewers (JWD and CHW) evaluated the CoE for each study outcome based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Any discrepancy between the review authors was resolved by discussion with the senior author (SCS).

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas, which can lead to a syndrome of local and systemic inflammatory responses, as well as organ failure. The incidence of AP and hospitalization have been increasing over the last 20 years. The etiology of AP includes, but is not limited to, pancreatic duct obstruction secondary to gallstones, alcohol, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and various drug-induced pathological cellular pathways and organelle dysfunction that that ultimately characterize AP. The clinical course of the disease varies and can be categorized as mild, moderately severe, or severe. Most patients are suffering from mild conditions with only interstitial changes in the pancreas. Around 20% of cases will present with moderate or severe episode of AP, accompanied by necrosis of the peripancreatic or pancreatic tissue or organ failure, or both, and a mortality rate of 20–40%.

Intravenous fluid (IVF) resuscitation, oxygen, analgesia, and nutrition are the fundamental managements for AP. Fluid administration can counteract tissue hypoperfusion and third-space volume loss without causing pancreatic and systemic hemodynamic deterioration in the inflammatory cascade. It is widely recommended by several guidelines and is highlighted as a pivotal therapeutic strategy. However, the evidence is limited and recent guidelines, suggest that IVF should be guided with caution as fluid overload is known to exacerbate tissue edema and impact impaired oxygen delivery.

A number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have now explored strategies for IVF, – the results of which are controversial and remain inconclusive. Some studies,– have demonstrated that aggressive fluid administration is associated with better outcomes in treatment of AP, while some of these studies, have showed no significant difference between aggressive and nonaggressive outcomes. In addition, it has been argued that the risk of fluid overload must be taken into account when aggressive IVF is performed. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis is to gather and summarize relevant data to investigate the differences between aggressive and nonaggressive IVF resuscitation in AP.

Acute pancreatitis intravenous hydration monitoring and dosing — monitor clinical parameters and target early reassessment with moderate strategies. Monitoring depends on heart rate, blood pressure, and urine output, and hydration leading to a decrease in the HCT (hemoconcentration) and/or decreased BUN (blood urea nitrogen) has been associated with decreased morbidity and mortality; the latest evaluation should be 6–8 hours after admission. A randomized study showed that moderate intravenous hydration for the first 24–48 hours may be equally effective as aggressive hydration and was less likely to cause volume overload. In patients with no evidence of hypovolemia, an initial resuscitation rate of no more than 1.5 mL/kg of body weight per hour should be administered, whereas in patients with hypovolemia, clinicians should administer a bolus of 10 mL/kg.

Discussion

Two distinct stages of AP have been identified: the early (≤ 2 week) stage, characterized by systemic SIRS and/or multi-organ failure (MOF), constituting the first peak of death; and the late (> 2 week) stage, characterized by local complications and, in the case of multiple complications due to co-infection of the pancreas and peripancreatic necrotic tissue co-infection; this phase constitutes the second peak of death. Recognition of the critical importance of organ failure in determining disease severity is essential. Therefore, fluid therapy to prevent hypovolemia and organ hypoperfusion is the long-term cornerstone of initial AP treatment. The combination of microangiopathic effects and of inflamed pancreatic edema is now believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of AP, resulting in reduced blood flow, cellular death, necrosis, and sustained increased release of pancreatic enzymes, which activates a number of cascade responses. Inflammation also increases capillary permeability, leading to increased fluid loss in the third space, exacerbating pancreatic hypoperfusion, further aggravating SIRS and leading to MOF. Early aggressive IVF resuscitation can therefore provide microcirculation support, restore blood perfusion, and reduce the occurrence of serious complications such as pancreatic necrosis. Clinical guidelines for fluid therapy proposed by many experts agree that intravenous volume resuscitation should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of AP is made. Ringer's lactate, normal saline, and other crystal solutions can be the first choice for liquid therapy. At present, the indicators of successful hydration have not been unified, and can be referred to the resuscitation targets of early target-oriented therapy, including urine volume > 0.5 mL/kg/h, mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg, central venous pressure 8–12 cmH 2 O, central venous oxygen saturation ⩾70%. In addition, the use of hematocrit, BUN, and creatinine is widely recommended as alternative markers. –

### Comparison of clinical outcomes between aggressive and non-aggressive intravenous hydration for acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116j7NHh]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Current practice guidelines for optimal infusion rates during early intravenous hydration in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) remain inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare treatment outcomes between aggressive and non-aggressive intravenous hydration in severe and non-severe AP.

Methods

This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on November 23, 2022, and hand-searched the reference lists of included RCTs, relevant review articles and clinical guidelines. We included RCTs that compared clinical outcomes from aggressive and non-aggressive intravenous hydration in AP. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model for participants with severe AP and non-severe AP. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and several secondary outcomes included fluid-related complications, clinical improvement and APACHE II scores within 48 h.

Results

We included a total of 9 RCTs with 953 participants. The meta-analysis indicated that, compared to non-aggressive intravenous hydration, aggressive intravenous hydration significantly increased mortality risk in severe AP (pooled RR: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.37, 4.40), while the result in non-severe AP was inconclusive (pooled RR: 2.26, 95% CI: 0.54, 9.44). However, aggressive intravenous hydration significantly increased fluid-related complication risk in both severe (pooled RR: 2.22, 95% CI 1.36, 3.63) and non-severe AP (pooled RR: 3.25, 95% CI: 1.53, 6.93). The meta-analysis indicated worse APACHE II scores (pooled mean difference: 3.31, 95% CI: 1.79, 4.84) in severe AP, and no increased likelihood of clinical improvement (pooled RR:1.20, 95% CI: 0.63, 2.29) in non-severe AP. Sensitivity analyses including only RCTs with goal-directed fluid therapy after initial fluid resuscitation therapy yielded consistent results.

Conclusions

Aggressive intravenous hydration increased the mortality risk in severe AP, and fluid-related complication risk in both severe and non-severe AP. More conservative intravenous fluid resuscitation protocols for AP are suggested.

Acute pancreatitis fluid choice — lactated Ringer solution has advantages over normal saline. Normal saline is more acidic with a pH of 5.5 and is associated with a nonanion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and renal injury when large volumes are given, and in 3 well-designed prospective randomized trials lactated Ringer solution has been shown to be more beneficial than normal saline. Patients receiving lactated Ringer solution were less likely to develop SIRS and were less likely to be admitted to the critical care unit and had a shorter hospitalization compared with normal saline, although in patients in the emergency department for a long period and inadequately treated with early aggressive hydration, the benefit may not exist and may be harmful when transferred to the floor or ICU.

Recommendations

The management of patients with acute pancreatitis depends on duration of the disease. The following guidelines are provided for specific time frames.

A. On admission

1. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is completed. Use CT-scan without contrast in case of diagnostic uncertainty.

2. Initiate fluid resuscitation with crystalloids for correction of hypovolemia with simultaneous monitoring of vital organ functions including IAP monitoring.

3. Assess severity based on clinical judgment and initiate prophylactic antibiotics in patients with probable severe pancreatitis.

4. If patient has any signs of organ dysfunction consider intensive care admission.

B. Within the first 48 hours from admission

1. Re-assess the severity daily and discontinue prophylactic antibiotics in patients with mild or moderate pancreatitis.

2. Continue monitoring of vital organ functions and IAP in accordance with fluid therapy. Optimize fluid therapy. Reduce the infusion of crystalloids, if a patient is hemodynamically stable and does not show signs of dehydration.

3. If the patient has signs of deteriorating organ functions consider intensive care admission in order to start invasive hemodynamic monitoring and critical care.

4. In patients with IAH, calculate APP and use conservative efforts to prevent development of ACS.

5. In case ACS develops or the patient has low APP, use all possible conservative efforts to reduce IAP and correct APP, but if not effective perform surgical decompression with midline laparostomy.

6. Take blood cultures and plain chest radiographs for detection of infections.

7. Initiate enteral nutrition.

C. Within the first week from disease onset

1. Same as B1 – B6.

2. Continue enteral nutrition, target for total caloric needs through enteral route.

3. Perform contrast enhanced CT-scan on days 5–7 after disease onset in patients with normal renal function. The amount and localization of necrosis may help in predicting the need of follow-up for late complications.

Sensitivity analyses

In the sensitivity analyses, we included 7 RCTs (severe AP: 2 RCTs; non-severe AP: 5 RCTs) examining intravenous hydration protocols based on goal-directed fluid therapy after the initial fluid resuscitation therapy. The results also indicated an increased risk of mortality in the severe AP group receiving aggressive intravenous hydration (2 RCTs, 191 participants; pooled RR: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.37, 4.40; I 2: 0%) (Additional file 1: Appendix Fig. S12), and increased risks of fluid-related complications in both the severe (1 RCT, 76 participants; pooled RR: 2.22, 95% CI: 1.36, 3.63; I 2: not applicable) and non-severe AP group (3 RCTs, of which only 1 contributed outcome events, 353 participants; pooled RR: 3.25, 95% CI: 1.53, 6.93; I 2: not applicable) receiving aggressive intravenous hydration, compared to the non-aggressive intravenous hydration group (Additional file 1: Appendix Fig. S13). Other secondary outcomes from sensitivity analyses were consistent with those from the main analyses (Additional file 1: Appendix Figs. S12–S25 and Tables S20–33).

GRADE assessment

Since there was a serious risk of bias and imprecise results due to the small sample sizes in the included RCTs, we judged the CoE by the GRADE criteria for our primary and secondary outcomes to be low to very low (Additional file 1: Appendix Table S34).

### Lactated ringer solution is superior to normal saline solution in managing acute pancreatitis: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116JwP4C]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Goal

The goal of this study was to further determine the role of lactated Ringer (LR) compared with normal saline (NS) in managing acute pancreatitis (AP) as a consideration of fluid resuscitation.

Background

Fluid resuscitation play a critically important role in managing AP, and NS and LR solutions were common selection in clinical practice. However, it remains debate about which regime may be more better for patients with AP.

Materials and Methods

The PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched to find eligible randomized controlled trials focusing on the comparative efficacy and safety of LR and NS for the management of patients with AP.

Results

Four eligible randomized controlled trials involving 248 patients to perform meta-analysis finally. Meta-analysis suggested no statistical difference between LR and NS groups in reducing the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome at 24 hours [risk ratio (RR) = 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.33–1.31, P = 0.24], 48 hours (RR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.29–1.68, P = 0.42), and 72 hours (RR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.37–1.25, P = 0.22). Meanwhile, no statistical difference was detected between LR and NS groups in terms of in-hospital mortality, incidence of local complications, pancreatic necrosis, organ failure, and developing moderate-to-severe AP, and the length of hospital stay. However, incidence of intensive care unit admission in LR group was significantly lower than that in NS group (RR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.18–0.85; P = 0.02).

Conclusion

The current updated meta-analysis indicates that LR may be superior to NS in managing patients with AP because of LR has a potential advantage in decreasing the incidence of pancreatic necrosis and intensive care unit admission compared with NS.

### Gaps and uncertainties in the management of acute pancreatitis: a scoping review and quality assessment of clinical practice guidelines [^116mxCHW]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study demonstrated notable disparities in the development of CPGs, where majority (77.3%) originated from HICs. This may reflect greater research infrastructure, resource availability, and capacity to perform high-quality clinical trials. This uneven distribution significantly influences the generalisability of recommendations, as CPGs from resource-rich settings often assume the availability of advanced healthcare services and technologies. For example, recommendations around conservative fluid resuscitation strategies and selective antibiotic use rely heavily on advanced diagnostic and monitoring facilities more readily accessible in HICs. By contrast, limited recommendations from LMICs highlight challenges in evidence generation, implementation capacity, and health system resource limitations, rather than solely a lack of clinical relevance. Consequently, recommendations applicable to LMIC settings often default to expert consensus rather than rigorous clinical trial data, which may limit their reliability and applicability.

Fluid resuscitation and abdominal compartment syndrome

Aggressive fluid therapy during the early phase of acute pancreatitis has been traditionally the cornerstone of treatment. The rationale of fluid therapy is to correct hypovolemia caused by third space fluid loss. High admission hematocrit (above normal reference limits) may serve as a marker of hemoconcentration, and it is present up to 60% of patients who develop organ failure, but the marker is too unspecific for predictive purposes. Fluid resuscitation decreases hematocrit, which could be used as resuscitation end-point. Too aggressive resuscitation may lead to inappropriate hemodilution and very low hematocrit values (< 30%) may be harmful for the patients by increasing the risk of sepsis and death. Moreover, excess volume loading may increase IAP and lead to development of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome. In patients with acute pancreatitis, hematocrit and central venous pressure as resuscitation end-points are poor indicators of volume depletion. Urine output (≥ 0.5 ml/kg/h) may serve as another resuscitation end-point, but other modalities are needed for volume management if oliguria persists after initial volume loading. According to recent systematic review there is little evidence concerning the rate of infusion, optimal resuscitation end-point and the type of fluid in patients with acute pancreatitis.

In those patients with pancreatitis who develop shock the same management guidelines as for septic shock patients can be applied. These include initial fluid challenge with crystalloids (rate 1000 ml/ hour) with minimum of 30 ml/kg and administration of vasopressor epinephrine to maintain adequate blood pressure. Principles of early goal directed resuscitation with monitoring of CVP, MAP and either central venous oxygen saturation or mixed venous oxygen saturation can be used also in acute pancreatitis. Frequently elevated IAP should be monitored and taken into account when considering resuscitation end-points. Abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) could serve as a good resuscitation end-point in patients with IAH. Maintaining APP above 50–60 mmHg is recommended in order to provide sufficient perfusion to abdominal organs. Lactate level should be monitored and resuscitation should be targeted to normalizing the lactate level. As soon as resuscitation end-points are reached, the infusion rate should be slowed down in order to avoid fluid overloading.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on Initial management of acute pancreatitis [^113hCCbp]. Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

AGA initial management of acute pancreatitis (AP) recommendations include that in AP, the AGA suggests using goal-directed therapy for fluid management and makes no recommendation whether normal saline or Ringer's lactate is used. The AGA suggests against using hydroxyethyl starch (HES) fluids; suggests against prophylactic antibiotics in predicted severe AP and necrotizing AP; and suggests against the routine use of urgent ERCP in acute biliary pancreatitis with no cholangitis. The AGA recommends early (within 24 h) oral feeding as tolerated rather than nil per os; recommends enteral rather than parenteral nutrition if oral feeding is not possible; in predicted severe or necrotizing pancreatitis requiring enteral tube feeding, the AGA suggest either nasogastric (NG) or nasojejunal (NJ) route; recommends cholecystectomy during the initial admission rather than after discharge; and recommends brief alcohol intervention during admission for acute alcoholic pancreatitis.

### Acute pancreatitis in 60 Iranian children: do pediatricians follow the new guidelines in diagnosis and management of acute pancreatitis? [^115harXA]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Adequate fluid therapy (Bolus fluid infusion with 10–20 cc/kg normal saline or lactate ringer and intravenous fluid therapy with 1.5–2 times maintenance in the first 24–48 h of disease are recommended according to guidelines.) and early onset of oral nutrition play important roles in reducing the length of hospitalization and the need for ICU admission and decreasing the likelihood of disease progression into its severe form. Only 18% of patients in the current study received bolus intravenous fluid therapy, and only half of the patients obtained more fluid than the maintenance requirement in the first 48 h of disease; therefore, fluid therapy should be emphasized in clinical education due to its great importance in these patients.

Moreover, one-quarter of patients remained NPO after the first 24 h, which also increased the need for further training of physicians. Almost half of the patients in this study were treated with antibiotics, and according to the hospital records, only one-third of them had indications for antibiotic treatment. According to the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition Pancreas Committee guidelines, administration of antibiotics for acute pancreatitis is only necessary in the case of infectious necrosis or disease progression into necrotic pancreatitis. Besides, the inappropriate use of antibiotics, along with the side effects of medications, increases the likelihood of antibiotic resistance. In this study, only one child with cerebral palsy expired, with signs of sepsis, seizures, and acute pancreatitis. According to previous studies, the mortality rate of acute pancreatitis in children is less than 5%, which is consistent with our study.

### Gaps and uncertainties in the management of acute pancreatitis: a scoping review and quality assessment of clinical practice guidelines [^114b4Xg5]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The findings from this scoping review and quality assessment have important implications for both policy and future research. First, future research efforts in pancreatitis should focus on addressing domains where limited evidence was identified. For instance, research is required to explore effective recovery strategies, including rehabilitation protocols and preventive measures, are essential. Further, prioritisation of clinical trials targeting areas of significant variability, such as fluid management, antibiotic use, and long-term monitoring strategies is much needed (Table 3). Second, healthcare systems, policymakers, and special interest groups must prioritise the development of more comprehensive guidelines that address the entire patient care continuum, including recovery and rehabilitation. These areas are critical for improving long-term outcomes, reducing recurrence, and enhancing quality of life for patients. Third, stronger collaboration between multidisciplinary teams, including gastroenterologists, surgeons, nurses, allied healthcare professionals, rehabilitation specialists, and policymakers, is needed to ensure that guidelines are not only evidence-based but also equitable and applicable across diverse healthcare settings. Therefore, clear actionable targets for clinicians, policymakers and researchers include: (i) development of an internationally harmonised guideline synthesis to provide standardised, evidence-based recommendations; and (ii) Integration of real-world data and implementation science to bridge the gap between guideline recommendations and clinical practice (Table 4).

Table 3
Summary of key domains and future research questions in acute pancreatitis.

Table 4
Key actionable areas and plan for clinicians, researchers and policymakers for acute pancreatitis.

This scoping review and quality assessment highlights both progress and persistent gaps in the development of clinical practice guidelines for the management of acute pancreatitis. While the quality of CPGs has improved, significant discrepancies exist between the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. Moreover, recovery and rehabilitation are underrepresented areas, and there is a pressing need for more comprehensive guidance in these domains. Addressing these gaps will require concerted efforts from researchers, clinicians, and policymakers to ensure that all patients with acute pancreatitis receive high-quality, equitable care throughout their treatment journey, from diagnosis to recovery.

Inclusion criteria

After removing duplicate records from the different databases, two independent reviewers (XWL and CHW) selected the included studies based on the following PICOS criteria: (1) Participants: Adults with AP. The diagnosis of AP should be based on two of the following criteria developed by the Atlanta international symposium and revised Atlanta classification: a.) Abdominal pain consistent with AP (e.g. acute onset of persistent, severe, epigastric pain often radiating to the back); b.) Serum lipase or amylase activity at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal; or c.) Classic image findings from computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or abdominal ultrasonography. We defined the severity of AP based on the Atlanta international symposium and revised Atlanta classification. For example, mild AP is defined by the absence of organ failure and local or systemic complications, and moderately severe AP is defined by the presence of transient organ failure or local or systemic complications. We classified mild and moderately severe AP into the non-severe AP group, because severe AP, characterized by persistent organ failure, may pose a higher mortality risk; (2) Interventions: aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, defined as a.) Fluid administration (predominantly normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution) at a rate greater than 10 ml/kg/hour as the initial management; b.) Fluid bolus 20 ml/kg for 2 h, then 2–3 ml/kg/hour in the first 24 h; c.) Isotonic crystalloid > 500 ml/hour for the first 12–24 h. If the RCTs did not report the fluid infusion rate in the study protocols, the crystalloid fluid administration should be greater than 4000 mL in the first 24 h; (3) Comparisons: non-aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, defined as a.) Fluid administration at a rate lower than 10 ml/kg/hour; b.) Fluid bolus 10 ml/kg for 2 h; then, 1.5 ml/kg/hour in the first 24 h or c.) Isotonic crystalloid < 500 ml/hour for the first 12–24 h. If the RCTs did not report the fluid infusion rate in the study protocols, the crystalloid fluid administration should be less than 4000 mL in the first 24 h; (4) Primary outcome: all-cause mortality. Other secondary outcomes, such as the rate of clinical improvement (based on the objective parameters, including systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) subsides and time period therefore, decrease in hematocrit (Hct), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine from baseline, and subjective measurements, including decrease in epigastric pain degree, assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) and tolerance of oral nutrition within 48 h) in non-severe AP and the changes of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores and Multiple Organ Dysfunction (MOD) scores for severe AP, fluid-related complications, such as abdominal compartment syndrome, pulmonary/peripheral edema and any sign of volume overload (e.g. rapid weight gain, incident ascites or jugular vein engorgement), as defined by previous guidelines, sepsis, acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, pancreatic necrosis, SIRS subsiding within 48 h, SIRS persisting > 48 h, persistent organ failure (any organ failure > 48 h), defined by the revised Atlanta classification and total hospitalization days were also evaluated if they were reported in the included studies. Specifically, decrease in epigastric pain may be related to better prognosis of AP and better subjective perception of quality of life for patients. In addition, we included APACHE II score changes as the clinical prognosis parameter, based on the suggestions of the ACG guidelines, and the prediction performance of poor outcome in severe AP has been validated. We also evaluated the Hct and BUN changes within 48 h, because these parameters have been considered as surrogate markers for successful hydration for AP; (5) Designs: RCTs. In cases of disagreement over study selection, the senior author (SCS) made the final decision.

### Comparison of early aggressive versus nonaggressive fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis: a meta-analysis [^112enMJf]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite early aggressive IVF resuscitation playing an important role in the treatment of AP, some recent studies have suggested that aggressive hydration may be associated with increased morbidity and mortality. A recent RCT conducted at 18 centers worldwide reported that early aggressive fluid resuscitation resulted in a higher incidence of fluid overload (requiring the meeting of at least two of the following three criteria: symptoms, physical signs, and imaging evidence of hypervolemia; in addition, the acute respiratory distress syndrome had to be ruled out) compared with moderate resuscitation, but no improvement in clinical outcomes (incidence of moderately severe or severe pancreatitis). Two previous meta-analyses explored the effect of early aggressive hydration. One meta-analysis reported that early aggressive IVF therapy did not improve mortality and may potentially increase the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and pulmonary edema. Another meta-analysis showed that, compared to conservative hydration, aggressive hydration increased in-hospital mortality and the incidence of pancreatic necrosis and renal failure. The lack of evidences for the efficacy of aggressive fluid resuscitation has practical implications because it challenges the strong predilection of many clinicians for early high-volume hydration. These findings require us to revisit the effects of early aggressive hydration in patients with AP.

### Comparison of early aggressive versus nonaggressive fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis: a meta-analysis [^116RJEGj]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

According to the analysis of the data collected so far, the therapeutic effect and prognosis of AP patients with nonaggressive liquid therapy is generally better than that of aggressive liquid therapy, so we must be extremely careful when choosing early aggressive hydration. It is important to recognize that early aggressive hydration needs to be used with greater caution in certain patient groups, such as the elderly or those with a history of cardiac or renal disease, to avoid complications such as fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and peritoneal compartment syndrome. In this setting, measurement of central venous pressure through a centrally placed catheter is most often used to determine volume status. Therefore, the rate and volume of fluid resuscitation should follow the principles of 'individuality and precision'.

The American College of Gastroenterology guidelines recommend aggressive fluid resuscitation defined as 250–500 mL/h for all patients unless cardiovascular or renal comorbidities exist. According to the published studies, most studies took an aggressive rehydration rate of 3 mL/kg/h and a nonaggressive rehydration rate of 1.5 mL/kg/h, so after combining the results of this study, we recommend 1.5 mL/kg/h, and the specific rehydration rate needs to be determined according to the individual patient. For the interval between onset of pancreatitis and initiation of fluid therapy, guidelines also state that early aggressive intravenous hydration is most beneficial during the first 12–24 h, beyond which there may be little benefit. Many of the included studies reported that the included patients were patients with pancreatitis onset of less than 24 h, so the results of this study are generally applicable to AP patients with a delay of no more than 24 h.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes between aggressive and non-aggressive intravenous hydration for acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113xuvxg]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Strength and limitations

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs that examine and compare outcomes between aggressive and non-aggressive intravenous hydration protocols for fluid therapy to treat severe and non-severe AP. In contrast to previous reviews which included both RCTs and cohort studies, we included only RCTs in order to achieve more homogeneity between studies, and in order to provide the highest quality of evidence to address the specific research questions of clinicians, researchers, and health policy makers. More importantly, we critically examined every potential record to ensure eligibility of the trials for our review. For example, we excluded one RCT by Wu et al. which was frequently included in previous meta-analyses on this topic, because the comparison of this RCT did not receive the non-aggressive intravenous hydration protocol. Furthermore, we performed more pre-specified subgroup analyses to examine the heterogeneity of treatment effects, and the results from these subgroup analyses were generally consistent with our main analysis. Finally, we replicated all analyses by including only RCTs with goal-directed fluid therapy for AP, as suggested by the AGA and ACG Acute Pancreatitis Task Force since 2018, and these findings were also consistent with our main analysis. Overall, our findings highlighted the clinical importance of a more conservative intravenous hydration therapy.

Several limitations should be noted before final interpretation of our findings. First, due to the limited number of included trial participants, the statistical power to detect significant differences in the secondary outcomes and the results from subgroup analyses may be suboptimal. However, our review did include four Asian RCTs and one multi-country RCT that had never been included in previous reviews, thus providing greater precision around estimates of treatment effects. Second, no individual-level data were obtained to examine the heterogeneity of treatment effects with different etiologies of AP. However, our included RCTs had participants with various etiologies of AP, so our findings may be applicable to the overall AP population. Third, the included RCTs did not report the total volumes of resuscitation fluid for the trial participants during hospitalization, so the actual volume differences between the aggressive and non-aggressive intravenous hydration groups remain unclear. Fourth, we could not investigate publication bias since we only included 9 RCTs in this meta-analysis. Finally, we judged the CoE of all study outcomes as low to very low, largely due to methodological concerns and small sample sizes of the included RCTs. We suggest regularly updating systematic reviews to include newly published RCTs on this critical topic.

### Draining sterile fluid collections in acute pancreatitis? Primum non nocere! [^111VgXEo]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

With interest we read the randomized study by Zerem et al. regarding the drainage of sterile fluid collections in acute pancreatitis. The authors are to be commended for performing a randomized trial in a difficult patient population.

Nearly all international guidelines advocate conservative management of sterile fluid collections in acute pancreatitis: (a) the American Gastroenterological Association (2007): "Acute fluid collections around the pancreas in the setting of acute pancreatitis require no therapy in the absence of infection or obstruction of a surrounding hollow viscus", (b) the American College of Gastroenterology (2006): "Most peripancreatic fluid collections remain sterile and will disappear during the recovery from acute pancreatitis", and (c) the international consensus meeting on treatment of acute pancreatitis (2004): "Routine operative or percutaneous drainage of the former (… peripancreatic fluid collections and pancreatic necrosis…) is not necessary and may infect otherwise sterile tissues". Nevertheless, guidelines should be put to the test of evidence-based medicine and accordingly the authors routinely aspirated peripancreatic fluid collections in 58 patients and subsequently randomized 40 patients with sterile peripancreatic fluid collections. Group A (n = 20) received conservative management, whereas group B (n = 20) underwent prolonged percutaneous catheter drainage of sterile collections. As the primary end point the authors chose "conversion to more aggressive procedure", which included percutaneous catheter drainage and surgery. In group A, 11 patients required additional treatment (mostly percutaneous drainage, n = 8), whereas in group B three patients required surgical intervention (11/20 vs. 3/20, P = 0.02). The authors concluded that "prolonged catheter drainage is more effective for management of recurrent sterile fluid collections in acute pancreatitis than is conservative management".

We consider the primary end point of "conversion to more aggressive procedure" rather inappropriate. Why not study clinically relevant outcome measures such as mortality, organ failure, secondary infection of peripancreatic collections, length of hospital stay, or a composite of these events? Notably, it is our interpretation, in line with the definition of the author's primary outcome measure, that all patients in group B underwent an "aggressive procedure", that being percutaneous drainage! Along this line of reasoning, all 20 patients in group B had an interventional procedure versus 11 of 20 patients in group A (P = 0.001). Furthermore, the prolonged percutaneous drainage in group B led to a significant increase in infected collections (4 vs. 11, P = 0.048), that became fatal in one patient.

### Evaluating the efficacy of different volume resuscitation strategies in acute pancreatitis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116FoiQq]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

We were unable to assess the effect of the type of intervention fluid on the study outcomes due to lack of comparative studies. Half of the included studies recruited patients who had received any type of intravenous resuscitation, one fourth exclusively used Lactated Ringer's solution. Although two studies classified patients who had received saline (normal or D5) or Ringer's lactate solution, the, patient outcomes based on the type of fluid administered was not reported. The use of balanced crystalloids in fluid therapy in critically ill patients has been associated with lower mortality rates compared to normal saline.

Furthermore, over half of the included studies had attrition, reporting or other biases which may have contributed to high heterogeneity between studies for clinical outcomes, SIRS persistence, and organ failure persistence.

### Acute pancreatitis in 60 Iranian children: do pediatricians follow the new guidelines in diagnosis and management of acute pancreatitis? [^115GGX3Z]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Considering the increasing prevalence of acute pancreatitis in children, if symptoms, such as vomiting or abdominal pain, occur in a patient with systemic or metabolic diseases, acute pancreatitis should be considered. Medications play an important role in the development of acute pancreatitis. In children using anticonvulsants, immunosuppressant drugs, and chemotherapy, it is important to consider the incidence of this disease. Moreover, in clinical education, the risks of radiation due to unnecessary CT scans for children with acute pancreatitis need to be emphasized. Besides, inappropriate prescription of antibiotics, insufficient fluid therapy, and delayed initiation of oral feeding in these patients should be highlighted in therapeutic and educational programs. Also, healthcare providers should consider COVID-19 as a differential diagnosis when managing patients with gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution versus normal saline in acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^117XnEzt]. Pancreas (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to summarize the overall association between the choice of fluid (lactated Ringer's [LR] or normal saline [NS]) and clinical outcomes in patients with acute pancreatitis.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed in electronic databases to identify eligible randomized controlled trials. Meta-analyses with the random-effects and IVhet models were used to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) for outcomes of interest with the administration of LR relative to NS, at 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

There was a significant reduction in the odds of intensive care unit admission and development of local complications, respectively, with the administration of LR among hospitalized patients with acute pancreatitis relative to administration of NS (pooled ORs, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.13–0.81] and 0.43 [95% CI, 0.21–0.89], respectively).

Conclusions

Our findings are able to assist clinicians in the navigation of the proper choice of fluid in patients with acute pancreatitis.

### Management of acute pancreatitis in the pediatric population: a clinical report from the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition pancreas committee [^113ZTm1Z]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Medium credibility.

Pediatric acute pancreatitis — fluid type and initial bolus: In the initial resuscitation phase of acute pancreatitis, theoretical and potential clinical advantages favor LR above NS based on adult data, but pediatric data are lacking. Recommendation 2a states that children with acute pancreatitis should be initially resuscitated with crystalloids, either with LR or NS in the acute setting, and that, based on assessment of hydration status/hemodynamic status, if evidence of hemodynamic compromise, a bolus of 10 to 20 mL/kg is recommended; panel agreement was 24/24 = 100% (Strongly agree = 22; agree = 2; neutral = 0; disagree = 0; strongly disagree = 0). Colloid use is described as appropriate only in specific situations when the hematocrit is < 25% or albumin is < 2 g/dL, with another publication recommending a ratio of 3:1 of crystalloid to colloid.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes between aggressive and non-aggressive intravenous hydration for acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117WvuQt]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 9 RCTs, the mortality risk from selecting aggressive intravenous hydration protocols over non-aggressive intravenous hydration protocols for fluid resuscitation therapy significantly increased 2.45-fold in severe AP, while in non-severe AP the results remained similar but did not reach statistical significance. This finding may be explained by our analyses of secondary outcomes, which indicated that aggressive intravenous hydration protocols did not decrease APACHE II scores in severe AP, or improve the clinical conditions in non-severe AP. In addition, aggressive intravenous hydration protocols increased the fluid-related complication risk in severe and non-severe AP by 2.22–3.25 times. Our findings suggested that aggressive intravenous hydration protocols should not be recommended for fluid therapy in severe and non-severe AP and may serve as an important reference not only for clinical practitioners but also for future practice guideline makers.

Determining an appropriate fluid therapy strategy for AP, especially as regards infusion rate, is critical but remains controversial. Previous animal studies have suggested that aggressive fluid therapy could improve splenic blood flow, correct pancreatic hypoperfusion and ultimately reduce pancreatic damage and mortality, but may cause higher central venous pressure, leading to side effects of interstitial edema without significant changes in mean arterial pressure. Conflicting treatment effects from aggressive intravenous fluid therapy have been found in previous RCTs and observational studies in patients with AP. Nonetheless, ACG guidelines recommend aggressive intravenous hydration (defined as 250–500 mL per hour of isotonic crystalloid solution), to be administered early to most patients with AP, but the AGA guidelines and the ACG Acute Pancreatitis Task Force consensus make no recommendations on the hydration infusion rate. Our findings did not support the practice guidelines of the ACG or AISP and extended the knowledge gaps in the ACG/Acute Pancreatitis Task Force consensus. Our meta-analysis indicated a greater than twofold increased risk of mortality and fluid overload associated with aggressive intravenous hydration protocols in severe AP cases, and a similarly increased risk of fluid overload in non-severe AP cases.

### Management of acute pancreatitis in the pediatric population: a clinical report from the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition pancreas committee [^1114qnXo]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Medium credibility.

Pediatric acute pancreatitis — fluid resuscitation — recommends crystalloids initially (LR or NS), bolus dosing for hemodynamic compromise, and augmented maintenance fluids with urine monitoring. Children "should be initially resuscitated with crystalloids, either with LR or NS in the acute setting", and "if evidence of hemodynamic compromise, a bolus of 10 to 20 mL/kg is recommended", with ongoing fluids such that "Children with diagnosis of AP should be provided 1.5 to 2 times maintenance IV fluids with monitoring of urine output over the next 24 to 48 hours".

### Comparison of early aggressive versus nonaggressive fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis: a meta-analysis [^1154Ei6J]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Early fluid resuscitation is one of the main therapeutic strategies for acute pancreatitis (AP). This study investigated the effects of early aggressive and nonaggressive hydration on AP.

Objectives

The aim of this meta-analysis is to investigate the differences between aggressive and nonaggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation in AP.

Design

This study was based on publicly available data, all of which have been extracted from previous ethically approved studies.

Data Sources and Methods

Two authors systematically searched PubMed, Embase (via OVID), Web of Science, and Cochrane Library to find all published research before February 2023. In-hospital mortality were set as primary endpoints.

Results

This meta-analysis included seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and eight cohort studies with 4072 individuals in nonaggressive (n = 2419) and aggressive (n = 1653) hydration groups. The results showed that patients in the nonaggressive group had a lower mortality rate than those in the aggressive hydration group [relative risks (RR), 0.66; p = 0.02]. Subgroup analysis results showed that patients in the nonaggressive hydration group had lower mortality rates in RCTs (RR, 0.39; p = 0.001), studies conducted in Eastern countries (RR, 0.63; p = 0.002), and studies with severe pancreatitis (RR, 0.65; p = 0.02). In addition, the nonaggressive hydration group had lower rates of infection (RR, 0.62; p < 0.001), organ failure (RR, 0.65; p = 0.02), and shock (RR, 0.21; p = 0.02), as well as a shorter hospital stay (weighted mean difference, -1.63; p = 0.001) than the aggressive hydration group.

Conclusions

Early nonaggressive fluid resuscitation is associated with lower mortality, lower risk of organ failure and infection, and shorter hospital stays than aggressive fluid resuscitation.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^1128STCb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

These guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of severe acute pancreatitis from collaboration of a panel of experts. It contains 55 statements on diagnosis, management in the ICU, surgical and operative management, open abdomen, and antibiotic treatment. For some of the statements such as severity grading, imaging, use of prophylactic antibiotics and most aspect of the management in the ICU, the evidence is strong. For others, such as laboratory diagnostics and surgical strategies, for example, the evidence is quite weak requiring further studies. With accumulating knowledge, the statements need to be regularly updated.

### Aggressive or moderate fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis [^1119KAhp]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study WATERFALL was published by Enrique de-Madaria and colleagues in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute pancreatitis. In the WATERFALL study, the trial question was: is early aggressive fluid resuscitation superior to moderate fluid resuscitation in patients with acute pancreatitis? In the WATERFALL study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the WATERFALL study, the population was: 249 patients (127 female, 122 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients who presented to the emergency department with acute pancreatitis. The key exclusion criteria were moderately severe or severe disease; HF; hypernatremia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemi; life expectancy < 1 year; chronic pancreatitis; chronic renal failure; decompensated cirrhosis. In the WATERFALL study, the interventions were: n = 122 aggressive fluid resuscitation (bolus of 20 mL/kg of body weight, followed by 3 mL/kg/hr) n = 127 moderate fluid resuscitation (bolus of 10 mL/kg in patients with hypovolemia or no bolus in patients with normovolemia, followed by 1.5 mL/kg/hr). In the WATERFALL study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the development of moderately severe or severe pancreatitis (22.1% vs. 17.3%; RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.18). In the WATERFALL study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in fluid overload (20.5% vs. 6.3%; RR 2.85, 95% CI 1.36 to 5.94) No significant difference in organ failure (7.4% vs. 3.9%; RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.47 to 3.23) No significant difference in respiratory failure (7.4% vs. 2.4%; RR 2.19, 95% CI 0.63 to 7.64). In the WATERFALL study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in dyspnea, local complications. significant difference in fluid overload (20.5% vs. 6.3%). In the WATERFALL study, the conclusion was: in adult patients who presented to the emergency department with acute pancreatitis, aggressive fluid resuscitation was not superior to moderate fluid resuscitation with respect to the development of moderately severe or severe pancreatitis.

### Diagnosis and management of acute pancreatitis [^115m3FZ4]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is increasing in incidence across the world, and in all age groups. Major changes in management have occurred in the last decade. Avoiding total parenteral nutrition and prophylactic antibiotics, avoiding overly aggressive fluid resuscitation, initiating early feeding, avoiding endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the absence of concomitant cholangitis, same-admission cholecystectomy, and minimally invasive approaches to infected necrosis should now be standard of care. Increasing recognition of the risk of recurrence of AP, and progression to chronic pancreatitis, along with the unexpectedly high risk of diabetes and exocrine insufficiency after AP is the subject of large ongoing studies. In this review, we provide an update on important changes in management for this increasingly common disease.

Acute pancreatitis is one of the most common reasons for gastroenterology-related hospitalization in the United States. With significant morbidity and subsequent mortality related to both the acute presentation and subsequent sequelae, prompt diagnosis and appropriate management are critical, especially in the first 24 hours of illness. It is also important to accurately recognize complications, such as pancreatic fluid collections and vascular events, and identify a definitive cause so that a strategy to prevent future attacks can be implemented.

### Management of gallstone pancreatitis: a review [^114TTh3j]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Gallstone pancreatitis (GSP) is the leading cause of acute pancreatitis, accounting for approximately 50% of cases. Without appropriate and timely treatment, patients are at increased risk of disease progression and recurrence. While there is increasing consensus among guidelines for the management of mild GSP, adherence to these guidelines remains poor. In addition, there is minimal evidence to guide clinicians in the treatment of moderately severe and severe pancreatitis.

Observations

The management of GSP continues to evolve and is dependent on severity of acute pancreatitis and concomitant biliary diagnoses. Across the spectrum of severity, there is evidence that goal-directed, moderate fluid resuscitation decreases the risk of fluid overload and mortality compared with aggressive resuscitation. Patients with isolated, mild GSP should undergo same-admission cholecystectomy; early cholecystectomy within 48 hours of admission has been supported by several randomized clinical trials. Cholecystectomy should be delayed for patients with severe disease; for severe and moderately severe disease, the optimal timing remains unclear. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is only useful for patients with suspected cholangitis or biliary obstruction, although the concomitance of these conditions in patients with GSP is rare. Modality of evaluation of the common bile duct to rule out concomitant choledocholithiasis varies and should be tailored to level of concern based on objective measures, such as laboratory results and imaging findings. Among these modalities, intraoperative cholangiography is associated with reduced length of stay and decreased use of ERCP. However, the benefit of routine intraoperative cholangiography remains in question.

Conclusions and Relevance

Treatment of GSP is dependent on disease severity, which can be difficult to assess. A comprehensive review of clinically relevant evidence and recommendations on GSP severity grading, fluid resuscitation, timing of cholecystectomy, need for ERCP, and evaluation and management of persistent choledocholithiasis can help guide clinicians in diagnosis and management.

### The role of endoscopic intervention in the management of inflammatory pancreatic fluid collections [^114ruqGh]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Pancreatic fluid collections (PFCs) are a frequent complication of pancreatitis, or less commonly, pancreatic trauma or surgery. The revised Atlanta Classification categorizes PFCs as acute or chronic, with further subclassification of acute collections into acute peripancreatic collections and acute necrotic collections and of chronic fluid collections into pseudocysts and walled-off pancreatic necrosis. Acute PFCs are generally only subjected to an intervention when they are infected and not responding to antibiotics and are not managed endoscopically. Chronic PFCs, both pseudocysts and walled-off pancreatic necrosis, require intervention only when symptomatic or enlarging over time. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided drainage has become the mainstay of management for chronic PFCs that require intervention. Developments in medical devices over the past few years have significantly simplified and shortened the duration of the procedure itself, but the optimum choice of stent in different clinical scenarios remains to be defined, as does the place of endoscopic necrosectomy. To optimize outcomes, these patients should undergo a careful preprocedure workup and discussion in a multidisciplinary environment and procedures should be carried out in high-volume pancreatic units.
