## Question

What is the treatment for acute asthma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for acute asthma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the clinical scenario and define the population and setting. Then, I should verify the core pharmacologic pillars and their evidence strength. Next, I will examine adjunctive therapies and when to escalate. After that, I need to check monitoring, disposition, and discharge planning, including steroid regimens and follow-up. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical algorithm with caveats and evidence gaps, making sure I continuously self-check claims against guidelines and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and severity assessment, because treatment hinges on this. Acute asthma spans mild to life-threatening exacerbations, and severity is typically judged by symptoms, work of breathing, speech, pulse oximetry, and objective measures such as peak expiratory flow or FEV1 when feasible, with reassessment at 1 hour to refine disposition risk, especially in moderate presentations, as this improves prediction of admission and ICU transfer needs [^113GzsoZ] [^115BZDHF].

> I will now examine the first pillar: rapid reversal of bronchospasm with short-acting beta-agonists. Wait, let me verify the delivery method and dosing cadence. Guidelines and evidence support frequent inhaled SABA, with pMDI plus spacer as efficient and at least equivalent to nebulizer in many settings, and continuous nebulization conferring additional benefit in severe presentations by reducing admissions and improving lung function, so I should tailor delivery to severity and patient factors rather than assume nebulizer superiority [^117WaQ1z] [^114z8Sgi].

> Next, I should review the second pillar: systemic corticosteroids to blunt airway inflammation. I need to ensure timing and route are correct. Early administration within 1 hour of presentation reduces hospitalizations and speeds resolution, and oral therapy is preferred over intravenous when feasible because it is faster, less invasive, and equally effective; typical adult dosing is prednisolone about 1 mg/kg/day up to 50 mg/day, and for children 6–11 years, 1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40–60 mg/day, with dexamethasone regimens as short as 1–2 days in some protocols, though I should confirm response before stopping and switch to prednisolone if relapse occurs [^116KTsTS] [^111cq7WD] [^1157R5if] [^1121xZVs].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of anticholinergics. Multiple doses of ipratropium added to SABA reduce hospitalizations and improve lung function in moderate-to-severe exacerbations, with the magnitude of admission reduction around 30–40% in pooled analyses, so I should add ipratropium early in more severe cases and continue repeated dosing rather than a single dose [^117YNbRp] [^111FNUV6].

> Let me consider adjuncts for severe or refractory cases. Intravenous magnesium sulfate reduces hospitalizations in children and improves lung function in adults with severe exacerbations, and I should reserve it for patients with poor response to initial therapy or severe obstruction; nebulized magnesium has not shown consistent benefit and should not be used routinely, so I need to avoid overgeneralizing from adult IV data to nebulized routes [^114nqCHR] [^112rkSc5] [^116ifTNd].

> I should double-check the role of heliox. Evidence is mixed and generally low quality, so heliox may be considered as a bridge in severe, refractory cases to reduce work of breathing and improve aerosol delivery, but I must not delay definitive airway and ventilatory management if the patient is failing standard therapy [^1135SqYX] [^113nFGzY].

> Next, I should review monitoring and disposition. I need to ensure objective reassessment at about 1 hour using symptoms, vitals, and PEF or FEV1 if feasible, because this refines risk stratification; patients with minimal response, rising respiratory rate, hypoxemia, or altered mental status warrant escalation and consideration of ICU transfer, whereas those with sustained improvement and PEF/FEV1 near baseline can be discharged with appropriate follow-up and education [^113GzsoZ] [^112HE3BK].

> For discharge planning, I should confirm steroid duration and controller initiation. Adults generally receive 5–7 days of oral corticosteroids, and children 3–5 days, with dexamethasone 1–2 days in some regimens; importantly, I should initiate or step up ICS-containing therapy on discharge, as this reduces relapse and future exacerbations, and I must provide a written action plan and ensure follow-up within a week [^1157R5if] [^116RwoLR] [^1164RQb6].

> But wait, what about inhaled corticosteroids in the ED itself. High-dose ICS in the ED can reduce admissions when used in addition to systemic corticosteroids, though the effect size is modest and heterogeneity exists; given low harm, I should consider ICS in moderate-to-severe cases, especially if systemic steroids are delayed or in children, while recognizing that ICS should not replace systemic steroids in acute care [^114GNzpG] [^111MAa9d].

> I need to ensure I address antibiotics appropriately. Routine antibiotics are not indicated unless there is strong evidence of bacterial infection such as fever with purulent sputum or radiographic pneumonia, so I should avoid reflex prescribing and anchor decisions to objective infection signs [^116rnTG6] [^113fpqzA].

> Let me think about special populations. In children, early systemic corticosteroids reduce admissions and relapses, and IV magnesium can be particularly impactful in moderate-to-severe cases; in pregnancy, standard acute therapies are considered safe and should not be withheld; in older adults, I should maintain a lower threshold for admission given blunted symptom perception and higher complication risk [^116UTcLq] [^114nqCHR] [^114yaAj6].

> I should confirm the practical algorithm. Start with SABA every 20 minutes for the first hour, add ipratropium if moderate-to-severe, give systemic corticosteroids early, reassess at 1 hour, escalate to continuous SABA, IV magnesium, and consider heliox if severe or refractory, and prepare for ICU transfer if deterioration persists; on discharge, provide a short OCS course, initiate or intensify ICS-containing therapy, ensure inhaler technique and spacer use, and arrange timely follow-up with an action plan [^113GzsoZ] [^1157R5if] [^116RwoLR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about nonstandard agents. Leukotriene modifiers, methylxanthines, and biologics have limited or no role in the acute ED setting, and I should avoid introducing them during exacerbations unless there is a specific indication or as part of a specialist-directed plan for severe asthma phenotypes [^1158sEkS] [^117UAZqk].

> Finally, I should double-check the strength of evidence and acknowledge gaps. The core pillars of SABA, systemic corticosteroids, and anticholinergics in severe disease are supported by multiple guidelines and systematic reviews, whereas adjuncts like heliox and nebulized magnesium have weaker or conflicting evidence; continuous quality improvement in spacer use, early steroids, and standardized severity scoring can meaningfully improve outcomes, and I need to align local protocols with these evidence-based practices [^116KTsTS] [^117YNbRp] [^114tT71Z].

Acute asthma management centers on **rapid bronchodilation with SABA** [^117WaQ1z] and **early systemic corticosteroids** [^116KTsTS] to reduce airway inflammation and prevent relapse [^115o6Ere]. For moderate-to-severe exacerbations, add **ipratropium** [^117YNbRp] to SABA to improve lung function and reduce admissions [^111FNUV6]. Consider **IV magnesium sulfate** [^112rkSc5] for severe or refractory cases, especially with poor response to initial therapy [^114nqCHR]. Provide supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 ≥ 93% [^112Npigm], and avoid routine antibiotics unless infection is suspected [^116rnTG6]. Monitor closely, reassess at 1 hour [^113GzsoZ], and arrange discharge with a 5–7 day oral steroid course [^1157R5if], inhaled corticosteroids [^116RwoLR], and a written action plan [^1164RQb6].

---

## Initial assessment and severity classification

Rapid assessment of severity guides therapy and disposition; use **clinical signs, lung function, and oxygen saturation** [^113GzsoZ] to classify severity and guide escalation [^112HE3BK].

| **Severity** | **Clinical features** | **PEF/FEV1** | **SpO2** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild | - Minimal dyspnea <br/> - No accessory muscle use <br/> - Normal speech | ≥ 80% predicted | ≥ 95% |
| Moderate | - Dyspnea <br/> - Accessory muscle use <br/> - Speech difficulty | 50–79% predicted | 90–94% |
| Severe | - Marked dyspnea <br/> - Accessory muscle use <br/> - Silent chest <br/> - Altered mental status | < 50% predicted | < 90% |

## Core pharmacological management

### Bronchodilators

- **Short-acting beta-agonists (SABA)**: First-line therapy; administer every 20 minutes for the first hour [^117WaQ1z], then adjust frequency based on response [^notfound]. Continuous nebulization is preferred for severe exacerbations [^114z8Sgi].

- **Anticholinergics**: Add ipratropium to SABA for moderate-to-severe exacerbations to improve lung function and reduce hospitalizations [^117YNbRp] [^111FNUV6].

---

### Systemic corticosteroids

- **Indication**: Administer to all but the mildest exacerbations to accelerate recovery and reduce relapse [^116KTsTS] [^115o6Ere].

- **Dosing**: Prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day (max 50 mg) for adults; 1–2 mg/kg/day (max 40 mg) for children 6–11 years [^111cq7WD].

- **Route**: Oral is preferred; IV if oral is not feasible [^116KTsTS].

- **Duration**: 5–7 days; shorter courses (e.g. 1–2 days of dexamethasone) may suffice in some cases [^1157R5if] [^1121xZVs].

---

### Adjunctive therapies

- **Magnesium sulfate**: Consider IV magnesium for severe or refractory exacerbuations, especially with poor response to initial therapy [^112rkSc5] [^114nqCHR].

- **Heliox**: Consider in severe cases not responding to standard therapy, though evidence is limited [^1135SqYX] [^113nFGzY].

- **Leukotriene receptor antagonists**: Not recommended in the acute setting [^117UAZqk] [^116RmnpS].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

Provide **supplemental oxygen** to maintain SpO2 ≥ 93% [^111rbYmb], and avoid routine antibiotics unless infection is suspected [^116rnTG6]. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, lung function, and mental status is essential, with reassessment at 1 hour [^113GzsoZ] [^112HE3BK].

---

## Discharge planning and follow-up care

- **Oral corticosteroids**: Prescribe a 5–7 day course on discharge [^1157R5if].

- **Inhaled corticosteroids**: Initiate or step up ICS therapy to reduce relapse risk [^116RwoLR] [^115e1suT].

- **Written action plan**: Provide a personalized plan with clear instructions on medication use and when to seek care [^1164RQb6].

- **Follow-up**: Arrange primary care follow-up within 2–7 days [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

In children, **early systemic corticosteroids** reduce admissions and relapses [^116UTcLq]; **IV magnesium** may reduce hospitalizations in moderate-to-severe cases [^114nqCHR]. In pregnancy, standard therapies are safe and should not be withheld. In elderly patients, monitor closely for complications and consider lower thresholds for admission.

---

## Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

- **Delayed corticosteroids**: Administer within 1 hour of presentation to reduce admissions [^116KTsTS] [^116q1vAq].

- **Underuse of ipratropium**: Add for moderate-to-severe exacerbations to improve outcomes [^117YNbRp] [^111FNUV6].

- **Overuse of antibiotics**: Avoid routine use unless infection is suspected [^116rnTG6] [^113fpqzA].

- **Inadequate discharge planning**: Ensure ICS initiation, oral steroids, and follow-up to reduce relapse [^116RwoLR] [^1157R5if].

---

Effective acute asthma care requires **rapid bronchodilation**, **early systemic corticosteroids**, and **close monitoring**, with therapy tailored to severity and a structured discharge plan to prevent relapse.

### Evidence-based treatments for acute asthma [^111e9ijX]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Asthma is an important health care problem; over 12 million people in the United States suffer from asthma, the majority of whom are young patients. Presentations of acute asthma to emergency departments are common. In the United States, acute asthma presentations account for close to 2 million emergency department visits annually, and these patients often exhibit acute and chronic markers of severe asthma; so controlling asthma is important from many perspectives. We review the evidence for various acute asthma therapies, using the highest levels of evidence, employing systematic reviews (especially those from the Cochrane Collaboration) and evidence from randomized controlled trials to guide therapy decisions. beta agonists and systemic corticosteroids are the cornerstones of initial treatment. Delivery of beta agonists via nebulizer or metered-dose inhaler with spacer device appear to be similarly efficacious. However, recent evidence from studies involving children and adults indicate that addition of ipratropium bromide to early beta agonist treatments may reduce airway obstruction and reduce hospital admissions, especially for more severe asthma. Evidence from systematic reviews indicates that intravenous magnesium sulfate may provide similar benefits in severe asthma. Antibiotics, intravenous beta agonists, and intravenous aminophylline have been shown to add little and may increase adverse effects. Treatment for discharged patients should include systemic corticosteroids for 5–7 days, for all but the mildest asthma. Addition of inhaled corticosteroids should be considered for most patients, since evidence suggests that inhaled corticosteroids may reduce relapses and improve quality of life. Alternative treatments such as long-acting beta agonists and leukotriene antagonists remain unproven in this setting. Linking a discharge plan to close follow-up and asthma education (especially an action plan) needs to be encouraged. Acute asthma is a common problem and treatment has improved dramatically over the past 10 years. Employing the evidence-based practice outlined above should reduce the burden of acute asthma on patients and the health care system.

### Mechanisms and management of asthma exacerbations [^116BXVwX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute asthma remains an important medical emergency, the most frequent cause of acute admissions in children and a major source of morbidity for adults with asthma. In all ages with asthma, the presence of exacerbations is an important defining characteristic of asthma severity. In this review, we assess the epidemiology of acute asthma, the triggers of acute exacerbations, and the mechanisms that underlie these exacerbations. We also assess current treatments that prevent exacerbations, with an emphasis on the role of type 2 airway inflammation in the context of acute exacerbations and the novel treatments that effectively target this. Finally we review current management strategies of the exacerbations themselves.

### Antibiotics for acute asthma [^116w9UUG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are often prescribed to patients who are admitted to hospital with acute asthma. Their exacerbation is often precipitated by a viral upper respiratory infection (URTI), but in some instances antibiotics are prescribed in spite of questionable efficacy. A lack of strong evidence either to support or to refute the use of treatments in acute asthma leaves room for discussion and debate as to how effective antibiotics are in an acute setting. This review assesses what evidence is available.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of antibiotics prescribed in the treatment of acute asthma

Search Strategy

Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL) were searched to identify all possible randomised control trials.

Selection Criteria

Only RCTs or quasi RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Studies were included if patients were treated for acute asthma in the ED or its equivalent with antibiotics or placebo. Two reviewers independently assessed articles for potential relevance, final inclusion, and methodological quality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers completed trial quality assessment and data extraction independently.

Main Results

From 128 potential studies, two trials were identified for inclusion in the review. Both trials reported numbers of exacerbations and not patient numbers due to re admissions over the course of the trials. The total number of patients in this review was 97, but values were recorded for 115 exacerbations.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The role of antibiotics in the treatment of acute asthma is difficult to assess from the current literature. Recommendations regarding antibiotic use in acute asthma will remain consensus driven until more research is conducted which includes larger numbers of patients.

### Asthma update [^112whHmD]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma continues to be one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits and a leading cause of hospitalization. Acute management involves severity-based treatment of bronchoconstriction and underlying airway inflammation. Optimal treatment has been defined and standardized through randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and consensus guidelines. Implementation of clinical practice guidelines may improve clinical, quality, and safety outcomes. Asthma morbidity is disproportionately high in poor, urban, and minority children. Children treated in emergency departments commonly have persistent chronic severity, significant morbidity, and infrequent follow-up and primary asthma care, and prescription of inhaled corticosteroids is appropriate.

### Corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma [^112MC3M8]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease, which is characterised by reversible airflow obstruction in response to a variety of stimuli. Exacerbations in response to airway irritants are part of the natural history of asthma, but often they also represent a failure in chronic treatment. Presentations to emergency departments and other acute care settings are common and frequently lead to hospitalisation and other complications. After treatment, however, most patients are discharged to the care of their primary care physician for further management. This review highlights the role of systemic and inhaled corticosteroids as mainstays of treatment in the acute and sub-acute phase of an exacerbation. These agents form the basis of most current clinical practice guidelines, yet their use is not universal. We will review the evidence for the use of these agents that arises from the Cochrane Collaboration of Systematic Reviews contained in the Cochrane Library.

### Acute asthma, prognosis, and treatment [^1121MFNw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Asthma affects about 300 million people globally and accounts for 1 in every 250 deaths in the world. Approximately 12 million people in the United States each year experience an acute exacerbation of their asthma, a quarter of which require hospitalization. Acute asthma should be differentiated from poor asthma control. Patients with acute asthma will exhibit increasing shortness of breath, chest tightness, coughing, and/or wheezing. In contrast, poor asthma control typically presents with a diurnal variability in airflow and is a characteristic that is usually not seen during an acute exacerbation. The history should include a review of comorbidities, adherence to medications, previous episodes of near-fatal asthma, and whether the patient has experienced multiple emergency department visits or hospitalizations, particularly those requiring admission to an intensive care unit involving respiratory failure, intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Patient education is important to ensure that the patient understands that asthma is mostly a chronic disease and necessitates the avoidance of allergens, prevention of infections, adherence with routine vaccinations, management of comorbid conditions, and adherence to treatment regimens. This article is a structured review of the available literature regarding the diagnosis and management of acute asthma.

### Defining treatment response for clinical trials of pediatric acute asthma [^112pVzCL]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

An agreed-upon definition of treatment response for clinical trials of pediatric acute asthma does not exist, limiting meaningful comparisons among therapeutic interventions and advances in asthma management.

Objective

To develop a consensus definition of treatment response for clinical trials of pediatric acute asthma.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of 22 experts participated in a Web-based modified Delphi process to achieve consensus on a definition of treatment response. Round 1 consisted of closed- and open-ended questions in which panelists ranked measures of treatment response developed by literature review, suggested additional measures, and explained their responses. In rounds 2 and 3, panelists reviewed summary statistics of the panel's rating from prior rounds and reconsidered their rankings. In round 3, pairwise ranking was performed to determine the ranked importance of components. Consensus was defined as 70% or greater agreement among panelists choosing Likert-scale values of 1 to 6 (extremely unimportant to extremely important) and an interquartile range less than 2.

Results

Drawing on results from the expert panel, we developed a definition of treatment response that includes Clinical Severity Score, need for additional therapies, and hospitalization. Clinical Severity Score encompassed most ranked criteria (eg, respiratory distress, wheeze) for a treatment response definition. Panelists recommended that a valid and pragmatic severity score be used consistently across institutions. Panelists also achieved consensus on the top 10 criteria that appropriately classify need for hospitalization.

Conclusions

This consensus definition of treatment response can be used in clinical trials of children with acute asthma to standardize outcome measurement and report meaningful outcomes.

### Acute asthma [^115ykJrg]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE: Asthma is the most common medical emergency in children. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates and poses a tremendous societal burden worldwide. Management of the acute attack involves a stepwise approach that includes beta-agonist and steroid therapy, the mainstay of emergency treatment. Most patients will respond to this regime and can be discharged from the emergency department. Failure to respond to treatment necessitates hospital admission and sometimes admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Management in the ICU involves intensification of pharmacologic therapy, including nonstandard therapies, in an attempt to avoid intubation and ventilation. When needed, mechanical ventilatory support can be rendered fairly safe with little morbidity if the likely cardiorespiratory physiologic derangements are appreciated and if appropriate ventilatory strategies are used. In the past two decades, the availability of newer potent medications and changes in approach to monitoring and ventilatory strategies have resulted in a decrease in ICU morbidity and mortality rates. Research endeavors are presently underway to further characterize the underlying mechanisms of the disease and are likely to lead to novel therapies. This article reviews the approach to management of acute severe asthma.

### Different oral corticosteroid regimens for acute asthma [^115paH13]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common long-term breathing condition that affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. People with asthma may experience short-term worsening of their asthma symptoms; these episodes are often known as 'exacerbations', 'flare-ups', 'attacks' or 'acute asthma'. Oral steroids, which have a potent anti-inflammatory effect, are recommended for all but the most mild asthma exacerbations; they should be initiated promptly. The most often prescribed oral steroids are prednisolone and dexamethasone, but current guidelines on dosing vary between countries, and often among different guideline producers within the same country. Despite their proven efficacy, use of steroids needs to be balanced against their potential to cause important adverse events. Evidence is somewhat limited regarding optimal dosing of oral steroids for asthma exacerbations to maximise recovery while minimising potential side effects, which is the topic of this review.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of any dose or duration of oral steroids versus any other dose or duration of oral steroids for adults and children with an asthma exacerbation.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov), the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. This search was up to date as of April 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding or duration, that evaluated one dose or duration of oral steroid versus any other dose or duration, for management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies involving both adults and children with asthma of any severity, in which investigators analysed adults and children separately. We allowed any other co-intervention in the management of an asthma exacerbation, provided it was not part of the randomised treatment. We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only and unpublished data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results for included trials, extracted numerical data and assessed risk of bias; all data were cross-checked for accuracy. We resolved disagreements by discussion with the third review author or with an external advisor. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences (RDs) using study participants as the unit of analysis; we analysed continuous data as mean differences (MDs). We used a random-effects model, and we carried out a fixed-effect analysis if we detected statistical heterogeneity. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 18 studies that randomised a total of 2438 participants - both adults and children - and performed comparisons of interest. Included studies assessed higher versus lower doses of prednisolone (n = 4); longer versus shorter courses of prednisolone (n = 3) or dexamethasone (n = 1); tapered versus non-tapered courses of prednisolone (n = 4); and prednisolone versus dexamethasone (n = 6). Follow-up duration ranged from seven days to six months. The smallest study randomised just 15 participants, and the largest 638 (median 93). The varied interventions and outcomes reported limited the number of meaningful meta-analyses that we could perform. For two of our primary outcomes - hospital admission and serious adverse events - events were too infrequent to permit conclusions about the superiority of one treatment over the other, or their equivalence. Researchers in the included studies reported asthma symptoms in different ways and rarely used validated scales, again limiting our conclusions. Secondary outcome meta-analysis was similarly hampered by heterogeneity among interventions and outcome measures used. Overall, we found no convincing evidence of differences in outcomes between a higher dose or longer course and a lower dose or shorter course of prednisolone or dexamethasone, or between prednisolone and dexamethasone. Included studies were generally of reasonable methodological quality. Review authors assessed most outcomes in the review as having low or very low quality, meaning we are not confident in the effect estimates. The predominant reason for downgrading was imprecision, but indirectness and risk of bias also reduced our confidence in some estimates.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is not strong enough to reveal whether shorter or lower-dose regimens are generally less effective than longer or higher-dose regimens, or indeed that the latter are associated with more adverse events. Any changes recommended for current practice should be supported by data from larger, well-designed trials. Varied study design and outcome measures limited the number of meta-analyses that we could perform. Greater emphasis on palatability and on whether some regimens might be easier to adhere to than others could better inform clinical decisions for individual patients.

### Practical management of acute asthma in adults [^11575Y5q]. Respiratory Care (2002). Low credibility.

All asthma patients are at risk for acute asthma exacerbations. Moderate to severe exacerbations account for many emergency department visits and subsequent hospitalizations each year. Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of acute asthma. The purpose of this review is to provide practical guidance in the assessment and treatment of adults with acute asthma in the hospital setting. Managing patients with acute asthma involves assessing the severity of the exacerbation, implementing measures to rapidly reverse airflow limitation, and instituting therapies that limit the progression of airway inflammation. Some patients may benefit from other supportive measures such as heliox and noninvasive ventilation. If the patient continues to deteriorate and requires mechanical ventilation, then ventilator settings that minimize the risk of hyperinflation should be chosen. After an episode of acute asthma, long-term preventive medications, especially inhaled corticosteroids, should be prescribed and education should be provided to prevent future episodes.

### Acute severe asthma: recent advances [^113mjD3j]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute severe asthma is challenging to the clinician both in terms of recognition and appropriate treatment. About 30% of these episodes need admission to the medical intensive care unit with a mortality of 8%. Relapse rates vary from 7 to 15% depending on how well the patient is managed. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent advances in identification of risk factors, pathophysiology and management of acute severe asthma.

Recent Findings

Although the exact mechanism for acute severe asthma is unclear, some that are implicated include inflammation, airway remodeling and downregulation of beta-receptors. None of the environmental factors have been clearly related to the development of near fatal attacks. Genetic polymorphisms have been associated with severe asthma. Lack of steroid responsiveness has been linked to severe asthma attacks. Chemokines and basement membrane changes characteristic of severe asthma are reported in a few studies. Lack of symptom perception in a certain group of patients with acute severe asthma leads to delayed interventions. Specific treatment modalities and ventilator management is reviewed.

Summary

Severe asthma is a phenotype of asthma with variable pathology and clinical presentation. Early recognition and timely intervention is needed to prevent significant mortality and morbidity.

### Life-threatening asthma: pathophysiology and management [^112k9RYm]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma prevalence and mortality have been increasing over the past 2 decades, despite advances in medical therapy. In 2003 the National Health Interview Survey reported over 4,000 asthma-related deaths. A small proportion of people with severe asthma use a large proportion of health-care resources and bear the burden of asthma-related morbidity and mortality. The management of acute asthma is complex and evolving. Understanding the phenotypes and pathophysiology of acute asthma will lead to increased recognition and characterization of populations at risk for fatal asthma. The early identification and appropriate management of acute asthma is critical in decreasing asthma morbidity and mortality. This paper reviews current pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic management of severe acute asthma.

### The role of anticholinergics in acute asthma treatment: an evidence-based evaluation [^114Z51F2]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

The role for anticholinergic medications in acute asthma is not well-defined. Thus, the use of therapy with anticholinergics and beta(2)-agonists, either simultaneously or in sequence, has produced positive as well as negative results in trials. Therefore, the current recommendations for the use of these drugs in the emergency department (ED) and hospital management of asthma exacerbations are not precise. This review answers the following question: what level of evidence is available in the literature to support the use of anticholinergic medications in combination with beta(2)-agonists in acute asthma patients? We limited the search on our therapy question to systematic reviews of randomized trials and/or randomized controlled trials not included in the reviews. After an extensive review of the most relevant evidence, the following conclusions may be emphasized. (1) The use of multiple doses of ipratropium bromide are indicated in the ED treatment of children and adults with severe acute asthma. The studies reported a substantial reduction in hospital admissions (30 to 60%; number needed to treat, 5 to 11) and significant differences in lung function favoring the combined treatment. No apparent increase in the occurrence of side effects was observed. (2) The use of single-dose protocols of ipratropium bromide with beta(2)-agonist treatment produced, particularly in children with more severe acute asthma, a modest improvement in pulmonary function without reduction in hospital admissions; in adults, the data showed a similar increase in pulmonary function with an approximately 35% reduction in the hospital admission rate. In patients with mild-to-moderate acute asthma, there is no apparent benefit from adding a single dose of an anticholinergic medication.

### Asthma in adults [^111xj3A3]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild-to-moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This review does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about specific interventions.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for chronic asthma? What are the effects of treatments for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 99 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions. For acute asthma: beta(2) agonists (plus ipratropium bromide, pressured metered-dose inhalers, short-acting continuous nebulised, short-acting intermittent nebulised, and short-acting intravenous); corticosteroids (inhaled); corticosteroids (single oral, combined inhaled, and short courses); education about acute asthma; generalist care; helium-oxygen mixture (heliox); magnesium sulphate (intravenous and adding isotonic nebulised magnesium to inhaled beta(2) agonists); mechanical ventilation; oxygen supplementation (controlled 28% oxygen and controlled 100% oxygen); and specialist care. For chronic asthma: beta(2) agonists (adding long-acting inhaled beta(2) agonists when asthma is poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids, or short-acting inhaled beta(2) agonists as needed for symptom relief); inhaled corticosteroids (low dose and increasing dose); leukotriene antagonists (with or without inhaled corticosteroids); and theophylline (when poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids).

### Asthma in adults (acute) [^115ydVhU]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild to moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This review does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about specific interventions.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 100 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta(2) agonists (plus ipratropium bromide, pressured metered-dose inhalers, short-acting continuous nebulised, short-acting intermittent nebulised, short-acting iv, and inhaled formoterol); corticosteroids (inhaled); corticosteroids (single oral, combined inhaled, and short courses); education about acute asthma; generalist care; helium-oxygen mixture (heliox); magnesium sulphate (iv and adding isotonic nebulised magnesium to inhaled beta(2) agonists); mechanical ventilation; oxygen supplementation (controlled 28% oxygen and controlled 100% oxygen); and specialist care.

### Comparison of national and global asthma management guiding documents [^1152timh]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic disease that affects both adults and children, and that continues to have a high economic burden. Asthma management guidelines were first developed nearly 30 years ago to standardize care, maintain asthma control, improve quality of life, maintain normal lung function, prevent exacerbations, and prevent asthma mortality. The two most common asthma guidelines used today were developed by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Expert Panel Working Group and the Global Initiative for Asthma Science Committee. Both guiding documents use scientific methodology to standardize their approach for formulating recommendations based on pertinent literature. Before the 2020 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (Expert Panel Report 4), nothing had been released since the 2007 guidelines, whereas the Global Initiative for Asthma publishes updates annually. Although each of these asthma strategies is similar, there are some noted differences. Over the years, the focus of asthma treatment has shifted from acute to chronic management. Frontline respiratory therapists and other health-care providers should have a good understanding of these 2 guiding references and how they can impact acute and chronic asthma management. The primary focus of this narrative is to look at the similarities and differences of these 2 guiding documents as they pertain to the 6 key questions identified by the Expert Panel of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program.

### A proposal for a practical treatment guideline designed for the initial two-hours of the management of patients with acute severe asthma and COPD using the principles of evidence-based medicine [^111fnfQ8]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

We have proposed a clinical treatment guideline for the management of acute, severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease (COPD) using the principles of evidence-based medicine. The content is based upon practical clinical issues in need of consensus. A previous study has shown that this particular area is in serious need of quality control. Based on a strict 2 h time schedule with a unified treatment plan for both asthma and COPD, it is possible to secure for the patients a well-documented medical therapy promoting decision-making and clarification of the patient within this time limit. A summary of the statements is presented in a one-page, user-friendly format in order to cope with the clinician's need of having access to published evidence quickly and easily. A website (www.phanareth.dk or a website provided by Respiratory Medicine) has been established providing regular updates. A strategy for the implementation and the evaluation process has been planned after the publication of this paper. We believe this approach to be an important step towards an increase in the quality of guidelines and also a tool to make "guideline writers" aware of the responsibility of making their recommendations work.

### A review of the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of acute asthma [^111TjPaE]. Clinical Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids (CSs) are generally accepted as treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma. In contrast, inhaled corticosteroids (ICs) have been used for the long-term management of asthma but are not widely accepted for the treatment of asthma exacerbations. The onset of action of ICs in acute asthma begins in 1 hour. In patients with mild to moderate exacerbation, administration of high-dose ICs may decrease the need for hospital admission and the number of symptomatic days.

### Corticosteroids for acute severe asthma in hospitalised patients [^111Egr2h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are currently used routinely in the management of acute severe asthma. The optimal dose and route of administration continues to be debated. Some investigators have reported a greater benefit of higher doses of corticosteroids in the management of severe asthma, while others have not.

Objectives

To determine whether higher doses of systemic corticosteroids (oral, intravenous or intramuscular) are more effective than lower doses in the management of patients with acute severe asthma requiring hospital admission.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group Asthma Register. In addition, primary authors and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Studies were selected for inclusion in the review if they met the following broad inclusion criteria: described as randomised controlled trials, included patients with acute severe asthma, compared different doses of corticosteroids (any route) in 2 or more treatment arms, and had a minimum period of follow up of 24 hours. Two reviewers independently assessed the studies for inclusion and disagreement was resolved by third party adjudication.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers if the authors were unable to verify the validity of information. Missing data were obtained from authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. The data were analysed as weighted mean differences (WMD) for primary pulmonary function outcomes using a fixed effects model. For the purposes of the review, three broad categories of corticosteroid dose (equivalent dose of methylprednisolone in 24 hours) were defined in advance: low dose (≤ 80 mg), medium dose (> 80 mg and ≤ 360 mg) and high dose (> 360 mg). There were thus 3 main comparison groups: low versus medium dose, medium versus high dose and low versus high dose.

Main Results

Nine trials were included; a total of 344 adult patients have been studied (96 with low dose, 85 with medium dose and 163 with high dose corticosteroids). Only 6 trials provided sufficient data for the meta-analysis. There were no clinically or statistically significant differences detected in % predicted FEV1 among comparison groups after 24, 48 or 72 hours. At 48 hours, the weighted mean difference was -3.3% predicted (95% confidence interval -12.4 to + 5.8) for the low vs medium dose comparison, -1.9% predicted (95% CI -8.1 to + 4.3) for the medium vs high dose comparison and + 0.5% predicted (95% CI - 7.8 to + 8.8) for the low vs high dose comparison. There appeared to be no significant differences in side effects or rates of respiratory failure among the varying doses of corticosteroids. A further search was conducted on 3rd August 2000. No new trials were identified.

Reviewer's Conclusions

No differences were identified among the different doses of corticosteroids in acute asthma requiring hospital admission. Low dose corticosteroids (≤ 80 mg/day of methylprednisolone or ≤ 400 mg/day of hydrocortisone) appear to be adequate in the initial management of these adult patients. Higher doses do not appear to offer a therapeutic advantage.

### Inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene modifiers in the acute treatment of asthma exacerbations [^112DWuMk]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbation has a considerable impact on patients' quality of life and constitutes a challenging condition for primary health-care providers. Severe exacerbations are also an important cause of hospital admissions and require high costs. Despite this, a widely accepted definition is still lacking; etiologic and pathogenetic mechanisms are still incompletely defined. Although the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and leukotriene modifiers in preventing mild to moderate asthma exacerbation is well recognized, their role within the context of an asthma action plan in general practice and in home-based early intervention for acute exacerbations is still controversial. Although systemic corticosteroids (CS) are standard care for severe exacerbation in the emergency department's (ED) management of asthma, published evidence suggests that high doses of ICS may be beneficial in the ED. The additive benefit of ICS when used with systemic CS is still debated. Data on leukotriene modifiers in the management of asthma exacerbation are limited. However, therapeutic strategies of this emergency including ICS and leukotriene modifiers seem logical and may be suitable, at least in certain patient groups. The availability of different drugs, active on different targets, can potentially contribute to a better management of asthma exacerbations.

### Treatment strategies for reducing asthma-related emergency department visits [^116FAZz5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Acute asthma exacerbations reflect inadequate long-term disease control. Treatment to control acute asthma exacerbations includes: 1) rapid reversal of airflow obstruction with bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids and reversing hypoxemia with oxygen in the emergency department (ED); 2) preventing early relapse by prescribing beta(2) agonists and oral corticosteroids at discharge and ensuring patients have an adequate supply of their other asthma medications; and 3) preventing future asthma exacerbations and ED visits through effective treatment in primary care. This article discusses each treatment and reviews the role of emergency physicians in treating patients to reverse airflow obstruction and prevent early relapse, future exacerbations, and ED visits by communicating the need for additional asthma control to patients' primary care physicians.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116bjrAR]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma — initial presentation during an acute exacerbation indicates that for "Initial asthma presentation is during an acute exacerbation", the preferred initial treatment (Track 1) is "Treat as for exacerbation (Box 9–4, p.167 and Box 9–6, p.171), including short course of OCS if severe; commence medium-dose MART (Evidence D)". The alternative initial treatment (Track 2) is "Treat as for exacerbation (Box 9–4, p.167 and Box 9–6, p.171), including short course of OCS if severe; commence medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA (Evidence D)".

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1179T5GD]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Acute asthma — Although there is a strong emphasis on minimizing oral corticosteroid (OCS) use to reduce long-term cumulative adverse effects, OCS are essential in management of acute severe asthma, and the occurrence of any severe exacerbation should be a prompt to assess the patient thoroughly, optimize their asthma treatment, and consider referral for expert advice to reduce the risk of another exacerbation occurring; evidence about use of dexamethasone has been updated based on the latest evidence.

### Acute severe asthma [^117QhwmU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Acute severe asthma remains a major economic and health burden. The natural history of acute decompensations is one of resolution and only about 0.4% of patients succumb overall. Mortality in medical intensive care units is higher but is less than 3% of hospital admissions. "Near-fatal" episodes may be more frequent, but precise figures are lacking. However, about 30% of medical intensive care unit admissions require intubation and mechanical ventilation with mortality of 8%. Morbidity and mortality increase with socioeconomic deprivation and ethnicity. Seventy to 80% of patients in emergency departments clear within 2 hours with standardized care. The relapse rate varies between 7 and 15%, depending on how aggressively the patient is treated. The airway obstruction in the 20–30% of people resistant to adrenergic agonists in the emergency department slowly reverses over 36–48 hours but requires intense treatment to do so. Current therapeutic options for this group consist of ipratropium and corticosteroids in combination with beta2 selective drugs. Even so, such regimens are not optimal and better approaches are needed. The long-term prognosis after a near-fatal episode is poor and mortality may approach 10%.

### Early use of inhaled corticosteroids in the emergency department treatment of acute asthma [^111MAa9d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroid therapy is central to the management of acute asthma. The use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may also be beneficial in this setting.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of ICS for the treatment of patients with acute asthma managed in the emergency department (ED).

Search Methods

We identified controlled clinical trials from the Cochrane Airways Group specialised register of controlled trials. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews, and texts also were searched. The latest search was September 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs. Studies were included if patients presented to the ED or its equivalent with acute asthma, and were treated with ICS or placebo, in addition to standard therapy. Two review authors independently selected potentially relevant articles, and then independently selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two review authors. There were three different types of studies that were included in this review: 1) studies comparing ICS vs. placebo, with no systemic corticosteroids given to either treatment group, 2) studies comparing ICS vs. placebo, with systemic corticosteroids given to both treatment groups, and 3) studies comparing ICS alone versus systemic corticosteroids. For the analysis, the first two types of studies were included as separate subgroups in the primary analysis (ICS vs. placebo), while the third type of study was included in the secondary analysis (ICS vs. systemic corticosteroid).

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two review authors if the authors were unable to verify the validity of extracted information. Missing data were obtained from the authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. Where appropriate, individual and pooled dichotomous outcomes were reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, individual and pooled continuous outcomes were reported as mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs. The primary analysis employed a fixed-effect model and a random-effects model was used for sensitivity analysis. Heterogeneity is reported using I-squared (I²) statistics.

Main Results

Twenty trials were selected for inclusion in the primary analysis (13 paediatric, seven adult), with a total number of 1403 patients. Patients treated with ICS were less likely to be admitted to hospital (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62; 12 studies; 960 patients) and heterogeneity (I² = 27%) was modest. This represents a reduction from 32 to 17 hospital admissions per 100 patients treated with ICS in comparison with placebo. Subgroup analysis of hospital admissions based on concomitant systemic corticosteroid use revealed that both subgroups indicated benefit from ICS in reducing hospital admissions (ICS and systemic corticosteroid versus systemic corticosteroid: OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.81; 5 studies; N = 433; ICS versus placebo: OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.52; 7 studies; N = 527). However, there was moderate heterogeneity in the subgroup using ICS in addition to systemic steroids (I² = 52%). Patients receiving ICS demonstrated small, significant improvements in peak expiratory flow (PEF: MD 7%; 95% CI 3% to 11%) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1): MD 6%; 95% CI 2% to 10%) at three to four hours post treatment). Only a small number of studies reported these outcomes such that they could be included in the meta-analysis and most of the studies in this comparison did not administer systemic corticosteroids to either treatment group. There was no evidence of significant adverse effects from ICS treatment with regard to tremor or nausea and vomiting. In the secondary analysis of studies comparing ICS alone versus systemic corticosteroid alone, heterogeneity among the studies complicated pooling of data or drawing reliable conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

ICS therapy reduces hospital admissions in patients with acute asthma who are not treated with oral or intravenous corticosteroids. They may also reduce admissions when they are used in addition to systemic corticosteroids; however, the most recent evidence is conflicting. There is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy results in clinically important changes in pulmonary function or clinical scores when used in acute asthma in addition to systemic corticosteroids. Also, there is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy can be used in place of systemic corticosteroid therapy when treating acute asthma. Further research is needed to clarify the most appropriate drug dosage and delivery device, and to define which patients are most likely to benefit from ICS therapy. Use of similar measures and reporting methods of lung function, and a common, validated, clinical score would be helpful in future versions of this meta-analysis.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^112Npigm]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

9. A continuum of care for worsening asthma, from early self-management, through to primary-care and acute-care management

The GINA report now includes several new tools: an evidence table summarising pharmacological options for written asthma action plans, flow charts for assessment and management of exacerbations in primary care and acute care, and a summary of key issues to be addressed during re-assessment and ongoing management after any exacerbation. Every patient should have an individualised written asthma action plan. The report provides the rationale for key new recommendations including an early increase in inhaled corticosteroid dose in written asthma action plans (unlike previous guidelines that have recommended only bronchodilator treatment and oral corticosteroids); initiation of regular inhaled corticosteroid-based treatment after any exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids, or its resumption if the patient was previously non-adherent, and, for severe exacerbations, use of controlled-flow oxygen with a target saturation for adults of 93–95%, rather than high-flow oxygen. GINA now recommends the term 'flare-up' for communication with patients, as it is simpler and less ambiguous than 'exacerbation' or 'attack', and it reinforces the crucial message that asthma is associated with inflammation and is present even when symptoms are absent.

10. A new approach to diagnosing asthma in children 5 years and younger

Previous classifications of wheezing phenotypes (episodic wheeze/multiple-trigger wheeze; or transient wheeze/persistent wheeze/late-onset wheeze) have not been found to be stable, and are no longer recommended. Instead, GINA recommends that a probability-based approach should be taken to the diagnosis of asthma in preschool children, taking into account the pattern, frequency and severity of symptoms; the diagnosis should be reviewed as the child grows older. Assessment of asthma control in this age group, as in adults, should include both current symptom control and assessment of risk factors for future adverse outcomes such as exacerbations; a trial of controller therapy should be given if the symptom pattern suggests asthma, if respiratory symptoms are uncontrolled and/or if wheezing episodes are frequent or severe. The aim is to reduce the risk of future severe exacerbations, even if symptoms are currently well controlled, and to minimise the impact of uncontrolled asthma on schooling and physical and social development.

### Management of acute asthma exacerbations… [^111rbYmb]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

13 Inhaled short-acting beta 2 agonists are the cornerstones of treatment for patients with acute asthma. 14–16 In patients with a PEF of 50 to 79 percent of their personal best, up to two treatments of two to six inhalations of a short-acting beta 2 agonist may be safely employed at home. The administration of oxygen to maintain saturation of at least 94 percent is recommended in all patients presenting with a moderate to severe asthma exacerbation. Oxygen should be administered as soon as possible, preferably in the prehospital phase in an office setting or in transport by emergency medical services. 8 It has been proposed that the helium and oxygen mixture, which has a lower density than oxygen, flows more easily through constricted airways and, as a result, improves outcomes in asthma exacerbations. However, there are insufficient data to support the use of heliox in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations.
20.

Inhaled short-acting beta 2 agonist treatment is the mainstay of office or emergency department treatment of moderate to severe asthma exacerbations. If the patient can tolerate a measurement of PEF or forced expiratory volume in one second, an initial value should be obtained and repeated to monitor treatment response. In patients with severe exacerbations, continuous beta 2 agonist administration has been shown to improve pulmonary function measurements and reduce hospital admission with no notable differences in pulse, blood pressure, or tremor. The addition of intravenous magnesium sulfate to standard therapy has been studied in adults and children with divergent results. In adults with severe exacerbations of asthma, intravenous magnesium sulfate therapy resulted in slightly better lung function but no change in rates of hospitalization. 2 agonists.

40, 41 Although seven to 10 days is the usual treatment duration for oral corticosteroids, three days of therapy has been shown to be as effective as five days for the complete resolution of symptoms within one week in children two to 15 years of age. 42 There are insufficient data to recommend the initiation of montelukast in place of oral corticosteroids or the use of inhaled corticosteroids in combination with oral corticosteroids at the time of discharge to prevent a relapse of asthma symptoms. 43, 44. 47 Scheduled dosing with inhaled beta 2 agonists should be continued until symptoms and PEF return to baseline.

### Treating exacerbations of asthma in children: the role of systemic corticosteroids [^116UTcLq]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the use of systemic corticosteroids to treat recurrent, acute asthma episodes in children, with a focus on the role of oral corticosteroids.

Methods

A comprehensive review of the literature was performed using the Medline database (January 1966-October 2002) and the Embase database (January 1980-August 2002).

Results

The significant findings of 17 selected, controlled clinical trials of oral corticosteroids (OCSs) for acute exacerbations of asthma in children, compared with placebo or with other formulations of corticosteroids, can be summarized as follows: 1) OCSs are effective for the outpatient treatment of acute asthma, 2) pulmonary function tests may not be the best means of assessing the efficacy of OCSs for acute asthma, 3) early administration of OCSs for acute asthma reduces hospitalizations, 4) the critical factor for a positive outcome is early administration of the corticosteroid, and 5) OCSs are preferred for the outpatient treatment of acute asthma.

Conclusions

Early treatment of acute asthma symptoms with OCSs in children with a pattern of recurrent acute asthma may decrease the severity of acute asthma episodes and reduce the likelihood of subsequent relapses. Attention should be given to identifying these children and standardizing a treatment approach based on accepted, consistent definitions of what constitutes an asthma exacerbation and recurrence. A suggested protocol is described.

### Corticosteroids for preventing relapse following acute exacerbations of asthma [^115o6Ere]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma is responsible for many emergency department (ED) visits annually. Between 12 to 16% will relapse to require additional interventions within two weeks of ED discharge. Treatment of acute asthma is based on rapid reversal of bronchospasm and reducing airway inflammation.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of corticosteroids (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous) for the treatment of asthmatic patients discharged from an acute care setting (i.e. usually the emergency department) after assessment and treatment of an acute asthmatic exacerbation.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of articles. In addition, authors of all included studies were contacted to locate unpublished studies. The most recent search was run in October 2006.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing two types of corticosteroids (oral, intra-muscular, or inhaled) with placebo for outpatient treatment of asthmatic exacerbations in adults or children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

Six trials involving 374 people were included. One study used intramuscular corticosteroids, five studies used oral corticosteroids. The review was split into two reviews and although the latest search yielded no additional placebo controlled trials an additional IM study was included. Significantly fewer patients in the corticosteroid group relapsed to receive additional care in the first week (Relative risk (RR) 0.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2 to 0.74). This favourable effect was maintained over the first 21 days (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.89) and there were fewer subsequent hospitalizations (RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.95). Patients receiving corticosteroids had less need for beta(2)-agonists (mean difference (MD) -3.3 activations/day; 95% CI -5.6 to -1.0). Changes in pulmonary function tests (SMD 0.045; 95% CI -0.47 to 0.56) and side effects (SMD 0.03; 95% CI -0.38 to 0.44) in the first 7 to 10 days, while rarely reported, showed no significant differences between the treatment groups. Statistically significant heterogeneity was identified for the side effect results; all other outcomes were homogeneous. From these results, as few as ten patients need to be treated to prevent relapse to additional care after an exacerbation of asthma.

Authors' Conclusions

A short course of corticosteroids following assessment for an asthma exacerbation significantly reduces the number of relapses to additional care, hospitalizations and use of short-acting beta(2)-agonist without an apparent increase in side effects. Intramuscular and oral corticosteroids are both effective.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^117UAZqk]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

### Systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma exacerbations [^116LH4cE]. The Journal of Asthma (2006). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of asthma may represent reactions to airway irritants or failures of chronic treatment. The costs to both the patient and society are high. Exacerbations often are frightening episodes that can cause significant morbidity and sometimes death. The emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations often required lead to significant health care expenses. Thus, preventing and optimizing management of acute exacerbations is critical. Corticosteroids are a cornerstone of asthma therapy. They have been shown to lower admission rates and reduce risk of relapse. This article provides an overview of the role of corticosteroids (including betamethasone, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisolone) in the management of acute asthma exacerbations, with an aim toward effective decision making about the choice of therapy.

### Management of acute exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department [^111SBV4V]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are the most common respiratory diseases requiring emergent medical evaluation and treatment. Asthma and COPD are chronic, debilitating disease processes that have been differentiated traditionally by the presence or absence of reversible airflow obstruction. Asthma and COPD exacerbations impose an enormous economic burden on the US health care budget. In daily clinical practice, it is difficult to differentiate these 2 obstructive processes based on their symptoms, and on their nearly identical acute treatment strategies; major differences are important when discussing anatomic sites involved, long-term prognosis, and the nature of inflammatory markers.

### Inhaled steroids for acute asthma following emergency department discharge [^115e1suT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with acute asthma treated in the emergency department (ED) are frequently treated with inhaled beta(2)-agonists and systemic corticosteroids after discharge. The use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) following discharge may also be beneficial in improving patient outcomes after acute asthma.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of ICS on outcomes in the treatment of acute asthma following discharge from the ED. To quantify the effectiveness of ICS therapy on acute asthma following ED discharge, when used in addition to, or as a substitute for, systemic corticosteroids.

Search Methods

Controlled clinical trials (CCTs) were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group register, which consists of systematic searches of EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL databases supplemented by handsearching of respiratory journals and conference proceedings. In addition, primary authors and pharmaceutical companies were contacted to identify eligible studies. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts also were searched. The searches have been conducted up to September 2012

Selection Criteria

We included both randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs. Studies were included if patients were treated for acute asthma in the ED or its equivalent, and following ED discharge were treated with ICS therapy either in addition to, or as a substitute for, oral corticosteroids. Two review authors independently assessed articles for potential relevance, final inclusion and methodological quality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two review authors, or confirmed by the study authors. Several authors and pharmaceutical companies provided unpublished data. The data were analysed using the Cochrane Review Manager software. Where appropriate, individual and pooled dichotomous outcomes were reported as odds ratios (OR) or relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, individual and pooled continuous outcomes were reported as mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs. The primary analysis employed a fixed effect model and heterogeneity is reported using I-squared (I²) statistics.

Main Results

Twelve trials were eligible for inclusion. Three of these trials, involving a total of 909 patients, compared ICS plus systemic corticosteroids versus oral corticosteroid therapy alone. There was no demonstrated benefit of ICS therapy when used in addition to oral corticosteroid therapy in the trials. Relapses were reduced; however, this was not statistically significant with the addition of ICS therapy (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.02; 3 studies; N = 909). In addition, no statistically significant differences were demonstrated between the two groups for relapses requiring admission, quality of life, symptom scores or adverse effects. Nine trials, involving a total of 1296 patients compared high-dose ICS therapy alone versus oral corticosteroid therapy alone after ED discharge. There were no significant differences demonstrated between ICS therapy alone versus oral corticosteroid therapy alone for relapse rates (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.52; 4 studies; N = 684), admissions to hospital, or in the secondary outcomes of beta(2)-agonist use, symptoms or adverse events. However, the sample size was not adequate to exclude the possibility of either treatment being significantly inferior and people with severe asthma were excluded from these trials.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy provides additional benefit when used in combination with standard systemic corticosteroid therapy upon ED discharge for acute asthma. There is some evidence that high-dose ICS therapy alone may be as effective as oral corticosteroid therapy when used in mild asthmatics upon ED discharge; however, the confidence intervals were too wide to be confident of equal effectiveness. Further research is needed to clarify whether ICS therapy should be employed in acute asthma treatment following ED discharge. The review does not suggest any reason to stop usual treatment with ICS following ED discharge, even if a course of oral corticosteroids are prescribed.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^1123dw1X]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A new look for the GINA report — practical and practice-oriented

While retaining its solid evidence base, the 2014 GINA report was developed with the specific aim of improving utility for busy clinicians, with a user-friendly format, clear language and layout, and liberal use of practical summary tables and flow charts to assist with problems that clinicians face every day. These resources include flow charts for managing acute asthma in primary-care and acute-care facilities, and tables briefly summarising options for non-pharmacological treatment, and for stepping down or stepping up from different treatment regimens/doses (see Figure 1 for examples). Background detail about physiology and pharmacology was moved to an Online Appendix. Information is provided in the report not only about 'what' should be done and 'why' (what evidence supports the recommendation) but also 'how' it can be implemented effectively; for example, practical advice is provided about how to ask patients about their adherence in a non-judgemental way.

### BTS / NICE / SIGN guideline for asthma 2024: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management. how does this compare to GINA 2024? [^111xSVQC]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methodology and scope

The GINA Strategy report was first produced in 1995, updated annually since 2002 and provides a comprehensive review of acute and chronic asthma across a range of severities. The 2024 NICE/BTS/SIGN Guideline, principally, as the title suggests, focuses on diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management. It is important to note that management of acute and chronic severe asthma is excluded.

Updated relevant clinical evidence is reviewed by the GINA scientific committee (composed of respiratory interested physicians) based on criteriadeveloped by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in the USA. The BTS/NICE/SIGN Asthma Guideline Committee is composed of multidisciplinary members (such as primary and secondary care physicians, nurses and pharmacists) and includes patient members. Evidence is analysed and recommendations made using NICE methodologywhich significantly, in contrast to GINA, places additional emphasis on economic data, particularly cost-effectiveness. A critical value is the cost of an intervention expressed as the cost per Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) An intervention with a cost per-QALY of less than 20,000 pounds sterling (24,000 Euros) is considered as being cost-effective.

### Is severity assessment after one hour of treatment better for predicting the need for admission in acute asthma? [^115BZDHF]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine if severity assessment after 1 h of treatment is better than assessment at presentation for predicting the requirement for hospital admission for emergency department (ED) patients with acute asthma.

Methods

Prospective, observational study conducted in 36 Australian ED for a 2-week period in 2001 involving patients aged 1–55 years presenting with asthma. Data collected included severity assessment according to the National Asthma Guidelines (Australia) at presentation and 1 h, and disposition. Descriptive analysis was applied.

Results

720 cases were analysed. Patients with 'mild' asthma at either assessment time had a greater than 80% chance of discharge home. Patients assessed as 'severe' at either assessment had a greater than 85% chance of requiring hospital admission, but the 1 h assessment was better at predicting the need for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. For the 'moderate' group, the initial assessment was a poor predictor of the need for admission however those who met the criteria for 'moderate' severity at 1 h had an 84% chance of requiring admission.

Conclusion

Assessment of asthma severity after 1 h of treatment is better than initial severity assessment for determining the need for hospital admission for patients initially assessed as having 'moderate' asthma and for predicting the need for ICU in patients initially assessed as 'severe'.

### Asthma evaluation and management [^114V2FDA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory illness with acute exacerbations, which often is encountered in the ED setting. Knowledge of the presentation and treatment of asthma is crucial for any physician treating patients with this disease. Beta-agonist, anticholinergic, and corticosteroid therapy continue to be the mainstay of emergency therapy despite advances in newer medications. Proper attention to long-term treatment of asthma and aggressive treatment of acute exacerbations should help reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Use of fractional exhaled nitric oxide to guide the treatment of asthma: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^117Aq171]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Target Audience

This practice guideline is designed to provide guidance to clinicians who manage adults and children 4 years of age and older with asthma, including adult and pediatric pulmonologists, adult and pediatric allergists, internists, pediatricians, family medicine specialists, and other healthcare providers involved in the care of patients with asthma. The use of this guideline is not designed for the evaluation and management of acute asthma but rather is designed for treatment decisions in ambulatory settings for the ongoing management of this common disease.

### The patient with asthma in the emergency department [^112h47vp]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is a highly prevalent disease that presents commonly to the emergency department (ED) in acute exacerbation. Recent asthma treatment guidelines have added content dedicated to the management of acute exacerbations. Effective management of an exacerbation requires rapid assessment of severity through physical examination, measurement of peak expiratory flow rate, and response to initial treatment. Most therapies are directed at alleviating bronchospasm and decreasing airway inflammation. While inhaled short-acting beta-agonists, systemic corticosteroids, and supplemental oxygen are the initial and often only therapies required for patients with mild moderate exacerbations, high-dose beta agonists and inhaled anti-cholinergics should also be given to patients with severe exacerbations. Adjunctive therapy with intravenous magnesium and Heliox-driven nebulization of bronchodilators should be considered for patients presenting with severe and very severe exacerbations. Early recognition and appropriate management of respiratory failure are required to mitigate the risk of complications including death. Disposition should be determined based on serial assessments of the response to therapy over the first 4 h in the ED. Patients stable for discharge should receive medications, asthma education including a written asthma action plan, and should have follow-up scheduled for them by ED staff. Rapid implementation of evidence-based, multi-disciplinary care is required to ensure the best possible outcomes for this potentially treatable disease.

### Corticosteroids for preventing relapse following acute exacerbations of asthma [^11765Qen]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma is responsible for many emergency department visits annually. Between 12–16% will relapse to require additional interventions within two weeks of ED discharge. Treatment of acute asthma is based on rapid reversal of bronchospasm and reducing airway inflammation and this review examines the evidence for using systemic corticosteroids to improve outcomes after discharge from the ED.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of corticosteroids (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous) for the treatment of asthmatic patients discharged from an acute care setting (i.e. usually the emergency department) after assessment and treatment of an acute asthmatic exacerbation.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Airways Group "Asthma and Wheez* RCT" register was searched using the terms: a) Asthma OR Wheez* b) Glucocorticoid OR Steroid* AND c) Exacerbat* OR Relapse* OR Emerg*. In addition, authors of all included studies were contacted to determine if unpublished studies which met the inclusion criteria were available. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts were also searched for additional citations.

Selection Criteria

Only randomized controlled trials were eligible for selection. Studies were included in this review if they dealt with the outpatient treatment of asthmatic exacerbations using glucocorticoids at discharge and reported either relapse rate or PFTs. Two independent reviewers first identified potentially relevant studies and then selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was assessed independently by two reviewers. Agreement was assessed using kappa (k) statistics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers; authors were contacted to verify the extracted data and clarify missing information. When author contact was unsuccessful, missing data were estimated from graphs where possible. Sensitivity, sub-group and overall analyses were performed using the Cochrane Review Manager.

Main Results

A search that yielded 229 references identified 169 (73%) original publications. Reviewers identified 8 studies for potential inclusion (k = 0.76); 18 references were added by searching publication reference lists and contact with authors. Of these 26 articles, a total of 7 were included in the overview. Two studies used intramuscular corticosteroids, five studies used oral corticosteroids. Significantly fewer patients in the corticosteroid group relapsed to receive additional care in the first week (odds ratio (OR) 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17, 0.73). This favourable effect was maintained over the first 21 days (OR 0.33; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.82). Patients receiving corticosteroids had less need for beta-agonists (weighted mean difference (WMD) -3.3 activations/day; 95% CI: -5.5, -1.0). Changes in pulmonary function tests (SMD 0.045; 95% CI: -0.47, 0.56) and side effects (SMD 0.03; 95% CI: -0.38, 0.44) in the first 7–10 days, while rarely reported, showed no differences between the treatment groups. Statistically significant heterogeneity was identified for the side effect results; all other outcomes were homogeneous. It appears that IM corticosteroids are similarly efficacious to a 7–10 day tapering course of oral agents. From these results, as few as 13 patients need to be treated to prevent relapse to additional care after an exacerbation of asthma.

Reviewer's Conclusions

A short course of corticosteroids following assessment for an acute exacerbation of asthma significantly reduces the number of relapses to additional care and decreases beta-agonist use without an apparent increase in side effects. Intramuscular corticosteroids appear as effective as oral agents.

### Asthma in adults (acute): magnesium sulfate treatment [^112rkSc5]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild to moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This overview does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about a specific intervention, magnesium sulfate.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of magnesium sulfate for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to November 2014 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 50 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 24 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 10 studies and the further review of 14 full publications. Of the 14 full articles evaluated, one systematic review was updated and one systematic review was added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for five PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for two comparisons based on information about the effectiveness and safety of magnesium sulfate (iv) versus placebo and magnesium sulfate (nebulised) plus short-acting beta2 agonists (inhaled) versus short-acting beta2 agonists (inhaled) alone.

### Successful implementation of spacer treatment guideline for acute asthma [^114mU15h]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2001). Low credibility.

Aims

To develop and implement an evidence based guideline for the treatment of acute asthma using a metered dose inhaler and spacer combination.

Methods

Defined strategies were used for the development and implementation of a guideline, assessed by a prospective, descriptive, study using notes review, and patient, nursing, and medical staff telephone contact. The setting was a tertiary referral hospital in Victoria, Australia with 25 000 yearly admissions, and asthma accounting for about 7% of total. The first 200 children and families to use the guideline after its introduction were evaluated.

Results

A total of 191 (95.5%) children were treated according to the guideline. Six (3.0%) children were given nebulisers appropriately based on severity; five (2.5%) were given nebulisers at parental or child choice; and four (2.0%) who did not have severe asthma, received nebulised treatment inappropriately.

Conclusions

Successful implementation of a new evidence based guideline can be achieved using specific strategies for promoting the application of research findings in the clinical arena.

### Factors associated with relapse in adult patients discharged from the emergency department following acute asthma: a systematic review [^116t1CZD]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Reducing relapses after treatment for acute asthma represents a potential improvement in the quality of life for patients with asthma and a reducible strain on crowded EDs. Moreover, they present an opportunity to improve outcomes for patients while reducing direct healthcare costs. Practical factors associated with relapse occurrence within 4 weeks of ED discharge have been identified, which may help to stratify patients based on their risks and potentially influence disposition decisions. Further research should focus on strategies to decrease relapses using validated clinical decision rules in order to identify patients at high risk for relapse after discharge, optimise their management and improve outcomes.

### Acute asthma in adults: a review [^114WYiG4]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

All patients with asthma are at risk of having exacerbations. Hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits account for a large proportion of the health-care cost burden of asthma, and avoidance or proper management of acute asthma (AA) episodes represent an area with the potential for large reductions in health-care costs. The severity of exacerbations may range from mild to life threatening, and mortality is most often associated with failure to appreciate the severity of the exacerbation, resulting in inadequate emergency treatment and delay in referring to hospital. This review describes the epidemiology, costs, pathophysiology, mortality, and management of adult AA in the ED and in the ICU.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^111o7unW]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Severe, life-threatening asthma and COPD exacerbations are managed commonly in the ICU and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is important to understand the commonalities and differences in the diagnosis and management of these obstructive lung diseases to improve patient outcomes via evidence-based care. In this review, we first outline triggers of acute asthma and COPD exacerbations and an initial diagnostic evaluation and severity assessment. We then review the pathophysiologic features of asthma and COPD exacerbations and create a framework for the management of exacerbations in critically ill adult patients aimed at reducing airway inflammation, reversing bronchospasm, and, in severe cases, supporting patients with mechanical ventilation or advanced therapies until clinical improvement is achieved.

### Treatment… [^111zjRmt]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

20 recommend a stepwise approach to pharmacologic treatment starting with the most aggressive therapy necessary to achieve control, followed by a "step down" to the minimal therapy that will maintain control. The goals of pharmacologic therapy are to minimize daytime and nocturnal symptoms, the number of asthma episodes and the use of short-acting beta agonists, to improve PEF to 80 percent or more of personal best and to allow the child to maintain normal activities without producing adverse medication side effects. acute symptoms and before exercise to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm. QUICK-RELIEF MEDICATIONS These drugs, including short-acting inhaled or oral beta 2 agonists, short-course oral corticosteroids or ipratropium, are taken as needed for immediate relief of acute symptoms and before exercise to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm. Short-acting beta.

26 Oral corticosteroids have broad anti-inflammatory effects and may be used in a limited, short course to gain initial control of the asthma and speed resolution of moderate-persistent or severe-persistent exacerbations. 26 The anticholinergic drug ipratropium is not approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of asthma in children 12 years or younger. However, it has been prescribed for off-label use in children with asthma and may be helpful in those rare children who do not tolerate inhaled beta. LONG-TERM CONTROL MEDICATIONS Medications for long-term control should be taken daily to maintain control of asthma and prevent exacerbations. Inhaled corticosteroids are the most potent and effective long-term anti-inflammatory medications.

They reduce inflammation in airways, improve pulmonary function to a greater degree than any other medication, reduce bronchial hyperre-sponsiveness and may reduce some aspects of airway remodeling, thus modifying disease progression. Some corticosteroids are effective in once- or twice-daily dosing regimens and may be used in all patient groups and for all levels of disease severity. Antileukotriene agents were developed to inhibit the effects of leukotrienes. This class of drugs represents the first new approach to asthma therapy in 25 years. The leukotriene receptor antagonists montelukast and zafirlukast, and the 5-lipoxyge-nase inhibitor zileuton are unique in their ability to target specific components of asthmatic inflammation.

### Intramuscular versus oral corticosteroids to reduce relapses following discharge from the emergency department for acute asthma [^117LJQjE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma is a common cause of presentations to acute care centres, such as the emergency department (ED), and while the majority of patients can be discharged, relapse requiring additional medical care is common. Systemic corticosteroids are a major part in the treatment of moderate to severe acute asthma; however, there is no clear evidence regarding the most effective route of administration for improving outcomes in patients discharged from acute care.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness and safety of a single dose of intramuscular (IM) corticosteroids provided prior to discharge compared to a short course of oral corticosteroids in the treatment of acute asthma patients discharged from an ED or equivalent acute care setting.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Airways Group conducted searches of the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, most recently on 14 March 2018. In addition in April 2017 we completed an extensive search of nine electronic databases including Medline, Embase, EBM ALL, Global Health, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Proquest Dissertations and Theses Global, and LILACS. Furthermore, we searched the grey literature to identify any additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials if they compared the effectiveness of intramuscular (IM) versus oral corticosteroids to treat paediatric or adult patients presenting with acute asthma to an ED or equivalent acute care setting. Two independent reviewers assessed study eligibility and study quality. We resolved disagreements via a third party and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Data Collection and Analysis

For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated individual and pooled statistics as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. We reported continuous outcomes using mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs using a random-effects model. We reported heterogeneity using I² and Cochran Q statistics. We used standard procedures recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

Nine studies involving 804 participants (IM = 402 participants; oral = 402 participants) met our review inclusion criteria. Four studies enrolled children (n = 245 participants), while five studies enrolled adults (n = 559 participants). All of the studies recruited participants presenting to an ED, except one study which recruited participants attending a primary care clinic. All of the paediatric studies compared intramuscular (IM) dexamethasone to oral prednisone/prednisolone. In the adult studies, the IM corticosteroid provided ranged from methylprednisolone, betamethasone, dexamethasone, or triamcinolone, while the regimen of oral corticosteroids provided consisted of prednisone, methylprednisolone, or dexamethasone. Only five studies were placebo controlled. For the purposes of this review, we did not take corticosteroid dose equivalency into account in the analysis. The most common co-intervention provided to participants during the acute care visit included short-acting beta₂-agonists (SABA), methylxanthines, and ipratropium bromide. In some instances, some studies reported providing some participants with supplemental oral or IV corticosteroids during their stay in the ED. Co-interventions provided to participants at discharge consisted primarily of SABA, methylxanthine, long-acting beta₂-agonists (LABA), and ipratropium bromide. The risk of bias of the included studies ranged from unclear to high across various domains. The primary outcome of interest was relapse to additional care defined as an unscheduled visit to a health practitioner for worsening asthma symptoms, or requiring subsequent treatment with corticosteroids which may have occurred at any time point after discharge from the ED. We found intramuscular and oral corticosteroids to be similarly effective in reducing the risk for relapse (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.24; 9 studies, 804 participants; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). We found no subgroup differences in relapse rates between paediatric and adult participants (P = 0.71), relapse occurring within or after 10 days post-discharge (P = 0.22), or participants with mild/moderate or severe exacerbations (P = 0.35). While we found no statistical difference between participants receiving IM versus oral corticosteroids regarding the risk for adverse events (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.07; 5 studies, 404 participants; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), an estimated 50 fewer patients per 1000 receiving IM corticosteroids reported experiencing adverse events (95% from 106 fewer to 21 more). We found inconsistent reporting of specific adverse events across the studies. There were no differences in the frequency of specific adverse events including nausea and vomiting, pain, swelling, redness, insomnia, or personality changes. We did not seek additional adverse events data. Participants receiving IM corticosteroids or oral corticosteroids both reported decreases in peak expiratory flow (MD -7.78 L/min, 95% CI -38.83 L/min to 23.28 L/min; 4 studies, 272 participants; I² = 33%; moderate-quality evidence), similar symptom persistence (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.20; 3 studies, 80 participants; I² = 44%; low-quality evidence), and 24-hour beta-agonist use (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.37; 2 studies, 48 participants; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to identify whether IM corticosteroids are more effective in reducing relapse compared to oral corticosteroids among children or adults discharged from an ED or equivalent acute care setting for acute asthma. While we found no statistical differences, patients receiving IM corticosteroids reported fewer adverse events. Additional studies comparing the effectiveness of IM versus oral corticosteroids could provide further evidence clarity. Furthermore, there is a need for studies comparing different IM corticosteroids (e.g. IM dexamethasone versus IM methylprednisone) and different oral corticosteroids (e.g. oral dexamethasone versus oral prednisone), with consideration for dosing and pharmacokinetic properties, to better identify the optimal IM or oral corticosteroid regimens to improve patient outcomes. Other factors, such as patient preference and potential issues with adherence, may dictate practitioner prescribing.

### Management of acute, severe asthma in children [^111xg7yE]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To briefly present the current options available for the treatment of acute, severe asthma in children, with a special focus on emergency department and inpatient treatment, and to describe newer therapies that may aid treatment in the future.

Data Sources and Study Selection

A MEDLINE search (1966-May 2001) of the English-language literature pertaining to drug therapy of acute asthma was performed. Key word searches included acute asthma, albuterol, ipratropium, corticosteroids, magnesium, and theophylline. Additional articles from these sources and published national guidelines were identified. Relevant studies pertaining to current therapy of acute asthma in pediatric patients were selected; if there were minimal pediatric data, adult data were included.

Data Synthesis

Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disorder of the airways. Acute exacerbations can occur and are challenging to manage. Albuterol, ipratropium, and systemic corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in acute asthma exacerbations. Because some patients do not respond to maximal therapy, older therapies such as magnesium and theophylline are being reevaluated. Theophylline may have some therapeutic effect, but given its toxicity profile, it is unclear whether it offers any advantage over maximal beta(2)-agonist therapy. There are only minimal published data evaluating the use of magnesium in pediatrics, and most are small trials or case reports. Newer therapies such as ventilation strategies with heliox and intravenous leukotriene modifiers currently being evaluated may or may not prove to be beneficial in the future.

Conclusions

beta(2)-agonists, ipratropium, and corticosteroids remain the most useful therapeutic agents for acute asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients. However, these agents are not ideal in all patients and, given the existing questions regarding safety and/or efficacy of available alternatives, more effective options are needed.

### Early use of inhaled corticosteroids in the emergency department treatment of acute asthma [^1144JMme]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroid therapy is central to the management of acute asthma The use of inhaled corticosteroids may also be beneficial in this setting.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with acute asthma managed in the emergency department (ED).

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group register. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews, and texts also were searched. The search is considered updated to February of 2003.

Selection Criteria

Only RCTs or quasi-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Studies were included if patients presented with acute asthma to the ED or its equivalent, and were treated with inhaled corticosteroids or placebo, in addition to standard therapy. Two reviewers independently selected potentially relevant articles, and then independently selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers if the authors were unable to verify the validity of extracted information. Missing data were obtained from the authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper.

Main Results

Eight trials were selected for inclusion, but data were not available for one of them. In the seven usable trials, (4 adult, 3 paediatric), a total of 376 patients were studied (191 with inhaled corticosteroids, 185 without). Patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids were less likely to be admitted to hospital (OR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.57). This benefit was evident in the subgroup of patients not receiving concomitant systemic steroids (OR 0.21; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.53). Patients receiving concomitant systemic steroids showed a similar, but non-significant, trend towards reduced admissions compared to placebo treatment (OR 0.45; 95% CI: 0.18, 1.12). Patients receiving inhaled corticosteroids also demonstrated small, significant improvements in peak expiratory flows (PEFR WMD: 8%; 95% CI: 3, 13%) and forced expiratory volumes (FEV1 WMD: 5%; 95% CI: 0.4, 10%). The treatment was well tolerated, with few reported adverse side effects. A secondary analysis compared inhaled corticosteroids alone vs systemic steroids alone; in the four trials included, there was significant heterogeneity between the study results for admission rates which precluded meaningful pooling of the study results.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Inhaled steroids reduced admission rates in patients with acute asthma, but it is unclear if there is a benefit of inhaled corticosteroids when used in addition to systemic corticosteroids. There is insufficient evidence that inhaled corticosteroids result in clinically important changes in pulmonary function or clinical scores when used in acute asthma. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence that inhaled corticosteroids alone are as effective as systemic steroids. Further research is needed to clarify if there is a benefit of inhaled corticosteroids when used in addition to systemic steroids.

### Pediatric acute asthma exacerbations: evaluation and management from emergency department to intensive care unit [^112GBa4E]. The Journal of Asthma (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this report is to review available modalities for assessing and managing acute asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients, including some that are not included in current expert panel guidelines. While it is not our purpose to provide a comprehensive review of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines, we review NAEPP-recommended treatments to provide the full range of treatments available for managing exacerbations with an emphasis on the continuum of care between the ER and ICU.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed using the following search terms in different combinations: asthma, children, pediatric, exacerbation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, guidelines, treatment, management, oxygen, albuterol, β2-agonist, anticholinergic, theophylline, corticosteroid, magnesium, heliox, BiPAP, ventilation, mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and respiratory failure. We attempted to weigh the evidence using the hierarchy in which meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide the strongest evidence, followed by individual RCTs, followed by observational studies. We also reviewed the NAEPP and Global Initiative for Asthma expert panel guidelines.

Results and Conclusions

Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, and acute exacerbations are a significant burden to patients and to public health. Optimal assessment and management of exacerbations, including appropriate escalation of interventions, are essential to minimize morbidity and prevent mortality. While inhaled albuterol and systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of exacerbation management, escalation may include interventions discussed in this review.

### Treatment of acute severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Danish hospitals. Do national recommendations improve on the quality of the treatment? [^115aCXqg]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Studies have demonstrated suboptimal treatment of acute severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We examined the quality of treatment in Denmark and the effect of intervention, by publication of recommendations for standardised treatment. All 70 hospitals in Denmark with emergency facilities participated in a telephone questionnaire, examining treatment behaviours among house officers. The survey was repeated 3 years later, after publication of national recommendations for treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD. The response rate in both surveys was 100%. An insufficient handling of nebulisers, a huge variation in the delivered dose of bronchodilators and a suboptimal use of corticosteroids was found. A significant trend towards more liberate use of oxygen was seen in both asthma (3.2 l min(-1) versus 4.8 l min(-1), P < 0.001) and COPD (1.5 l min(-1) versus 1.9 l min(-1), P = 0.047). Further, a huge difference in treatment behaviours was revealed from this survey The knowledge among house officers of basic principles of treatment was insufficient. Treatment behaviour was only moderately affected by national publication of detailed recommendations for treatment. This study indicates a need for implementing tools for quality control.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^115mUwa7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations, or 'attacks', during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans sometimes advocate a short-term increase in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at the first sign of an exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of ICS as part of a patient-initiated action plan for the home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and handsearched abstracts to 20 December 2021. We also searched major trial registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel and cross-over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that allocated people with persistent asthma to take a blinded inhaler in the event of an exacerbation which either increased their daily dose of ICS or kept it stable (placebo).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We reassessed risk of bias for all studies at the result level using the revised risk of bias tool for RCTs (Risk of Bias 2), and employed the GRADE approach to assess our confidence in the synthesised effect estimates. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as the need for rescue oral steroids in the randomised population. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure in the subset who initiated the study inhaler (treated population), unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, serious and non-serious adverse events, and duration of exacerbation.

Main Results

This review update added a new study that increased the number of people in the primary analysis from 1520 to 1774, and incorporates the most up-to-date methods to assess the likely impact of bias within the meta-analyses. The updated review now includes nine RCTs (1923 participants; seven parallel and two cross-over) conducted in Europe, North America, and Australasia and published between 1998 and 2018. Five studies evaluated adult populations (n = 1247; ≥ 15 years), and four studies evaluated child or adolescent populations (n = 676; < 15 years). All study participants had mild to moderate asthma. Studies varied in the dose of maintenance ICS, age, fold increase of ICS in the event of an exacerbation, criteria for initiating the study inhaler, and allowed medications. Approximately 50% of randomised participants initiated the study inhaler (range 23% to 100%), and the included studies reported treatment failure in a variety of ways, meaning assumptions were required to permit the combining of data. Participants randomised to increase their ICS dose at the first signs of an exacerbation had similar odds of needing rescue oral corticosteroids to those randomised to a placebo inhaler (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.25; 8 studies; 1774 participants; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence). We could draw no firm conclusions from subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, baseline dose, smoking history, and fold increase of ICS on the primary outcome. Results for the same outcome in the subset of participants who initiated the study inhaler were unchanged from the previous version, which provides a different point estimate with very low confidence due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; 7 studies; 766 participants; I² = 42%; random-effects model). Confidence was reduced due to risk of bias and assumptions that had to be made to include study data in the intention-to-treat and treated-population analyses. Sensitivity analyses that tested the impact of assumptions made for synthesis and to exclude cross-over studies, studies at overall high risk of bias, and those with commercial funding did not change our conclusions. Pooled effects for unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, and duration of exacerbation made it very difficult to determine where the true effect may lie, and confidence was reduced by risk of bias. Point estimates for both serious and non-serious adverse events favoured keeping ICS stable, but imprecision and risk of bias due to missing data and outcome measurement and reporting reduced our confidence in the effects (serious adverse events: OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; 2 studies; 394 participants; I² = 0%; non-serious adverse events: OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; 2 studies; 142 participants; I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from double-blind trials of adults and children with mild to moderate asthma suggests there is unlikely to be an important reduction in the need for oral steroids from increasing a patient's ICS dose at the first sign of an exacerbation. Other clinically important benefits and potential harms of increased doses of ICS compared with keeping the dose stable cannot be ruled out due to wide confidence intervals, risk of bias in the trials, and assumptions that had to be made for synthesis. Included studies conducted between 1998 and 2018 reflect evolving clinical practice and study methods, and the data do not support thorough investigation of effect modifiers such as baseline dose, fold increase, asthma severity and timing. The review does not include recent evidence from pragmatic, unblinded studies showing benefits of larger dose increases in those with poorly controlled asthma. A systematic review is warranted to examine the differences between the blinded and unblinded trials using robust methods for assessing risk of bias to present the most complete view of the evidence for decision makers.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117WCiRQ]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Protocol registration and reporting

The protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022373692, available at). The review was done as per the methodology described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and is being reported as per the updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

Research question

Does inhaled/nebulised MgSO 4 as an adjunct to SABA, compared with standard therapy, help reduce asthma severity score in children presenting with acute asthma exacerbation?

Information sources and eligibility criteria

We searched Medline (via PubMed), Embase, Web of Science and CENTRAL for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published from inception until 15 December 2023. The search was further updated on 15 February 2024. We did not use any language restrictions or filters during the database search. The electronic search was supplemented by a manual search of the bibliography of relevant reports to identify additional citations. We also searched various registries (until 15 December 2023), namely ClinicalTrials.gov, Clinical Trial Registry of India, Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry and the European Union Clinical Trials Register. We included studies if they meet all the following criteria: (1) population: children aged 1–18 years with acute asthma, (2) intervention: inhaled/nebulised MgSO 4, (3) control: either placebo with standard therapy or standard therapy alone, (4) study design: parallel-group RCTs. Studies will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria: (1) population: adults, (2) intervention: oral or intravenous MgSO 4, (3) study design: non-RCT/crossover RCT, and studies published in non-English language or as abstract only.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the asthma severity. There are multiple scores for assessing asthma severity, namely the Pulmonary Index Score, Pediatric Asthma Severity Score, Childhood Asthma Scoreand the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure. All these scores are on an ordinal scale where increasing scores mean increasing disease severity. We combined studies reporting similar scores. If different scores were reported across studies, then we combined them using standardised mean difference (SMD) calculated by the following formula:

Secondary outcomes included pulmonary function tests (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)), need for hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of hospital stay, effect on physiological parameters (heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation) and adverse events, including mortality before discharge.

### The role of magnesium sulfate in acute asthma: does route of administration make a difference? [^116ifTNd]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The role of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) in the treatment of acute asthma is not clear. Four recent systematic reviews suggest a limited role of intravenous (i.v.) and inhaled nebulized treatment. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature, focus on two recent large multicenter randomized controlled trials, and discuss future research directions.

Recent Findings

The Magnesium Nebulized Trial In Children (MAGNETIC) trial has shown little benefit to routine use of nebulized MgSO4 in children with acute asthma, but there may be a benefit in those with severe exacerbations and a shorter duration of symptoms. The 3Mg trial has shown no role for nebulized MgSO4 in adults and, at best a limited role for i.v. MgSO4 in only the most severe exacerbations. This is the only study with direct comparison of nebulized and i.v. MgSO4.

Summary

MgSO4 has a role in severe exacerbations of acute asthma and there is no evidence of benefit outside this clinical situation. Both nebulized and i.v. treatments are well tolerated and inexpensive. In adults, the most effective route of administration is i.v. There are no direct comparison studies in children. Further research should focus on more severe exacerbations.

### Definition of critical asthma syndromes [^1111NGFd]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Urgent visits to the clinic and emergency department for acute severe asthma exacerbations are all too frequent. Existing national guidelines do not present consistent or specific recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of individual asthma patients in respiratory distress. In this vein, we propose the term "critical asthma syndrome" (CAS) to describe any child or adult who is at high risk for fatal asthma. Acute severe asthma, refractory asthma, status asthmaticus, and near-fatal asthma all describe CAS where physical exhaustion from the overwhelming work of breathing leads to respiratory arrest and death from hypoxia or related complications. The authors of this supplement seek to emphasize the importance of early recognition, prompt and coordinated evaluation, and treatment of CAS in the emergency department, hospital, and intensive care units by experienced healthcare provider teams. CAS is not severe persistent asthma where control of symptoms and prevention of exacerbations are targets of chronic disease management in the outpatient setting. The authors address the distinctions between the two entities throughout the supplement, and elaborate on the considerations important in the care of a critically ill patient, including the common errors to avoid. In addition, gaps in knowledge and clinical experience in regards to critical asthma are highlighted. Knowledge gaps include a lack of understanding of how to recognize CAS, how to coordinate and integrate hospital and outpatient resources, when to further phenotype patients with critical asthma in order to facilitate effective treatment, and how to prevent future acute exacerbations. Lastly, CAS is complicated by the fact that asthma care in diverse healthcare settings is haphazard. We recommend that primary care physicians refer patients promptly to an asthma specialist for consultation to reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations and prevent the development of CAS.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1117x8e1]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, systemic corticosteroids, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer systemic corticosteroids in acute care settings to speed resolution of exacerbations and prevent relapses in all adult, adolescent, and pediatric (6–11 years of age) patients with asthma exacerbation, except for the mildest exacerbations.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111cq7WD]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids for acute asthma — timing and doses: OCS should be given promptly, especially if the patient is deteriorating, or had already increased their reliever and maintenance ICS-containing medications before presenting (Evidence B). The recommended dose of prednisolone for adults is 1 mg/kg/day or equivalent up to a maximum of 50 mg/day, and 1–2 mg/kg/day for children 6–11 years.

### Inhaled budesonide in the management of acute worsenings and exacerbations of asthma: a review of the evidence [^113fCEr7]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The use of systemic corticosteroids, together with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy, has become established for the management of acute asthma. These agents are undoubtedly effective, but are also associated with problems such as metabolic adverse effects. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) offer potential benefit in the acute setting because they are delivered directly to the airways. They are also likely to reduce systemic exposure, which would lead in turn to reductions in rates of unwanted systemic effects. In order to evaluate the role of budesonide in the management of acute asthma exacerbations we conducted a review of the literature and critically evaluated the rationale for the use of ICS in general in this setting. Trials in adults and children requiring treatment for acute exacerbation of asthma have shown clinical and/or spirometric benefit for budesonide when delivered via nebulizer, dry powder inhaler, or aerosol in the emergency department, hospital and follow-up settings. The efficacy seems to benefit from high doses given repeatedly during the initial phase of an acute exacerbation. These acute effects are likely to be linked to the drug's distinctive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. The current evidence base revealed encouraging results regarding the efficacy of the ICS budesonide in patients with wheeze and acute worsening of asthma. Future studies should focus on the efficacy of these agents in more severe asthma worsenings.

### Management of acute loss of asthma control in the yellow zone: a practice parameter [^116iLTDn]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Yellow zone asthma — escalation and implementation: Summary Statement 4 states to instruct patients to escalate asthma therapy when they experience a loss of asthma control that puts them in the "yellow zone" (Recommendation: B Evidence), and once a patient experiences the onset of yellow zone symptoms, implementation of a yellow zone management strategy should commence without delay to prevent further deterioration of asthma control. The document notes that the ideal treatment strategy has not been identified and thus no single recommendation can be made, and treatment strategies will be reviewed and stratified by the age of the patient (0–4, 5–12, and > 12 years). For pharmacologic interventions in this situation, characteristics include quick onset of action with relief of symptoms; reliable prevention of progression to the red zone; safe enough to initiate at home by the patient, with acceptable and minimal side effects with repeated use over time; convenient dosing schedule, with frequency and route of administration that are practical for patients to self-administer; easy-to-use portable device if a device is needed; and cost effective, with cost of treatment justified by its potential benefit.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115hMT4R]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (monitoring and discharge), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain close monitoring during exacerbation treatment, and titrate treatment according to the response. Transfer patients immediately to an acute care facility when presenting with signs of a severe or life-threatening exacerbation not responding to treatment or continuing to deteriorate. Obtain close monitoring in patients with little or slow response to short-acting β-agonists.

### Continuous versus intermittent β-agonists in the treatment of acute asthma [^114z8Sgi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with acute asthma treated in the emergency department are frequently treated with intermittent inhaled beta-agonists delivered by nebulisation. The use of continuous beta-agonist (CBA) via nebulisation in the emergency setting may offer additional benefits in acute asthma.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy (e.g., reductions in admission, improvement in pulmonary functions) and risks (e.g., adverse events, effects on vital signs) of continuous versus intermittent inhaled beta-agonists for the treatment of patients with acute asthma managed in the emergency department.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group "Asthma and WHEEZ" Register which is a compilation of systematic searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL and hand searching of 20 respiratory journals. In addition, primary authors and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts were also searched. The search is considered updated to June 2003.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion. Studies were included if patients presented with acute asthma and were treated with either continuous or intermittent inhaled beta-agonists early in the ED treatment. "Continuous" nebulisation was defined as truly continuous aerosol delivery of beta-agonist medication (e.g., using a commercially available large-volume nebuliser, or a small-volume nebuliser with infusion pump) or sufficiently frequent nebulisations that medication delivery was effectively continuous (i.e., 1 nebulisation every 15 minutes or > 4 nebulisations per hour). Studies also needed to report either pulmonary function or admission results. Two reviewers independently selected potentially relevant articles and two additional reviewers independently selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers if the authors were unable to verify the validity of information. Missing data were obtained from authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. The data were analysed using the Cochrane Review Manager (Version 4.1). Relative risks (RR), weighted mean differences (WMD) and standardized mean differences (SMD) are reported with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI); both peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV-1) data are reported.

Main Results

165 trials were reviewed and eight were included; a total of 461 patients have been studied (229 with CBA; 232 with intermittent beta-agonists). Overall, admission to hospital was reduced with CBA compared to intermittent beta-agonists (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.5 to 0.9); patients with severe airway obstruction at presentation appeared to benefit most from this intervention (RR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.5 to 0.9). Patients receiving CBA demonstrated small but statistically significant improvements in pulmonary function tests when all studies were pooled. Patients receiving CBA had greater improvements in % predicted FEV-1 (SMD: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.5) and PEFR (SMD: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.5); this effect was observed by 2–3 hours. Continuous treatment was generally well tolerated, with no clinically important differences observed in pulse rate (WMD: -2.87; 95% CI: -6.0 to 0.3) or blood pressure (WMD: -1.75; 95% CI: -5.6 to 2.1) between the treatment groups. Tremor was equally common in both groups (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.5 to 1.3) and potassium concentration was unchanged (WMD: 0.02; 95% CI: -0.2 to 0.2).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Current evidence supports the use of CBA in patients with severe acute asthma who present to the emergency department to increase their pulmonary functions and reduce hospitalisation. Moreover, CBA treatment appears to be safe and well tolerated in patients who receive it.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116aZEEc]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Initial asthma treatment in children 6–11 years provides preferred initial treatment by presenting symptoms, and states that these recommendations are based on evidence and consensus. Infrequent asthma symptoms (e.g., 1–2 days/week or less): Low-dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken (Evidence B) in combination or in separate inhalers. Asthma symptoms 2–5 days/week: Low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A); other options include taking ICS whenever SABA is taken in combination or separate inhalers (Evidence B), or daily LTRA (Evidence A for less effectiveness for exacerbations than ICS), and to consider likely adherence if the reliever is SABA. Asthma symptoms most days (e.g., 4–5 days/week) or waking due to asthma once a week or more: Low-dose ICS-LABA plus as needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Medium-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Very-low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (Evidence B); other options include daily low-dose ICS and LTRA, plus as-needed SABA. Daily asthma symptoms, waking at night once or more a week, and low lung function: Medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA, OR low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (MART). Initial asthma presentation during an acute exacerbation: Treat as for exacerbation, including a short course of OCS if the exacerbation is severe; commence Step 3 or Step 4 treatment, and arrange follow-up.

### Medication regimens for managing acute asthma [^113nFGzY]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbation is defined as a progressive increase in symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing sufficient to require a change in therapy. After ruling out diagnoses that mimic an asthma exacerbation, therapy should be initiated. Short-acting β 2 agonists and short-acting muscarinic antagonists are effective as bronchodilators for asthma in the acute setting. Systemic corticosteroids to reduce airway inflammation continue to be the mainstay therapy for asthma exacerbations, and, unless there is a contraindication, the oral route is favored. Based on the current evidence, nebulized magnesium should not be routinely used in acute asthma. The evidence favors the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate in selected cases, particularly in severe exacerbations. Methylxanthines have a minimum role as therapy for asthma exacerbations but may be considered in refractory cases of status asthmaticus with careful monitoring of toxicity. Current guidelines recommend the use of helium-oxygen mixtures in patients who do not respond to standard therapies or those with severe disease.

### COVID-19, asthma, and inhaled corticosteroids: another beneficial effect of inhaled corticosteroids? [^115kHeTo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a real pandemic. After a median incubation period of 5 days, the disease occurs in different stages, inducing upper and lower airway responses in mild disease (80–90% of patients) and progressing to bilateral pneumonia in severe disease (10–20%). A subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 develops acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring mechanical ventilation on intensive care. COVID-19 patients with preexisting comorbid conditions such as chronic respiratory diseases have worse disease outcomes, including a higher incidence of the need for hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality. However, it remains to be further investigated how preexisting chronic inflammatory airway diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and their treatment might modify the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of COVID-19. Approximately 300 million individuals worldwide have asthma. Considering that a significant proportion of individuals with asthma is confronted with COVID-19, it is crucial to understand which asthma patients are particularly at risk and how inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) — the cornerstone of asthma treatment — may influence morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. Long-term treatment with systemic corticosteroids (e.g. in transplant patients) is immunosuppressive, increasing the risk and severity of viral infections. Because of the potential risk for worse disease outcomes, the World Health Organization does not recommend systemic corticosteroid treatment in COVID-19, unless if indicated for other reasons such as acute asthma or COPD exacerbations requiring a short course of oral corticosteroids. These recommendations have caused doubt and uncertainty among patients with asthma and physicians on whether ICS therapy should be maintained during this pandemic. However, withdrawal of ICS treatment puts asthma patients at risk of severe exacerbations. A recent meta-analysis on COVID-19 outcomes in patients with chronic respiratory diseases using ICS concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to abandon the well-established ICS treatment in asthma. There is thus an urgent need to elucidate demographic and clinical characteristics that determine disease outcomes of COVID-19 in asthma, to investigate the impact of ICS and to unravel the underlying pathogenic mechanisms.

### Asthma outcomes: exacerbations [^1111yw5z]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The goals of asthma treatment include preventing recurrent exacerbations. Yet there is no consensus about the terminology for describing or defining "exacerbation" or about how to characterize an episode's severity.

Objective

National Institutes of Health institutes and other federal agencies convened an expert group to propose how asthma exacerbation should be assessed as a standardized asthma outcome in future asthma clinical research studies.

Methods

We used comprehensive literature reviews and expert opinion to compile a list of asthma exacerbation outcomes and classified them as either core (required in future studies), supplemental (used according to study aims and standardized), or emerging (requiring validation and standardization). This work was discussed at a National Institutes of Health-organized workshop in March 2010 and finalized in September 2011.

Results

No dominant definition of "exacerbation" was found. The most widely used definitions included 3 components, all related to treatment, rather than symptoms: (1) systemic use of corticosteroids, (2) asthma-specific emergency department visits or hospitalizations, and (3) use of short-acting β-agonists as quick-relief (sometimes referred to as "rescue" or "reliever") medications.

Conclusions

The working group participants propose that the definition of "asthma exacerbation" be "a worsening of asthma requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids to prevent a serious outcome". As core outcomes, they propose inclusion and separate reporting of several essential variables of an exacerbation. Furthermore, they propose the development of a standardized, component-based definition of "exacerbation" with clear thresholds of severity for each component.

### Management preferences of pediatricians in moderate and severe acute asthma [^111bf1kt]. The Journal of Asthma (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess and compare management preferences of physicians for moderate and severe acute asthma based on case scenarios and to determine the factors influencing their decisions.

Methods

A questionnaire based on the Global Initiative on Asthma (GINA) guideline and comprising eight questions on management of acute asthma was delivered to participants of two national pediatric congresses. Management of moderate and severe acute asthma cases was evaluated by two clinical case scenarios for estimation of acute attack severity, initial treatment, treatment after 1h, and discharge recommendations. A uniform answer box comprising the possible choices was provided just below the questions, and respondents were requested to tick the answers they thought was appropriate.

Results

Four-hundred and eighteen questionnaires were analyzed. All questions regarding moderate and severe acute asthma case scenarios were answered accurately by 15.8% and 17.0% of physicians, respectively. The initial treatment of moderate and severe cases was known by 100.0% and 78.2% of physicians, respectively. Knowledge of the appropriate plan for treatment after 1h was low both for moderate (45.0%) and severe attacks (35.4%). Discharge recommendations were adequate in 32.5% and 70.8% of physicians for moderate and severe attacks, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that working at a hospital with a continuing medical education program was the only significant predictor of a correct response to all questions regarding severe attacks (p = .04; 95%CI, 1.02–3.21). No predictors were found for information on moderate attacks.

Conclusions

Pediatricians have difficulty in planning treatment after 1 hour both for moderate and severe asthma attacks. Postgraduate education programs that target physicians in hospitals without continuing medical education facilities may improve guideline adherence.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111nvJAc]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for asthma, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, diagnosis, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to diagnose asthma in children aged ≤ 5 years if they meet the following 3 criteria (record as suspected asthma if only 1 or 2 criteria are met)
| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Recurrent acute wheezing episodes with or without asthma-like symptoms between episodes|- At least 2 acute episodes (lasting > 24 hours) of asthma-like signs/symptoms (such as wheezing on expiration, accessory muscle use, difficult and/or heavy breathing), with wheezing confirmed during at least 1 episode, OR < br > - At least 1 acute wheezing episode (lasting > 24 hours) with wheezing confirmed and with asthma-like symptoms between wheezing episodes (|
|No likely alternative cause for the respiratory symptoms|- No other condition (except for a concurrent viral respiratory infection) is likely to explain the asthma-like signs/symptoms based on a thorough medical history and examination < br > - Avoid obtaining imaging or laboratory tests|
|Timely clinical response to acute or longer-term asthma treatment|- During an acute wheezing episode in a healthcare setting, confirmed improvement of respiratory symptoms and signs within 20–60 minutes after administration of short-acting β-agonist or, for more severe episodes, within 3–4 hours after short-acting β-agonist and oral corticosteroid are commenced, OR < br > - At home, the parent/caregiver reports that the child's wheezing or difficulty breathing improves within 20–60 minutes after being given short-acting β-agonist, OR < br > - During a 2-3-month trial of daily ICS (100–250 mcg/day fluticasone-propionate equivalent by pressurized metered-dose inhaler via spacer) plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist, the parent/caregiver reports a decrease in the severity and/or frequency of the child's acute wheezing episodes or asthma-like symptoms between acute wheezing episodes.|

### Management of acute asthma exacerbations [^113juTH7]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbations can be classified as mild, moderate, severe, or life threatening. Criteria for exacerbation severity are based on symptoms and physical examination parameters, as well as lung function and oxygen saturation. In patients with a peak expiratory flow of 50 to 79 percent of their personal best, up to two treatments of two to six inhalations of short-acting beta2 agonists 20 minutes apart followed by a reassessment of peak expiratory flow and symptoms may be safely employed at home. Administration using a hand-held metered-dose inhaler with a spacer device is at least equivalent to nebulized beta2 agonist therapy in children and adults. In the ambulatory and emergency department settings, the goals of treatment are correction of severe hypoxemia, rapid reversal of airflow obstruction, and reduction of the risk of relapse. Multiple doses of inhaled anticholinergic medication combined with beta2 agonists improve lung function and decrease hospitalization in school-age children with severe asthma exacerbations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate has been shown to significantly increase lung function and decrease the necessity of hospitalization in children. The administration of systemic corticosteroids within one hour of emergency department presentation decreases the need for hospitalization, with the most pronounced effect in patients with severe exacerbations. Airway inflammation can persist for days to weeks after an acute attack; therefore, more intensive treatment should be continued after discharge until symptoms and peak expiratory flow return to baseline.

### Asthma: updated diagnosis and management recommendations… [^113yA9Y8]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- As-needed SABA therapy alone is not recommended because of severe exacerbations and mortality risks.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination is preferred in adolescents and adults with mild asthma.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS and a SABA is preferred in children six to 11 years of age with mild asthma. STEP 1 Step 1 options are for those with symptoms less than twice per month and no risk factors for exacerbations. An inhaled low-dose ICS/formoterol combination used as needed is the preferred treatment in adults and adolescents. The guideline also strongly discourages the use of long-acting bronchodilators without an ICS because of increased risk of exacerbation. If the ICS/formoterol combination is not available or affordable, a low-dose ICS as needed for symptoms with a SABA is recommended.

STEP 3 Options in adults and adolescents include low-dose ICS/long-acting beta 2-agonist as daily treatment with a SABA as needed, or low-dose ICS/formoterol as both daily treatment and as needed. In children six to 11 years of age, either a medium-dose ICS or a low-dose ICS/LABA combination should be used as a controller, with a SABA as needed. STEP 4 Preferred options for adults and adolescents include a low-dose ICS/formoterol as both daily and as-needed treatment or a medium-dose ICS/LABA as daily maintenance treatment with a SABA as needed. The addition of sublingual allergen immunotherapy may be considered in adults with allergic rhinitis and suboptimally controlled asthma despite ICS therapy. Referral is recommended for children six to 11 years of age if asthma is not controlled with a medium-dose ICS.

STEP 5 Patients with persistent and severe symptoms despite optimal use of step 4 treatments should be referred for allergist evaluation and consideration of add-on treatments. These additional treatments include high-dose ICS/LABA, tiotropium, azithromycin, anti-immunoglobulin E, anti-interleukin-5/5R, anti-interleukin-4R alpha, sputum-guided treatment, bronchial thermoplasty, and low-dose oral corticosteroids. Adverse effects and the risk of antibiotic resistance should be taken into account when considering these treatments.

Management of worsening asthma and exacerbations — adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — terminology and written asthma action plans emphasize that exacerbations represent an acute or sub-acute worsening in symptoms and lung function, and that the term 'flare-up' is preferable for most patients; patients at increased risk of asthma-related death should be identified and flagged for more frequent review. All patients should be provided with a written asthma action plan appropriate for their age, current treatment, and reliever inhaler (short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-formoterol), with the plan stating when and how to change reliever and/or maintenance medications, use oral corticosteroids if needed, and access medical care if symptoms fail to respond; advise patients with a history of rapid deterioration to seek acute care or see their doctor immediately, and base the plan on changes in symptoms or (only in adults) peak expiratory flow (PEF).

### International perspective on research priorities and outcome measures of importance in the care of children with acute exacerbations of asthma: a qualitative interview study [^115wGFJL]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

This study explored the priorities in research questions and outcome measures for children with acute exacerbations of asthma. This was examined by using the TDF to gain an understanding of how clinicians diagnosed asthma, classified severity management decisions and measurement of success (or otherwise) of the treatment administered. Findings from this study can now be used to help us prioritise specific research areas in paediatric acute asthma and inform investigators about the use of relevant patient populations and how to best assess treatment response.

Diagnostic criteria for acute exacerbation of asthma in children varied between clinicians. It is common that individuals have different understanding or interpretation of a concept however, without internationally recognised criteria to diagnose the severity of acute asthma in the ED setting, it is challenging to systematically examine the quality of practice including treatments, outcomes and costs.

Respondents have suggested some common features useful in defining entry criteria for future asthma studies. These include a minimum age of 2 years, and the need for definitions of asthma to include components from medical history (such as a previous salbutamol responsive wheeze episode) and examination findings such as respiratory distress or work of breathing.

Further, for trials in severe asthma exacerbations, it is important to standardise the assessment of severity. Asthma scores were a popular choice, as they allow for both measurement as study entry criteria and a way to measure change. The use of asthma scores is widespread in some regions (particularly North America and Europe) however, robust validation is lacking. Experienced clinicians described the utility of altered conscious state as a marker for critical illness; however, this is not routinely captured in most asthma scores. In addition, the measurement properties of this symptoms/sign are not well explored.

It was more common that clinicians from low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) reported need to manage more severe or life-threatening disease and how treatment decisions may be influenced by cost. This is likely multifactorial and reflects accessibility and affordability of high-quality timely healthcare. It is clear that there needs to be better understanding of how cost impacts families or clinicians' choices of treatment and that treatment choices that are more readily used in low-income and middle-income countries, for example, subcutaneous or intramuscular epinephrine need to feature in trial design.

Box 9–5 — discharge medications after acute care for asthma advises to initiate inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment if not already being taken; for adults/adolescents, maintenance-and-reliever therapy with ICS–formoterol (MART) is preferred and, for adults/adolescents, start MART at Step 4 on discharge; if prescribing an ICS regimen with short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) reliever, step the maintenance dose up for 2–4 weeks and emphasize adherence and inhaler technique. To reduce relapse risk, prescribe at least a 5–7 day course of oral corticosteroids (OCS) for adults (prednisolone or equivalent 40–50 mg/day) and 3–5 days for children (1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day) (Evidence A); review progress before ceasing OCS, and if the OCS is dexamethasone, treatment is only for total 1–2 days, with switching to prednisolone considered if there is failure of resolution or relapse of symptoms.

Reviewing response during treatment for an exacerbation: During treatment, patients should be closely monitored, and treatment titrated according to their response. Patients who present with signs of a severe or life-threatening exacerbation, who fail to respond to treatment, or who continue to deteriorate should be transferred immediately to an acute care facility, and those with little or slow response to SABA treatment should be closely monitored. For many patients, lung function can be monitored after SABA therapy is repeated, and additional treatment should continue until PEF or FEV1 reaches a plateau or ideally returns to the patient's previous best, after which a decision can be made whether to send the patient home or transfer them to an acute care facility.

### Predictors of repeated acute hospital attendance for asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115HsUdz]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Asthma is the most frequent chronic disease in children 1 and its worldwide prevalence is still rising, with an estimated 300 million people affected. 2 For many years, daily symptoms have been the focus of treatment guidelines, and physicians have used control questionnaires to guide treatment adjustments. However, current guidelines 3, 4 have an increasing focus on the risk of adverse outcomes, such as asthma attacks, as this risk is not directly correlated with daily control. Children with largely well‐controlled symptoms are still at risk of developing severe asthma attacks. 5

Asthma attacks are common 6 and are associated with high healthcare costs 7 as well as missed school and workdays. They cause anxiety 8 and carry a risk of death and long‐term effects such as loss of lung function. 9 These acute events are especially relevant for children among whom there is the greatest potential for loss of lung function. Attacks often follow a viral respiratory tract infection 10, 11 but secondary care attendance is generally preventable. Attacks may occur despite the use of inhaled corticosteroids, 5, 12 though it is neither affordable nor safe to provide all children with more aggressive treatment, particularly in low‐middle income countries. It is therefore important to be able to identify patients at greatest risk of further attacks and hospital admission to better prioritize limited resources and provide additional education and support or adjustments to treatment where most needed.

### Inhaled corticosteroids in acute asthma: a systemic review and meta-analysis [^114GNzpG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma exacerbations are a common and important cause of attendance at emergency departments (ED) and subsequent hospital admissions. Despite previous reviews reporting that in acute settings the risk of hospital admission is reduced with the use of high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), this evidence has not changed clinical practice.

Objective

To estimate the efficacy of ICS in the treatment of acute asthma in ED.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials were identified using PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and EMBASE. The primary outcome was hospital admission rates. The primary comparison was between administration of ICS in addition to systemic corticosteroids (SCS) and to SCS alone. Secondary comparisons were ICS alone compared with SCS alone and ICS compared with placebo.

Results

There were 25 studies involving 2733 participants. For the primary comparison, ICS in addition to SCS reduced the risk of hospital admission compared with SCS; fixed-effects odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.73 (0.57–0.94). Lung function was poorly reported. There was moderate evidence of an improvement in clinical scores and vital signs with ICS in addition to SCS. Relatively few studies reported adverse events.

Conclusion

There is moderate evidence that high doses of ICS, in addition to SCS, reduce the risk of hospital admission in ED treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma exacerbations. Further research is required to determine their optimal role in both ED and outpatient settings.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^1128E6hX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma outcomes and GRADE/EtD methodology — The Expert Panel used the GRADE framework to review evidence, create evidence profiles, develop EtD tables, and write recommendation statements, and across all topic areas the outcomes deemed critical were asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life, with additional outcomes assessed when data for the three critical outcomes were not available. The panel established thresholds for minimally important difference (MID) for asthma control and asthma-related quality-of-life measures and, where no MID existed (such as exacerbations), reached consensus on clinically important differences based in part on RCT effect sizes and their judgments; core exacerbation measures included treatment with systemic corticosteroids, asthma-specific emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. Topic teams developed EtD tables for each key question using evidence from the systematic review reports, and new articles found in updated literature reviews were noted in EtD new-evidence sections but not incorporated into pooled estimates.

### Anticholinergics in the treatment of children and adults with acute asthma: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^111FNUV6]. Thorax (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend the use of a combination of inhaled beta(2) agonists and anticholinergics, particularly for patients with acute severe or life threatening asthma in the emergency setting. However, this statement is based on a relatively small number of randomised controlled trials and related systematic reviews. A review was undertaken to incorporate the more recent evidence available about the effectiveness of treatment with a combination of beta(2) agonists and anticholinergics compared with beta(2) agonists alone in the treatment of acute asthma.

Methods

A search was conducted of all randomised controlled trials published before April 2005.

Results

Data from 32 randomised controlled trials (n = 3611 subjects) showed significant reductions in hospital admissions in both children (RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85, p = 0.0001) and adults (RR = 0.68; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.86, p = 0.002) treated with inhaled anticholinergic agents. Combined treatment also produced a significant increase in spirometric parameters 60–120 minutes after the last treatment in both children (SMD = -0.54; 95% CI -0.28 to -0.81, p = 0.0001) and adults (SMD = -0.36; 95% CI -0.23 to -0.49, p = 0.00001).

Conclusions

This review strongly suggests that the addition of multiple doses of inhaled ipratropium bromide to beta(2) agonists is indicated as the standard treatment in children, adolescents, and adults with moderate to severe exacerbations of asthma in the emergency setting.

### Positive expiratory pressure for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations: a randomized controlled trial [^116PexAj]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of brief, single administration of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy in reducing clinical severity and need for additional second-line therapies and hospitalization in children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute asthma.

Study Design

This was a prospective randomized controlled trial of children 2–18 years of age presenting to a tertiary-care academic pediatric ED with moderate-to-severe asthma exacerbations from December 2014 to June 2016. Children who continued to have moderate asthma severity after completion of initial therapies (albuterol/ipratropium bromide and corticosteroids) were randomized to receive PEP therapy or standard of care. The primary outcome was change in pulmonary asthma score before and after intervention, as assessed by a blinded physician. Secondary outcomes included need for additional therapies, ED length of stay, and disposition.

Results

A total of 52 patients were randomized to receive either PEP (n? = ?26) or standard therapy (n? = ?26). Study groups were similar in demographics and baseline characteristics. There was no significant difference in primary outcome between groups with a mean change in Pulmonary Asthma Score of 0.92 (± 1.2) in the PEP group and 0.40 (± 1.2) in the standard group (P? = ?.12). There also was no significant difference in need for additional therapies, ED length of stay, and disposition. Mild, self-resolving side effects were observed in 3 subjects receiving PEP therapy.

Conclusion

Single, brief, administration of PEP therapy after completion of first-line therapies does not improve clinical severity in children presenting to the ED with acute asthma.

Trial Registration

ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02494076.

### The acute management of asthma [^1158sEkS]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) or clinic with acute exacerbation of asthma (AEA) can be very challenging varying in both severity and response to therapy. High-dose, frequent or continuous nebulized short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) therapy that can be combined with a short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) is the backbone of treatment. When patients do not rapidly clinically respond to SABA/SAMA inhalation, the early use of oral or parenteral corticosteroids should be considered and has been shown to impact the immediate need for ICU admission or even the need for hospital admission. Adjunctive therapies such as the use of intravenous magnesium and helium/oxygen combination gas for inhalation and for driving a nebulizer to deliver a SABA and or SAMA should be considered and are best used early in the treatment plan if they are likely to impact the patients' clinical course. The use of other agents such as theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonist, and long-acting muscarinic antagonist currently does not play a major role in the immediate treatment of AEA in the clinic or the ED but is an important therapeutic option for physicians to be aware of and to consider initiating at the time of discharge from clinic, hospital, or ED to reduce later clinical worsening and readmission to the ED and hospital. A comprehensive summary is provided of the currently available respiratory pharmaceuticals approved for asthma and other airway syndromes. Clinicians must be prepared to use the entire spectrum of medications available for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations and the agents that should be initiated to prevent worsening or additional exacerbations. They need to be familiar with the major potential drug toxicities associated with their use.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral montelukast in acute asthma exacerbation [^116RmnpS]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our study suggests that there is no added benefit of using montelukast along with the standard therapy for the management of acute asthma exacerbation in hospitalized adult population. We recommend that larger scale multicenter trials would better help to evaluate the role of cysteinyl leukotrienes antagonists in treating acute exacerbations of asthma.

### A question of time: systemic corticosteroids in managing acute asthma in children [^116q1vAq]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this article is to examine the evidence for the effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids in managing acute asthma in children as it relates to the timing of its administration.

Recent Findings

Three themes relevant to the timing of systemic corticosteroid administration as it relates to managing acute asthma in children are addressed, namely the evidence for early administration of systemic corticosteroid; factors associated with the administration of systemic corticosteroids and evidence for nurse-initiated administration of systemic corticosteroid.

Summary

There is a clear inverse relationship between time elapsed from the intake of systemic corticosteroids to disposition and the risk of admission. The variable timing of systemic corticosteroid may explain the variable success of clinical care pathways to manage acute asthma. Recent studies have documented a significant reduction hospital admission with early administration of systemic corticosteroid. For acute asthma pathways to succeed in improving hospital admission rates, implementation of such pathways must be linked to barriers to the administration of systemic corticosteroids. Findings from the studies cited provide guidance in the administration of systemic corticosteroids in children with asthma in the real life setting of an emergency department.

### Management of asthma exacerbations in the emergency department [^114yaAj6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Asthma exacerbations occur across a wide spectrum of chronic severity; they contribute to millions of emergency department (ED) visits in both children and adults every year. Management of asthma exacerbations is an important part of the continuum of asthma care. The best strategy for ED management of an asthma exacerbation is early recognition and intervention, continuous monitoring, appropriate disposition, and, once improved, multifaceted transitional care that optimizes subacute and chronic asthma management after ED discharge. This article concisely reviews ED evaluation, treatment, disposition, and postdischarge care for patients with asthma exacerbations, based on high-quality evidence (eg, systematic reviews from the Cochrane Collaboration) and current international guidelines (eg, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3, Global Initiative for Asthma, and Australian guidelines). Special populations (young children, pregnant women, and the elderly) also are addressed. Despite advances in asthma science, there remain many important evidence gaps in managing ED patients with asthma exacerbation. This article summarizes several of these controversial areas and challenges that merit further investigation.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for treating children with acute asthma in the emergency department [^114nqCHR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma in children can be life-threatening and must be treated promptly in the emergency setting. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is recommended by various guidelines for cases of acute asthma that have not responded to first-line treatment with bronchodilators and steroids. The treatment has recently been shown to reduce the need for hospital admission for adults compared with placebo, but it is unclear whether it is equally effective for children.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of intravenous magnesium sulfate (IV MgSO4) in children treated for acute asthma in the emergency department (ED).

Search Methods

We identified studies by searching the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register up to 23 February 2016. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and reference lists of other reviews, and we contacted study authors to ask for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of children treated in the ED for exacerbations of asthma if they compared any dose of IV MgSO4 with placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened the results of the search and independently extracted data from studies meeting the inclusion criteria. We resolved disagreements through discussion and contacted study authors in cases of missing data and other uncertainties relating to the studies. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios and continuous data as mean differences, both using fixed-effect models. We assessed each study for risk of bias and rated the quality of evidence for each outcome with GRADE and presented the results in a 'Summary of findings' table. There was insufficient evidence to conduct the planned subgroup analyses.

Main Results

Five studies (182 children) met the inclusion criteria, and four contributed data to at least one meta-analysis. The included studies were overall at low risk of bias, but our confidence in the evidence was generally low, mainly due to the small sample sizes. Treatment with IV MgSO4 reduced the odds of admission to hospital by 68% (odds ratio (OR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.74; children = 115; studies = 3; I² = 63%). This result was based on data from just three studies including 115 children. Meta-analysis for the secondary outcomes was extremely limited by paucity of data. We performed meta-analysis for the outcome 'return to the emergency department within 48 hours', which showed a very imprecise effect estimate that was not statistically significant (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.02 to 10.30; children = 85; studies = 2; I² = 0%). Side effects and adverse events were not consistently reported and meta-analysis was not possible, however few side effects or adverse events were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

IV MgSO4 may reduce the need for hospital admission in children presenting to the ED with moderate to severe exacerbations of asthma, but the evidence is extremely limited by the number and size of studies. Few side effects of the treatment were reported, but the data were extremely limited.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116KTsTS]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Treatment in acute care settings — systemic corticosteroids — Systemic corticosteroids speed resolution of exacerbations and prevent relapse, and in acute care settings should be utilized in all but the mildest exacerbations in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years (Evidence A). Where possible, systemic corticosteroids should be administered to the patient within 1 hour of presentation. Use of systemic corticosteroids is particularly important in the emergency department if initial SABA treatment fails to achieve lasting improvement in symptoms, the exacerbation developed while the patient was taking OCS, or the patient has a history of previous exacerbations requiring OCS. For route of delivery, oral administration is as effective as intravenous, the oral route is preferred because it is quicker, less invasive and less expensive, and OCS require at least 4 hours to produce a clinical improvement.

### Factors associated with relapse in adult patients discharged from the emergency department following acute asthma: a systematic review [^113zSdTK]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma affects over 17.5 million adults in North America and its prevalence continues to rise, as evidenced by the 12.3% relative increase from 2001 (7.3%) to 2009 (8.2%). Worldwide, asthma prevalence ranges from low (underdeveloped countries) to high (developed countries). Asthma is predominantly a chronic disease that can be controlled with appropriate pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions; however, exacerbations do not always respond to standard or additional treatment options, leading to urgent visits to health providers, admissions to hospital and, in severe and rare cases, death. In the USA, patients with exacerbations had significantly higher asthma-related healthcare costs: $1740 over 1 year compared with $847 for asthmatics without exacerbations. While patients with acute asthma often seek care in the emergency department (ED), most are successfully treated and subsequently discharged; only 6–12% of adult patients presenting to the ED with an exacerbation of asthma will be admitted.

The understanding and management of acute asthma have advanced considerably in recent years. Current evidence-based guidelines (National Asthma Education and Prevention Plan (NAEPP), Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), and Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS)) suggest that early treatment with short-acting β 2 -agonists, inhaled short-acting anticholinergic agents and systemic corticosteroids (SCS) will reduce hospitalisations. On ED discharge, SCS are recommended, and further studies suggest that prescribing inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at discharge can reduce relapse following discharge at least in adult patients. ICS in combination with long-acting β-agonists (ICS/LABA) are more effective than ICS monotherapy in patients with persistent asthma, with the number needed to treat of 19 to prevent one exacerbation. On the other hand, the impact of non-pharmacological interventions (ie, ED-based educational strategies) on relapses remains unclear.
