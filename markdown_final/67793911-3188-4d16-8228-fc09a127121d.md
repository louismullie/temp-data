## Question

do gastroparesis patients need to be NPO

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether gastroparesis patients need to be NPO. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how guidelines frame nutrition in gastroparesis. Then, I should verify the stepwise approach to oral, enteral, and parenteral nutrition. Next, I will check actual practice data on how often non-oral feeding is required. After that, I need to consider special scenarios where temporary NPO might be appropriate. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer with practical implications and monitoring points.

> Let me first confirm the guideline position, because I shouldn't jump to conclusions before verifying the foundation. ACG guidance explicitly prefers the oral route for nutrition and hydration in gastroparesis and emphasizes dietary modification as first-line management rather than fasting, which directly argues against routine NPO status in most patients [^116wXKdJ]. I should also check whether more recent ACG updates alter this stance; in fact, they endorse a small-particle diet to improve symptoms and gastric emptying, which again presupposes oral intake rather than NPO [^113XaXsK]. European consensus similarly reserves formal nutritional support for severe weight loss or intractable vomiting, implying continued oral intake whenever feasible [^111EkcaT].

> Hold on, I need to outline the standard stepwise nutritional strategy, because this determines when to escalate beyond oral intake. The approach begins with oral dietary modification, including small, frequent meals that are low in fat and fiber and moving to homogenized or liquid textures if solids are not tolerated, ideally with dietitian guidance, which presumes not being NPO [^11179FuE] [^117BAWU4]. If oral intake is insufficient, the next step is oral nutrition supplements, then postpyloric enteral nutrition via nasojejunal trial and, if needed, jejunostomy; parenteral nutrition is rarely required and is reserved for failure of enteral options, reinforcing that routine NPO is not part of standard care [^116LYRS8] [^113fwWLa] [^111SLuNp]. I should also confirm the criteria to initiate enteral support, such as substantial unintentional weight loss or repeated hospitalizations, which again shows that escalation is selective rather than universal NPO [^111Jmf2w].

> Wait, let me verify how often patients actually need non-oral nutrition in practice, because this quantifies the exception. In a large prospective cohort, only 3.3% of gastroparesis patients required enteral or exclusive parenteral nutrition, while 96.7% maintained oral intake, underscoring that oral feeding is the norm rather than NPO or tube feeding; those on EN/PN had greater symptom severity and lower BMI, consistent with reserving artificial nutrition for severe cases [^11458RC4]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially cited this proportion as 96.7% using oral nutrition with a reference labeled 78266j19, but I should correct that and confirm the proper citation is 78266a19 from JPEN 2023, which contains those exact data [^11458RC4].

> I should consider the concept of "gastric rest", because it might be misconstrued as NPO. Let me check carefully: protocols described as gastric rest use postpyloric enteral feeding via nasoduodenal or jejunal routes to bypass the stomach for several months in decompensated, nutritionally failing cases; this is not true NPO since nutrition proceeds enterally while the goal remains subsequent reintroduction of oral feeding after stabilization [^111ATWob] [^116gaHmX] [^111b2yts]. Hold on, I should verify severity categories: grade 3 or decompensated disease involves failure to maintain nutrition orally with frequent admissions, which is the context in which gastric rest and jejunal feeding are considered, not routine cases where NPO would be inappropriate [^114taAZh].

> But wait, what about scenarios that might justify temporary NPO despite the general preference for oral feeding? I need to ensure we separate disease management from acute care and procedural needs. Short-term NPO may be used during acute exacerbations with intractable vomiting requiring hospital stabilization or pre-procedurally for anesthesia-dependent interventions, but this is situational and time-limited, and there is no disease-management mandate for chronic NPO in gastroparesis; by contrast, NPO is standard in malignant bowel obstruction, which is a different pathophysiologic entity and not a model for gastroparesis nutrition strategy [^111EkcaT] [^1163LUKQ].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing contradicts this conclusion. No high-quality guideline recommends routine NPO for gastroparesis; instead, they consistently prioritize oral intake with structured dietary adjustments, escalating to enteral nutrition only when oral intake fails and reserving parenteral nutrition for rare, refractory situations, with explicit triggers such as significant weight loss or repeated hospitalizations, which is antithetical to blanket NPO orders in this population [^116wXKdJ] [^111Jmf2w]. I should also emphasize that preserving enteral feeding supports gut function and aligns with contemporary nutrition principles in gastroparesis, as reinforced by recent expert updates on nutritional management in this disorder [^111SLuNp] [^111SZycf].

> Practically, I will now translate this into what to do rather than whether to eat, because that is where outcomes improve. Patients should receive dietitian-guided small, frequent meals emphasizing small particle size, lower fat and fiber, and liquid/pureed textures as needed, continue oral nutrition supplements if solids are poorly tolerated, and escalate to postpyloric enteral feeding only when criteria for nutritional failure are met, while optimizing comorbid factors like glycemic control in diabetes; routine NPO should be avoided outside of acute, short-term indications [^11179FuE] [^113XaXsK] [^117BAWU4] [^111t1qF5].

No, gastroparesis patients do not need to be **NPO by default**. NPO is only indicated for **severe, refractory symptoms** (intractable vomiting, high aspiration risk, or before procedures). Routine care emphasizes **oral intake first** with small, low-fat, low-fiber meals [^11179FuE] [^113XaXsK]; if oral intake is inadequate, use enteral nutrition [^116wXKdJ], and reserve parenteral nutrition for rare cases [^115Sixjh] [^111SLuNp]. Prolonged NPO increases malnutrition and dehydration risk, so reintroduce oral intake as soon as feasible.

---

## Indications for NPO status in gastroparesis

NPO is **not routine** in gastroparesis; reserve it for specific clinical scenarios:

- **Severe, refractory symptoms**: Intractable vomiting, severe nausea, or high aspiration risk may require temporary NPO.

- **Procedures**: Preoperative or procedural fasting is indicated to reduce aspiration risk during anesthesia or sedation.

- **Acute exacerbations**: Short-term NPO may be used during acute flares with severe symptoms, then reintroduce oral intake as soon as feasible.

---

## Risks associated with prolonged NPO status

Prolonged NPO in gastroparesis carries **significant risks**:

- **Malnutrition**: Delayed gastric emptying already limits intake; prolonged NPO worsens nutritional deficits.

- **Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance**: Reduced oral intake increases dehydration and electrolyte disturbances [^114qBdoJ].

- **Reduced quality of life**: Extended NPO worsens symptoms and quality of life.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

The focus is on **maintaining nutrition and hydration** [^116wXKdJ]:

- **Oral intake first**: Small, frequent, low-fat, low-fiber meals are first-line dietary management [^113XaXsK].

- **Enteral nutrition**: Use enteral nutrition (preferably postpyloric) if oral intake is inadequate [^116wXKdJ] [^113fwWLa].

- **Parenteral nutrition**: Reserve for rare cases when enteral nutrition is not feasible [^111SLuNp].

- **Symptom-targeted therapy**: Use prokinetics and antiemetics [^113uRr5F] to enable oral intake [^113mAdQb].

---

## Clinical scenarios where NPO may be necessary

Severe, refractory symptoms — such as intractable vomiting, severe nausea, or high aspiration risk — may warrant **temporary NPO**, generally short term until symptoms are controlled. Preoperative or procedural fasting is indicated to reduce aspiration risk during anesthesia or sedation, with duration determined by procedural guidelines. Acute exacerbations may likewise require short-term NPO until symptoms stabilize [^116gaHmX].

---

## Alternative nutritional strategies

When **oral intake is inadequate**, consider **enteral nutrition** — preferably postpyloric (nasojejunal or jejunostomy) rather than gastric feeding [^113fwWLa] — and reserve **parenteral nutrition** for situations where enteral nutrition is not feasible [^111SLuNp].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Patients with gastroparesis **do not require routine NPO**; reserve it for severe symptoms, aspiration risk, or procedures. Because prolonged NPO increases risks of malnutrition and dehydration, prioritize oral intake, then enteral nutrition, and reserve parenteral nutrition for rare cases. Reintroduce oral intake promptly to maintain nutrition and hydration.

### Clinical guideline: Management of gastroparesis [^115Sixjh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for the evaluation and management of patients with gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is identified in clinical practice through the recognition of clinical symptoms and documentation of delayed gastric emptying. Symptoms of gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, bloating, and upper abdominal pain. Management of gastroparesis should include assessment and correction of nutritional state, relief of symptoms, improvement of gastric emptying, and, in diabetics, glycemic control.

Patient nutritional state should be managed by oral dietary modifications. If oral intake is not adequate, then enteral nutrition via a jejunostomy tube needs to be considered. Parenteral nutrition is rarely required when hydration and nutritional state cannot be maintained. Medical treatment entails the use of prokinetic and antiemetic therapies. Approved treatment options, including metoclopramide and gastric electrical stimulation (GES, approved on a humanitarian device exemption), do not adequately address clinical need. Antiemetics have not been specifically tested in gastroparesis but may relieve nausea and vomiting.

Other medications aimed at symptom relief include unapproved medications or off-label indications such as domperidone, erythromycin (primarily over a short term), and centrally acting antidepressants used as symptom modulators. GES may relieve symptoms, including weekly vomiting frequency and the need for nutritional supplementation, based on open-label studies. Second-line approaches include…

### The epidemiology and burden of gastroparesis: Real-world data from a large healthcare provider in Israel [^1153GSbJ]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). High credibility.

Gastroparesis is a gastrointestinal motility dysfunction characterized by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of gastric mechanical obstruction. Data on the epidemiology of gastroparesis are sparse, even though the condition substantially impairs patients' quality of life. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology and estimate the short-term healthcare resource use burden of gastroparesis in a large population.

- **Methods**: This cross-sectional study utilized computerized data from Maccabi Healthcare Services, a 2.5-million-member state-mandated health organization in Israel. Data were collected between 2003 and 2018 to assess the prevalence of gastroparesis. Definite gastroparesis was defined by both gastroparesis diagnosis and gastric emptying test, while probable gastroparesis was defined by gastroparesis diagnosis only. To compare healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), data were also collected on controls that were individually matched (1:2) for age, sex, and comorbidities.

- **Key results**: A total of 522 patients with gastroparesis were identified (21.1 per 100,000 WHO age-standardized), including 204 with definite gastroparesis (8.6 per 100,000 WHO). The male to female ratio was 1:2, with a mean ± SD age of 54.7 ± 17.1 years. Diabetes accounted for 25.9% of gastroparesis cases, while the rest were idiopathic. Gastroparesis patients were more likely to have cardiovascular diseases (10% vs. 6.9% for controls, p = 0.034) and a lower prevalence of obesity (17% vs. 24.4%, p < 0.001). Healthcare resource utilization within the 2 years after the index date was higher, with more hospitalizations than controls.

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients with gastroparesis using enteral and/or exclusive parenteral nutrition [^11458RC4]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Patients with gastroparesis (Gp) may require enteral nutrition (EN) or exclusive parenteral nutrition (PN). Among patients with Gp, the study aimed to:

- **Identify frequency**: Determine the frequency of EN and exclusive PN use.
- **Explore characteristics**: Examine characteristics of patients using EN and/or exclusive PN compared with those using oral nutrition (ON), including changes over 48 weeks.

- **Methods**: Patients with Gp underwent history and physical examination, gastric emptying scintigraphy, water load satiety testing (WLST), and questionnaires assessing gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life (QOL). Patients were observed for 48 weeks.

- **Results**: Of 971 patients with Gp (idiopathic, 579; diabetic, 336; post-Nissen fundoplication, 51), 939 (96.7%) were using ON only, 14 (1.4%) using exclusive PN, and 18 (1.9%) using EN. Compared with patients receiving ON, patients receiving exclusive PN and/or EN were younger, had lower body mass index, and had greater symptom severity. Patients receiving exclusive PN and/or EN exhibited lower physical QOL but not mental QOL or Gp-related QOL scores. Furthermore, these patients ingested less water during WLST yet did not experience worse gastric emptying. Of those who had been receiving exclusive PN and/or EN, 50% and 25%, respectively, resumed ON at 48-week follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: This study describes patients with Gp requiring exclusive PN and/or EN for nutrition support, representing a small (3.3%) but significant subset of patients with Gp. Unique clinical and physiological parameters are associated with this subset, providing insight into the use of nutritional support.

### Gastroparesis: A review of current diagnosis and treatment options [^114agJGR]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis (GP) is a chronic neuromuscular disorder of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The incidence of GP is not well described; however, the number of individuals affected by symptoms of GP in the United States is estimated to be over 4 million. The etiology of GP is diverse. Approximately 25% of cases are associated with diabetes, whereas nearly 50% are classified as idiopathic, with many of these latter cases likely representing a post-infectious process. Connective tissue disorders, autoimmune disorders, prior gastric surgery, ischemia, and medications comprise the vast majority of the remaining cases.

The pathophysiology of GP is also varied. Abnormalities in fundic tone, antroduodenal dyscoordination, a weak antral pump, gastric dysrhythmias, and abnormal duodenal feedback all contribute to delays in gastric emptying and symptom expression. Characteristic symptoms of GP include nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, early satiety, and weight loss.

The diagnosis of GP is made using a combination of characteristic symptoms alongside objective evidence of delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, treatment options include dietary modification, medications to accelerate gastric emptying, antiemetic agents, gastric electrical stimulation, and surgery.

In the following sections, we will provide an overview of the healthcare impact of GP, describe the underlying pathophysiology, and review treatment options using an evidence-based approach.

### Therapeutic strategies in gastroparesis: Results of stepwise approach with diet and prokinetics, gastric rest, and PEG-J: A retrospective analysis [^111ATWob]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

A procedural success rate of 100% was found in our study for both gastroduodenal tube placement and PEG-J, which is comparable to literature rates. In three months of nasoduodenal feeding (GR), occlusion of the tube and nasal irritation occurred at relatively low rates (8% and 5.5%, respectively). Patients were able to accept the NJ fairly well because they agreed in advance to a three-month period. Additionally, patients were informed that PEG(-J) placement is generally associated with more risks and complications than an NJ tube. The NJ tube is fairly thin, which may have contributed to good tolerability.

Dislocation is the major disadvantage of PEG-J and occurred in 32% of patients, which is in line with literature data ranging from 25.2% to 55.9%. No occlusion occurred, which is described in 3.5%-35% of patients with PEG-J.

Some limitations of our study should be mentioned. Firstly, it is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. Over the eight-year period, we did not systematically collect all patient-reported outcome measures or systematically characterize psychological factors and psychiatric comorbidities. Secondly, as a tertiary referral center, a small percentage (9%) of the scintigraphic data were collected in other centers with different protocols and normal values and were therefore not eligible for statistical comparison. However, we believe these are reliable in diagnosing gastroparesis.

Antroduodenal manometry results were only taken into account with respect to antral.

### ACG clinical guideline: Gastroparesis [^113F2ZH4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Gastroparesis is characterized by symptoms suggesting retention of food in the stomach, with objective evidence of delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction in the gastric outflow. This condition is increasingly encountered in clinical practice. These guidelines summarize perspectives on the risk factors, diagnosis, and management of gastroparesis in adults, including dietary, pharmacological, device, and interventions directed at the pylorus. They represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology.

The scientific evidence for these guidelines was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. When the evidence was not appropriate for Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, we used expert consensus to develop key concept statements. These guidelines should be considered as preferred but are not the only approaches to these conditions.

### Pre-procedural fasting for coronary interventions: Is it time to change practice [^115ijmb1]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Traditionally, patients are kept nil-per-os/nil-by-mouth (NPO/NBM) prior to invasive cardiac procedures, yet there exists neither evidence nor clear guidance about the benefits of this practice.

- **Objectives**: To demonstrate that percutaneous cardiac catheterisation does not require prior fasting.

- **Methods**: The data source is a retrospective analysis of a data registry of consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and stable angina at two district general hospitals in the UK with no on-site cardiac surgery services.

- **Results**: A total of 1916 PCI procedures were performed over a 3-year period. None of the patients were kept NPO/NBM prior to their coronary procedures. The mean age was 67 ± 16 years. 70% (1349/1916) were men. 38.5% (738/1916) had chronic stable angina, while the rest had ACS. 21% (398/1916) were diabetics, while 53% (1017/1916) were hypertensive. PCI was technically successful in 95% (1821/1916) of patients. 88.5% (1697/1916) had a transradial approach. 77% (570/738) of elective PCI patients were discharged within 6 hours post-procedure. No patients required emergency endotracheal intubation, and there were no occurrences of intraprocedural or postprocedural aspiration pneumonia.

- **Conclusions**: Our observational study demonstrates that patients undergoing PCI do not need to be fasted prior to their procedures.

### Nutritional approaches for gastroparesis [^116LYRS8]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with gastroparesis often experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, epigastric discomfort, and early satiety, leading to inadequate food intake and a high risk of malnutrition. There is a considerable scarcity of data about nutritional strategies for gastroparesis, and practices rely on extrapolated evidence. Some approaches include the modification of food composition, consistency, and volume in the context of delayed gastric emptying. If the patient is unable to consume adequate calories through a solid food diet, stepwise nutritional interventions could include the use of liquid meals, oral nutrition supplements, enteral nutrition, and parenteral nutrition. This review discusses the role, rationale, and evidence of diverse nutritional interventions in the management of gastroparesis.

### Gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) for refractory gastroparesis: Results from an international prospective trial [^115WT8iR]. Gut (2022). High credibility.

Although gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) is considered a promising technique for the management of refractory gastroparesis, high-quality evidence is limited. We prospectively investigated the efficacy and safety of G-POEM in unselected patients with refractory gastroparesis.

In five tertiary centers, patients with symptomatic gastroparesis refractory to standard medical therapy and confirmed by impaired gastric emptying were included. The primary endpoint was clinical success, defined as at least a one-score decrease in the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) with a ≥ 25% decrease in two subscales, at 12 months. The GCSI score and subscales, adverse events (AEs), and the 36-Item Short Form questionnaire of quality of life were evaluated at baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after G-POEM. A gastric emptying study was performed before and 3 months after the procedure.

Of 80 enrolled patients, 75 (94%) completed the 12-month follow-up. Clinical success at 12 months was 56% (95% CI, 44.8 to 66.7). The GCSI score (including subscales) improved moderately after G-POEM. Predictors such as a gastric emptying t-half > 2.6 (OR = 3.23, p = 0.04) and baseline gastric retention > 20% at 4 hours (OR = 3.65, p = 0.03) were independent predictors of clinical success at 12 months, as was early response to G-POEM at 1 month after therapy (OR 8.75, p < 0.001). Mild procedure-related AEs occurred in 5 (6%) patients.

In conclusion, G-POEM is a safe procedure but showed only modest overall effectiveness in the treatment of refractory gastroparesis. Further studies are warranted.

### Endoscopic approaches to gastroparesis [^1122Huyn]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

This review covers the cause, evaluation, and treatment options for gastroparesis. Symptoms of delayed gastric emptying are increasingly seen by gastroenterologists and gastrointestinal surgeons. Endoscopy, both laparoscopic and flexible, is increasingly important in treatment algorithms for this problem.

- **Recent findings**: Gastroparesis is increasingly being seen in clinical practice. A progressive algorithm needs to be followed in these challenging cases: starting with medical treatment and diet modification, progressing through endoscopic treatments, including new ones such as per-oral pyloromyotomy, and finally laparoscopic treatments including gastrectomy.

- **Summary**: Endoscopic interventions are effective treatments for certain gastroparesis patients. New procedures offer a minimally invasive alternative to more radical options and should probably be more widely adopted.

### The goals for successful development of treatment in gastroparesis [^112bjF4h]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2024). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is a motility disorder of the stomach characterized by cardinal symptoms and delayed gastric emptying of solid food in the absence of mechanical obstruction. There is a significant unmet need in its management, with no medications approved for its treatment over four decades.

The objectives of this review are to develop an understanding of the goals of treatment, the evidence-based criteria for treatment success based on the scientific understanding of gastroparesis, and patient response outcomes. It aims to propose evidence-based principles for the successful development of treatments for gastroparesis.

- **Pathophysiologic targets**: In gastroparesis, eligibility criteria for clinical trial participation are based on validated gastric emptying studies. Additionally, there are patient response outcome measures that have been validated to appraise the effects of treatment on clinically relevant outcomes.

- **Study design**: These considerations lead to recommendations regarding eligibility, design, and duration of proof-of-efficacy studies. The endorsement of the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary as a validated patient response outcome supports the justification for shortening proof-of-efficacy, placebo-controlled clinical trials to a 4-week treatment duration following a baseline period.

We believe that such approaches will increase the likelihood of a successful assessment of efficacy in novel approaches to treating patients with gastroparesis.

### Clinical predictors of symptom improvement failure in gastroparesis [^115RsjNV]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

In this retrospective study evaluating the clinical outcomes of GP, we found that GP patients with T2DM had better symptom improvement compared to non-diabetics. Furthermore, a history of bariatric surgery was associated with no clinical improvement at 4 or 12 weeks, whereas lower BMI and CKD were associated with refractory symptoms at 4 weeks after GP diagnosis. In a subgroup analysis, diabetic peripheral neuropathy was associated with refractory GP at both weeks 4 and 12. The duration of DM in this group was marginally associated with failure of symptom improvement 12 weeks after the diagnosis of GP, whereas a low BMI remained a predictor of poor outcome in non-diabetic GP at 4 and 12 weeks. Prokinetic medications and gastrojejunal tube feeding were used in patients with severe disease, and as a result, these patients had persistent symptoms at weeks 4 and 12. Additionally, glycemic control at the time of diagnosis did not predict the clinical outcome.

The study population was predominantly female, as previously reported. A large number of patients were obese, which could be due to a nationwide increase in obesity prevalence. Obesity is a risk factor for GERD, explaining the latter's high incidence in our patient population. The relation of GERD with GP is multifactorial. Delayed gastric motility causes an increase in acid secretion, gastric volume, and the gastroesophageal pressure gradient. Gastric distention can also cause relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, contributing to esophageal reflux. Although obesity and GERD were more prevalent, this relationship underscores the complex interplay between these conditions.

Regarding surgical interventions for gastroparesis, specifically with respect to gastric POEM, AGA 2022 guidelines recommend considering gastric POEM in selected patients with refractory gastroparesis who have severe delay in gastric emptying. This should be done using a thoughtful team approach involving motility specialists and advanced endoscopists at a center of excellence.

### Therapeutic strategies in gastroparesis: Results of stepwise approach with diet and prokinetics, gastric rest, and PEG-J: A retrospective analysis [^116gaHmX]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

In our tertiary referral center, Maastricht University Medical Centre (Maastricht UMC+), we provide medical and nutritional support according to a stepwise approach, starting with dietary and lifestyle advice and prokinetics. When these initial measures fail, particularly in the presence of malnutrition (grade 3 gastroparesis), three months of nasoduodenal tube feeding with the aim to achieve "gastric rest" (GR) and "gastric decompression" is considered. Thereafter, oral feeding is re-introduced in a stepwise fashion, and nasoduodenal feeding is stopped. When oral reintroduction fails, placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with jejunal extension (PEG-J) for long-term enteral nutrition is offered.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of our stepwise approach with different interventions (diet and medication; nasoduodenal tube feeding with gastric rest; PEG-J) on gastroparesis symptoms and objective parameters, such as body weight and BMI.

### Therapeutic strategies in gastroparesis: Results of stepwise approach with diet and prokinetics, gastric rest, and PEG-J: A retrospective analysis [^111b2yts]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

A total of 36 patients (non-responders to DP) were treated with three months of gastric rest by nasoduodenal tube feeding after an insufficient response with DP. Enteral tube feeding was well tolerated by all patients. Tube position was only checked in cases of complaints.

- **Outcomes of gastric rest**: A total of 17 patients (47%, group III) responded well to GR. These patients were able to discontinue enteral feeding after three months and successfully reintroduced oral intake in a slow and stepwise manner, gradually increasing calories as tolerated. Oral intake was combined with medication such as prokinetics (erythromycin, domperidone, and metoclopramide) in 65% of patients. Objective weight gain in GR symptom responders was 2.5 kg (P = 0.018 compared to pretreatment). The other 19 patients (53%, group IV) were non-responders in terms of being unable to discontinue enteral feeding and completely resume oral feeding. These 19 patients also had an average weight gain of 2.1 kg (P = 0.027) after three months of GR. Weight change and weight before and after treatment were not statistically different among responders and non-responders to GR (resp. P = 0.433 and P = 0.531).

- **Complications of gastric rest**: During the three months of GR, complications included occlusion of the nasoduodenal tube in three patients (8%) and nasopharyngeal irritation in two patients (5.5%), resulting in tube replacement.

The 19 patients (22% of the total of 86 patients, group IV) with insufficient symptomatic respon…

This editorial addresses the importance of diabetic gastroparesis as a marker of poor glycemic control, other vascular complications, and suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. By highlighting the need to prevent and manage gastroparesis, it attempts to understand why the condition has not received its due share of attention. Complexities in screening, diagnosis, and management all contribute to the lack of focus on this autonomic neuropathy. The editorial reinforces the necessity to enhance awareness about diabetic gastroparesis and underscores the importance of utilizing good clinical sense and rational prescription writing to limit the impact of this complication.

### Gastroparesis: Clinical update [^115mPTuv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis refers to chronically abnormal gastric motility characterized by symptoms suggestive of mechanical obstruction and delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. It may be idiopathic or attributable to neuropathic or myopathic abnormalities, such as diabetes mellitus, postvagotomy, postviral infection, and scleroderma. Dietary and behavioral modification, prokinetic drugs, and surgical interventions have been used in managing patients with gastroparesis. Although mild gastroparesis is usually well managed with these treatment options, severe gastroparesis may be very difficult to control and may require referral to a specialist center if symptoms are intractable despite pharmacological therapy and dietetic support. New advances in drug therapy, botulinum toxin injection, and gastric electrical stimulation techniques have been introduced and might provide new hope to patients with refractory gastroparesis. This article critically reviews the advances in the field from the perspective of the clinician.

### Clinical predictors of symptom improvement failure in gastroparesis [^1147e7wv]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with delayed gastric emptying had poor clinical outcomes compared to those with normal gastric emptying. Gastroparesis was associated with a higher rate of no clinical improvement at 4 weeks (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31–2.63; P = 0.001) compared to patients with a normal gastric emptying study. However, this difference was not significant at 12 weeks (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 0.9–1.86; P = 0.16).

### Rome Foundation and international neurogastroenterology and motility societies' consensus on idiopathic gastroparesis [^1144JK9D]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

To establish a consensus on the definition and management of idiopathic gastroparesis, international experts — selected by neurogastroenterology and motility societies and initiated by the Rome Foundation — devised 144 statements using the Delphi method, with at least 80% agreement required. This consensus defined idiopathic gastroparesis as the presence of symptoms associated with delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Nausea and vomiting were identified as cardinal symptoms. Frequently co-existing symptoms are early satiation and postprandial fullness.

Diagnosis requires the presence of these symptoms alongside delayed gastric emptying, measured by a 4-hour scintigraphy or gastric emptying breath test of a mixed composition meal in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Therapeutic options with proven efficacy were sparse.

- **Dietary adjustments**: Nutritional support, according to guidelines from the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism for substantial weight loss or intractable vomiting, and opioid cessation were recommended by consensus opinion.

- **Antiemetic and prokinetic agents**: Also considered potentially beneficial.

This consensus offers a global perspective on idiopathic gastroparesis.

### Diabetic gastroparesis: Therapeutic options [^114p7CQd]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is characterized by a failure of normal gastric motility and emptying. The delay in gastric emptying leads to significant morbidity due to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and stomach fullness. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus are frequently associated with abnormal gastric motility and are recognized as causes of gastroparesis. The relationship between delayed gastric emptying and symptoms is variable, and individuals with delayed gastric emptying may be asymptomatic. Cross-sectional studies show that about 30%–50% of individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes exhibit delayed gastric emptying.

Paradoxically, in the early stages of type 2 diabetes, there may be an accelerated phase of gastric emptying with enhanced proximal contraction, resulting in nausea in individuals without overt neuropathy. Diabetic gastroparesis (DG) causes significant morbidity. Nausea and vomiting occur in only a small minority of patients, while others may experience unpredictable hypo- and hyperglycemia, leading to overall deranged glycemic control. Thus, the phenomenon of "gastric hypoglycemia" is well-documented and may be an important cause of unexplained hypoglycemia in those classified as having brittle diabetes.

### Epidemiology and outcomes of gastroparesis, as documented in general practice records, in the United Kingdom [^113Xp7Te]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Following diagnosis, 776 patients (68.4%) were prescribed at least one prokinetic, with the remaining 359 patients (31.6%) being offered no recognized pharmacological therapy. The most commonly prescribed medications were domperidone (46.6%) and metoclopramide (22.9%). Erythromycin was prescribed for 6.2% of patients, while prucalopride and cisapride were prescribed for less than 1%.

- **Diabetic versus idiopathic gastroparesis**: Patients with type 2 diabetic gastroparesis differed from those with type 1 diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis in several notable factors. They were older at the time of diagnosis (62.6 years versus 46.3 years in type 1 diabetic and 44.5 years in idiopathic gastroparesis). Additionally, a higher proportion of patients with diabetic gastroparesis were overweight or obese compared to those with idiopathic gastroparesis (78.1% of type 2 diabetic, 56.4% of type 1 diabetic, and 52.3% of idiopathic gastroparesis). After multivariate Cox regression, patients with idiopathic gastroparesis had a significantly higher survival probability than those with diabetic gastroparesis, after adjusting for significant predictors in this study population, including age, sex, and presence of cancer, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, and renal disease. The adjusted hazard ratio for death was 1.9 (95% CI 1.2 to 3.0) in diabetic versus idiopathic gastroparesis.

### Therapeutic strategies in gastroparesis: Results of stepwise approach with diet and prokinetics, gastric rest, and PEG-J: A retrospective analysis [^114taAZh]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis can be classified into the following categories: grade 1 (easily controlled symptoms, ability to maintain weight on regular or slightly adjusted diet); grade 2 is compensated gastroparesis (moderate symptoms, partial control by medication, ability to maintain nutritional status with dietary adjustments, and occasional hospital admissions); and grade 3 is decompensated gastroparesis (refractory symptoms, nutritional status cannot be maintained via oral intake, and frequent hospital admissions).

Due to an incomplete understanding of gastroparesis and limited therapeutic options, symptom management is challenging. Nutritional interventions are often necessary. Initial treatment generally consists of dietary interventions, such as intake of small and frequent meals, and restoring glycemic control in diabetic patients. Dietary advice is often combined with the use of prokinetic agents such as dopaminergic-2-antagonists (e.g. domperidone, metoclopramide), motilin analogues (e.g. erythromycin), or serotonin 4 (5-HT4) agonists (e.g. prucalopride). However, the lack of robust evidence for their effectiveness, in addition to potential serious side effects like QT prolongation or tachyphylaxis, limits the chances for a therapeutic benefit.

With regard to nutritional support, consensus has been reached that nasoduodenal tube feeding should be considered in cases where patients have significant weight loss (5%-10% in 3–6 months), are unable to achieve their target weight, or when repeated hospital admissions for malnutrition or dehydration are necessary.

### Therapeutic strategies in gastroparesis: Results of stepwise approach with diet and prokinetics, gastric rest, and PEG-J: A retrospective analysis [^113RbLfp]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

A total of 86 patients diagnosed with gastroparesis (71% female, age range 20–87 years [mean 55.8 years]) were seen between 2008 and 2016, and their data were analyzed. Idiopathic gastroparesis was the most common type (n = 33, 38.3%), followed by diabetic gastroparesis (n = 23, 26.7%), postsurgical gastroparesis (n = 23, 26.7%), and generalized motility disorder (including patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) (n = 7, 8.1%).

Groups were defined as follows: group I consists of patients that only needed DP (responders to DP, 50 patients). Group II consists of non-responders to DP (decompensated gastroparesis) who received GR (36 patients). Group III consists of responders to DP + GR (17 patients), and group IV of patients that did not respond to DP and GR and therefore received PEG-J (19 patients). Before treatment (6–12 months), 31 patients had a stable weight (36%), 27 patients (31.4%) had < 10 kg weight loss, and 28 patients (32.6%) had ≥ 10 kg weight loss. No relation was observed between treatment (symptom as well as weight) response and gastric emptying parameters (data not shown).

- **Drug use**: Of the 86 patients, 12 used opioids. In only three cases was it apparent that opioid use was an etiological factor in gastroparesis due to the temporal relation between initiating opioids and gastroparesis symptom development. A total of seven patients used centrally acting medications.

### Ten controversies in gastroparesis and a look to the future [^114Mo1xr]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). High credibility.

Gastroparesis is a complex, challenging gastrointestinal disorder that presents with upper gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly nausea and vomiting, significantly impacting patients' quality of life. Once mechanical obstruction is ruled out, it is essential to identify delayed gastric emptying for a definitive diagnosis. The most common causes include idiopathic origins (no identified etiology), diabetes mellitus, and postsurgical status. Management of gastroparesis focuses on dietary modifications and treatments directed towards symptom relief. Unfortunately, approximately one-third of patients are refractory to pharmacological therapy, and the effectiveness of the few nonpharmacological options has been questioned.

- **Purpose**: An extensive review of the literature identifies several uncertainties or controversies regarding the differential diagnosis based on the spectrum of symptoms, the lack of availability of reliable diagnostic tests, and questions regarding effective therapeutic options.

In this review, we discuss ten controversies regarding gastroparesis: clinical presentation, diagnosis, overlap syndromes, pathophysiology, etiology, as well as pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapeutic options. Additionally, we briefly review studies exploring pathological, inflammatory, and molecular disturbances affecting the intrinsic neuromuscular elements that may be involved in the pathophysiology of gastroparesis and may constitute possible therapeutic targets in the future. Finally, we tabulate future research opportunities to resolve these controversies in the management of patients.

### Therapeutic strategies in gastroparesis: Results of stepwise approach with diet and prokinetics, gastric rest, and PEG-J: A retrospective analysis [^1158mvkz]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

A significant weight gain of 5.1 kg on average (range −5 to +21 kg, P = 0.002) was observed within 6 months after PEG-J placement. Symptom responders showed a more pronounced weight gain compared with non-responders, although weight and weight change were not statistically different among responders and non-responders for PEG-J (resp. P = 0.150 and P = 0.454).

Of all patients receiving enteral nutrition, 16 (84%) were able to have some oral intake in addition to enteral tube feeding, while three patients could not eat or drink anything (16%).

Data were eligible for analysis in 17 of the 19 patients (no measurement performed in two patients). No significant differences were observed in manometry data (antral amplitude, antral motility index, and presence of phase III contractions) between responders (n = 7) and non-responders (n = 12) to PEG-J, albeit this might be due to a type II statistical error.

- **Complications of PEG-J**: The most frequent complication was luxation of the jejunal extension to the stomach (six patients [32%], 1–8 times), occurring following a few months of use, which required placement of a new extension. Other complications were peristomal infection (in two patients [10.5%] within 30 days, in three patients [16%] after 30 days, easily treated with oral antibiotics) and buried bumper (three patients, 16%, after approximately one year, which led to replacement).

Only three patients (16%) out of the 19 treated with PEG-J were able to re…

### Gastroparesis with concomitant gastrointestinal dysmotility is not a contraindication for per-oral pyloromyotomy (POP) [^11787Rka]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Low credibility.

Per-oral pyloromyotomy (POP or G-POEM) provides significant short-term improvements in symptoms and objective emptying for patients with medically refractory gastroparesis. However, it is unclear if patients with gastroparesis and co-existing dysmotility (small bowel or colonic delay) also benefit. In this study, we used wireless motility capsule (WMC) data to measure outcomes in patients with isolated gastroparesis (GP) and gastroparesis with co-existing dysmotility (GP+Dys) who underwent POP.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed patients who had POP and completed WMC data during their evaluation of intestinal dysmotility. WMC data were reviewed to identify patients who demonstrated isolated GP or GP+Dys. Each patient's pre-op and post-op Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) and 4-hour solid-phase scintigraphy gastric emptying studies (GES) scores were compared to evaluate improvement.

- **Results**: Of the entire cohort (n = 73), 89% were female with a mean age of 47.0 ± 15.0 years old. Gastroparesis etiologies were divided among idiopathic (54.8%), diabetic (26%), postsurgical (8.2%), autoimmune (5.5%), and multifactorial (5.5%). Forty-one patients (56%) had GP and 32 patients (44%) had GP+Dys. GCSI improved after POP whether the patient had isolated GP (-12.31, p < 0.001) or GP+Dys (-9.58, p < 0.001); however, there was no significant difference in total GCSI improvement between the two groups. A subset of patients had postoperative GES available (n = 47). In the isolated GP and GP+Dys cohorts, 15/28 (54%) and 12/19 (63%) patients had normal post-op 4-hour GES, respectively.

### Gastroparesis [^114qBdoJ]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2018). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is a disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying of solid food in the absence of a mechanical obstruction of the stomach, resulting in the cardinal symptoms of early satiety, postprandial fullness, nausea, vomiting, belching, and bloating. Gastroparesis is now recognized as part of a broader spectrum of gastric neuromuscular dysfunction that includes impaired gastric accommodation. The overlap between upper gastrointestinal symptoms makes the distinction between gastroparesis and other disorders, such as functional dyspepsia, challenging. Thus, a confirmed diagnosis of gastroparesis requires measurement of delayed gastric emptying via an appropriate test, such as gastric scintigraphy or breath testing.

Gastroparesis can have idiopathic, diabetic, iatrogenic, post-surgical, or post-viral etiologies. The management of gastroparesis involves correcting fluid, electrolyte, and nutritional deficiencies; identifying and treating the cause of delayed gastric emptying (for example, diabetes mellitus); and suppressing or eliminating symptoms with pharmacological agents as first-line therapies. Several novel pharmacologic agents and interventions are currently in the pipeline and show promise to help tailor individualized therapy for patients with gastroparesis.

	- **Question**: Does nil-per-os (NPO) time and preoperative fasting influence fluid needs during surgery?

	- **Findings**: Using multiple statistical analyses, we found no relationship between NPO time and fluid volume delivery suggested by a goal-directed fluid-therapy algorithm.

	- **Meaning**: Intravenous fluid resuscitation based on historical "NPO time deficits" may not be indicated.

### Epidemiology and outcomes of gastroparesis, as documented in general practice records, in the United Kingdom [^11348VHM]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

We found that the majority of patients with gastroparesis in the CPRD were overweight or obese. Contrary to previous beliefs, this evidence from a real-world setting suggests that the chronic nausea and vomiting associated with gastroparesis may not always lead to weight loss. The coexistence of obesity should, therefore, not preclude consideration of gastroparesis as a potential cause of upper GI symptoms, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes.

To put these results in context, the mean BMI among patients with gastroparesis in the Olmsted County study was 24.9 ± 6.8 versus 27.2 ± 8.1 in the CPRD. A higher proportion of patients with type 2 diabetic gastroparesis in the CPRD were overweight or obese than those with type 1 diabetic gastroparesis or idiopathic gastroparesis. Given the association of obesity with an increased risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus, this is perhaps not surprising. However, our observation that approximately 50% of patients with idiopathic gastroparesis were also overweight or obese supports data reported by the NIH consortium in the United States.

On further investigation, Parkman et al. concluded that patients with idiopathic gastroparesis consume and expend fewer calories than healthy controls and postulated that weight gain could be possible in the presence of less severe symptoms. Without information on the severity of symptoms, we are unable to address this hypothesis in CPRD, and further research is required.

Other than underlying patient factors, the structure of the UK healthcare system may partially contribute to the differences observed.

### Acupuncture for symptomatic gastroparesis [^112MtLxs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis, a state of delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction of the stomach, substantially impacts people's daily function and quality of life when symptomatic. Treatment options are based on limited evidence of benefits. Acupuncture is widely used to manage gastrointestinal disorders, although its role in people with symptomatic gastroparesis is unclear. We therefore undertook a systematic review of the evidence.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of acupuncture, in comparison with no treatment, sham acupuncture, conventional medicine, standard care, or other non-pharmacological active interventions for symptom management in people with gastroparesis.

- **Search methods**: On 26 March 2018, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, AMED, Korean medical databases (including Korean Studies Information, DBPIA, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, Research Information Centre for Health Database, KoreaMed, and the National Assembly Library), and Chinese databases (including the China Academic Journal). We also searched two clinical trials registries for ongoing trials. We imposed no language limitations.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected all randomised controlled trials comparing the penetrating type of acupuncture with no treatment, sham acupuncture, conventional medicine, standard care, and other non-pharmacological active interventions for people with symptomatic gastroparesis of any aetiology (i.e. surgical, diabetic, or idiopathic).

### Therapeutic strategies in gastroparesis: Results of stepwise approach with diet and prokinetics, gastric rest, and PEG-J: A retrospective analysis [^115PZLPT]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Based on literature data, approximately 30% of gastroparesis patients progress to grade III (decompensated) gastroparesis, of which the majority eventually require long-term enteral tube feeding. In our experience, only 19 of 86 patients (22%) progressed to grade III. We have opted for the placement of a PEG-J with fixation of the tube tip in the distal duodenum or proximal jejunum. Alternative procedures include jejunostomies placed via surgery, radiology, or endoscopy. The surgical approach is known for higher complication rates, and experience with (direct) PEJ (Percutaneous Endoscopic Jejunostomy) and percutaneous radiologic jejunostomy (PRJ) in gastroparesis is limited. In a study assessing the effect of surgical jejunostomy in diabetic gastroparesis, symptom relief was observed in 39% and improved nutritional status in 56%. No data on the efficacy of nasojejunal feeding or the effect of dietary treatment on weight in gastroparesis patients were previously published. Our preference for the PEG-J procedure with duodenal extension and fixation is based on the local expertise of our PEG team and outpatient PEG support.

Several other therapeutic options are available. Botulinum toxin injections were performed at our center during the period these patients were included. Some patients were treated with botulinum toxin (22/86); however, this therapy was not the primary focus of our analysis. Furthermore, this therapy is not recommended by guidelines due to questionable response compared to placebo, and there…

### Diabetic gastroparesis: Principles and current trends in management [^117Hnu49]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Normal gastric emptying results from the integration of tonic contractions of the fundus, phasic contractions of the antrum, and the inhibitory forces of pyloric and duodenal contractions. This process requires complex interactions between smooth muscle, enteric and autonomic nerves, and specialized pacemaker cells known as the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC).

The emptying of the gastric reservoir is caused by two mechanisms: a tonic contraction of the fundus and peristaltic waves (phasic contractions) moving over the distal part of the gastric body and antrum. These two forces represent the pump of the gastric reservoir. Both the peristaltic waves and the tonic contractions of the reservoir are stimulated by cholinergic enteric neurons that are under modulatory vagal tone. In the region of the body of the stomach, peristaltic waves only produce a small circular constriction.

The peristaltic wave originates at the proximal stomach and propagates to the pylorus. These waves are based on electrical waves originating in the gastric wall. A network of interstitial cells, known as the ICC, exists in the wall of both the stomach and small intestine. These cells produce electrical pacesetter potentials due to oscillations in their membrane potential. The pacesetter potential of the ICC drives electrical events in smooth muscle cells where they are reflected as slow waves.

### MASCC multidisciplinary evidence-based recommendations for the management of malignant bowel obstruction in advanced cancer [^1163LUKQ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Low credibility.

When a patient is initially diagnosed with malignant bowel obstruction (MBO), they should be made nil per os (NPO; nothing by mouth). Once the acute MBO resolves, either fully or partially, a symptom-led, slow, and graded reintroduction to oral diet is recommended. This may include clear fluids, free or full fluids, and texture-modified low-fiber diets (soft, minced, and pureed). If tolerated, patients can progress back to a normal textured low-fiber diet (level of evidence: IV; grade: B).

Nutrition interventions should be initiated in patients with advanced cancers only when the benefits on quality of life and survival outweigh the risks. Clear expectations should be discussed by a multidisciplinary team with patients and families (level of evidence: IV; grade: B).

Patients admitted with acute onset of an MBO are typically managed by being nil by mouth, along with the addition of decompressive procedures to control symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. Managing the nutrition requirements of patients with advanced cancers and MBO is controversial and ethically challenging due to a lack of consensus and scant published evidence. Nutrition interventions must consider the patient's prognosis, prioritizing their wishes. Awareness of the sociocultural meaning of food and nutrition is important and may contribute to increased quality of life.

### Medical and surgical management of gastroparesis: A systematic review [^113jXfb5]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis (GPS) is a rare disease with multiple etiologies that results in delayed gastric emptying. Diagnosis of GPS can be challenging due to its rather complex clinical presentation. Pharmacologic refractory cases require surgical interventions, all of which have yet to be standardized or characterized.

- **Objectives**: We present a review of the literature and provide an update on therapies for patients with GPS.

- **Setting**: Department of General Surgery, Academic Hospital, United States.

- **Methods**: We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase for English-written articles published in the last 38 years, using an advanced title search of "gastroparesis management". Other keywords included "surgical management" and "refractory gastroparesis". Further references were obtained through cross-referencing.

- **Results**: A total of 12,250 articles were selected after eliminating duplicates. After a thorough screening of selection criteria, 68 full-text articles were included for review.

- **Conclusion**: GPS is a challenging disease to manage. Nutritional support must remain the primary approach, followed by either medical or surgical treatment modalities if necessary. In patients with refractory gastroparesis, adjunctive therapies have been proposed as promising long-term options.

### United European Gastroenterology (UEG) and European Society for Neurogastroenterology and Motility (ESNM) consensus on gastroparesis [^111iLXk7]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is a condition characterized by epigastric symptoms and delayed gastric emptying (GE) rate in the absence of any mechanical obstruction. Clinically, it presents challenges due to a lack of guidance regarding its diagnosis and management.

- **Methods**: A Delphi consensus was undertaken by 40 experts from 19 European countries, who conducted a literature summary and voting process on 89 statements. The quality of evidence was evaluated using grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation criteria. Consensus, defined as ≥ 80% agreement, was reached for 25 statements.

- **Results**: The European consensus defined gastroparesis as the presence of symptoms associated with delayed GE in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Nausea and vomiting were identified as cardinal symptoms, often coexisting with postprandial distress syndrome symptoms of dyspepsia. While the true epidemiology of gastroparesis is not detailed, diabetes, gastric surgery, certain neurological and connective tissue diseases, and the use of certain drugs are recognized as risk factors. The panel agreed that severely impaired gastric motor function is present in these patients. However, there was no consensus on the underlying pathophysiology. It was agreed that an upper endoscopy and a GE test are required for diagnosis. Only dietary therapy, dopamine-2 antagonists, and 5-HT 4 receptor agonists were considered appropriate therapies, along with nutritional support in cases of severe weight loss. No consensus was reached on the use of proton pump inhibitors.

### Nutritional aspects in patients with gastroparesis [^111SZycf]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

The purpose of this review was to highlight the most recent updates on nutritional aspects in gastroparesis (GP), focusing on dietary recommendations, utilization of enteral and parenteral nutrition, and endoscopic and surgical interventions.

Recent data addressed eating patterns and nutritional interventions, providing clarifications on the role of endoscopic and surgical interventions that impact the nutritional management of GP patients. These findings support the importance of a gastroparesis-specific diet in addition to drug therapy and confirm the benefits of a modified low-fat, low-fiber diet. Guidelines suggest a new approach to GP management based on predominant symptoms. Gastric peroral endoscopic pyloromyotomy (G-POEM) and surgical gastric electrical stimulator (GES) placement may be considered in individuals with nausea and vomiting, prior to the need for jejunostomy tube placement for enteral feeding or parenteral nutrition.

Literature supports the significance of dietary interventions, emphasizing low-fat and low-fiber diets alongside drug therapies. Severely fiber-restrictive diets may not be necessary. There is a better understanding of when jejunal feeding should be implemented for refractory cases, with consideration of G-POEM and/or GES even before jejunal tube placement. This approach will require patient evaluation in specialized motility centers.

### Expert consensus document: Advances in the diagnosis and classification of gastric and intestinal motility disorders [^117Pgb3J]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of gastroparesis requires objective evidence of clearly delayed gastric emptying in symptomatic patients. Because accelerated, normal, and delayed gastric emptying cannot be differentiated reliably based on type or severity of gastrointestinal symptoms, objective measurement of clearly delayed gastric emptying (gastric emptying time increased above the upper level of normal) using well-validated techniques such as gastric emptying scintigraphy (FIG. 1) is required for diagnosis of gastroparesis. To obtain a more specific symptom pattern and a better separation from functional dyspepsia with delayed emptying, gastroparesis has been proposed to require a stricter definition (for example, > 3 standard deviations above the mean value in healthy volunteers).

The merit of gastric emptying studies for clinical management has been questioned because of variations in the reports of association between gastric emptying rates and symptoms. Several studies published during the past 7 years have shown a positive association between symptoms of gastroparesis and gastric emptying times. Measurement of gastric emptying can also predict responsiveness to different therapeutic options. For example, the presence of slow gastric emptying in patients with functional dyspepsia was associated with poor response to antidepressant medications that target visceral hypersensitivity. On the other hand, one systematic literature review that used multiple methods, various symptom instruments, and diverse treatments showed that most drugs that improved idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis.

### Association between nil per os status and intubated patients undergoing surgery [^113i1adj]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Low credibility.

Patient outcomes heavily rely on nutritional support. However, holding enteric feeds prior to surgical operations in critically ill patients is still a common practice in intensive critical units. Our objective is to describe the relationship between the duration of nil per os (NPO) status and respiratory outcomes in intubated, critically ill patients requiring operative intervention.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective analysis on intubated, critically ill patients who underwent operative intervention between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018, to investigate how the duration of NPO status may affect respiratory outcomes. We compared adverse respiratory events among patients who maintained NPO status for ≥ 6 hours (NPO group) versus those who were NPO for < 6 hours (non-NPO group) prior to surgery.

- **Results**: Two hundred patients met the inclusion criteria: 104 in the NPO group and 96 in the non-NPO group. Aspiration events were found in 5.8% of NPO patients and 7.3% of non-NPO patients (P = 0.66). Desaturation events occurred in 16.3% of NPO patients and 14.6% of non-NPO patients (P = 0.73). Pneumonia was found in 18.3% of NPO patients and 19.8% of non-NPO patients (P = 0.78). Reintubation rates were 13.5% for NPO patients and 16.7% for non-NPO patients (P = 0.57). The median (range) hours of NPO for non-NPO patients was 1.0 hours (0–3.0), and 13.0 hours (6.0–20.0) for NPO patients (P < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: For intubated, critically ill patients requiring operative intervention, there was no observed difference in adverse respiratory events between those kept NPO for 6 hours or greater compared to those kept NPO for less than 6 hours. Patients were commonly without enteric nutrition for perioperative periods.

### Lack of impact of nil-per-os (NPO) time on goal-directed fluid delivery in first case versus afternoon case starts: a retrospective cohort study [^1171w4wp]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Low credibility.

This retrospective study utilized a de-identified dataset provided by the hospital information technology department. The University of California Irvine Institutional Review Board deemed the protocol IRB exempt.

- **Data collection**: We extracted data for this study from our perioperative database, SIS (Surgical Information Systems, Alpharetta, GA). The initial data pull included all adult procedures in 20 main operating rooms at UC Irvine Medical Center (UCIMC) from September 1, 2013, through September 1, 2015, that were marked as receiving GDFT in the medical record (our charts include a mandatory GDFT field that must be selected yes/no before the chart can be closed).

Inclusion criteria for the study were adult patients aged 18 or over having open or laparoscopic abdominal procedures (colectomy, adrenalectomy, gastrectomy, hepatic resection, Whipple or pancreatic procedures, nephrectomy, cystectomy, abdominoperineal resection, or gynecologic oncology procedures). For each identified case, we pulled: case, date and time; procedure; patient demographics (including gender, height, weight, age, American Society of Anesthesiologists Patient Score); patient comorbidities (including hypertension, congestive heart failure, renal failure, and dialysis); NPO time; whether or not the patient received an epidural or arterial line; intraoperative data (including urine output, estimated blood loss, total crystalloid and colloid, blood administration, median and minimum heart rate, median and minimum mean arterial pressure).

We sorted the data and created two groups distin[guished based on the start time of the procedures].

### Management of the patient with gastroparesis [^116EcTn3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Management options for gastroparesis are largely universal despite the condition being associated with various underlying disorders. The foundation of standard management consists of dietary measures and pharmacologic agents, primarily in the form of prokinetic medications. For patients experiencing refractory symptoms, alternative dosing schemes or drug combinations may be employed. Occasionally, some patients may require a venting gastrostomy and/or jejunal feeding.

This review explores the standard dietary and pharmacologic approaches to managing gastroparesis, alongside considerations for gastrostomy/jejunostomy tubes and surgical options for refractory cases. Additionally, the discussion extends to experimental agents and techniques, such as gastric pacing.

### Per-oral pyloromyotomy (POP) for medically refractory gastroparesis: Short-term results from the first 100 patients at a high volume center [^113rRZRV]. Annals of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

For patients with gastroparesis, temporary pyloric disruption has been shown to improve symptoms and gastric emptying. Per-oral pyloromyotomy (POP) is an innovative endoscopic procedure to divide the pylorus from within a submucosal tunnel, serving as a corollary to surgical pyloromyotomy. Here, we evaluate subjective and objective outcomes 12 weeks after POP at a high volume center.

- **Methods**: The first 100 consecutive patients undergoing POP were included, with procedure dates between January 2016 and October 2017. Patients were evaluated using the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) and 4-hour solid-phase scintigraphic gastric emptying studies (GES) prior to the procedure and at 90 days post-POP. The study cohort was 85% female, with a mean age of 45.0 ± 14.6 years. Gastroparesis etiologies were divided among idiopathic (56%), diabetic (21%), postsurgical (19%), and other in 4%. Sixty-seven percent of the patients had previous endoscopic or surgical interventions for gastroparesis. Most POP procedures were performed in the operating room (97%) and were completed in an average of 33 minutes. Ten patients incurred complications (10%), which included 1 diagnostic laparoscopy and 2 cases of gastrointestinal bleeding.

- **Results**: Overall GCSI improved from a preoperative mean of 3.82 ± 0.86 to 2.54 ± 1.2 (P < 0.001). The improvement in each GCSI subscore was also highly statistically significant. Among the patients with postoperative GES available, 78% had objectively better 4-hour emptying with a mean improvement in retention by 23.6% (P < 0.001). This included 57% of patients with improved outcomes.

### Diabetic gastroparesis: Principles and current trends in management [^112sciBm]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are the most disabling symptoms of gastroparesis, and antiemetic agents without stimulatory activity are often used alone or in combination with prokinetic drugs to treat gastroparesis. Antiemetic medications act on a broad range of distinct receptor subtypes in the peripheral and central nervous system. Like prokinetics, the choice of antiemetic is empirical. Some antiemetics have the potential for KEG Q-Tc prolongation, as do some other drugs used for the treatment of gastroparetic symptoms.

- **Phenothiazines**: Phenothiazines are the most commonly prescribed traditional antiemetics and include prochlorperazine and tiethyperazine. These drugs are both dopamine and cholinergic receptor antagonists that act on the area postrema in the brainstem. Side effects include sedation and extrapyramidal effects such as drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, skin rashes, and Parkinsonian-like tardive dyskinesia.

- **Serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonists**: These medications include ondansetron, granisetron, and dolasetron, and they act on the chemoreceptor trigger zone as well as on peripheral afferent nerve fibers within the vagus nerve. They may be used in DGP when all other drugs have failed to provide symptom relief.

- **Antihistamines**: Antihistamines act on H1 receptors to produce central antiemetic effects. Commonly prescribed antiemetics include diphenhydramine, dimenhydrinate, and meclizine. These agents are most often used to treat symptoms related to motion sickness. Side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, difficulty urinating, and constipation.

### Gastroparesis: Separate entity or just a part of dyspepsia [^113Lw7VJ]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is defined by the presence of delayed gastric emptying (GE) in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Symptoms attributed to gastroparesis include postprandial fullness, early satiation, nausea, and vomiting. Gastroprokinetic drugs are the preferred treatment option. However, several problems with the concept of gastroparesis have been identified recently. There is a major overlap with the symptom complex of the functional dyspepsia subtype known as postprandial distress syndrome. The distinguishing feature of gastroparesis is delayed GE, but the correlation between delayed emptying and symptom pattern or severity in gastroparesis is modest, and the stability of delayed emptying over time is poor. Other pathophysiological mechanisms, such as hypersensitivity or impaired accommodation, may also underlie symptoms in patients with gastroparesis.

Moreover, the symptomatic response to prokinetic therapy is variable and cannot be predicted based on the degree of enhanced GE. Various approaches have been proposed to increase the clinical usefulness of diagnosing gastroparesis, including a higher threshold of abnormal emptying and the selection of patients with a specific symptom pattern more likely to be associated with delayed emptying.
