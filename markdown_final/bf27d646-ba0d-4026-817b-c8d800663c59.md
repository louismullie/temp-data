## Question

Can people with prostate cancer history use sglt2

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether people with a history of prostate cancer can use SGLT2 inhibitors, specifically regarding their safety, cancer risk, potential benefits, and practical considerations for use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core safety question of whether SGLT2 inhibitors increase prostate cancer risk or recurrence. Then, I should verify whether any major guidelines or labels restrict use in patients with a history of prostate cancer. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility for anticancer effects. After that, I should review clinical evidence for prostate-specific outcomes, including observational and interventional data. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations, including renal function thresholds, genitourinary risks, and monitoring considerations, and close with a clear bottom line recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the core safety signal. Multiple meta-analyses and systematic reviews consistently show that SGLT2 inhibitors as a class are not associated with an increased overall cancer risk, and importantly, several analyses suggest a reduced risk of prostate cancer compared with DPP-4 inhibitors, with pooled effect sizes around 0.75 to 0.77, which implies a roughly 23–25% relative risk reduction, albeit from observational data and with heterogeneity that warrants cautious interpretation [^113hxWEj] [^1179Pp5B] [^115djksi] [^113r6Ftm].

> Wait, let me verify whether any regulatory or guideline cautions specifically pertain to prostate cancer. I initially thought there might be a prostate-specific warning, but hold on, I should verify the labels and guidelines. The historical concern has centered on bladder cancer, particularly with dapagliflozin, and even that has evolved; an AACE corrigendum notes removal of language advising against use in active bladder cancer and caution with a history of bladder cancer from dapagliflozin labeling, reflecting updated evidence, and current dapagliflozin labeling does not carry a bladder cancer warning, while canagliflozin and empagliflozin labels never included such warnings, and there are no prostate cancer–specific contraindications or precautions in major guidelines or labels [^112ecaVY] [^114465qh] [^117FK3zZ].

> I need to check mechanistic plausibility next. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce intratumoral glucose availability by lowering systemic glucose and insulin, which can theoretically suppress tumor growth signaling; preclinical work demonstrates SGLT2 expression in prostate cancer and antitumor effects of SGLT2 blockade in prostate models, and broader translational work supports anticancer activity across several tumor types, including prostate, which provides a biologically coherent rationale for safety and potential benefit rather than harm in prostate cancer survivors [^115rf1RQ] [^113JxMNo].

> Next, I should review prostate-specific clinical signals. Observational cohort comparisons suggest lower prostate cancer incidence with SGLT2 inhibitors versus DPP-4 inhibitors, and a small retrospective series in men with localized or biochemically recurrent prostate cancer showed PSA responses in a subset initiating SGLT2 inhibitors without androgen deprivation, which is hypothesis-generating rather than definitive but aligns with the mechanistic premise and the absence of a harm signal [^113hxWEj] [^112YnzFf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check for potential confounding and detection bias. The inverse association between diabetes and prostate cancer risk is partly explained by fewer biopsies among treated diabetic men rather than true biological protection, so I need to ensure that the SGLT2 data are interpreted in that context. Still, the comparative analyses versus DPP-4 inhibitors and the consistency across multiple datasets reduce the likelihood that detection bias alone explains the observed reduction with SGLT2 inhibitors, though residual confounding remains possible in observational designs [^115PWxG4] [^113j6ftD].

> I will now examine practical considerations that could modify use in prostate cancer survivors. Renal function thresholds matter: most SGLT2 inhibitors have reduced glycemic efficacy below eGFR 45–60 and are generally avoided or used only for cardiorenal indications at lower eGFR, so I should confirm kidney function before prescribing and align the indication with cardiorenal benefit rather than glycemic control alone in advanced CKD [^1136uiH2] [^1179Pp5B]. I need to ensure we counsel on genitourinary infections, polyuria, and volume depletion, which can be more bothersome in men with prostate enlargement or post-treatment LUTS; guidelines advise screening for and mitigating these risks and considering patient preferences and comorbidities when selecting therapy [^115o2419] [^116pthGv].

> But wait, what about potential urologic complications after pelvic radiation or surgery. A case report described hemorrhagic cystitis temporally associated with empagliflozin after prostate radiation, with symptom improvement after discontinuation; this is very low-quality evidence, yet it prompts me to consider extra caution with SGLT2 inhibitors in men with recent pelvic radiation or active hematuria, monitor closely for urinary symptoms, and reassess if significant bleeding or infection risk emerges, balancing this against the robust cardiorenal benefits in appropriate candidates [^111DeDaA] [^115o2419].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating certainty. Overall, there is no evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors increase prostate cancer risk or recurrence, and multiple lines of evidence suggest neutral to potentially protective associations for prostate cancer, supported by mechanistic plausibility; no major guideline lists prostate cancer history as a contraindication, and the principal cautions relate to genitourinary infections, volume status, and renal function rather than prostate-specific oncologic risk [^113hxWEj] [^114KcRwN] [^115o2419] [^1179Pp5B].

> Bottom line, after verifying the totality of evidence and practical constraints, SGLT2 inhibitors can be used in patients with a history of prostate cancer when there is a clear cardiorenal indication, with attention to renal function, genitourinary symptoms, and infection risk, and with shared decision-making if there are urologic comorbidities such as post-radiation cystitis or recurrent infections. If the clinical priority is purely glycemic control and these risks are prominent, a GLP-1 receptor agonist may be a reasonable alternative, but that choice should be individualized rather than driven by prostate cancer history per se [^1179Pp5B] [^115o2419] [^116pthGv].

---

Patients with a history of prostate cancer can use SGLT2 inhibitors when clinically indicated, as there is **no evidence of increased prostate cancer risk** or recurrence with these agents [^116vnsoT] [^113r6Ftm]. SGLT2 inhibitors are appropriate for patients with cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, and may even be associated with a **lower overall cancer risk** compared with DPP-4 inhibitors [^113hxWEj] [^114KcRwN]. Clinicians should monitor for genitourinary infections and volume depletion, and use caution in patients with severe renal impairment or high fracture risk [^117FK3zZ] [^1136uiH2].

---

## Evidence regarding prostate cancer risk

Multiple large randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses show **no increase in prostate cancer incidence** with SGLT2 inhibitors compared with placebo or active comparators [^116vnsoT] [^113r6Ftm]. Observational data suggest a **protective association**, with lower prostate cancer risk versus DPP-4 inhibitors (pooled effect size 0.75, 95% CI 0.58–0.97) [^113hxWEj] [^114KcRwN]. Preclinical studies indicate potential anticancer effects, including reduced tumor growth and enhanced chemosensitivity, though clinical confirmation is pending [^115rf1RQ] [^113JxMNo].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines do not list prostate cancer history as a contraindication to SGLT2 inhibitors. The **VA/DoD guideline** recommends SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with T2DM and heart failure or CKD, without restricting use in patients with a history of prostate cancer [^notfound]. The **AACE guideline** similarly supports use for cardiovascular and renal indications, with no prostate cancer–specific restrictions [^notfound].

---

## Potential benefits in prostate cancer patients

Beyond glycemic control, SGLT2 inhibitors offer **cardiovascular and renal benefits** that may be relevant for prostate cancer survivors with comorbidities:

- **Cardiovascular benefits**: Reduced heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular events, beneficial given the elevated cardiovascular risk in prostate cancer patients [^1179Pp5B] [^113hCycy].

- **Renal benefits**: Slowed progression of chronic kidney disease, valuable for patients with renal comorbidities [^115kAGDZ].

- **Weight and blood pressure**: Modest weight loss and blood pressure reduction, potentially beneficial in metabolic syndrome [^1179Pp5B].

---

## Safety considerations and precautions

While SGLT2 inhibitors are generally safe, clinicians should consider the following in patients with a history of prostate cancer:

- **Genitourinary infections**: Increased risk of urinary tract and genital infections; monitor and counsel patients accordingly [^117FK3zZ] [^113wcbpx].

- **Volume depletion**: Risk of hypotension and dehydration, especially in older adults or those on diuretics; assess volume status before initiation [^117FK3zZ] [^115o2419].

- **Fracture risk**: Canagliflozin may increase fracture risk; use caution in patients with osteoporosis or high fracture risk [^117FK3zZ] [^1111qHRT].

- **Renal function**: Use caution in severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²); dose adjustments may be necessary [^1136uiH2] [^1111qHRT].

---

## Clinical scenarios where SGLT2 inhibitors may be beneficial

SGLT2 inhibitors may be **particularly beneficial** in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale for sglt2 inhibitor use** |
|-|-|
| Cardiovascular disease or heart failure | - Reduced cardiovascular events <br/> - Heart failure hospitalizations [^1179Pp5B] |
| Chronic kidney disease | - Slowed progression of renal impairment [^115kAGDZ] |
| Metabolic syndrome or obesity | - Weight loss <br/> - Blood pressure reduction [^1179Pp5B] |
| High risk of genitourinary infections | - Monitor closely <br/> - Consider alternative therapies if recurrent infections occur [^117FK3zZ] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where caution or alternative therapies may be considered

Alternative therapies may be preferable in the following scenarios:

- **Severe renal impairment**: eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; consider alternative glucose-lowering agents [^1111qHRT].

- **High fracture risk**: Use caution with canagliflozin; consider alternatives if fracture risk is significant [^117FK3zZ].

- **Recurrent genitourinary infections**: Consider alternative therapies if infections persist despite preventive measures [^1111qHRT].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Patients with a history of prostate cancer can use SGLT2 inhibitors when clinically indicated, as there is **no evidence of increased prostate cancer risk** or recurrence [^116vnsoT] [^113r6Ftm]. These agents offer cardiovascular and renal benefits that may be advantageous for many survivors. Clinicians should monitor for infections and volume depletion, and use caution in patients with severe renal impairment or high fracture risk [^117FK3zZ] [^1136uiH2].

5 CONCLUSION

As current evidence stands, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin do not appear to significantly impact cancer risk in patients with type 2 diabetes; however, long‐term safety data are lacking. Given the limitations of the included quantitative systematic reviews, as well as imprecise effect estimates reported in these reviews, more long‐term data from high quality observational studies are needed to more precisely assess cancer risks associated with SGLT‐2 inhibitor use. Future studies should focus on quantifying bladder and gastrointestinal cancers.

### The cardioprotective and anticancer effects of SGLT2 inhibitors: state-of-the-art review [^117E6QtG]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were originally developed to address type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the renal proximal tubules. Beyond SGLT2 inhibitors' glucose-lowering effects, extensive studies have highlighted their remarkable cardioprotective properties in patients, regardless of diabetes status. Currently, 2 SGLT2 inhibitors, empagliflozin and dapagliflozin, have gained approval for treating heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction. Emerging evidence suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors exert direct protective effects on the cardiovascular system, independently of glycemic control. These effects encompass improved cardiac metabolism, reduced oxidative stress, modulation of neurohormonal pathways, attenuation of myocardial inflammation, and preservation of endothelial function. Such multifaceted mechanisms underscore their potential as therapeutic agents in various cardiac conditions.

One area of particular interest involves exploring the potential protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in mitigating cancer treatment–related cardiotoxicity and their role in cardio-oncology. Cardio-oncology is a clinical and scientific discipline that focuses on diagnosing, preventing, treating, and monitoring the cardiovascular consequences of cancer and its therapies. With the growing number of cancer survivors and the ongoing use of cardiotoxic cancer therapies, such as anthracyclines, proteasome inhibitors, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, there is a pressing need for cardioprotective strategies. A plethora of preclinical studies, along with a growing number of observational clinical studies, have suggested promising cardioprotective roles for SGLT2 inhibitors in mitigating cancer treatment–related cardiotoxicity.,

In the pursuit of improving the cardiovascular health of patients with cancer, it is crucial to develop cardioprotective agents that can effectively protect the heart without compromising the anticancer effects of cancer treatments. In this regard, several preclinical studies have demonstrated potential anticancer effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in various types of cancer, including breast, prostate, colorectal, and bladder cancer. This growing preclinical evidence, highlighting the anticancer properties of SGLT2 inhibitors, further underscores their significance as promising cardioprotective agents against cancer therapy–related cardiotoxicity.

Anticancer Effects of SGLT2 Inhibitors

Following the demonstration of the cardioprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors against cancer therapy–related cardiovascular toxicity, it is crucial to investigate their impact on the anticancer effects of cancer treatments. This investigation is essential to confirm that combining SGLT2 inhibitors with cancer treatments would not compromise their chemotherapeutic benefits.

Initially, concerns were raised regarding the risk for cancer with SGLT2 inhibitors, especially bladder cancer with dapagliflozin. However, subsequent studies and meta-analyses have examined these concerns, ultimately concluding that there was no overall risk for malignancy with SGLT2 inhibitors. Furthermore, recent epidemiologic studies have revealed a positive association between the use of SGLT2 inhibitors and improved overall survival among patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)and hepatocellular carcinomawith pre-existing diabetes, irrespective of patients' demographics, tumor characteristics, and cancer treatments. Notably, a longer duration of SGLT2 inhibitor use, especially with canagliflozin, was associated with better survival. However, it is important to note that no randomized clinical trials have investigated the anticancer effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. To confirm these observations, several preclinical studies have provided evidence for potential anticancer effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on their own, particularly canagliflozin and dapagliflozin, in both experimental cell lines (Table 4) and animal models (Table 5).

Table 4
In Vitro Studies Demonstrating the Anticancer Effects of SGLT2 Inhibitors

Table 5
In Vivo Studies Demonstrating the Anticancer Effects of SGLT2 Inhibitors

These studies have consistently demonstrated the ability of SGLT2 inhibitors to impede the growth of tumors across the following cancer models: hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma, osteosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, cervical cancer, renal cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, colon cancer, and breast cancer. Importantly, in preclinical studies, the combination of SGLT2 inhibitors with other chemotherapies and ionizing radiation enhanced their efficacy and increased cancer cell responsiveness to treatments (Table 6). This combination strategy carries the potential to lower the therapeutic doses of cancer treatments, thereby ameliorating their adverse effects, particularly cardiotoxicity. Furthermore, this combined approach holds promise in attenuating cancer cell resistance to treatment.

Discussion

Overview of T2DM and cancer risk

T2DM is among the most prevalent non-communicable diseases globally, affecting approximately 828 million adults, with its incidence rising annually due to lifestyle changes. It is commonly associated with risk factors such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndrome. Effective therapeutic management is crucial to preventing disease onset, progression, and associated complications. Given the substantial global burden, timely and safe interventions that provide the greatest benefits for this patient population can significantly mitigate its impact on public health.

T2DM is inherently associated with an increase of cancer risk. Cancers of the liver, pancreas, endometrium, colon, breast, and bladder have been shown to occur more frequently in individuals with T2DM, whereas prostate cancer appears to have a lower incidence in this population. The increased cancer risk in diabetic patients is influenced by multiple factors, including hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, obesity, and oxidative stress, all of which contribute to tumor initiation and progression. Insulin, a key metabolic regulator, also exerts mitogenic effects, promoting malignant cell proliferation through both receptor and post-receptor mechanisms. Additionally, variations in metabolic control, diabetes duration, and the pharmacologic agents used for treatment may further modify cancer risk. While metformin appears to reduce cancer incidence, other glucose-lowering agents have a negligible or uncertain impact.

Mechanistic insights into SGLT2 and DPP-4 inhibitors

In this study, we have found that SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with a lower cancer incidence compared to DPP-4 inhibitors, a finding that may be explained through several mechanistic pathways. First, SGLT2 inhibitors appear to exert a protective effect by lowering circulating insulin levels; since obesity-related hyperinsulinemia acts as a potent mitogen, its reduction can diminish the stimulus for cellular proliferation and carcinogenesis. In addition, the improved glycemic control achieved with SGLT2 inhibitors mitigates hyperglycemia, a factor that has been linked to cancer progression in various malignancies, thereby potentially reducing tumor-promoting metabolic stress. Furthermore, these agents contribute to the improvement of metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions characterized by chronic inflammation, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance, all of which are recognized as contributors to cancer development. Another potential mechanism is the reduction of oxidative stress induced by hyperglycemia in T2DM, which plays a critical role in DNA damage, mutation accumulation, and cancer progression. SGLT2 inhibitors have also been reported to decrease oxidative stress by lowering glucose toxicity and improving mitochondrial function, which may further contribute to their protective effects against cancer.

CRPC treatment initiation and sequencing — decision factors — indicates that the decision to initiate therapy after disease progression on one or more treatments should be based on available high-level evidence of safety, efficacy, and/or tolerability and its application to the individual patient, and prior exposures to therapeutic agents should be considered. Data to inform the optimal sequence for delivery of these agents in patients with mCRPC is evolving, and choice of therapy is based largely on clinical considerations, including patient preferences, prior treatment, presence or absence of visceral disease, symptoms, and potential side effects.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists: established and emerging indications [^1179Pp5B]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are used in patients with type 2 diabetes as glucose lowering therapies, with additional benefits of weight loss and blood pressure reduction. Data from cardiovascular outcome trials have highlighted that these drugs confer protection against major cardiovascular disease in those with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, reduce the risk of admission to hospital for heart failure, and reduce cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Ongoing research using hard renal endpoints such as end stage kidney disease rather than surrogate markers might clarify the renoprotective benefits of both agents. When used for glucose lowering, SGLT2 inhibitors are most effective if the estimated glomerular filtration rate is more than 60 mL per min per 1.73m 2 at initiation and should be avoided where there is a risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. GLP-1 receptor agonists are contraindicated in those with a history of medullary thyroid cancer and used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis of a known cause. These drugs are now second-line, or even arguably first-line, glucose lowering therapies in patients with cardiorenal disease, irrespective of glycaemic control. If an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist is considered suitable in patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment should be prioritised according to existing evidence: GLP-1 receptor agonists should be considered in patients at a high risk of, or with established, cardiovascular disease and SGLT2 inhibitors considered for patients with heart failure (with reduced ejection fraction) or chronic kidney disease (with or without established cardiovascular disease). There is now compelling data on the benefits of these drugs for a range of other clinical indications even without type 2 diabetes, including for GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with obesity and overweight with weight-related comorbidities.

### Family history, obesity, urological factors and diabetic medications and their associations with risk of prostate cancer diagnosis in a large prospective study [^116PLj8X]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study prospectively examined the evidence for several known or suspected causative or protective factors for PC. The risk of localised and advanced PC diagnosis was elevated in men with a family history of PC, multiple first-degree family members diagnosed with PC, severe LUTS, while the risk of advanced PC was increased in men who were obese or had a vasectomy. The overall PC risk was reduced in men with dispensed records for BPH medications or metformin. All analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle and health-related factors, as well as GP visits and frequency of PSA testing, prior to PC diagnosis.

Our findings for increased risk of being diagnosed with PC in men with a family history of PC, and a 2.5-fold risk in men with multiple first-degree family members with PC, is consistent with current evidence. PC is one of the most heritable malignancies with over 170 genetic variants identified to be associated with PC, in genome-wide association studies, which together account for 28.4% of the familial relative risk (compared to ~6% accounted for by rare genetic variants). A meta-analysis of 33 epidemiological studies reported increased PC risk in men with a brother (RR = 3.14; 2.37–4.15) or father (RR = 2.35; 2.02–2.72) diagnosed with PC and this risk increased ~4-fold in men with 2 or more first-degree family members with PC (RR-4.39; 2.61–7.39). Given that family history is a combination of genetic, environmental and behavioural factors, the lower risk estimates observed in our study may in part be due to less variability in these factors due to the short follow-up period of 4–7 years since recruitment, as well as lack of information on the number of affected brothers, all of which may have biased results towards the null.

### Association between antidiabetic medications and prostate-specific antigen levels and biopsy results [^115PWxG4]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the association between the use of antidiabetic medications and levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), frequency of PSA testing and biopsy, and detection of prostate cancer among diabetic men?

Findings

This cohort study found no evidence that antidiabetic medications were associated with lower PSA levels or frequency of cancer detection on biopsy. However, rates of PSA testing and prostate biopsy were lower in men receiving antidiabetic medications (even when PSA was elevated).

Meaning

This study suggests that detection bias due to fewer biopsies for elevated PSA among men receiving antidiabetic medications may explain some of the lower risk of prostate cancer in men with diabetes.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1172tW4m]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of antidiabetic drugs.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in adults with type 2 diabetes.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from inception through April 2013 without language restrictions; regulatory authorities' reports; and gray literature.

Study Selection

Randomized trials comparing SGLT2 inhibitors with placebo or other medication for type 2 diabetes.

Data Extraction

Three reviewers extracted or checked data for study characteristics, outcomes of interest, and risk of bias, and 3 reviewers summarized strength of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

Data Synthesis

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors were compared with placebo in 45 studies (n = 11 232) and with active comparators in 13 studies (n = 5175). They had a favorable effect on hemoglobin A1c level (mean difference vs. placebo, -0.66% [95% CI, -0.73% to -0.58%]; mean difference vs. active comparators, -0.06% [CI, -0.18% to 0.05%]). Sensitivity analyses incorporating unpublished data showed similar effect estimates. Compared with other agents, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced body weight (mean difference, -1.80 kg [CI, -3.50 to -0.11 kg]) and systolic blood pressure (mean difference, -4.45 mm Hg [CI, -5.73 to -3.18 mm Hg]). Urinary and genital tract infections were more common with SGLT2 inhibitors (odds ratios, 1.42 [CI, 1.06 to 1.90] and 5.06 [CI, 3.44 to 7.45], respectively). Hypoglycemic risk was similar to that of other agents. Results for cardiovascular outcomes and death were inconclusive. An imbalance in incidence of bladder and breast cancer was noted with dapagliflozin compared with control.

Limitation

Most trials were rated as high risk of bias because of missing data and last-observation-carried-forward methods.

Conclusion

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors may improve short-term outcomes in adults with type 2 diabetes, but effects on long-term outcomes and safety are unclear.

Primary Funding Source

None.

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that SGLT2 inhibitor use may be associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes, particularly reduced mortality and heart failure hospitalization, in cancer patients with diabetes receiving cancer therapies. These findings warrant future randomized controlled trials to confirm the cardioprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in cancer patients with and without diabetes and to evaluate their safety and efficacy in specific cancer types and treatment regimens. Additionally, mechanistic studies are needed to better understand the underlying pathways through which SGLT2 inhibitors exert their cardioprotective and potential anti-tumor effects on cancer therapy-induced cardiotoxicity. As the population of cancer survivors continues to grow, identifying effective strategies to mitigate the cardiovascular complications of cancer treatment becomes increasingly important. SGLT2 inhibitors may represent a promising approach to improve cardiovascular outcomes and overall survival in this vulnerable population.

### Family history, obesity, urological factors and diabetic medications and their associations with risk of prostate cancer diagnosis in a large prospective study [^116hFV8w]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Obese men in our study had a higher relative risk of advanced PC diagnosis (HR = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.11–2.13) than localised PC (HR = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.84–1.20) (p = 0.05 for difference between HRs) and this is consistent with previous reports. We have previously reported higher PSA testing rates for obese men, but our recent study of this cohort reported lower biopsy rates but a higher likelihood of positive biopsy for obese men compared to men with a normal BMI. There is evidence that PSA levels are inversely associated with BMI, which may delay the diagnosis of PC. Also, increased PC risk may be associated with obesity in men with high-grade disease. Men classified with localised disease in our study are a heterogeneous population with low to high-risk diseases diagnosed at an early stage. This heterogeneity may have attenuated the association and biased the hazards ratio towards the null. Analysis by grade of disease was not possible.

### Comparative risk of cancer associated with SGLT inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113hxWEj]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 studies provides evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with a lower overall risk of cancer compared to DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with T2DM. The pooled effect size (effect size = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.70–0.84) suggests a significant protective effect of SGLT2 inhibitors. Subgroup analyses revealed no significant differences in the risk of bladder, breast, and pancreatic cancers between the two drug classes. However, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a significantly reduced risk of liver (effect size = 0.76), lung (effect size = 0.87), and prostate (effect size = 0.75) cancers, with a trend toward reduced risk in stomach (effect size = 0.69) and colorectal cancers (effect size = 0.80). While publication bias was detected, sensitivity analysis using the trim-and-fill method confirmed the robustness of the findings, with minimal changes in effect size. These findings may inform clinical decision-making by highlighting the potential oncologic benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors over DPP-4 inhibitors, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes at higher baseline risk for certain cancers. As such, they could support updates to treatment guidelines that emphasize long-term safety profiles alongside glycemic control when selecting second-line therapies for T2DM.

### Carcinogenicity risk assessment supports the chronic safety of dapagliflozin, an inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2, in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116TwFPW]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The studies presented here were undertaken because it is well recognized that even the most extensive clinical development programs can at best only provide safety screening signals related to human malignancies, especially for risks involving specific cancer types. Using a multitude of different approaches and at high multiples of human exposures, this comprehensive non-clinical safety program provided a substantial body of evidence suggesting no indication of tumor initiation or promotion or enhancement of tumor progression associated with selective SGLT2 inhibition in general or with dapagliflozin specifically. Therefore, these results support the finding of no overall imbalance in malignancy observed in clinical trials and add to the weight of evidence regarding the overall safety of dapagliflozin in humans.

### SGLT2 inhibition and three urological cancers: up-to-date results [^116EL4dx]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify the causal role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition on three urological cancers.

Methods

Six single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the expression level of SLC5A2, a proxy for SGLT2 inhibition, from a recent publication were extracted. Three common urological cancers, including bladder cancer, prostate cancer and kidney cancer, were analysed. The main cohort of bladder cancer was derived from UK Biobank (1279 cases and 372,016 controls). The prostate cancer cohort was from the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) consortium (79,148 cases and 61,106 controls). The kidney cancer phenotype was from the UK Biobank cohort of 463,010 individuals (1114 cases and 461,896 controls). Primary and sensitivity analysis were performed to validate the results. In vitro analysis was also incorporated to validate the Mendelian randomisation results.

Results

In primary analysis, SGLT2 inhibition was associated with reduced risk of bladder cancer (OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97–0.99) per unit lowering of HbA1c level. A protective association was also observed for prostate cancer with odds ratio = 0.31 (95% CI = 0.21–0.47). However, we did not discover a causal relationship between SGLT2 inhibition and kidney cancer (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.99–1.00). Sensitivity analysis and in vitro validation did not support the causal role of SGLT2 inhibition in increasing cancer risk.

Conclusions

We did not find any evidence that SGLT2 inhibition could increase the risk of the three cancers. Even in some analysis, SGLT2 inhibition tended to show protective effects on the three urological cancers.

### Association of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists with cancer risk in older adults with type 2 diabetes [^115roCeQ]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The real-world evidence on the association between glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and cancer risk remains limited and mixed.

Methods

In 2013–2020 national Medicare claims data, we included cancer-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We identified those who initiated GLP-1 RA, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP4i) and conducted 1:1 propensity score matching for confounding adjustment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of nine obesity-associated cancers (thyroid, pancreatic, bladder, colorectal, lung, kidney, breast, endometrial, and prostate cancer).

Results

In the matched GLP-1RA versus SGLT2i cohort (n = 21,362 pairs), GLP-1RA users had similar overall cancer risk with SGLT2i users (HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.95–1.12]), but GLP-1RAs were associated with an increased kidney cancer risk (HR, 1.43 [1.06–1.92]). In the matched GLP-1RA versus DPP4i cohort (n = 20,962 pairs), the GLP-1RA versus DPP4i comparison showed no significant difference in overall cancer risk (HR, 0.96 [0.89–1.04]) but revealed a significantly elevated endometrial cancer risk (HR, 1.55 [1.01–2.37]).

Conclusion

GLP-1RAs might be associated with an increased risk of certain cancer types. Future studies are needed to validate the potential tumorigenic risk associated with GLP1-RAs.

### PKC δ-mediated SGLT1 upregulation confers the acquired resistance of NSCLC to EGFR TKIs [^116C1qdH]. Oncogene (2021). Medium credibility.

Since SGLTs are functionally active in various cancer types, including pancreatic, prostate, and brain cancers, the use of new antidiabetic SGLT inhibitors for cancer therapy has also emerged as a possibility. Four SGLT2 inhibitors, empagliflozin (Jardiance), dapagliflozin (Forxiga), canagliflozin (Invokana), and ertugliflozin (Stelagro) have recently been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus by the US Food and Drug Administration, and are associated with beneficial effects in the cardiovascular system and the kidney. Randomized clinical trial data have not revealed any associations between treatment with these SGLT2 inhibitors and increased incidence rates of malignancies. Our data show that co-targeting SGLT1 with LX4211 (sotagliflozin) enhanced the anticancer activity of EGFR TKIs in mouse models. LX4211 is an orally-delivered dual SGLT1/2 inhibitor approved for T1DM and exhibits a 20-fold higher potency for SGLT2 over SGLT1; the involvement of SGLT2 inhibition in this synergism cannot be ruled out. Moreover, this dual inhibitor improves severe glycemic and non-glycemic outcomes without severe gastrointestinal side effects, although its associated increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus is of concern. The possibility of this event should be evaluated during clinical testing of the synergistic effects of LX4211 on the anticancer activity of EGFR TKIs.

In conclusion, our results elucidate the role of PKCδ/EGFR-dependent SGLT1 expression in the rewiring of glucose uptake and metabolism that supports the expansion of cells with acquired TKI resistance (Fig. 8). These findings indicate that SGLT1 is a potential target for avoiding acquired resistance to EGFR TKI therapy in NSCLC.

Analysis based on the type of cancer

The subgroup analysis of the comparative risk of bladder cancer between SGLT inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors included five studies published between 2022 and 2024. The overall pooled effect size was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.51–1.04, I² = 79.4%, p = 0.001), indicating no statistically significant difference in the risk of bladder cancer between the two groups (Fig. 3).

### Association between metformin use and risk of prostate cancer and its grade [^1151bd42]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Metformin is commonly prescribed to treat type 2 diabetes. Recent evidence suggests that it may possess antitumoral properties. The aim of this study was to test the association between metformin use and risk of prostate cancer and its grade among men with diabetes.

Methods

Data were obtained from population-based health-care administrative databases in Ontario, Canada. This retrospective cohort study used a nested case-control approach to examine the relationship between metformin exposure and the risk of prostate cancer within a cohort of incident diabetic men aged 66 years or older. We conducted four case-control analyses, defining case subjects as 1) any prostate cancer, 2) high-grade, 3) low-grade, and 4) biopsy-diagnosed. In each analysis, case subjects were matched to five control subjects on age and cohort entry date. Metformin exposure was determined based on prescriptions before cancer diagnosis, and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were estimated using conditional logistic regression. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

Within our cohort of 119 315 men with diabetes, there were 5306 case subjects with prostate cancer and 26 530 matched control subjects. Within the cancer case subjects, 1104 had high- grade cancer, 1719 had low-grade cancer, and 3524 had biopsy-diagnosed cancer. There was no association between metformin use and risk of any prostate cancer (aOR = 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.96 to 1.1), high-grade cancer (aOR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.96 to 1.32), low-grade cancer (aOR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.82 to 1.06), or biopsy-diagnosed cancer (aOR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.84 to 1.02).

Conclusions

This large study did not find an association between metformin use and risk of prostate cancer among older men with diabetes, regardless of cancer grade or method of diagnosis.

### The association of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors with cancer: an overview of quantitative systematic reviews [^112ujxG5]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

3.3 Site‐specific cancers

A total of 143 point estimates were reported for 11 specific types of cancers (Appendix S2: Figures S1‐S8). There were 26 point estimates from three reviews for skin cancer, 21 point estimates from four reviews were reported for bladder cancer, 21 point estimates from four reviews were reported for breast cancer, 18 point estimates from four reviews were reported for renal cancer, 15 point estimates from two reviews were reported for gastrointestinal cancer, 15 point estimates from two reviews were reported for prostate cancer, 15 point estimates from two reviews were reported for pulmonary cancer, four point estimates from one review were reported for pancreatic cancer, four point estimates from one review were reported for hepatic cancer, three point estimates from one review were reported for female genital tract cancer, and one point estimate from one review was reported for cancers 'other than bladder or breast'.

From all the point estimates reported for site‐specific cancers, seven were considered statistically significant. Two point estimates from one review indicated a significantly increased class association of bladder cancer with SGLT‐2 inhibitors (OR 3.87, 95%CI 1.48‐10.08 versus placebo and active comparators; OR 3.71, 95%CI 1.38‐9.96 vs placebo). Additionally, two point estimates from two different reviews reported a statistically significant increased association of bladder cancer with empagliflozin (OR 4.49, 95%CI 1.21‐16.73 versus placebo and active comparators; OR 7.37, 95%CI 1.28‐42.59 vs placebo). Two point estimates from one review indicated a significantly decreased association of gastrointestinal cancer with canagliflozin (OR 0.15, 95%CI 0.04‐0.60 vs placebo and active comparators; OR 0.31, 95%CI 0.11‐0.88 vs placebo). A significantly increased association of gastrointestinal cancer with empagliflozin vs canagliflozin (OR 4.01, 95%CI 1.34‐11.96) was reported by a network meta‐analysis. 10

### How representative of a general type 2 diabetes population are patients included in cardiovascular outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors? A large European observational study [^112hvjkf]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

2.2 Study population

All patients who were using glucose‐lowering drugs within the year prior to 31 December 2015 or during the last quarter of 2015 in Germany, were included (Online Supplemental Appendix 1.2).

2.2.1 Baseline data

Patient baseline data included characteristics (eg, age and sex), and comorbidities retrieved from all available data prior to and including the index date, with the exception of cancer (within 5 years prior to the index date). Prior medications were defined as any dispensed 12 months (3 months in the Netherlands) prior to and including the index date.

2.2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Adaptation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the CVOTs to the respective countries' health care data was performed by using detailed diagnostic codes, procedure codes and drug codes (Table S1a–S1d, Online Supplemental Appendix). Criteria were adapted to the codes similarly in all countries. The main difference between the included CVOTs concerns inclusion criteria; the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME 5 and VERTIS‐CV 3 trials included only patients with established CV disease, while the DECLARE‐TIMI 58 16 and CANVAS 4 trials also included patients with CV risk factors only (DECLARE‐TIMI 58, ≥ 2 and CANVAS, ≥ 3).

2.2.3 Outcome

Representativeness was determined by dividing the number of patients fulfilling the four CVOT key inclusion and exclusion criteria by the total enrolled T2D population.

2.2.4 Statistical analysis

Demographic data are presented as mean (SD) or n (%). No statistical comparisons were performed among country results. All analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, North Carolina) or R statistical software (R version 3.1.1 or 3.2.3). 17

### Comparative risk of cancer associated with SGLT inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11592KWD]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the rising global prevalence of T2DM and the chronic nature of treatment, clarifying the comparative cancer risk between SGLT2 and DPP-4 inhibitors is a public health priority. This meta-analysis aims to systematically evaluate and compare the overall and site-specific cancer risks associated with these two drug classes to inform safer, evidence-based therapeutic choices.

### SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes management: key evidence and implications for clinical practice [^116rPm5v]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Figures 1 and 2 present an overview of the NICE and SIGN treatment algorithms for blood glucose-lowering and T2DM management, respectively. Recommendations concerning SGLT2i treatments apply across the class of medicines, rather than to individual therapies or molecules.

(Abbreviations: DPP-4i dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, GLP-1 glucagon-like peptide-1, SGLT2i sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, SU sulfonylurea). Recommendations that cover DPP-4is, GLP-1 mimetics and SUs refer to these groups of drugs at a class level. a When prescribing pioglitazone, exercise particular caution if the person is at high risk of the AEs of the drug. Pioglitazone is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, bladder cancer and bone fracture. Known risk factors for these conditions, including increased age, should be carefully evaluated before treatment: see the manufacturers' summaries of product characteristics for details. MHRA guidance (2011) advises that 'prescribers should review the safety and efficacy of pioglitazone in individuals after 3–6 months of treatment to ensure that only those deriving benefit continue to be treated'. b See NICE Technology Appraisal Guidance 288 and 418, 315 and 336 on dapagliflozin, canagliflozin and empagliflozin, respectively. All three SGLT-2 inhibitors are recommended as options in dual therapy regimens with metformin under certain conditions, as options in triple therapy regimens and in combination with insulin. All three are also options as monotherapies in adults in whom metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated. Serious and life-threatening cases of DKA have been reported in people taking SGLT2is (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin) or shortly after stopping the SGLT2i. MHRA guidance (2015) advises testing for raised ketones in people with symptoms of DKA, even if plasma glucose levels are near normal. c Only continue GLP-1 mimetic therapy if the person has a beneficial metabolic response [a reduction of HbA1c by at least 11 mmol/mol (1.0%) and a weight loss of at least 3% of initial body weight in 6 months]. d If metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, repaglinide is both clinically effective and cost effective in adults with type 2 diabetes. However, discuss with any person for whom repaglinide is being considered that there is no licensed non-metformin-based combination containing repaglinide that can be offered at first intensification. e Drugs in dual therapy should be introduced in a stepwise manner, checking for tolerability and effectiveness of each drug. f MHRA guidance (2011) notes that cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, especially in individuals with risk factors for the development of cardiac failure. People should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain, and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs. g The recommendations in this guideline also apply to any current and future biosimilar product(s) of insulin glargine that have an appropriate Marketing Authorisation that allows the use of the biosimilar(s) in the same indication

### Post-authorisation safety study to assess the risk of urinary tract cancer in people with type 2 diabetes initiating empagliflozin: a multi-country European study [^1174PujS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Population

A total of 711 936 people with T2D who were new users of either empagliflozin or any DPP‐4i during the study period were eligible for inclusion in this study and made up the source populations (Table 1). After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as removing people with less than 6 months of possible follow‐up (index date less than 6 months prior to end of study date), people in both cohorts underwent PS matching separately in each country (Table S4). The most common reason for censoring within the latency period in all countries was treatment discontinuation (Table S5). Among both empagliflozin and DPP‐4i initiators in all countries, < 0.1% had a diagnosis of UTC during the latency period. Unmatched empagliflozin initiators had more severe diabetes than empagliflozin initiators with at least one match, like, 1.5–2.5 years longer duration of treated diabetes (Table S6). The balance of PS variables was re‐assessed following the aforementioned steps. Across all countries, the main analysis population cohorts were balanced for most or all included PS variables (Table S7).

TABLE 1
Study population.

The main analyses included 151 055 matched people: 18 838 empagliflozin initiators and 44 838 DPP‐4i initiators in the UK; 20 844 empagliflozin initiators and 25 682 DPP‐4i initiators in Sweden; and 15 696 empagliflozin initiators, and 25 157 DPP‐4i initiators in Finland (Table 1).

The baseline characteristics were mostly similar between empagliflozin and DPP‐4i initiators in the main analysis population across countries (Table 2). The majority of the main analysis population were female. The mean age of participants was 57–63 years across the countries. The mean duration since the start of diabetes treatment was approximately 5 years. The duration of follow‐up since the index date was comparable between the empagliflozin initiators (599–656 days) and DPP‐4i initiators (582–681 days). In the UK and Finland, empagliflozin initiators were slightly younger than DPP‐4i initiators, had used insulin prior to the index date more frequently, and had a higher body mass index (BMI). In Finland, glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was also higher among empagliflozin initiators than DPP‐4i initiators; however, BMI and HbA1c were missing for most patients.

### Comparative risk of cancer associated with SGLT inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114KcRwN]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the overall and site-specific cancer risk associated with SGLT2i versus DPP4i in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for cohort studies comparing cancer incidence in adult type 2 diabetes patients treated with SGLT2i versus DPP4i. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model due to significant heterogeneity (I²). Subgroup analyses by cancer type and publication bias assessment were performed.

Results

Seventeen cohort studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, SGLT2i use was associated with a significantly lower risk of incident cancer compared to DPP4i use (Pooled RR = 0.77, 95%CI:0.70–0.84; I² = 81.6%). Subgroup analyses revealed significantly lower risks for liver (RR = 0.76), lung (RR = 0.87), and prostate (RR = 0.75) cancers with SGLT2i. Trends towards lower risk were observed for colorectal (RR = 0.80) and stomach (RR = 0.69) cancers. No significant differences were found for bladder, breast, or pancreatic cancer risk.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with a reduced overall risk of cancer compared to DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly for liver, lung, and prostate cancers. However, these findings are based on observational data with significant heterogeneity and varying follow-up times, requiring additional long-term research to confirm.

### Update on long-term efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113f69up]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a novel class of antihyperglycaemic agents with an insulin-independent mode of action. Dapagliflozin is a member of the SGLT2 inhibitors class that has received marketing authorization in Europe and the US for use in patients with type 2 diabetes. This review summarizes current evidence from clinical trials assessing the clinical efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin, and presents data regarding its cost-effectiveness. Treatment with dapagliflozin results in similar reduction in haemoglobin A1c with other oral antihyperglycaemic drugs, which is preserved over 4 years of treatment. However, compared with most antidiabetic agents, dapagliflozin provides additional clinical benefits including body weight loss and blood pressure reduction. Moreover, treatment with dapagliflozin does not increase risk for hypoglycaemia, but is associated with increased incidence of mild to moderate urinary and genital tract infections. A pivotal outcomes trial of dapagliflozin is expected to clarify its effect on cardiovascular endpoints, whilst a causative relationship between dapagliflozin and select malignancies is unlikely. Finally, based on recent economic evaluations dapagliflozin seems to be a cost-effective option for type 2 diabetes in some settings.

### Family history, obesity, urological factors and diabetic medications and their associations with risk of prostate cancer diagnosis in a large prospective study [^113bnwK4]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

From the 267,153 participants in the 45 and Up Study, participants were excluded if they withdrew from the study after baseline (n = 268), were participants from the pilot study (n = 175), were aged below 45 years (n = 5) or were female (n = 142,929). Of the remaining 123,732 male participants, there were 107,706 eligible men for our analysis (Fig. 1). Of these, 4257 men were diagnosed with PC during the study period.

The median time between recruitment to study and PC diagnosis was 2.89 years. The median age of PC cases at recruitment was 65.9 years, 77.5% of men were born in Australia or New Zealand, 54.2% had private insurance cover, 50.9% were living in major cities and 81.8% reported being married or living with a partner (Table 1). Among PC cases, 8.2% reported having a family history of PC, had a median BMI of 26.6 kg/m 2, 49.4% reported ever having smoked cigarettes, drank a median of 7 alcoholic drinks per week and did 10 h of median physical activity per week. Prior to PC diagnosis, there were 3.2% of PC cases identified as having a dispensed record for PBS subsidised prescription for metformin, and 9.9% of cases with prescription records for BPH treatment. Participants' characteristics are summarised in Table 1. Sociodemographic and behavioural factors associated with increased risk of PC diagnosis were being born in Australia or New Zealand, and having private health cover, low income, no comorbidities, increased frequency of PSA testing and frequent visits to GP (Table 2).

### Glucuretic effects and renal safety of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113bqX1X]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin is a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor approved as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the United States, the European Union and other countries. Dapagliflozin increases renal glucose excretion in an insulin-independent manner, and its mechanism of action is complementary to those of other antidiabetes medications. When used as monotherapy or in combination with other oral antidiabetes medications or insulin, dapagliflozin improves glycemic measures in patients with T2DM. Dapagliflozin treatment is also associated with weight reduction and a decrease in blood pressure, both of which may be beneficial in patients with T2DM. Because of its mechanism of action, dapagliflozin has a low intrinsic propensity to cause hypoglycemia. Overall, dapagliflozin is well tolerated, with the frequency of most adverse events similar to that seen with placebo. Cases of genital infections and, in some studies, urinary tract infections have been more frequent in dapagliflozin-treated groups compared with placebo groups. In the clinical development program, more cases of newly diagnosed bladder cancer were reported for patients treated with dapagliflozin (0.17%) compared with placebo or comparator (0.03%). Although there were not enough cases to determine causality, dapagliflozin should not be used in patients with bladder cancer and should be used with caution in patients with a history of bladder cancer. Dapagliflozin may decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR), especially in elderly patients and patients with impaired renal function. Renal function should be monitored before initiation of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin should not be used in patients with an estimated GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). No cardiovascular safety signals have been detected for dapagliflozin, and a long-term cardiovascular outcomes study is ongoing. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that dapagliflozin is a promising new treatment option for T2DM.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113qoMDd]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Bone health in prostate cancer — duration of antiresorptive therapy and drug holidays indicates that for patients receiving antiresorptive therapy, there are currently no consensus guidelines on duration of treatment; due to concerns of long-term risks of antiresorptive therapy, a "drug holiday" at 3 to 5 years can be considered based on agent utilized, stability of bone mineral density, prior fracture history, and future fracture risk. Bone mineral density should be monitored approximately every 1 to 2 years after suspending therapy, and therapy should generally be resumed if bone mineral density declines significantly or if the patient develops a new fragility fracture.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of canagliflozin hemihydrate PO (also known as Invokana):
- **Acute pyelonephritis, urosepsis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of serious UTIs, including pyelonephritis and urosepsis.
- **Bone fracture**: use caution in patients with factors contributing to fracture risk, such as elderly age and osteoporosis.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: use caution in patients taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Consider reducing the insulin or insulin secretagogue dose.
- **Decreased serum canagliflozin levels**: use caution in patients taking concomitant UGT enzyme inducers (such as rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or ritonavir). Increase canagliflozin dose to 200 mg/day in patients currently taking 100 mg, and to 300 mg in those taking 200 mg/day.
- **Diabetic ketoacidosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibors have been associated with an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, especially in patients with pancreatic disorders, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, recent surgery, reduced insulin dose, volume depletion, or excessive alcohol use. Consider obtaining ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis as indicated. Assess for ketoacidosis in patients presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis, regardless of blood glucose levels. Withhold canagliflozin at least 3 days, if possible, before major surgery or procedures associated with prolonged fasting. Resume once clinically stable and after oral intake has resumed.
- **Fournier's gangrene**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibors have been associated with an increased risk of Fournier's gangrene.
- **Lower extremity amputation**: use extreme caution in patients with a history of prior amputation, PAD, or neuropathy. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection, new pain or tenderness, sores or ulcers involving the lower limbs. Discontinue if symptoms develop.
- **Reactivation of genital mycotic infections**: use caution in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections and in uncircumcised males.
- **Volume depletion**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of volume depletion, especially in patients with renal impairment, taking loop diuretics, or advanced age. Assess and correct volume status before initiating canagliflozin. Monitor for volume depletion throughout treatment.

Effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on cancer

As glucose is a major substrate required for cancer cell survival and growth, Scafoglio and colleagues hypothesized that the metabolism-shifting effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2Is) might be protective against malignancy as well. In this seminal investigation, functional expression of SGLT2 on human pancreatic and prostate cancers was demonstrated. In addition, this was the first study providing evidence on SGLT2Is blocking glucose uptake and reducing tumour growth in a xenograft model of pancreatic cancer, which led to the conduction of subsequent pre-clinical studies investigating the anti-cancer effects of SGLT2Is.

Considerations that may prompt use of an alternative class for SGLT2 inhibitors include severely reduced kidney function, history of prior amputation, severe peripheral arterial disease, active diabetic foot ulcers (caution with canagliflozin), recurrent genital candidiasis, diabetic ketoacidosis, fracture (caution with canagliflozin), and if the patient is considering pregnancy or breast feeding; for GLP-1RAs, considerations include persistent nausea despite appropriate dietary education and low doses, gastroparesis, active gallbladder disease, history of MEN2 or medullary thyroid cancer, history of proliferative retinopathy (caution with semaglutide or dulaglutide), and if the patient is considering pregnancy or breast feeding. Renal function notes specify that eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² is a caution for glycemic efficacy, the FDA label for canagliflozin allows use to an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m² in DKD, and to use clinical judgement when initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor if an ACE inhibitor or ARB is being started or up-titrated and renal function is impaired.

### The association of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors with cancer: an overview of quantitative systematic reviews [^116avcZC]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

SGLT‐2 inhibitors do not appear to be associated with an overall increased risk of cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Point estimates reported for class effects of SGLT‐2 inhibitors on the risk of any cancer event, as well as specific cancer subtypes, showed no significant association with the use of these agents. This held true regardless of whether SGLT‐2 inhibitor interventions were compared with placebo or active comparators. However, practicing clinicians do not prescribe by class, but rather by individual SGLT‐2 inhibitor agents for antihyperglycaemic management. Considering popular SGLT‐2 inhibitor agents used globally (ie canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin), most cancer‐related data collected for these individual agents also indicated there were no significant associations between their use and overall risk of any cancer event. Some individual point estimates from included reviews, specifically for canagliflozin and empagliflozin, reported a statistically significant decreased risk of gastric cancer and increased risk of bladder cancers for users of these agents, respectively. 10, 13

There are several potential reasons that could account for the statistically significant associations observed between empagliflozin use and bladder cancer. First, detection bias is a plausible explanation for this increased risk. 22 SGLT‐2 inhibitors may increase the risk of genital tract infections secondary to their mechanism of action 23, 24, 25; however, investigation into these infections (eg urinalysis) may prompt further diagnostic workup and eventual diagnosis of bladder cancers that were present before initiation of SGLT‐2 inhibitor therapy. Second, cautious interpretation is warranted as the observed association is driven by the imbalance between empagliflozin and comparator users in a very lower numbers of events. In fact, there were zero events in each comparator group for the reported significant point estimates. Third, bladder cancer pathogenesis follows an insidious course over several years for most cases, and follow‐up beyond one year was rare in both randomized and nonrandomized studies assessed in our included systematic reviews. One quantitative systematic review excluded studies that had participant follow‐up of less than one year. This review accounted for 48 cases of bladder cancer in 28 055 participants treated with SGLT‐2 inhibitors, compared to 58 cases of bladder cancer in 20 594 participants treated with placebo or active comparators. 13 Lastly, it is possible that prolonged bladder irritation due to recurrent or chronic urinary tract infections increases the risk of bladder cancer; however, the current evidence is unreliable and does not demonstrate a causal association between empagliflozin and an increased risk of bladder cancer.

2 METHODS

The current study was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis: the PRISMA Statement. 14 This study is exempted from IRB approval and contains no patient‐level data.

2.1 Search strategy

A systematic search was performed of PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and Web of Science and the clinical trial registry maintained at clinicaltrials.gov from 1966 to September 2018 with the terms: pioglitazone or actos AND gliflozin or sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor or empagliflozin or dapagliflozin or canagliflozin or ipragliflozin or tofogliflozin or remogliflozin AND glucose or Hba1c or blood pressure or mortality or death or heart failure or cancer or infection or hypoglycaemia or oedema or weight or side effect. We restricted the search to studies in humans and clinical trials. There was no language restriction. We retrieved further information by a manual search of references from recent reviews and relevant published original studies. Two investigators (HWL and ML) independently conducted the literature search, screen of abstracts and selection of included trials.

2.2 Study selection and data abstraction

We selected studies using the following entry criteria: (a) the study was randomized controlled trial; (b) patients had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus; (c) the comparison treatment was SGLT‐2 inhibitor plus pioglitazone (active group) vs pioglitazone (control group); (d) reported at least one measure of the following: mean and standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE) were reported for change from baseline in HbA1c, fasting glucose, and body weight, in active and control groups; (e) intended follow‐up of at least 24 weeks for all participants. All data from eligible studies were abstracted by two independent investigators (HWL and ML) according to standard protocol. Discrepancies were resolved by joint discussion. Recorded data variables were trial name, year of publication, study area, treatment regimens and daily dose for each group, mean age, number of participants, number of events/participants in certain end‐points (eg, people who achieved Hba1c < 7.0, hypoglycaemia, death, heart failure, urinary tract infection, genital tract infection), percentage of women, duration of follow‐up and mean and SD or SE of the interested variables or event of each groups.

### Assessment of glycemic susceptibility across multiple urological and reproductive disorders [^116S1MkT]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
The mediating effects of type II diabetes on urological outcomes

The relationship between diabetes and cancer has been debated over the years. However, nearly all studies were based on cohort study design, which could not totally avoid confounder bias. It is now generally considered diabetes promotes tumorigenesis in a majority of organs, including the stomach, pancreas, liver, kidney, bladder, breast, endometrium, colorectal, head and neck. However, an inverse association between diabetes and prostate cancer was observed. We conducted such an MR study to prove the causal associations between glycemic traits and three urological cancers. Although several significant associations were observed, the results were not so stable that validated glycemic susceptibility could not be established in the three urological cancers. An unexpected positive relationship was found between type II diabetes and prostate cancer, although the results were not so robust and the actual causality should be doubted. Despite conventional epidemiology studies confirming the increased risk of kidney cancer in different diabetic populations, we did not find such shreds of evidence from the point of genetic epidemiology, and even an unstable negative relationship was discovered. Hence, the association should be interpreted cautiously.

Recently, a renowned clinical research has been published to illustrate the role of one type of anti-diabetic medication, SGLT2 inhibitors, in tumorigenesis of bladder cancer. The study concluded that the medication did not increase the risk of bladder cancer. We might need to think about that in another way. Since several anti-diabetic medications reported the occurrence of bladder cancer, we should ponder on the relevance between glycemic metabolism and bladder cancer. Maybe the influence of glycemic metabolism could induce bladder tumorigenesis and there might exist a genetic association between the two entities. Recently, a large cohort study from UK Biobank implied diabetes and higher HbA1c levels were associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. However, in our study, we could not find a robust association between glycemic traits and bladder cancer. Only a weak causal association was found in the UK Biobank cohort (Fig. 2 and Table S7). The phenomena reminded us that there might exist potential confounders impacting glycemic metabolism and bladder cancer. We were not sure that a causal association could be confirmed.

### Post-authorisation safety study to assess the risk of urinary tract cancer in people with type 2 diabetes initiating empagliflozin: a multi-country European study [^113BmB4F]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

A meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials observed no difference in the risk of bladder cancer and of any other type of cancer among people treated with empagliflozin or any other SGLT2i, compared with placebo or other drugs used in second‐line treatment. Further, an overview of quantitative systematic reviews did not find an increased risk of any cancer event versus placebo and active comparators among people treated with any SGLT2i.

Analyses with respect to secondary exposure definitions showed similar findings across the different definitions (cumulative dosage of empagliflozin or cumulative exposure duration of empagliflozin). No increase in the risk of UTC with increased exposures supports the conclusion from the main analyses of a lack of evidence regarding an increased risk of any UTC. Bladder cancer rates comparable with the current study were observed in empagliflozin and placebo groups in the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial for cumulative or any category daily dosage of empagliflozin.

### The association of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors with cancer: an overview of quantitative systematic reviews [^112ovtEX]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT‐2) inhibitors are a novel class of antihyperglycaemic agents used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These agents inhibit the SGLT‐2 protein expressed in the proximal tubule within the kidney, which is responsible for the renal reabsorption of glucose. 1 Inhibition of these transporters facilitates blood glucose reduction via urinary excretion of glucose. 1 There are a wide variety of benefits associated with SGLT‐2 inhibitor use in type 2 diabetes, including significant reduction in haemoglobin A1C, reduction in major cardiovascular adverse events (MACE) and significant reduction in the risk of end‐stage kidney disease compared to placebo. 2, 3, 4 Due to these demonstrated benefits, the utilization of SGLT‐2 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus has rapidly increased since market approval. 5 However, these agents have undergone unprecedented postmarketing investigations given the FDA requirements to demonstrate cardiovascular safety of new antihyperglycaemic agents. Despite elusive mechanisms, cancer risk associated with SGLT‐2 inhibitors has been reported in several quantitative systematic reviews. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

There are signals in the literature that SGLT‐2 inhibitors may affect cancer risk. It has been postulated that SGLT‐2 inhibitors may activate medullary thyroid tumour growth in both rats and male mice; however, the relevance of this information in humans is not known. 14, 15 Furthermore, in 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) observed discrepancies in the risk of bladder and breast cancers with dapagliflozin versus comparators. 16 Regulatory concerns were also raised due to an imbalance of lung cancer and melanoma observed with empagliflozin use. 17 In contrast, canagliflozin has been associated with a decreased risk of stomach cancer. 10 SGLT‐1 has been implicated in cancer cell survival via glucose uptake; therefore, canagliflozin's inhibition of both SGLT‐1 and SGLT‐2 receptors has been proposed for this agent's purported protective effect. 18

### Family history, obesity, urological factors and diabetic medications and their associations with risk of prostate cancer diagnosis in a large prospective study [^115JfEy2]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Since the early 1990s, PSA testing in Australia increased substantially with corresponding increases in the diagnosis of localised cancers and a fall in the rate of advanced cancers. Increased PSA testing has been documented in higher socio-economic status groups and in those with 'healthier' behaviours. Therefore, adjusting for PSA testing behaviour is important in understanding the risk factors in localised (more likely to be screen-detected) and advanced cancers separately. Our findings show a range of established and emerging factors were associated with the risk of a diagnosis of localised and advanced PC, after adjusting for participants' history of PSA testing. Further research is required to determine the association of these risk factors in the diagnosis of clinically significant PC.

### Association between antidiabetic medications and prostate-specific antigen levels and biopsy results [^113j6ftD]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Diabetic men appear to have a lower risk of prostate cancer. Whether antidiabetic medications are protective or potentially mask prostate cancer by lowering prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is unclear.

Objective

To examine the associations of antidiabetic medication use with (1) PSA levels, (2) frequency of PSA testing, (3) receipt of biopsy following elevated PSA results, and (4) prostate cancer detection at biopsy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Population-based cohort study using data from the Stockholm PSA and Biopsy Register. Participants were all prostate cancer-free men aged 40 to 79 years residing in Stockholm County, Sweden, between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2015. Data were analyzed from November 2018 to March 2019.

Exposures

One or more prescription for metformin, sulfonylurea, or insulin, as recorded in Sweden's National Prescribed Drug Register.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Levels of PSA following first exposure to antidiabetic medications were assessed using multivariable linear regression. Frequency of PSA testing was assessed via multivariable Poisson regression. Biopsy following elevated PSA (≥ 3.0 ng/mL) and prostate cancer detection at biopsy were assessed via multivariable logistic regression.

Results

The cohort of 564 666 men (median [range] age, 65 [40–79] years) consisted of 4583 men initially exposed to metformin, 1104 exposed to sulfonylurea, and 978 exposed to insulin who were age matched with unexposed men (1:5). Exposed men had lower median (interquartile range) PSA levels before starting antidiabetic medications compared with unexposed men (1.2 [0.7–2.5] vs 1.6 [0.8–3.2] ng/mL). After accounting for baseline differences, PSA levels did not vary from those of unexposed men following exposure to antidiabetic medications. Frequency of PSA testing was higher for those receiving metformin (rate ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.06–1.09) and sulfonylurea (rate ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03–1.08) but was lower for those receiving insulin (rate ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.77–0.81). Likelihood of biopsy after elevated PSA was lower among men receiving metformin (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96) and insulin (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74–0.93). There were no differences in prostate cancer detection at biopsy, regardless of PSA levels that triggered the biopsy.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study's findings do not support the hypothesis that the inverse association between diabetes and prostate cancer is mediated through antidiabetic medications lowering PSA levels to mask prostate cancer. They do suggest potential detection bias due to fewer biopsies among men receiving antidiabetic medications, which may explain the lower prostate cancer risk in men with diabetes.

### The association of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors with cancer: an overview of quantitative systematic reviews [^1152b1jJ]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, there have been several systematic reviews and meta‐analyses reporting on cancer risk associated with SGLT‐2 inhibitor use. A combination of low cancer event rates, poor diagnostic consistency and short follow‐up times of studies included in quantitative reviews assessing cancer risk in SGLT‐2 inhibitor users thus far have made it difficult for clinicians to draw confident conclusions on potentially relevant implications of this data in practice. Given these limitations as well as variance in the methodological rigour of published quantitative systematic reviews, there is a need to critically review, evaluate and summarize these studies. Therefore, we conducted an overview of reviews, adapted from Cochrane Overviews, which serves to effectively accomplish this task. 19 An overview of reviews provides clinicians, policymakers and clinical guideline developers with a summary of the available evidence for a topic of interest. We aimed to summarize evidence from and assess the quality of published quantitative systematic reviews evaluating the cancer risk associated with SGLT‐2 inhibitor use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are a revolutionary treatment for obesity, and investigations into other uses of these agents are ongoing. Epidemiologic data suggest that prostate cancer risk may decrease following GLP-1 receptor agonist initiation. To better define the potential role of GLP-1 receptor agonist use among men with prostate cancer, we will define changes that occur in men with prostate cancer following lifestyle intervention; illuminate the current relationship between these interventions and prostate cancer risk; and explore the potential mechanism of action on tumor biology, providing rationale for evaluating its effects on prostate cancer in a planned clinical trial.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115o2419]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus with heart failure — SGLT-2 inhibitors to prevent hospitalization: For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure, we recommend a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor to prevent hospital admissions for heart failure. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation, categorized it as Reviewed, New-added, stated that the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was high, and found that the benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors in reducing hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) for patients with T2DM and HF outweighed the potential harm. Guideline-directed medical therapy includes SGLT-2 inhibitors as part of an initial "four pillar" approach for patients with heart failure along with angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors, beta blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and adding an SGLT-2 inhibitor to a regimen in a patient already achieving glycemic goals might require de-escalation of other medications to limit the risk of hypoglycemia. Evidence cited notes empagliflozin has been shown effective in patients with reduced and preserved ejection fraction and that dapagliflozin similarly reduced the rate of heart failure outcomes, while some systematic reviews suggest that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) might also reduce HHF but the overall impact on HHF is likely minimal without albiglutide, which is no longer marketed in the U.S. Implementation should consider patient factors and tolerability described here, including urinary frequency (especially with coexisting bladder or prostate conditions), a history of recurrent or severe genitourinary infections, and in older patients on other antihypertensives or diuretics or those with systolic heart failure the possibility of symptomatic hypotension or volume depletion that might require de-escalation or discontinuation of therapy.

### Family history, obesity, urological factors and diabetic medications and their associations with risk of prostate cancer diagnosis in a large prospective study [^112bbSWe]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

The study sample comprises approximately 10% of the total population of NSW aged 45 and above and, consistent with most cohort studies, has a relatively modest response rate of 18%. However, the associations quantified here are based on internal comparisons and previous methodological work reported that such comparisons are valid even though the cohort is not fully representative of the target population. Research study participants as a group are healthier than the general population and may be more engaged in testing and screening behaviours than the general population, increasing the potential risk of diagnostic bias. Adjustments for PSA testing by previous studies have compared risk in the pre- and post-PSA testing eras, adjusted for baseline PSA levels, or adjusted for self-reported PSA testing from information collected at baseline. Our ability to adjust for the rate of PSA testing, GP visits and other health comorbidities in the period prior to PC diagnosis (or censoring) for each participant through administrative record linkage, allowed us to minimise the risk of confounding related to differential levels of medical surveillance, is a strength. Joint Cox regression analysis was used to examine the association between each risk factor and the time to diagnosis for each stage of PC. This may have minimised the risk of error measurements in the time-dependent variables, which in this case is the spread of disease. Linkage with PBS data allowed us to derive information on dispensing of medications for diabetes and BPH, in the period prior to PC diagnosis (or censoring) for each participant. A limitation is that PBS data were only available since 2002 and therefore analysis for the duration of use was not possible. Furthermore, PBS data before 2012 used in this study, do not include data for medicines costing below the general beneficiary co-payment and so information for these medications for non-concessional patients may be missing. However, a validation study by Comino et al showed that the use of reimbursement records for diabetes prescriptions for 2002–2004 had a positive predictive value of ~85% for study participants who reported having diabetes in the baseline questionnaire, and this suggests that the effect of underestimation may be minimal. Our classification of localised PC cases does not separate those with clinically significant disease from those with low risk or indolent cancers due to a lack of information on clinical pathology, and this is a limitation.

2.4 Data extraction

One reviewer (RP, KN, WA, YL, NM, JMG) extracted relevant review‐level data from the eligible quantitative systematic reviews and recorded it on a standardized Google Form developed for the present overview. Information was extracted from each included quantitative systematic review on bibliographic details, research question(s)/objective(s), search strategies, number of included studies, interventions and comparisons evaluated, outcomes reported and methods of analysis used. Two reviewers (RP, KN, WA, YL, NM) extracted all pooled and single study estimates from each included review, and verification of all estimates was completed through consensus. We extracted pooled estimates calculated from traditional pairwise meta‐analytical techniques, as well as indirect and mixed treatment point estimates from network meta‐analytical techniques.

2.5 Quality assessment

Two independent reviewers assessed the quality of included systematic reviews using the 'A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews 2' (AMSTAR 2) checklist. 21 AMSTAR 2 is a validated tool consisting of 16 domains that assess the methodological quality of systematic reviews containing both randomized and nonrandomized studies of interventions. All discordant AMSTAR 2 quality ratings between reviewers were resolved by consensus. Consistent with AMSTAR 2 published literature, systematic reviews having more than one critical flaw were rated as critically low quality, one critical flaw as low quality, more than one noncritical weakness as moderate quality and no or one noncritical weakness as high quality.

We conducted a descriptive analysis of our results by summarizing the bibliographic characteristics of included quantitative systematic reviews, as well as by summarizing the point estimates for each adverse outcome assessed. We tabulated the number of systematic reviews and number of pooled estimates of treatment effect for all placebo and active treatment comparisons for SGLT‐2 inhibitors as a class, as well as individual SGLT‐2 inhibitors used commonly worldwide (ie canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin). We used forest plots to report pooled point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from included systematic reviews for all cancer outcomes. Furthermore, we plotted pooled estimates from reviews according to individual SGLT‐2 inhibitor agents, as well as concomitant treatment with background antihyperglycaemic agents.

### Risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor and / or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor: a nationwide study [^1111a9eK]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Diabetes itself is associated with a substantially higher risk of cancer, with relative risks ranging from 1.2 to 2.5 for different cancer sites except for prostate. Pancreatic cancer is up to 7.61 times higher than in patients without diabetes. We have found a 25% lower hazard of cancer in the SLGT2i 'clean' versus the DPP-4i 'clean' cohort. There are conflicting results on the prevalence of cancer in patients treated with glucose-lowering compounds. Initially, both GLP-1 RA and DPP-4i were suspected to lead to an increased risk of pancreatic and thyroid cancer; however, today, these concerns have been resolved. Some studies refer to a possible increase in cancer using SGLT2i, mainly bladder cancer, while others suggest a protective effect, for example in case of canagliflozin and gastrointestinal tract cancer. Incidence of cancer was not reported for empagliflozinand was not altered by canagliflozinin CVOTs. The overall rate was not different in dapagliflozin-treated patients, except for a 43% lower prevalence of bladder cancer. In our study, the additive use of SGLT2i and DPP-4i (in the SGLT2i 'add-on' group) was not significantly associated with a lower risk of cancer as compared with those patients who stopped taking DPP-4i after initiation of an SGLT2i. The follow-up of patients was in line with or even longer than previous landmark RCT studies in the field of diabetes (SAVOR-TIMI, 2.1; EXAMINE, 1.5; TECOS, 3; CARMELINA, 2.2; EMPA-REG, 3.1; CANVAS, 2.4; DECLARE-TIMI, 4.2; EMPEROR-REDUCED, 1.33; DAPA-HF, 1.5; ELIXA, 2.1; LEADER, 3.8; SUSTAIN-6, 2.1; EXCEL, 3.2; HARMONY, 1.6). Especially in the case of RWE studies (CVD-REAL, approximately 0.9; CVD-REAL Nordic, 0.95 years), the follow-up time was short, generally less than 1–1.5 years. The risk of cancer was evaluated as a safety measure in many of these studies. Altogether, the 3-year observational period has already provided data showing a striking difference in mortality between the groups investigated.

### The association of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors with cancer: an overview of quantitative systematic reviews [^117GDbCk]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Additionally, evidence from a 2017 meta‐analysis by Tang et al suggested a statistically significant decreased risk of gastrointestinal cancer in canagliflozin users. 10 As noted previously, these results should be interpreted with caution, as short follow‐up times of included randomized controlled trials and low event rates preclude evaluation of long‐term gastrointestinal cancer risk in participants using canagliflozin. Furthermore, this association was not evident from a meta‐analysis conducted by Dicembrini et al in 2019. 13

Although several quantitative systematic reviews have been published assessing cancer‐related events as primary and secondary outcomes in SGLT‐2 inhibitor users, the methodological rigour of these studies appears to be inconsistent. Half of the included quantitative systematic reviews were considered to be of 'critically low quality' according to AMSTAR 2 assessment. Since systematic reviews are considered to be at the top of the scientific evidence pyramid, it is crucial that the methods undertaken to complete these reviews are transparent and replicable. 26 However, this does not necessarily mean that the point estimates reported within reviews deemed 'low quality' by AMSTAR 2 rating are sourced from low quality evidence. The quality of evidence contained within the included reviews was generally high (ie evidence from randomized controlled trials and government regulatory reports). It is important to remember that the AMSTAR 2 tool is used to measure the methodological quality of systematic reviews, not to assess the quality of evidence contained within the review.

Our review provides clinicians with a comprehensive summary that highlights important limitations of assessing SGLT‐2 inhibitor‐associated cancer risk using quantitative systematic reviews. Despite using established methods (eg published protocol, comprehensive search strategy, screening and quality assessment performed by at least 2 independent reviewers), our overview also has some limitations. We did not meta‐analyse the point estimates gathered from included reviews as this was beyond the scope of this study. Additionally, our unit of analysis was at the review level. Furthermore, with the large volume of reviews that have been published on SGLT‐2 inhibitor safety, it is possible that additional studies and reviews assessing cancer risk in our population of interest are currently under consideration for publication. A potential resolution to prevent evidence from individual systematic reviews from becoming quickly outdated is to develop a 'living systematic review' that has been described by the Cochrane community. 27 With an updated literature search that is ideally conducted once monthly, living systematic reviews are continually updated with the most current evidence as it becomes available.

### Family history, obesity, urological factors and diabetic medications and their associations with risk of prostate cancer diagnosis in a large prospective study [^113HHvq2]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Metformin, commonly used as first-line therapy for diabetes which is the fastest growing chronic condition in Australia, may have a role in PC prevention due to its glucose-lowering and anti-proliferative properties. Diabetics have reduced PSA levels and given that biopsies are conducted in response to elevated PSA levels, this may delay PC diagnosis in diabetics and consequently lead to a diagnosis of more advanced disease However our results showed that the risk of localised as well as advanced PC diagnosis was reduced in men with prescription records for metformin. There is uncertainty in the evidence for an association between metformin and PC risk, and some of these inconsistencies may partly be due to the selection of study populations. The Finnish Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer showed that the risk of incident PC was lower in anti-diabetic drug users versus non-users (0.81; 0.61–0.95); however, sub-group analyses within diabetics, showed no association with PC incidence. 'Non-users' of metformin, which is the reference group used in these studies, in a general population is a group that is generally free of diabetes, whereas 'non-users' in a diabetic population is a group that is diagnosed with diabetes but have chosen not to take medication. As such the effect in 'users' compared to 'non-users' in diabetics may be attenuated compared to that in the general population. Analyses restricted to diabetics are consistent with that reported by most studies which may have biased results towards null. Various in vitro and clinical studies have associated elevated circulating insulin levels with tumour growth and increased cell proliferation. Metformin has the capacity to reduce tumour proliferation in a multitude of mechanisms that include reducing circulating insulin and glucose levels as well as regulating the expression of various cell signalling pathways involved in the regulation of insulin and glucose metabolism. One small clinical trial of metformin in PC cases showed that metformin distributed to human prostate tissue, suggesting that metformin could exert its effects directly on tissue targets. There are a few randomised clinical trials currently underway that will determine the potential chemoprevention properties of metformin for PC.

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and cancer: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116vnsoT]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

The aim of this meta-analysis of randomized trials was to assess the effects of SGLT-2i on the overall incidence of malignancies and on different types of cancer, summerizing the results of trials with a duration of at least 1year. This was done in light of the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) that has been highlighted by some studies, showing an increased incidence of bladder cancer, particularly with use of empagliflozin.

Materials and Methods

A Medline and Embase search for "Canaglifozin", "Dapaglifozin", "Empaglifozin", "Ertuglifozin", "Ipraglifozin", Tofoglifozin" or "Luseoglifozin" was performed, identifying randomized trials with a duration of more than 52weeks up to 1 December 2018 that compared SGLT-2is with placebo or active comparators. The outcomes considered were all types of cancer and several site-specific cancers (ie, breast, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, pancreatic, skin, prostate and bladder). Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios with 95% Confidence Intervals (MH-OR, 95% CI) were calculated for all outcomes.

Results

A total of 27 trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Retrieved trials had enrolled 27744 and 20441 patients in SGLT-2 inhibitor and comparator groups, respectively. No difference was observed in the incidence of all malignancies between patients allocated to SGLT-2i and comparators (MH-OR 0.98[0.77–1.24]). The incidence of bladder cancer, and of any other type of cancer, was not significantly increased by treatment with any SGLT-2i.

Conclusions

Available data from randomized trials do not suggest a detrimental effect of SGLT-2is on the incidence of malignancies in general, or in bladder cancer in particular.

### Comparative risk of cancer associated with SGLT inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115hbVba]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, also known as gliflozins, are a class of oral antidiabetic drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The most widely used agents from this category are Empagliflozin, Canagliflozin, and Dapagliflozin. SGLT-2 inhibitors received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) back in 2013. Beyond their glucose-lowering effects, SGLT2 inhibitors offer additional benefits, including weight loss, blood pressure management, and cardiovascular and renal protection even in non-diabetic patients.

Dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, known as gliptins, constitute a new class of oral antidiabetic agents. Such medications include Sitagliptin, Saxagliptin, and Linagliptin. DPP-4 inhibitors work by blocking DPP-4, preventing degradation of incretins, allowing for increased levels of active incretins in response to a meal and therefore enhanced insulin secretion and decreased glucagon secretion. This glucose-dependent mechanism lowers blood sugar with a low risk of hypoglycemia. They also show cardiovascular safety, though their renal benefits are not as strong as those observed with SGLT2 inhibitors. DPP-4 inhibitors, which were approved by the FDA in the mid-2000s, are now an important addition to the options available to manage type 2 diabetes, especially in patients who may not tolerate other therapies well.

While both SGLT-2 inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors are effective in managing blood glucose levels, their long-term safety profiles, particularly concerning cancer risk, have received significant attention. Preclinical and mechanistic studies suggest that SGLT-2 inhibitors may exert protective effects against cancer by reducing hyperglycemia, lowering insulin levels, and improving metabolic parameters, which could theoretically mitigate cancer risk. In contrast, DPP-4 inhibitors, which modulate incretin hormones and immune responses, have raised concerns due to their potential to promote tumor growth and angiogenesis, particularly in preclinical models. However, clinical evidence remains inconclusive, with some studies reporting no significant increase in overall cancer risk associated with either drug class, while others suggest potential site-specific risks, such as bladder cancer with SGLT-2 inhibitors or pancreatic cancer with DPP-4 inhibitors. These discrepancies highlight the need for a comprehensive synthesis of existing data to clarify the comparative cancer risks associated with these medications.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^115kAGDZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in older adults — SGLT2 inhibitors reduce HbA1c by ~0.8%, can reduce weight, and do not cause hypoglycemia; empagliflozin and canagliflozin have been shown to decrease major adverse cardiovascular events, heart failure, and the progression of CKD; these compounds cause an obligate increase in urine volume and an increase in urogenital candida infections, and because adverse effects related to volume depletion were more frequent in older patients treated with canagliflozin, recommendations limit the dosage to 100 mg/d in such patients.

### Association of SGLT2 inhibitor initiation and PSA response in prostate cancer [^112YnzFf]. The Prostate (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-castrating therapies are an unmet clinical need for patients with advanced prostate cancer. To maximize quality of life and prioritize cardiovascular health, we investigated SGLT2 inhibitors as a non-castrating therapy in patients with prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with either local or biochemically recurrent prostate cancer who initiated therapy with an SGLT2 inhibitor without concurrent androgen deprivation therapy. The primary endpoint was an estimated PSA 50 response rate. A secondary endpoint was PSA any response rate.

Results

A total of nine patients (median age 63 years old; 44.4% Black; median PSA 3.7; 33.3% localized, 66.7% biochemically recurrent) were included. The PSA 50 and PSA any response rate were 22.2% (N = 2/9) and 44.4% (N = 4/9), respectively.

Conclusions

Patients with localized or biochemically recurrent prostate cancer achieved PSA responses to SGLT2 inhibitors. These findings justify prospective studies in patients with prostate cancer.

Each plot includes individual study effect sizes with corresponding confidence intervals and study weights. The diamond at the bottom of each plot represents the overall pooled effect size, summarizing the association between SGLT2 inhibitor use and the risk of each cancer type

Publication bias

The publication bias assessment for the study was conducted using a funnel plot and Egger's test (Fig. 5). The initial funnel plot showed slight asymmetry, suggesting potential publication bias, as smaller studies with null or negative results appeared to be missing. Egger's test confirmed this asymmetry with a statistically significant result (p = 0.001), indicating the presence of publication bias. To address this potential bias, we applied the trim-and-fill method, which imputed one study to adjust for the observed asymmetry (Fig. 5). After adjustment, the overall effect size changed slightly from 0.727 (95% CI: 0.631–0.837) to 0.737 (95% CI: 0.639–0.850). While the trim-and-fill analysis suggests that publication bias may have influenced the results, the robustness of the overall findings was maintained, as the effect size remained consistent and statistically significant.

### Family history, obesity, urological factors and diabetic medications and their associations with risk of prostate cancer diagnosis in a large prospective study [^1171RHkH]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Prostate cancer (PC) aetiology is unclear. PC risk was examined in relation to several factors in a large population-based prospective study.

Methods

Male participants were from Sax Institute's 45 and Up Study (Australia) recruited between 2006 and 2009. Questionnaire and linked administrative health data from the Centre for Health Record Linkage and Services Australia were used to identify incident PC, healthcare utilisations, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) testing reimbursements and dispensing of metformin and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) prescriptions. Multivariable Cox and Joint Cox regression analyses were used to examine associations by cancer spread, adjusting for various confounders.

Results

Of 107,706 eligible men, 4257 developed incident PC up to end 2013. Risk of PC diagnosis increased with: PC family history (versus no family history of cancer; HR adjusted = 1.36; 95% CI:1.21–1.52); father and brother(s) diagnosed with PC (versus cancer-free family history; HR adjusted = 2.20; 95% CI:1.61–2.99); severe lower-urinary-tract symptoms (versus mild; HR adjusted = 1.77; 95% CI:1.53–2.04) and vasectomy (versus none; HR adjusted = 1.08; 95% CI:1.00–1.16). PC risk decreased with dispensed prescriptions (versus none) for BPH (HR adjusted = 0.76; 95% CI:0.69–0.85) and metformin (HR adjusted = 0.57; 95% CI:0.48–0.68). Advanced PC risk increased with vasectomy (HR adjusted = 1.28; 95% CI:1.06–1.55) and being obese (versus normal weight; HR adjusted = 1.31; 95% CI:1.01–1.69).

Conclusion

Vasectomy and obesity are associated with an increased risk of advanced PC. The reduced risk of localised and advanced PC associated with BPH, and diabetes prescriptions warrants investigation.

### Interpreting adverse signals in diabetes drug development programs [^111NWPTV]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Another cancer question has been raised for the sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin, which was recently approved in Europe and Australia. Although there was no evidence of mutagenicity or carcinogenicity in preclinical trials and no overall imbalance in malignancies during the development program, there were increases in breast, prostate, and bladder cancers. Given the weight loss associated with this agent, the detection bias discussed for orlistat may apply, and the prostate cancers (mostly well advanced) were generally discovered early in the trials when scrutiny of urinary phenomena brought to attention hematuria and urination difficulties. A history of hematuria recently before or at randomization was recorded for 7 of 10 cases of bladder cancer; these cancers were mostly detected too early and were too advanced to have originated after treatment with dapagliflozin. Whether persistently high glucose in the urine could promote growth of preexisting tumors is not entirely excluded, but extensive preclinical studies have not shown a signal, and patients with familial renal glucosuria do not appear to experience detrimental effects of lifelong glucosuria.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1134xKnG]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2026 Prostate Cancer — QT interval, monitoring, and cardiometabolic screening during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT): ADT may also prolong the QT/QTc interval, and providers should consider whether the benefits of ADT outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, or concomitant drugs known to prolong the QT interval; electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected, and periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes should be considered. Based on adverse metabolic effects and associations with higher incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, screening for and intervention to prevent/treat diabetes and cardiovascular disease are recommended for patients receiving ADT, while whether strategies for these activities should differ from those of the general population remains uncertain.

### Metformin for patients with metastatic prostate cancer starting androgen deprivation therapy: a randomised phase 3 trial of the STAMPEDE platform protocol [^116JS2mr]. The Lancet: Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Metformin is a widely used anti-diabetic drug. Several studies have suggested that metformin has anticancer activity in some malignancies, including prostate cancer. Metformin might also mitigate the adverse metabolic effects of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). We hypothesised that metformin might improve survival in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and reduce metabolic complications associated with ADT.

Methods

The STAMPEDE multi-arm, multi-stage, randomised phase 3 trial recruited patients with high-risk locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate staged by conventional imaging with isotope bone and CT scanning. This publication reports findings for the most recent STAMPEDE research question, testing the addition of metformin to standard of care for non-diabetic (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] < 48 mmol/mol [equivalent to < 6.5%]) patients with metastatic disease with adequate renal function (glomerular filtration rate ≥ 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2) and WHO performance status 0–2. This trial recruited from 112 hospitals in the UK and Switzerland to the STAMPEDE protocol. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to standard of care or standard of care plus metformin 850 mg twice daily. Random assignment was by telephone using minimisation with a random element of 20% (developed and maintained by the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL), stratified for randomising hospital, age (< 70 years vs ≥ 70 years), WHO performance status (0 vs 1 or 2), type of ADT, regular long-term use of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; yes vs no), pelvic nodal status (positive vs negative), planned radiotherapy (yes vs no), and planned docetaxel or androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) use (docetaxel vs abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide vs none). Standard of care comprised ADT with or without radiotherapy and with or without docetaxel or ARPI. The primary outcome measure was overall survival, defined as the time to death from any cause, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in patients who started treatment. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00268476 and ISRCTN, ISRCTN78818544.

Findings

Between Sep 5, 2016, and Mar 31, 2023, 1874 patients with metastatic disease were randomly allocated to standard of care (n = 938) or standard of care plus metformin (n = 936). The median patient age was 69 years (IQR 63–73) and the median PSA was 84 ng/mL (24–352). 1758 (94%) of 1874 patients were newly diagnosed with metastatic disease and 116 (6%) were diagnosed with metachronous relapsing disease. 1543 (82%) of 1874 patients received ADT plus docetaxel and 52 (3%) received abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide. The median time to most recent case report form follow-up was 60 months (IQR 49–72). 473 deaths were reported in the standard of care group; median survival was 61.8 months (IQR 29.7 to not reached). There were 453 deaths in the metformin group; median survival was 67.4 months (32.5 to not reached; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80–1.03; p = 0.15). Grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported in 487 (52%) of 938 patients in the standard of care group and 523 (57%) of 921 patients in the standard of care plus metformin group. 61 (7%) patients in the standard of care group and 84 (9%) patients in the standard of care plus metformin group reported at least one grade 3 or worse gastrointestinal adverse event; all other body systems showed no difference in grade 3 adverse events. There were six drug-related deaths in the standard of care group and one in the standard of care plus metformin group.

Interpretation

We did not find significant evidence of an overall survival benefit of adding metformin to standard of care in the overall population of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. The side-effect profile of metformin was as expected and consisted mainly of diarrhoea. Adverse metabolic side-effects of ADT were significantly reduced in the metformin group compared with the standard of care group.

### Patients with diabetes with and without sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors use with incident cancer risk [^115c5X4a]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The study compared the incidence of cancer between patients with diabetes with and without sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors use.

Methods

This study identified a non-SGLT2 inhibitor cohort of 325,989 patients and a SGLT2 inhibitor cohort of 325,990 patients. The primary interest of this study was the occurrence of cancer. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models.

Results

Patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors (adjusted HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.76–0.83) had a significantly lower risk of developing cancer than patients without receiving SGLT2 inhibitors.

Conclusion

The results demonstrated that patients with diabetes receiving SGLT2 inhibitors had a significantly lower risk of cancer.

### Family history, obesity, urological factors and diabetic medications and their associations with risk of prostate cancer diagnosis in a large prospective study [^113w2j2r]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Our analysis of urological factors showed some evidence that for men who reported having a vasectomy, the relative risk of advanced PC was higher (HR adjusted = 1.28; 95% CI:1.06–1.55; p = 0.052) than the relative the relative risk of localised PC (HR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.95–1.14). This finding is consistent with a 24-year follow-up of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, which reported no association between vasectomy and localised or low-grade disease, but an increased risk of high-grade (hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% CI, 1.03–1.45) and advanced-stage prostate cancer (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.03–1.40). A 15-year follow-up of participants from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study reported no association between vasectomy and overall or advanced PC; association by tumour grade was not reported. A meta-analysis of 13 cohort studies showed weak evidence for a positive association between vasectomy and PC incidence (HR = 1.08; 95% CI 1.02, 1.14), but association by grade or stage of disease was not reported. The biological mechanism underlying an association between vasectomy and PC risk is unclear.

### Safety of sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors [^113wcbpx]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have a well-defined safety profile based on data obtained from numerous clinical trials, including cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) and postmarketing pharmacovigilance reporting. Adverse events including risk of genital mycotic infection and volume depletion-related events are consistent with the mechanism of action of this drug class. However, several emergent (albeit infrequent) serious safety issues have also been reported. In their respective CVOTs, the proportion of patients with reported diabetic ketoacidosis was similar in empagliflozin or canagliflozin compared with their placebo groups, but it was higher for dapagliflozin. Canagliflozin may be associated with an increased risk of bone fracture and lower limb amputation; however, data are inconclusive. There is no evidence linking SGLT2 inhibitors with an increased risk of cancer, but these agents, particularly dapagliflozin, should be used with caution in patients with hematuria or a history of bladder cancer. Postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury have occurred in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, and cases identified in recent CVOTs occurred with similar frequency in SGLT2 inhibitor and placebo groups. Common adverse events associated with SGLT2 inhibitors (such as genital infections or volume depletion) are generally mild and manageable by patients or by primary care physicians, and the risk of rare events (such as ketoacidosis) can be minimized by appropriate patient selection and early recognition of symptoms. When selecting treatment, it is important that clinicians weigh the known risks of SGLT2 inhibitors against their proven benefits, including the reduction of adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes.

To summarize reported cancer events associated with SGLT‐2 inhibitors used in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as assess the quality of included reviews.

Materials and methods

In May 2019, we searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library for quantitative systematic reviews assessing the safety of SGLT‐2 inhibitors. Data were abstracted using a standardized form, and methodological quality was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool. Main outcome measures included total cancer events and specific cancers such as breast cancer, bladder cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, prostate cancer, respiratory cancer, renal cancer and skin cancer. Pooled treatment effects from included reviews were summarized for SGLT‐2 inhibitors as a class and for individual SGLT‐2 inhibitors commonly used worldwide (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin).

Results

We screened 1248 unique citations, of which eight quantitative systematic reviews meta‐analysed results from studies reporting the association between an SGLT‐2 inhibitor and any cancer. Only one review was rated as high quality according to AMSTAR 2 assessment. In total, data from 170 cancer‐related point estimates (PE) were reported. As a class, SGLT‐2 inhibitors were not associated with an increased risk of any cancer event versus placebo and active comparators. Most point estimates (7/143) were nonsignificant for individual cancers except for two associations. Empagliflozin was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer versus placebo and active comparators in two reviews, while canagliflozin appeared protective for gastrointestinal cancer versus placebo and active comparators in one review.

Conclusions

It appears that SGLT‐2 inhibitors are not associated with an increased risk of total cancer or specific cancers in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, higher quality evidence is needed to derive confident conclusions.

### Comparative risk of cancer associated with SGLT inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115djksi]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

The subgroup analysis for the comparative risk of breast cancer included five studies, further exploring heterogeneity. The overall pooled effect size was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.71–1.01, I² = 68.8%, p = 0.012), indicating no significant difference in breast cancer risk between SGLT inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors (Fig. 3).

The subgroup analysis for the comparative risk of colorectal cancer included four studies, with an overall pooled effect size of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.56–0.98, I² = 49.1%, p = 0.117), suggesting a trend toward a lower risk with SGLT-2 inhibitors compared to DPP-4 inhibitors (Fig. 3).

Similar to the previous subgroup, the subgroup analysis for the risk of liver cancer included five studies, with an overall pooled effect size of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.62–0.95, I² = 59.6%, p = 0.042), indicating a statistically significant reduction in liver cancer risk with SGLT-2 inhibitors compared to DPP-4 inhibitors (Fig. 3).

The subgroup analyses for lungs, pancreas, prostate, and stomach cancers further explore the comparative risk between SGLT inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors (Fig. 4). For lung cancer, the overall pooled effect size was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81–0.94, I² = 0.0%, p = 0.814), indicating a significant reduction in risk with SGLT inhibitors. For pancreatic cancer, the ES was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.63–1.14, I² = 55.2%, p = 0.082), suggesting no significant difference. For prostate cancer, the ES was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.58–0.97, I² = 75.4%, p = 0.003), showing a significant reduction in risk. For stomach cancer, the ES was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.22–1.08, I² = 62.2%, p = 0.001), indicating a trend toward reduced risk. These findings suggest varying protective effects of SGLT inhibitors across different cancer types, with the most consistent benefit observed in lung and prostate cancers.

Clinical Studies Supporting the Use of SGLT2 Inhibitors in Cardio-Oncology

Similarly, a retrospective cohort study based on population data used administrative data sets encompassing individuals ≥ 65 years of age, treated for diabetes, and undergoing anthracycline treatment between 2016 and 2019. During a median follow-up period of 1.6 years, the study included 933 patients, with 99 receiving SGLT2 inhibitors and 834 without SGLT2 inhibitors. The predominant cancer types in both groups were breast cancer and lymphoma. This study revealed that the use of SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with a lower rate of hospitalization for HF, but not incident HF, after anthracycline chemotherapy in older patients with cancer.

A recent retrospective study assessed the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients experiencing cardiac dysfunction due to cancer therapy, including anthracyclines, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, and radiation therapy. The study focused on patients ≥ 18 years of age with histories of T2DM, cancer, and exposure to potentially cardiotoxic antineoplastic therapies, with subsequent diagnoses of cardiomyopathy or HF between 2013 and 2020. The study cohort included 1,280 patients experiencing cardiac dysfunction or HF related to cancer therapy (640 in each group, categorized on the basis of SGLT2 inhibitor use). Hematologic cancer was the most common, followed by gastrointestinal cancer, breast cancer, and lymphoma. Over a 2-year follow-up period, patients on SGLT2 inhibitors exhibited a lower risk for acute HF exacerbation and all-cause mortality, along with fewer all-cause hospitalizations or emergency department visits, incidences of atrial fibrillation or flutter, acute kidney injury, and the need for renal replacement therapy.

These findings suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors may be beneficial in reducing the risk for cardiotoxicity in patients with cancer. Nevertheless, randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy and risks of SGLT2 inhibitors in mitigating cardiotoxicity for patients undergoing cardiotoxic therapies. To this end, the EMPACT (Empagliflozin in the Prevention of Cardiotoxicity in Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy Based on Anthracyclines) trial, a randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, is currently underway. This trial aims to determine the efficacy of empagliflozin in preventing LV systolic dysfunction in patients with cancer exposed to high cumulative doses of anthracyclines.

### Exploring the impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors on genitourinary toxicities in prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy: a case study and discussion [^111DeDaA]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Radiation therapy is a common treatment modality offered to patients with localized prostate cancer. It can be associated with early radiation-induced toxicities including dysuria, nocturia, frequency, urgency, spasm, and, rarely, hematuria. Early toxicities usually resolve once the treatment period has ended. Chronic toxicities are less common, and rarely, patients may experience radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis and hematuria months or years after radiation. We herein describe the case of a 65-year-old man with a past medical history of type-2 diabetes mellitus who experienced hemorrhagic cystitis for months following his radiation therapy. The patient was on sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor therapy (empagliflozin), which we highlight as a potential risk factor for hemorrhagic cystitis. After cessation of Jardiance and initiation of semaglutide (GLP-1 agonist), his urinary symptoms significantly improved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such case reported.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116pthGv]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

SGLT-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists — benefits, risks, and patient selection are outlined, noting that it appears that glycemic and cardiovascular (CV) benefits outweigh the risks with mitigation by appropriate patient selection; risks include increased risk of Fournier's gangrene with SGLT-2 inhibitor use, and amputation risk does not appear to be increased for this class overall although canagliflozin trials indicate this specific agent might be associated with increased risk. Patient preferences vary: benefits include weight loss, blood pressure (BP) reduction, and CV and renal protection, but some are deterred by urinary frequency with SGLT-2 inhibitors or nausea or the need to administer an injection with GLP-1 RAs, with additional factors including high cost of GLP-1 RAs and PCP discomfort. Selection can be tailored: for morbid obesity, difficulty emptying the bladder, incontinence, or patients who are male and uncircumcised, a GLP-1 RA might be a better choice; in contrast, for current high risk for pancreatitis, personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma, or concerns over cold chain storage (including patients experiencing homelessness or those who are actively deployed), an oral SGLT-2 inhibitor would be preferred, while neither agent would be optimal for absolute insulin deficiency or patients who are already underweight and aiming to avoid weight loss.

### Family history, obesity, urological factors and diabetic medications and their associations with risk of prostate cancer diagnosis in a large prospective study [^116YPWRJ]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer (PC) is the second most common cancer diagnosed in men worldwide and the most common cancer diagnosed in men from developed countries. Australia has the highest incidence of PC internationally and, in 2021, an estimated 18,000 new PC cases will be diagnosed in Australia.

Despite its high incidence, there is limited evidence on risk factors for PC. Established risk factors include advancing age, African ancestry and family history of PC. All these factors are non-modifiable, thus providing no basis for primary prevention of PC. While a diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma and obesity are associated with PC incidence, only the latter is potentially modifiable. There is emerging evidence that pharmaceuticals prescribed for the treatment of diabetes are related to the risk of a range of malignancies including PC. Results from two large population-based prospective studies showed a reduced risk of incident PC in men taking pharmaceuticals for diabetes. It is suggested that the anti-tumour effects of prescriptions for diabetes may be due to their anti-proliferative effects.

Some urological factors are associated with PC risk including prescriptions for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), lower-urinary-tract symptoms (LUTS) and vasectomy. These associations, especially with BPH prescriptions, vasectomy and LUTs may be at least partly attributable to increased medical surveillance. The PSA test, the most commonly used biomarker in prostate cancer surveillance, was introduced in Australia in the late-1980s and the rise in its uptake corresponded with a rapid increase in PC incidence. Thus, when seeking possible PC risk factors, the potential confounding effects of PSA testing on their associations with PC must be considered.

The current study prospectively examined potential risk factors for PC diagnosis in the 45 and Up Study, a large Australian population-based study of 267,153 male and female participants recruited in New South Wales (NSW). The study's aim was to assess whether selected sociodemographic, behavioural and health-related factors were associated with a higher or lower risk of PC diagnosis, while accounting for possible confounding by PSA testing.

Regarding medical management for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to management of castration-resistant prostate cancer, non-metastatic, nonsteroidal antiandrogens, CUA/CUOG 2022 guidelines recommend to offer apalutamide, enzalutamide, or darolutamide in patients with high-risk non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (defined as a PSA-doubling time < 10 months) with an estimated life expectancy of > 5 years.
