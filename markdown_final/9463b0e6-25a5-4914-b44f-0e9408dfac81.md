## Question

Asthma plan of care

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a clinically rigorous, reference-aware transformation of a step-by-step asthma plan of care, preserving the reasoning flow and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principles that anchor guideline-concordant care. Then, I should verify the core components of supported self-management and how to tailor them. Next, I will examine the written asthma action plan in detail, including zones, triggers, and medication adjustments. After that, I need to check implementation strategies, follow-up cadence, and special populations. Finally, I will review evidence quality, address controversies, and synthesize a practical, patient-centered algorithm with clear triggers for escalation and de-escalation of therapy.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principles so I don't jump to conclusions. Asthma care should be personalized, iterative, and anchored in shared decision-making, with explicit attention to symptom control, future risk, inhaler technique, adherence, comorbidities, and patient goals; this is the GINA cycle of assessment, treatment adjustment, and review, and it is echoed by NAEPP's emphasis on control-based management and regular follow-up, so I need to ensure each step aligns with these principles [^1177LqWS] [^113CD9Bg] [^114MP712].

> Next, I should review the core components of supported self-management, and I need to be precise here. The triad of education, a written or digital action plan, and regular professional review is consistently associated with reduced unscheduled care and improved control; symptom-based and PEF-based plans perform similarly in adults, and the plan should be tailored to literacy, culture, and device strategy, with explicit instructions for recognizing deterioration and escalating therapy, including when to start oral corticosteroids and when to seek urgent care [^115fuFkh] [^1157qP5M] [^111vtVHL].

> Hold on, I should verify the action plan architecture. A traffic-light model with green, yellow, and red zones is standard; green reflects good control, yellow signals loss of control, and red indicates a severe exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids and urgent care; for adults, both symptom- and PEF-based triggers are acceptable, but PEF thresholds should be anchored to personal best rather than percent predicted to improve outcomes, and plans should specify 2–4 action points with clear medication adjustments and safety nets [^115SgWRe] [^1161JHhj] [^111hhmhD].

> I will now examine the green zone content and make sure I'm not missing anything. The green zone should define well-controlled asthma, list daily controller therapy with dose and frequency, remind patients to take medication even when asymptomatic, and include exercise prophylaxis with a short-acting bronchodilator taken 5–20 minutes before activity; I should double-check that spacer use is emphasized for MDIs to optimize delivery and reduce oropharyngeal deposition [^117Fpw9x] [^115XaUnK].

> Let me think about the yellow zone, because this is where early intervention prevents progression. The yellow zone should specify how to recognize worsening symptoms or a PEF decline, when to increase reliever frequency, when to double or quadruple ICS dose temporarily, and when to add a short course of oral corticosteroids if there is no response in 2–3 days; I should confirm dosing: adults typically use prednisone 40–50 mg daily for 5–7 days, and children 6–11 years use 1–2 mg/kg/day up to 40 mg for 3–5 days, with explicit instructions to contact a clinician if OCS are started [^113KRmut] [^111vtVHL] [^1149pput].

> Wait, let me verify the red zone and emergency thresholds so I don't understate severity. The red zone should direct immediate use of rapid-acting bronchodilator, initiation of oral corticosteroids if not already started, and urgent medical contact or ED presentation for severe symptoms, rapid deterioration, PEF or FEV1 less than 60% of personal best, or history of near-fatal asthma; patients with a history of rapid deterioration should be advised to seek acute care immediately at the first sign of worsening [^113KRmut] [^1149pput] [^111dzYpc].

> I need to ensure the plan is individualized beyond medication names. It should include patient-specific triggers and avoidance strategies, comorbidity management such as allergic rhinitis, smoking cessation support, and vaccination reminders; for children 5 years and younger, I should confirm that caregiver-directed plans avoid recommending parent-initiated OCS due to insufficient evidence, and instead emphasize prompt medical review if symptoms persist [^116GRwc5] [^11392SEF] [^115oGJpF].

> Next, I should review implementation strategies because effectiveness depends on delivery. Embedding action plans into EHRs, using standardized templates aligned to local formularies and device strategies, and training teams in inhaler technique and motivational approaches improve uptake; I should double-check that discharge from ED or hospital with an action plan and PEF meter improves outcomes, and that proactive recall systems and case management for high-risk patients sustain engagement [^112WWy46] [^117MEqDY] [^115hVvex].

> Let me verify the follow-up cadence and what must be reviewed at each visit. Routine reviews should occur at least annually, and more frequently after exacerbations, treatment changes, or in moderate–severe disease; each visit should assess control, risk, inhaler technique, adherence, comorbidities, and patient goals, and update the action plan accordingly; after an exacerbation, early follow-up within 1–2 weeks is recommended to consolidate gains and prevent relapse [^114sNAck] [^111kNbTU] [^111dzYpc].

> I should confirm step-down principles so we don't inadvertently maintain overtreatment. Once control is stable for 2–3 months, consider stepping down ICS by 25–50% at 3-month intervals, avoid stepping down during travel, pregnancy, or periods of poor access, and ensure a written action plan is in place to detect early loss of control; if MART is used, the same action plan principles apply with adjustments tailored to the ICS–formoterol strategy [^112qJMtP] [^117XBK4A] [^111vtVHL].

> But wait, what about special populations and settings where standard approaches may falter. For low health literacy, pictorial or digital plans and teach-back improve understanding; for adolescents, incorporating behavior change techniques and peer support can enhance engagement; for older adults, simplify regimens and consider caregiver involvement; in primary care, system-level prompts and team-based care increase action plan ownership; in pediatrics, school and childcare policies and staff education are critical adjuncts [^115HfkWP] [^1157qP5M] [^111r9aL8] [^115hVvex].

> I should double-check the evidence quality and reconcile apparent contradictions. High-quality syntheses show supported self-management reduces hospitalizations, ED visits, and unscheduled care and improves quality of life, with the strongest effects when education, action plan, and regular review are all present; however, some RCTs of isolated written plans without structured support show limited or no added benefit, and VA/DoD rates the evidence for action plans alone as low quality, supporting a weak recommendation; thus, the plan must be embedded in a program, not handed out in isolation [^115fuFkh] [^113jnGPG] [^117MEqDY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about digital tools replacing clinician-led care. Smartphone apps that only log symptoms or peak flow without actionable advice have not shown consistent benefits, whereas integrated digital programs that link monitoring to personalized actions and clinician oversight can be effective; I need to ensure any digital solution mirrors the core components of supported self-management and is culturally and linguistically adapted [^113jnGPG] [^1157qP5M].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check each branch. Start with baseline assessment of control, risk, lung function, inhaler technique, adherence, triggers, comorbidities, and goals; provide education and co-create a written or digital action plan; arrange follow-up every 3–6 months or sooner if control is poor; during worsening, use the yellow zone to escalate reliever and controller therapy and add OCS if indicated; use the red zone for emergency action and urgent care; after exacerbations, ensure early follow-up and update the plan; when stable, step down ICS cautiously with close monitoring and a clear action plan for relapse detection [^117PXmpy] [^114MP712] [^111dzYpc].

> Finally, I need to ensure system-level enablers are addressed so this plan is sustainable. Implementation requires leadership buy-in, standardized workflows, EHR integration, performance measurement, and training aligned to local context; evaluating process and outcome measures and feeding data back to teams supports continuous improvement and helps close the gap between evidence and practice [^113dGUfW] [^117MEqDY] [^113yEpP3].

An effective asthma plan of care centers on **individualized written action plans** [^115fuFkh] and **supported self-management** [^115xhxvL] to reduce exacerbations and improve control. Key elements include: confirm the diagnosis and classify severity; provide education and inhaler technique training; deliver a personalized action plan with 2–4 zones and clear medication adjustments; address adherence and triggers; schedule regular follow-up every 3–6 months; and ensure rapid post-exacerbation review. These components are **strongly recommended** by GINA and supported by evidence showing reduced hospitalizations, ED visits, and improved quality of life [^111vtVHL] [^117PXmpy] [^115xhxvL].

---

## Diagnosis and severity classification

Confirm the diagnosis with **objective measures** (spirometry, FeNO, or bronchodilator response) [^114oPgGP] and classify severity using GINA steps (1–5) to guide initial therapy and risk stratification [^113CD9Bg].

---

## Patient education and self-management

- **Education**: Teach asthma pathophysiology, triggers, and inhaler technique using teach-back [^115HfkWP].
- **Self-monitoring**: Encourage symptom or peak flow monitoring [^1177LqWS].
- **Adherence**: Address barriers and reinforce daily controller use [^112D7inW].

---

## Written asthma action plan (WAAP)

- **Individualization**: Tailor the WAAP to severity, literacy, and culture [^notfound].
- **Zones**: Use 2–4 zones (green/yellow/red) with clear symptoms, PEF thresholds, and actions [^1161JHhj].
- **Medication adjustments**: Specify when to increase ICS, add OCS, and seek care [^1149pput].
- **Format**: Provide printed, digital, or pictorial versions [^111vtVHL].

## Medication management

| **Step** | **Preferred controller** | **Reliever** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Low-dose ICS | As-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol |
| 2 | Low-dose ICS | As-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol |
| 3 | Low-dose ICS-LABA | As-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol |
| 4 | Medium/high-dose ICS-LABA | As-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol |
| 5 | Add-on biologics or oral corticosteroids | As-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol |

---

Step-up therapy if control remains inadequate after 2–3 months, and step down once control is stable for 3 months [^114MP712] [^117XBK4A].

---

## Trigger identification and avoidance

Identify **allergens, irritants, and occupational exposures** [^notfound], and provide counseling on avoidance and environmental controls.

---

## Regular follow-up and monitoring

Routine reviews should occur **every 3–6 months** to assess control, adherence, inhaler technique, and update the WAAP [^notfound]. Post-exacerbation follow-up should be scheduled within 1–2 weeks to review control, triggers, and the WAAP [^111dzYpc].

---

## Special considerations

- **Children**: Emphasize caregiver education and school-based plans [^111r9aL8].
- **Severe asthma**: Refer for specialist evaluation and consider biologics [^116aFjD9].
- **Comorbidities**: Manage allergies, obesity, and anxiety/depression [^115HfkWP].

---

## Evidence supporting the plan

Supported self-management reduces **hospitalizations, ED visits, and unscheduled care** and improves quality of life, with benefits across diverse settings and populations [^115fuFkh] [^115xhxvL] [^112h4w1F].

---

An effective asthma plan of care integrates **personalized education**, a written action plan, and **regular follow-up** to reduce exacerbations and improve control [^111vtVHL].

### Personalised asthma action plans for adults with asthma [^115PmbqD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A key aim of asthma care is to empower each person to take control of his or her own condition. A personalised asthma action plan (PAAP), also known as a written action plan, an individualised action plan, or a self-management action plan, contributes to this endeavour. A PAAP includes individualised self-management instructions devised collaboratively with the patient to help maintain asthma control and regain control in the event of an exacerbation. A PAAP includes baseline characteristics (such as lung function), maintenance medication and instructions on how to respond to increasing symptoms and when to seek medical help.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of PAAPs used alone or in combination with education, for patient-reported outcomes, resource use and safety among adults with asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, clinical trial registers, reference lists of included studies and review articles, and relevant manufacturers' websites up to 14 September 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), both blinded and unblinded, that evaluated written PAAPs in adults with asthma. Included studies compared PAAP alone versus no PAAP, and/or PAAP plus education versus education alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted study characteristics and outcome data and assessed risk of bias for each included study. Primary outcomes were number of participants reporting at least one exacerbation requiring an emergency department (ED) visit or hospitalisation, asthma symptom scores on a validated scale and adverse events (all causes). Secondary outcomes were quality of life measured on a validated scale, number of participants reporting at least one exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids, respiratory function and days lost from work or study. We used a random-effects model for all analyses and standard Cochrane methods throughout.

Main Results

We identified 15 studies described in 27 articles that met our inclusion criteria. These 15 included studies randomised a total of 3062 participants (PAAP vs no PAAP: 2602 participants; PAAP plus education vs education alone: 460 participants). Ten studies (eight PAAP vs no PAAP; two PAAP plus education vs education alone) provided outcome data that contributed to quantitative analyses. The overall quality of evidence was rated as low or very low. Fourteen studies lasted six months or longer, and the remaining study lasted for 14 weeks. When reported, mean age ranged from 22 to 49 years and asthma severity ranged from mild to severe/high risk. PAAP alone compared with no PAAPResults showed no clear benefit or harm associated with PAAPs in terms of the number of participants requiring an ED visit or hospitalisation for an exacerbation (odds ratio (OR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.24; 1385 participants; five studies; low-quality evidence), change from baseline in asthma symptoms (mean difference (MD) -0.16, 95% CI -0.25 to - 0.07; 141 participants; one study; low-quality evidence) or the number of serious adverse events, including death (OR 3.26, 95% CI 0.33 to 32.21; 125 participants; one study; very low-quality evidence). Data revealed a statistically significant improvement in quality of life scores for those receiving PAAP compared with no PAAP (MD 0.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.30; 441 participants; three studies; low-quality evidence), but this was below the threshold for a minimum clinically important difference (MCID). Results also showed no clear benefit or harm associated with PAAPs on the number of participants reporting at least one exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids (OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.48; 1136 participants; three studies; very low-quality evidence) nor on respiratory function (change from baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1): MD -0.04 L, 95% CI -0.25L to 0.17 L; 392 participants; three studies; low-quality evidence). In one study, PAAPs were associated with significantly fewer days lost from work or study (MD -6.20, 95% CI -7.32 to - 5.08; 74 participants; low-quality evidence). PAAP plus education compared with education aloneResults showed no clear benefit or harm associated with adding a PAAP to education in terms of the number of participants requiring an ED visit or hospitalisation for an exacerbation (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.27 to 4.32; 70 participants; one study; very low-quality evidence), change from baseline in asthma symptoms (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.54 to 0.34; 70 participants; one study; low-quality evidence), change in quality of life scores from baseline (MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.39; 174 participants; one study; low-quality evidence) and number of participants requiring oral corticosteroids for an exacerbation (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.12; 70 participants; one study; very low-quality evidence). No studies reported serious adverse events, respiratory function or days lost from work or study.

Authors' Conclusions

Analysis of available studies was limited by variable reporting of primary and secondary outcomes; therefore, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions related to the effectiveness of PAAPs in the management of adult asthma. We found no evidence from randomised controlled trials of additional benefit or harm associated with use of PAAP versus no PAAP, or PAAP plus education versus education alone, but we considered the quality of the evidence to be low or very low, meaning that we cannot be confident in the magnitude or direction of reported treatment effects. In the context of this caveat, we found no observable effect on the primary outcomes of hospital attendance with an asthma exacerbation, asthma symptom scores or adverse events. We recommend further research with a particular focus on key patient-relevant outcomes, including exacerbation frequency and quality of life, in a broad spectrum of adults, including those over 60 years of age.

### Written action plans for asthma: an evidence-based review of the key components [^1161JHhj]. Thorax (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Written action plans for asthma facilitate the early detection and treatment of an asthma exacerbation. Several versions of action plans have been published but the key components have not been determined. A study was undertaken to determine the impact of individual components of written action plans on asthma health outcomes.

Methods

Randomised controlled trials (n = 26) that evaluated asthma action plans as part of asthma self-management education were identified. Action plans were classified as being individualised and complete if they specified when and how to increase treatment (n = 17), and as incomplete (n = 4) or non-specific (n = 5) if they did not include these instructions.

Results

For individualised complete written action plans the use of 2–4 action points and the use of both inhaled (ICS) and oral (OCS) corticosteroid consistently improved asthma outcomes. Action points based on personal best peak expiratory flow (PEF) consistently improved health outcomes while those based on percentage predicted PEF did not. The efficacy of incomplete action plans was inconclusive because of insufficient data. Non-specific action plans led to improvements in knowledge and symptoms.

Conclusion

Individualised written action plans based on personal best PEF, using 2–4 action points, and recommending both ICS and OCS for treatment of exacerbations consistently improve asthma health outcomes. Other variations appear less beneficial or require further study. These observations provide a guide to the types of variations possible with written action plans, and strongly support the use of individualised complete written action plans.

### Does self-management prevent severe exacerbations? [^116UhykY]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Despite effective therapies, asthma outcomes remain suboptimal. Education in self-management is crucial to maintaining control in a variable condition such as asthma and reducing the risk of severe asthma exacerbations, hospitalizations and deaths. This review considers the evidence for supported self-management.

Recent Findings

Recent systematic reviews have clarified and confirmed the major benefits from effective self-management education, but have also shown that implementation is rare in routine practice, with consequent avoidable morbidity and mortality. Recent research has focused on the most effective ways of delivering and supporting self-management in different patient groups and has clarified the relative effectiveness of the different components. Self-management support using new digital technologies has been investigated.

Summary

All clinicians treating patients with asthma should be supporting their patients to understand and manage their own condition. Optimal self-management incorporates education, provision of a personalized asthma action plan and is supported by regular professional review. Action plans in a written or digital format should advise on recognizing deterioration and the actions to take, including when to seek professional help, appropriate changes in medication dose or commencing rescue oral steroids. Action plans should be personalized and agreed by the patient, and provided in a culturally tailored form.

### Improving primary care management of asthma: do we know what really works? [^111yhs8G]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Primary care is pivotal to any health system; however, there is no universal definition of what we mean by primary care and certainly not one standardised model of care. Without focussing on a single model, we have attempted to bring together expert opinion and the most recent evidence on strategies that improve outcomes in asthma patients in primary care. To our knowledge the methodology used in this project has not been used before. The panel of experts who identified the key drivers were knowledgeable of asthma in primary care at a national level in their respective countries and globally. A literature search to investigate the individual key drivers and their underpinning components was undertaken using a keyword search. This identified many publications but very few measured the effect on patient outcome and those that did reported conflicting results. Furthermore, we found a paucity of research relating to the components relating to national healthcare policy and guidelines.

The evidence suggests that health systems that have primary care as a cornerstone and place asthma as a healthcare priority improve asthma care and improve outcome on patient level. The highly regarded Finnish asthma initiative carried out more than 25 years ago not only identified asthma as a national priority, but also placed primary care at the centre of the programme, recognising the key role of General Practitioners and nurses and greatly reduced asthma mortality and morbidity. After the successful implementation of the Finnish asthma plan, many other countries and regions have attempted to implement similar initiatives. For example, in Poland and Brazil, asthma burden was reduced utilising such a strategy.

Poor health outcomes in asthma patients have been attributed in primary care to gaps between evidence-based recommendations and practice. Studies show that adherence to clinical guidelines is poor, whatever the clinical setting, with the main barriers being time pressures and limited resources, reflecting that it is not the guidelines per se that improve care, but it is the implementation of the recommendations.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^115UKXeM]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — evidence base for key questions summarizes study counts by topic. For the long-term comparative benefits and harms of chronic inhaled corticosteroids, evidence includes 3 systematic reviews (SRs) and 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (in 11 publications) (14 publications total). For self-management approaches, asthma action plan (AAP) components, or patient education components, evidence includes 4 SRs (2 with network meta-analysis [NMA]) and 6 RCTs. For interventions to reduce or remove indoor inhalant allergens among individuals with asthma, evidence comprises 4 RCTs and 2 Post-Hoc Analyses. For the long-term effects of cumulative corticosteroid exposure in asthma with a comorbid atopic disease for which corticosteroids are a standard treatment, no studies identified. Across all key questions, the total evidence base is 57 studies (in 60 publications).

### Action plans in asthma [^115Qb5ab]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2005). Low credibility.

Around 5.2 million people in the U.K. have asthma. Symptoms of the disease are often variable, so a fixed treatment regimen is not always appropriate. Personal asthma action plans aim to prompt patients to adjust their medication, or seek medical help, in response to changes in symptoms or peak flow readings. A national clinical guideline in the U.K. recommends that patients with asthma should be offered education in self-management, including a written asthma action plan that focuses on their individual needs. At present, only a minority of people with asthma report receiving such an action plan. Here we discuss the potential content of action plans and review the evidence for their effectiveness.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^111437LB]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to develop a global strategy for managing and preventing asthma. GINA reports, now funded independently through the sale of GINA products, have provided the foundation for many national guidelines. They are prepared by international experts from primary, secondary and tertiary care, and are annually updated following a review of evidence. In 2014, a major revision of the GINA report was published, that took into account advances in evidence not only about asthma and its treatment, but also about how to improve implementation of evidence-based recommendations in clinical practice. This paper summarises key changes relevant to primary care in the new GINA report. A noticeable difference is the report's radically different approach, now clinically-focussed, with multiple practical tools and flow charts to improve its utility for busy frontline clinicians. Key changes in recommendations include a new, diagnosis-centred definition of asthma; more detail about how to assess current symptom control and future risk; a comprehensive approach to tailoring treatment for individual patients; expanded indications for commencing inhaled corticosteroids; new recommendations for written asthma action plans; a new chapter on diagnosis and initial treatment of patients with asthma-COPD overlap syndrome; and a revised approach to diagnosing asthma in preschool children. The 2014 GINA report (further updated in 2015) moved away from a 'textbook' approach to provide clinicians with up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk, in a practical, practice-centred format.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115fuFkh]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Training in guided asthma self-management — essential components of effective education are self-monitoring of symptoms and/or peak expiratory flow (PEF), a written asthma action plan to show how to recognize and respond to worsening asthma, and regular review of asthma control, treatment and skills by a healthcare provider. Self-management education that includes these components dramatically reduces asthma morbidity in adults and children, with benefits including reduction of one-third to two-thirds in asthma-related hospitalizations, emergency department visits and unscheduled doctor or clinic visits, missed work/school days, and nocturnal awakenings, and it has been estimated that the implementation of a self-management program in 20 patients prevents one hospitalization, and successful completion by 8 patients prevents one emergency department visit. Less intensive interventions without a written action plan are less effective and information alone is ineffective, and a systematic meta-review of 270 RCTs on supported self-management confirmed reduced unscheduled health care use, improved asthma control, applicability to a wide range of target groups and clinical settings, and no increase in healthcare costs (Evidence A).

### Optimizing adherence to medication to improve outcomes in asthma [^112D7inW]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Taking medication as prescribed is an essential component of asthma management and has been proven to contribute to improved symptom management and reduced risk of asthma exacerbations. Nevertheless, patients continue to find it difficult to achieve optimal adherence, and healthcare professionals (HCP) often struggle with providing appropriate support. Although the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) recommends reviewing inhaler technique and adherence to medications at every consultation as part of routine asthma assessment and management, following this recommendation is challenging in everyday practice. Supporting adherence effectively requires understanding what effect suboptimal adherence has on outcomes in different patient groups, what factors influence medication-taking behaviors at different levels, and what interventions are best suited to address these factors and can be implemented in specific clinical contexts. Moreover, as asthma is a variable condition, supported self-management can empower patients to adjust their preventer medication according to their asthma action plan.

Adherence to medications has been conceptualized as a complex group of behaviors and interactions embedded in the broader process of asthma care. Research evidence is accumulating on the impact of these behaviors on a range of clinical outcomes, in particular severe exacerbations, hospitalizations, and deaths. Preventing asthma deaths through appropriate medical management and education needs to be a priority for health systems. Clinical teams need proven, evidence-based tools that they can easily integrate into routine patient-centered asthma management protocols. Designing effective tools and interventions for specific patient groups and clinical contexts requires understanding the most relevant influencing factors (determinants) and selecting adherence support strategies capable of influencing these factors in the given context. Numerous determinants of medication adherence in asthma have been identified at patient level, HCP level, and healthcare system level. Therefore, solutions for optimizing adherence need to support change simultaneously at patient level by supporting patients to understand their condition better and feel motivated to follow the prescribed regimen, and at the HCP and system levels by improving care processes and providing the necessary training and resources for guideline-recommended care. Research evidence supports this process by raising awareness on the value of optimizing adherence considering its impact on clinical outcomes, identifying and conceptualizing key modifiable determinants, and developing a range of solutions and testing their effectiveness and implementability in different clinical settings. This review highlights recent research on asthma medication adherence concerning these three key domains of research and reflects on their relevance for clinical practice.

### Systematic meta-review of supported self-management for asthma: a healthcare perspective [^1157qP5M]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Which components of supported self-management are important?

A 3* meta-analysis (36 RCTs; 6090 participants of all ages recruited from primary and secondary care settings) defined optimal self-management as education including advice on self-monitoring and a written action plan that was supported by regular professional review. There is evidence that reducing the intensity of self-management education or level of clinical review may reduce its effectiveness.

Components of an action plan

The components of an action plan were further defined in two 3* and three 2* reviews. In adults, self-monitoring based on peak flow or symptoms is equally effective. In a comparison in children, symptom-based plans were more effective at reducing unscheduled healthcare, and equally effective at improving most measures of asthma control; the exception was days with symptoms, which were reduced more by peak-flow-based than symptom-based plans. A 3* review concluded that action plans with between two and four action points, including recommendations on increasing inhaled corticosteroids and initiating oral corticosteroids, were consistently effective in reducing admissions and A&E attendances.

Behavioural change techniques

One 3* meta-analysis demonstrated that self-management interventions that incorporated specific behaviour change techniques reduced unscheduled care and improved control. Meta-regression of the data from the 38 RCTs (7883 participants) concluded that active involvement of participants in the intervention was a key factor in reducing unscheduled healthcare. More specifically, identifying individual behavioural traits (e.g. rebelliousness, low perceived emotional support) in adolescents enabled targeted use of behavioural change techniques. A goal-setting approach proved challenging to implement in primary care settings.

Technology

Two 1* narrative reviews investigated computer- or internet-based interactive self-management programmes. The effect on healthcare utilisation was inconsistent, confirmed by a recent review identified in the pre-publication update, though both showed improvement in symptoms and/or quality of life. Two update RCTs of web-based self-management programmes for adolescents also showed improved asthma control, and an extended follow-up of RCT participants concluded that these effects could be sustained 18 months after conclusion of the trial. Several school-based programmes used technology-based interventions to improve control and reduce absenteeism. Supported self-management using mobile phone technology currently has a limited and inconclusive evidence base, though a recent RCT in pregnancy demonstrated improved asthma control and quality of life.

General Principles of Asthma Management

The goals of asthma management are to achieve good symptom control, relieve symptoms when they occur, and minimize the risk of exacerbations and asthma-related death, persistent airflow limitation, and side effects of treatment. The patient's own treatment goals should be identified because they may be different. Effective asthma management requires a partnership between the patient (or parent/caregiver) and healthcare providers, with shared decision-making and good communication.

Asthma management is not "one-size-fits-all" but instead should be personalized and adjusted in a continual cycle of assessment, treatment adjustment, and review (Figure 2).

Assessment

Assess not only symptom control and lung function but also the individual's modifiable risk factors and comorbidities (also called "treatable traits") and patient/parent goals and preferences. Check adherence and inhaler technique frequently. Poor symptom control is associated with a much higher risk of exacerbations, but patients with apparently mild asthma or with good symptom control can still have severe or life-threatening exacerbations.

Treatment Adjustment

Treatment adjustment includes not only changes in the asthma medication dose or type but also multidisciplinary management of modifiable risk factors and comorbidities (Section 3D in Reference) and nonpharmacological strategies such as smoking cessation and avoidance of indoor/outdoor air pollution (Box 3–9 in Reference).

For all patients, provide regular training in inhaler techniques and asthma self-management, including self-monitoring of symptoms and/or PEF, and a written asthma action plan (Section 3C in Reference). Encourage adherence with controller medication, even when symptoms are infrequent. Consider stepping down treatment when good control has been maintained for 2–3 months (Box 3–7 in Reference).

### Systematic meta-review of supported self-management for asthma: a healthcare perspective [^111Z7zy6]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is common, affecting 334 million people worldwide, and is responsible for substantial morbidity and an increasing burden on healthcare services globally. In the UK, there are over 6 million primary care consultations, and 100,000 hospital admissions each year, at an estimated cost of £1 billion per year.

For a quarter of a century, national and international guidelines have recommended – unequivocally – that people with asthma should be provided with self-management education reinforced by a personalised asthma action plan and supported by regular review, though mode of delivery, personnel delivering the support, the targeted group and the intensity of the intervention vary. The 2014 UK National Review of Asthma Deaths provided a stark reminder of the importance of ensuring that people with asthma respond in a timely and appropriate manner to deteriorating symptoms: only 23% had documented evidence of having been provided with self-management education and 45% of people who died had not sought or received medical attention in their final attack.

However, despite self-management being highlighted as a core component of all models of care for people with long-term conditions (LTCs) and the concept being well established in the context of asthma, in practice only a minority of people with asthma have an action plan. Effective implementation requires a whole systems approach, combining active engagement of patients with the training and motivation of professionals embedded within an organisation in which self-management is valued. Patient organisations, healthcare professionals, policy-makers, commissioners and providers of healthcare services thus need an up-to-date systematic overview of the evidence to inform decisions about prioritisation of supported self-management and to underpin implementation strategies within diverse healthcare systems.

The data presented in this paper are derived from two parallel programmes of work on supported self-management in LTCs commissioned by the National Institute of Health Research: Practical Systematic Review of Self-Management Support (PRISMS) and Reducing Care Utilisation through Self-management Interventions (RECURSIVE). In the context of asthma, we aimed to answer questions of importance to clinicians, patient-interest groups, managers responsible for developing healthcare services and policy-makers: can supported self-management reduce the use of healthcare resources and improve asthma control? More specifically, in which target groups has it been shown to work, which components are important, in what healthcare contexts, and at what cost?

Review

Arrange regular medical review to identify modifiable risk factors, optimize care, and minimize the risk of exacerbations; review at least yearly (more often in patients with moderate or severe asthma), after an exacerbation, and after a treatment change. Review clinical outcomes and side effects, patient/parent/caregiver satisfaction, inhaler technique and self-management skills. Ensure the patient/caregiver has an up-to-date written asthma action plan.

Rationale

The GINA strategy (Figure 2) considers not only patient characteristics that may predict a clinically important difference in treatment response but also medication access, the patient's preferences, and practical issues of cost, ability to use the inhaler, and likely adherence. The extent to which asthma treatment can be individualized according to patient characteristics or phenotype depends on the health system, the clinical context, evidence about the magnitude of potential difference in outcomes, cost, and available resources.

Personalised asthma action plans

Key features of effective self-management approaches are:

Self-management education should be reinforced by provision of a (written) PAAP which reminds patients of their regular treatment, how to monitor and recognise that control is deteriorating and the action they should take. As an adult, our patient can choose whether she wishes to monitor her control with symptoms or by recording peak flows (or a combination of both). Symptom-based monitoring is generally better in children.
Plans should have between two and three action points including emergency doses of reliever medication; increasing low dose (or recommencing) inhaled steroids; or starting a course of oral steroids according to severity of the exacerbation.
Personalisation of the action plan is crucial. Focussing specifically on what actions she could take to prevent a repetition of the recent attack is likely to engage her interest. Not all patients will wish to start oral steroids without advice from a healthcare professional, though with her busy lifestyle and travel our patient is likely to be keen to have an emergency supply of prednisolone. Mobile technology has the potential to support self-management, though a recent systematic review concluded that none of the currently available smart phone 'apps' were fit for purpose.
Identification and avoidance of her triggers is important. As pollen seems to be a trigger, management of allergic rhinitis needs to be discussed (and included in her action plan): she may benefit from regular use of a nasal steroid spray during the season.
Self-management as recommended by guidelines, focuses narrowly on adherence to medication/monitoring and the early recognition/remediation of exacerbations, summarised in (written) PAAPs. Patients, however, may want to discuss how to reduce the impact of asthma on their life more generally, including non-pharmacological approaches.

Supported self-management

The impact is greater if self-management education is delivered within a comprehensive programme of accessible, proactive asthma care, and needs to be supported by ongoing regular review. With her busy lifestyle, our patient may be reluctant to attend follow-up appointments, and once her asthma is controlled it may be possible to make convenient arrangements for professional review perhaps by telephone, or e-mail. Flexible access to professional advice (e.g. utilising diverse modes of consultation) is an important component of supporting self-management.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112RgzNF]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Guided asthma self-management education and skills training — people with asthma need education and skills training to manage it well, most effectively achieved through a partnership between the patient/carer and their healthcare providers; essential components include choosing the most appropriate inhaler for the patient's asthma treatment (consider available devices, cost, the ability of the patient to use the inhaler after training, environmental impact, and patient satisfaction), skills training to use inhaler devices effectively, encouraging adherence with medications, appointments and other advice within an agreed management strategy, asthma information, and training in guided self-management with self-monitoring of symptoms or peak expiratory flow (PEF), a written asthma action plan, and regular review by a healthcare provider or trained healthcare worker. In developing, customizing and evaluating self-management interventions for different cultures, sociocultural factors should be considered.

Which contextual factors influence effectiveness?

Resonating with the concept of 'optimal' self-management (education, an action plan and regular review), a 3* meta-analysis identified that omitting regular review (1 RCT) or reducing intensity of education (1 RCT) was associated with a smaller reduction in unscheduled consultations. A 2* meta-analysis analysed the findings of 18 RCTs (3006 participants) according to the components of the Chronic Care Model. Interventions that included all four components had a greater effect on adherence to inhaled corticosteroids compared to trials including self-management unsupported by the organisational components.

Organisational role in promoting supported self-management

A 3* narrative review of 14 RCTs (4588 participants) concluded that proactive organisational systems can increase action plan ownership by promoting uptake of asthma reviews and implementing (and monitoring) structured management systems for asthma care. A recent RCT of a structured approach to self-management education in both primary care and specialist units improved asthma control and reduced unscheduled care, and a large cluster RCT at low risk of bias showed an increased adherence to guidelines and reduced asthma symptoms by systematically providing individualised prompts to general practitioners and parents of children with asthma. Automatically linking an action plan to prescriptions given to patients being discharged from A&E improved clinician management and patient uptake of steroid courses.

What is the effect of supported self-management on healthcare utilisation and costs?

The RECURSIVE meta-analysis confirmed that self-management support interventions for people with asthma are associated with significant improvements in quality-of-life outcomes (SMD 0.26, 95% CI 0.12–0.39), significant small decreases in hospitalisation rates and costs (SMD −0.21, 95% CI −0.40 to −0.01), significant small decreases in A&E visits (SMD −0.25, 95% CI −0.49 to −0.01), and non-significant small increases in total healthcare costs (SMD 0.13, 95% CI −0.09 to 0.34). Figure 3 shows a Forest plot of the total costs.

Implementation of Asthma Management Strategies into Health Systems

To improve asthma care and patient outcomes, evidence-based recommendations must be disseminated and implemented nationally and locally and integrated into health systems and clinical practice. Implementation requires an evidence-based strategy involving professional groups and stakeholders and considering local cultural and socioeconomic conditions. The cost-effectiveness of implementation programs should be assessed so a decision can be made to pursue or modify them. Local adaptation and implementation of asthma care strategies are aided by purpose-developed tools.

### Can asthma control be improved by understanding the patient's perspective? [^113dogKU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Summary

It is possible to improve current levels of asthma control if healthcare professionals do four things:

1) use appropriate, patient-centred tools to assess control

2) identify the reasons for poor control in individual patients

3) work with patients to design individual treatment plans that address poor control and the causes of poor control, taking account of patient goals and aspirations

4) monitor outcomes and take appropriate action through regular review

### Self-management education and regular practitioner review for adults with asthma [^112h4w1F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

A key component of many asthma management guidelines is the recommendation for patient education and regular medical review. A number of controlled trials have been conducted to measure the effectiveness of asthma education programmes. These programmes improve patient knowledge, but their impact on health outcomes is less well established. This review was conducted to examine the strength of evidence supporting Step 6 of the Australian Asthma Management Plan: "Educate and Review Regularly"; to test whether health outcomes are influenced by education and self-management programmes.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of asthma self-management programmes, when coupled with regular health practitioner review, on health outcomes in adults with asthma.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of self-management education in adults over 16 years of age with asthma.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial quality was assessed and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Study authors were contacted for confirmation.

Main Results

Thirty six trials, which compared self-management education with usual care, were included. Self-management education reduced hospitalisations (relative risk 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.82); emergency room visits (relative risk 0.82, 95% confidence interval (0.73 to 0.94); unscheduled visits to the doctor (relative risk 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 0.81); days off work or school (relative risk 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.93); nocturnal asthma (relative risk 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.0.56 to 0.79); and quality of life (standard mean difference 0.29, confidence interval 0.11 to 0.47). Measures of lung function were little changed.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Education in asthma self-management which involves self-monitoring by either peak expiratory flow or symptoms, coupled with regular medical review and a written action plan improves health outcomes for adults with asthma. Training programmes that enable people to adjust their medication using a written action plan appear to be more effective than other forms of asthma self-management.

Written Asthma Action Plans

As part of asthma self-management, provide all patients with a written asthma action plan appropriate for their level of asthma control and health literacy, so they know how to recognize and respond to worsening asthma. State when and how to change reliever and controller medications, use OCS if appropriate, and access medical care if symptoms fail to respond to treatment. Base the action plan on changes in symptoms or (only in adults) PEF.

Advise patients who have a history of rapid deterioration to go to an acute care facility or see their doctor immediately if their asthma starts to worsen.

Action plan recommendations for responding to worsening asthma depend on the patient's usual therapy. Patients prescribed as-needed ICS–formoterol as their reliever, either alone or in MART, should increase their as-needed doses as symptoms increase. Those on a maintenance ICS-containing controller should increase to a high dose temporarily (e.g. for 1–2 wk) (Box 4–2 in Reference).

Rationale

In a systematic review of self-management studies, action plans in which the ICS dose was at least doubled were associated with improved asthma outcomes and reduced healthcare use. In some studies in adults and adolescents and preschool children, short-term, higher-dose ICS reduced progression to a severe exacerbation, and some found less impact on serum cortisol than with OCS, but cost may be an issue. Given the shape of the ICS dose–response curve, the benefit of increasing maintenance ICS when asthma worsens may be greater when background adherence is lower. The timing of an increased ICS dose may be important: studies in adults in which the ICS dose was doubled 5–7 days after symptoms worsened found no reduction in severe exacerbations. In contrast, in MART, taking reliever doses of ICS–formoterol as soon as asthma symptoms occur, reduces the risk of progression to severe exacerbation.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111hhmhD]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Written asthma action plans — content and evidence: Personal written asthma action plans show patients how to make short-term changes to their treatment in response to changes in their symptoms and/or peak expiratory flow (PEF), and describe how and when to access medical care; these plans can be printed, digital or pictorial. The benefits of self-management education for asthma morbidity are greater in adults when the action plans include both a step up in inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and the addition of oral corticosteroids (OCS) and, for PEF-based plans, when they are based on personal best rather than percent predicted PEF (Evidence A). The efficacy of self-management education is similar regardless of whether patients self-adjust their medications according to an individual written plan or whether the medication adjustments are made by a doctor (Evidence A), and patients who are unable to undertake guided self-management can still achieve benefit from a structured program of regular medical review.

### Asthma education [^116b24Ya]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Education about asthma and self-management of asthma are now key recommendations of asthma management guidelines. A Cochrane systematic review of 12 RCTs found that limited education programmes that offer information about asthma but not self-management skills did not reduce hospitalisation rates or visits to the doctor for asthma. The positive outcomes from limited asthma education were a reduction in symptoms. Asthma self-management education which consists of information, self-monitoring, regular medical review, and a written action plan is effective and leads to a reduction in hospitalisation and ER visits for asthma, unscheduled doctors visits, days lost from work, episodes of nocturnal asthma, indirect costs and an improvement in quality of life. The effects were large enough to be of both clinical and statistical significance. While a structured asthma self-management programme is effective in a hospital setting, attempts to deliver these programmes in primary care have met with varying success.

### Written individualised management plans for asthma in children and adults [^112A8axx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Non-adherence to treatment advice is a common phenomenon in asthma and may account for a significant proportion of the morbidity. Comprehensive care that includes asthma education, a written self-management plan and regular review has been shown to improve asthma outcomes, but the contribution of these components has not been established.

Objectives

To determine whether the provision of a written asthma self-management plan increases adherence and improves outcome.

Search Strategy

We carried out a search on the Cochrane Airways Group trials register. There was no language restriction. The search of the databases used the following terms: action plan OR self OR self-care OR self-manag* OR educ* AND adher* OR comply OR compli*. We contacted authors of included studies for any unpublished or on-going studies and bibliographies of all included studies and reviews were searched for further studies. The most recent search was carried out in May 2003.

Selection Criteria

We only considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with asthma. Participants must have been assigned to receive an individualised written asthma management plan (symptom or peak flow based) about the actions required for regular asthma management and/or the actions to take in the event of an asthma exacerbation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed study quality and abstracted data.

Main Results

Seven trials met the inclusion criteria. The written management plans were either peak flow or symptom based, which were compared against each other or compared to no written management plan. Reported outcomes included: medication adherence, hospitalisation, emergency department visits, oral corticosteroid use, lung function, days lost from school/work, unscheduled doctor visits and respiratory tract infections. There was no consistent evidence that written plans produced better patient outcomes than no written plan. For some outcomes, there appeared to be an advantage of one type of plan over the other, but there was no consistency - one type of plan was not consistently more effective than another.

Reviewers' Conclusions

The available trials are too small and the results too few and inconsistent to form any firm conclusions as to the contribution of written self management plans in the known beneficial effects of a comprehensive asthma care programme.

### Improving primary care management of asthma: do we know what really works? [^111Yvj4J]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Asthma imposes a substantial burden on individuals and societies. Patients with asthma need high-quality primary care management; however, evidence suggests the quality of this care can be highly variable. Here we identify and report factors contributing to high-quality management. Twelve primary care global asthma experts, representing nine countries, identified key factors. A literature review (past 10 years) was performed to validate or refute the expert viewpoint. Key driving factors identified were: policy, clinical guidelines, rewards for performance, practice organisation and workforce. Further analysis established the relevant factor components. Review evidence supported the validity of each driver; however, impact on patient outcomes was uncertain. Single interventions (e.g. healthcare practitioner education) showed little effect; interventions driven by national policy (e.g. incentive schemes and teamworking) were more effective. The panel's opinion, supported by literature review, concluded that multiple primary care interventions offer greater benefit than any single intervention in asthma management.

Adapting and implementing asthma clinical practice guidelines — implementation of asthma management strategies may be carried out at a national, regional or local level, and ideally should be a multidisciplinary effort involving many stakeholders, using cost-effective methods of knowledge translation; each implementation initiative needs to consider the nature of the local health system and its resources, including human resources, infrastructure, and available treatments, with goals and strategies varying between and within countries based on economics, culture, and the physical and social environment; priority should be given to high-impact interventions, and specific steps need to be followed before clinical practice recommendations can be embedded into local clinical practice and become the standard of care, with the individual steps summarized in Box 14–2.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1164RQb6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Management of worsening asthma and exacerbations — adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — terminology and written asthma action plans emphasize that exacerbations represent an acute or sub-acute worsening in symptoms and lung function, and that the term 'flare-up' is preferable for most patients; patients at increased risk of asthma-related death should be identified and flagged for more frequent review. All patients should be provided with a written asthma action plan appropriate for their age, current treatment, and reliever inhaler (short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-formoterol), with the plan stating when and how to change reliever and/or maintenance medications, use oral corticosteroids if needed, and access medical care if symptoms fail to respond; advise patients with a history of rapid deterioration to seek acute care or see their doctor immediately, and base the plan on changes in symptoms or (only in adults) peak expiratory flow (PEF).

Follow-up

Arrange early follow-up after any exacerbation, regardless of where it was managed:

- Review the patient's symptom control and risk factors for further exacerbations.
- Prescribe/continue ICS-containing controller therapy (preferably MART with ICS–formoterol) to reduce the risk of further exacerbations. If already taking controller therapy, continue increased doses for 2–4 weeks.
- Provide a written asthma action plan and, where relevant, advice about avoiding exacerbation triggers.
- Check inhaler technique and adherence.

Asthma outcomes after an ED presentation for acute asthma are significantly improved by comprehensive intervention programs that include optimal controller management, inhaler technique, and elements of self-management education (self-monitoring, written action plan, and regular review).

Referral for expert advice should be considered for patients who have been hospitalized for asthma or who have repeat presentations to acute care settings. Follow-up by a specialist is associated with fewer subsequent ED visits or hospitalizations and better asthma control.

### Systematic meta-review of supported self-management for asthma: a healthcare perspective [^115xhxvL]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Supported self-management has been recommended by asthma guidelines for three decades; improving current suboptimal implementation will require commitment from professionals, patients and healthcare organisations. The Practical Systematic Review of Self-Management Support (PRISMS) meta-review and Reducing Care Utilisation through Self-management Interventions (RECURSIVE) health economic review were commissioned to provide a systematic overview of supported self-management to inform implementation. We sought to investigate if supported asthma self-management reduces use of healthcare resources and improves asthma control; for which target groups it works; and which components and contextual factors contribute to effectiveness. Finally, we investigated the costs to healthcare services of providing supported self-management.

Methods

We undertook a meta-review (systematic overview) of systematic reviews updated with randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published since the review search dates, and health economic meta-analysis of RCTs. Twelve electronic databases were searched in 2012 (updated in 2015; pre-publication update January 2017) for systematic reviews reporting RCTs (and update RCTs) evaluating supported asthma self-management. We assessed the quality of included studies and undertook a meta-analysis and narrative synthesis.

Results

A total of 27 systematic reviews (n = 244 RCTs) and 13 update RCTs revealed that supported self-management can reduce hospitalisations, accident and emergency attendances and unscheduled consultations, and improve markers of control and quality of life for people with asthma across a range of cultural, demographic and healthcare settings. Core components are patient education, provision of an action plan and regular professional review. Self-management is most effective when delivered in the context of proactive long-term condition management. The total cost (n = 24 RCTs) of providing self-management support is offset by a reduction in hospitalisations and accident and emergency visits (standard mean difference 0.13, 95% confidence interval -0.09 to 0.34).

Conclusions

Evidence from a total of 270 RCTs confirms that supported self-management for asthma can reduce unscheduled care and improve asthma control, can be delivered effectively for diverse demographic and cultural groups, is applicable in a broad range of clinical settings, and does not significantly increase total healthcare costs. Informed by this comprehensive synthesis of the literature, clinicians, patient-interest groups, policy-makers and providers of healthcare services should prioritise provision of supported self-management for people with asthma as a core component of routine care.

### Optimizing adherence to medication to improve outcomes in asthma [^111rFtsH]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE

Research continues to indicate a high prevalence of suboptimal adherence in asthma, with significant impact on clinical outcomes and a complex network of determinant factors. It also describes promising approaches to improve adherence by a personalized approach to patient support and using digital tools to facilitate monitoring, communication, and coordination. How could this new evidence inform quality improvement work in specific clinical settings? Figure 1 summarizes a conceptual approach to interventions that can guide research on, and adoption of, adherence support innovation in clinical practice. Informed by established theory and methodological recommendations, it proposes five questions for reflection on optimizing adherence in a specific setting.

(1) First, new efforts dedicated to improving adherence need to be informed by an assessment of the current situation and its impact on clinical outcomes: is adherence a concern in this setting? The studies we reviewed show that this is the case in many settings globally. Confirming this hypothesis locally and ascertaining the extent of the problem gives compelling arguments for prioritization and underpins involvement of key stakeholders.
(2) Second, it is important to clarify which adherence behaviors are particularly challenging for patients and HCPs and need improvement? There is still a complex dynamic between underuse of ICS, poor inhaler technique, and overuse of SABA and OCS, resulting from a multifaceted interaction between prescriber, patient, and caregiver behaviors. Understanding this interplay and sequence of behaviors is essential for effective support. Given the variability of asthma, patient empowerment would require supporting them to adjust their preventer medication according to their asthma action plan
(3) Third, the behavioral determinants with the highest relevance in this setting need to be identified and prioritized to understand who is most at risk, and why do they struggle with adherence? Among the diverse range of determinants reported in the literature, a key distinction is to be made between nonmodifiable factors (such as age, sex, socioeconomic status) that may inform the selection of patient groups in need of more support, and modifiable factors (such as regimen complexity or medication beliefs), which may be the focus of the intervention itself.
(4) Once setting-specific information on adherence outcomes, behaviors, and determinants is obtained, a fourth question can be answered on how patients can be supported, by focusing intervention on specific target groups and selecting strategies to address the modifiable factors identified. The interventions reviewed above illustrate different options, such as supporting a broad group of inhaler users by a personalized approach that prioritizes intervention components (TAI and RACE) or focusing on enhancing support in school settings for children with asthma (TEAM-ED, RAL).
(5) A fifth question is increasingly asked in adherence research and has proven crucial for clinical practice: how can interventions be implemented? Understanding the constraints and opportunities in the setting in which an intervention is intended to function provides key information for adjusting the intervention content and delivery approach, which is also evaluated on implementation outcomes, such as feasibility or acceptability.

### Systematic meta-review of supported self-management for asthma: a healthcare perspective [^1157tH5G]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Interpretation of findings

The literature on asthma self-management is particularly well developed and may thus be an exemplar for other LTCs. The 16 systematic reviews reporting effectiveness were typically large (five included data from > 5000 participants) and had consistently positive results, suggesting a mature evidence base, unlikely to be influenced by further trials. Outcomes in subgroups were more often the subject of the update RCTs as the field moves on from demonstrating overall effectiveness to investigating the impact in specific target groups, demographic contexts, or mode of delivery.

Self-management support for asthma is a complex intervention and successful interventions were multi-component, including education, trigger avoidance, teaching self-monitoring, optimal treatment strategies, promotion of adherence and behaviour change techniques, many of which are common to self-management in other LTCs. Appropriately in a variable condition, the hallmark of asthma self-management is the provision of an action plan with advice on recognising and responding to deterioration in control. People with asthma, however, have broader concerns as they accommodate the condition within their lives and the action plan needs to be embedded in support for 'living with asthma'.

Individuals with LTCs adjust medical regimes and self-management strategies to fit into their own lives and health beliefs. Meta-reviews, for example in type 2 diabetes, hypertension and asthma, have emphasised the importance of culturally tailored interventions. Self-management support can be provided by many different professionals, often specialist nurses or LTC educators, but in some contexts the key personnel were community health workers or peer counsellors. Traditionally education is delivered face-to-face, but increasingly technology-based interventions are being developed as alternatives.

Self-management support interventions are an integral component of high-quality care for people with LTCs. Several of the systematic reviews demonstrated the synergy between self-management education and regular clinical review, and supported self-management is most effective when delivered within a proactive asthma management programme, or integrated within organisational routines. Only a minority of trials had follow-up periods over 12 months, and studies are needed to confirm long-term sustainability. Costs associated with self-management interventions are similar to usual care.

Asthma step-down to minimum effective treatment: Once good asthma control has been maintained for 2–3 months, consider stepping down gradually to find the lowest treatment that controls symptoms and exacerbations, provide a written asthma action plan, monitor closely with a follow-up visit, and do not completely withdraw ICS unless needed temporarily to confirm the diagnosis of asthma.

Continue collaborative optimization of patient care — ongoing management of a patient with severe asthma involves collaboration among the patient, the primary care physician, specialist(s), and other health professionals to optimize clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. Continue to review the patient every 3–6 months, including clinical asthma measures (symptom control, exacerbations, lung function), comorbidities, the patient's risk factors for exacerbations, treatments (check inhaler technique and adherence, review need for add-on treatments, assess side-effects including of oral corticosteroids [OCS], and optimize comorbidity management and non-pharmacologic strategies), and the patient's social and emotional needs. The optimal frequency and location of review will depend on the patient's asthma control, risk factors and comorbidities, and their confidence in self-management, and may depend on local payer requirements and availability of specialist physicians. Communicate regularly with the family physician and other members of the health care team about the outcome of review visits, patient concerns, an action plan for worsening asthma or other risks, changes to medications (asthma and non-asthma) and potential side-effects, and indications and contact details for expedited review.

Patients with more than 1–2 exacerbations per year despite Step 4–5 therapy (or Step 4 therapy in children 6–11 years), or with several emergency department visits, should be referred to a specialist center, if available, for assessment and strategies to reduce their risk of future exacerbations and their risk of exposure to OCS.

### WITHDRAWN: written individualised management plans for asthma in children and adults [^116w763q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Non-adherence to treatment advice is a common phenomenon in asthma and may account for a significant proportion of the morbidity. Comprehensive care that includes asthma education, a written self-management plan and regular review has been shown to improve asthma outcomes, but the contribution of these components has not been established.

Objectives

To determine whether the provision of a written asthma self-management plan increases adherence and improves outcome.

Search Strategy

We carried out a search on the Cochrane Airways Group trials register. There was no language restriction. The search of the databases used the following terms: action plan OR self OR self-care OR self-manag* OR educ* AND adher* OR comply OR compli*. We contacted authors of included studies for any unpublished or on-going studies and bibliographies of all included studies and reviews were searched for further studies. The most recent search was carried out in June 2004.

Selection Criteria

We only considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with asthma. Participants must have been assigned to receive an individualised written asthma management plan (symptom or peak flow based) about the actions required for regular asthma management and/or the actions to take in the event of an asthma exacerbation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed study quality and abstracted data.

Main Results

Seven trials met the inclusion criteria. The written management plans were either peak flow or symptom based, which were compared against each other or compared to no written management plan. Reported outcomes included: medication adherence, hospitalisation, emergency department visits, oral corticosteroid use, lung function, days lost from school/work, unscheduled doctor visits and respiratory tract infections. There was no consistent evidence that written plans produced better patient outcomes than no written plan. For some outcomes, there appeared to be an advantage of one type of plan over the other, but there was no consistency - one type of plan was not consistently more effective than another.

Authors' Conclusions

The available trials are too small and the results too few and inconsistent to form any firm conclusions as to the contribution of written self management plans in the known beneficial effects of a comprehensive asthma care programme.

### Lessons learnt from a primary care asthma improvement project [^116Yh2e4]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Despite national guidelines being available for the diagnosis and management of asthma since 1993, the quality of the diagnosis remains poorand patients continue to die unnecessarily. Key recommendations from the National Review of Asthma Deaths include better education for patients, parents and healthcare professionals, better monitoring of asthma control, and the provision of a Personal Asthma Action Plan for all patients. This pilot project aims to improve adherence to national and international guidelines and address the key recommendations of the National Review of Asthma Deaths. Although only performed in three primary care sites, our project has encountered many challenges in undertaking data extraction and the setting up of an asthma education and training programme. Many of the above challenges are broad and not specific to asthma. We hope that this will arm future researchers with information on, and understanding of, the challenges they may well encounter. We hope that this will help similar future studies in asthma or other disease states in the UK and in other coutries.

### Do patients of subspecialist physicians benefit from written asthma action plans? [^113QqNNd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Rationale

Asthma clinical guidelines suggest written asthma action plans are essential for improving self-management and outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of written instructions in the form of a written asthma action plan provided by subspecialist physicians as part of usual asthma care during office visits.

Methods

A total of 407 children and adults with persistent asthma receiving first-time care in pulmonary and allergy practices at 4 urban medical centers were randomized to receive either written instructions (n = 204) or no written instructions other than prescriptions (n = 203) from physicians.

Measurements and Main Results

Using written asthma action plan forms as a vehicle for providing self-management instructions did not have a significant effect on any of the primary outcomes: (1) asthma symptom frequency, (2) emergency visits, or (3) asthma quality of life from baseline to 12-month follow-up. Both groups showed similar and significant reductions in asthma symptom frequency (daytime symptoms [P < 0.0001], nocturnal symptoms [P < 0.0001], β-agonist use [P < 0.0001]). There was also a significant reduction in emergency visits for the intervention (P < 0.0001) and control (P < 0.0006) groups. There was significant improvement in asthma quality-of-life scores for adults (P < 0.0001) and pediatric caregivers (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Our results suggest that using a written asthma action plan form as a vehicle for providing asthma management instructions to patients with persistent asthma who are receiving subspecialty care for the first time confers no added benefit beyond subspecialty-based medical care and education for asthma. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 00149461).

Patient education and asthma action plans (AAPs) — educating patients with current, relevant, evidence-based information helps patients be more involved in shared decision making and is generally considered the standard of care; patient education should include a structured patient-centered conversation, evidence-based education documents, and a discussion about ongoing follow-up, and components of a patient-centered education plan should include the goals of education, assessment of baseline asthma literacy, information about the disease and symptoms, identification of disease triggers and how to control them, skills training, identification of medications and their use, and when to seek additional medical help; this education should be tailored to the patient's needs, values, and literacy; educational programs for patients with asthma should include a written AAP, with routine review and update of AAPs integrated into regular medical follow-up; multiple different educational modalities are available and should be evaluated and utilized to ensure complete patient understanding; formats for AAPs can vary significantly, but the main feature includes instructions to help maintain daily control and to recognize and respond to loss of control; a patient focus group suggested that patients are receptive to AAPs, which provide an organized approach for day-to-day management and a plan for what to do when loss of symptom control occurs.

### Balancing the needs of the many and the few: where next for adult asthma guidelines? [^114uR6NB]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Asthma differs from many other chronic conditions in that most key management decisions are made in non-specialist settings, such as general practitioner surgeries and accident and emergency departments. Diagnosis in primary care relies on recognition of a characteristic pattern of symptoms and the occurrence of asthma attacks, sometimes supplemented by basic lung function tests. Ongoing management is guided by the assessment of symptoms and simple lung function measures of airflow obstruction, with little attempt made to personalise management. This approach is flawed because the inadequate specificity of symptoms, as well as the low sensitivity of variable airflow obstruction, means that a diagnosis of asthma is often difficult to exclude with confidence. Moreover, even if diagnosed correctly, dissociation between inflammation, airflow obstruction, and symptoms means that a generalised stepwise approach to managing asthma on the basis of symptoms is unlikely to be successful in a substantial proportion of patients. As a result, effective treatments are used inefficiently, and outcomes are often worse than they could be. Rather than use of either a population-based or personalised approach for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we recommend a new combined approach, in which treatment decisions are driven by objective assessment of key treatable mechanistic traits.

### Enablers and determinants of the provision of written action plans to patients with asthma: a stratified survey of Canadian physicians [^1165FtRL]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Most patients with asthma have poor or suboptimal control of their disease with frequent symptoms, activity limitation, exacerbations, and health care resources consumption. To maximise asthma control, international and national asthma guidelines recommend self-management asthma education, regular medical review, and the provision of a written action plan (WAP). – A WAP is a personalised document that details how to maintain asthma control, what to do when losing control (i.e. when and what medication to increase or commence), and when to seek medical attention in case of loss of control. Strong evidence supports the beneficial effect on health outcomes of asthma education that included the provision of a WAP. Importantly, randomised paediatric trials confirmed the individual contribution of WAP itself to increase treatment adherence, reduce exacerbations, and improve control of asthma, whether the WAP was used as an adjunct to asthma education, or alone upon discharge from the emergency department. Yet, while patients have strongly endorsed their usefulness, less than 30% of patients with asthma presenting to the acute care setting, or in general population surveys own a WAP.

Best Practice Advice 3: Recognize and support education and management plans addressing exacerbation risk for people with all severities of asthma

Asthma exacerbations can occur in all severities of asthma despite guideline-directed treatment. A history of ED visits or hospitalization for an exacerbation increase the risk of future exacerbations, irrespective of severity, patient demographics, or clinical characteristics. Patients with intermittent, mild, and moderate asthma are all at risk for exacerbations, which is often related to unrecognized lack of asthma control.

Recently in the US, approximately 60% of adults and 44% of children were reported to have uncontrolled asthma, with more than 80% of whom had mild or moderate asthma. In an international cohort of 1115 patients classified as GINA Step 1 or Step 2, 25% had uncontrolled asthma and about 33% reported rescue inhaler use in the previous 4 weeks. Based on United Kingdom data from the National Review of Asthma Deaths, up to 45% of patients across asthma severities dies without seeking medical assistance or before emergency care could be provided, indicating a need for improved education and management plans.

Appropriate and optimal therapy to minimize symptoms, exacerbations risk, and routine exacerbation assessment and history is important for all patients with asthma, regardless of severity.

### Individualized asthma self-management improves medication adherence and markers of asthma control [^1171EpWs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Adherence to inhaled anti-inflammatory therapy and self-management skills are essential parts of the asthma treatment plan to improve asthma control and prevent exacerbations. Whether self-management education improves long-term medication adherence is less clear.

Objective

A 24-week prospective, randomized controlled trial was performed to study the effect of self-management education on long-term adherence to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy and markers of asthma control.

Methods

After stabilization on ICS medication during a run-in phase, 95 adults with moderate-to-severe asthma were recruited from a large metropolitan community, and 84 were randomized to individualized self-management education, including self-monitoring of symptoms and peak flow or usual care with self-monitoring alone. The key components of the 30-minute intervention were asthma information, assessment, and correction of inhaler technique; an individualized action plan based on self-monitoring data; and environmental control strategies for relevant allergen and irritant exposures. The intervention was personalized based on pulmonary function, allergen skin test reactivity, and inhaler technique and reinforced at 2-week intervals.

Results

Participants randomized to the self-management intervention maintained consistently higher ICS adherence levels and showed a 9-fold greater odds of more than 60% adherence to the prescribed dose compared with control subjects at the end of the intervention (P = 0.02) and maintained a 3-fold greater odds of higher than 60% adherence at the end of the study. Perceived control of asthma improved (P = 0.006), nighttime awakenings decreased (P = 0.03), and inhaled beta-agonist use decreased (P = 0.01) in intervention participants compared with control subjects.

Conclusion

Our results show that individualized asthma self-management education attenuates the usual decrease in medication adherence and improves clinical markers of asthma control.

Asthma action plan (AAP) implementation and evidence — rationale and strength: The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low and the topic was categorized as Reviewed, Amended; however, the benefits of a written AAP to improve asthma control and asthma-related quality of life slightly outweighed the potential harm, and thus the Work Group decided upon a Weak For recommendation. Patient and practice considerations noted that AAPs were important to patient and caregiver care, but providers may see AAP completion and education as a burden with variable staff training, significant time needed, and practical issues such as availability of printers or electronic means; integration of the AAP into the Electronic Health Record (EHR) can facilitate regular review and adjustment, and patients vary in confidence with self-managing asthma which can lead to overusing the healthcare system or delaying treatment.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115MkVWQ]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma management cycle for personalized asthma care involves a continual cycle of assessment, adjustment of treatment and review. Assess the patient's symptom control and their risk factors for exacerbations, for decline in lung function and for medication adverse effects, with particular attention to inhaler technique and adherence; assess comorbidities and the patient's goals and preferences, and confirm the diagnosis of asthma if not yet done. Adjust the patient's management based on these assessments, including treatment of modifiable risk factors and comorbidities, relevant non-pharmacologic strategies, education and skills training, and adjustment of medication as required; for adults and adolescents, the preferred controller and reliever treatment across all steps is with combination ICS-formoterol, as shown in GINA Track 1. Review the patient in line with the goals of treatment, reassess factors affecting symptoms, risk of adverse outcomes and patient satisfaction, arrange further investigations if needed, and readjust treatment if needed.

Best Practice Advice 7: After an exacerbation, request a patient follow up visit within a short time to explore steps to prevent future exacerbations; these may include providing self-management education, inhaler technique review, adherence evaluation, smoking cessation advice, and an updated asthma action plan, and updating immunizations

Effective asthma self-management education includes helping patients understand self-monitoring of symptoms and/or lung function (PEF) and their written asthma action plan. A follow up visit after an exacerbation is essential to review any persistent symptoms, assess current therapy, evaluate and manage modifiable risk factors (such as causative triggers like viral infections — especially those preventable by vaccines [e.g. influenza, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], SARS-CoV-2] — and allergies, continued smoking or smoke exposure, obesity, poor adherence, and poor inhaler technique), recommend indicated immunizations, and update the asthma action plan. Immediately after an asthma exacerbation can be an effective time to reinforce these concepts with patients as they may be more motivated to prevent future exacerbations with the current exacerbation fresh in their mind.

Clinicians treating a patient with an asthma exacerbation in an ER should add anti-inflammatory treatment with ICS to inhaled bronchodilators at discharge and recommend an appointment with the patient's PCC within a short time (3–4 days) while providing a discharge letter including a written asthma action plan.

Principles of self-management of exacerbations via a written asthma action plan include:
How to assess symptoms and detect worsening symptoms that may precede an exacerbation early on
How to assess lung function using PEF (if applicable)
When and how to increase reliever (ICS plus rapid acting bronchodilator) treatment
When and how to increase controller therapy
How to review response to treatment and assess next steps
When to contact clinician or emergency services

How can we improve asthma control and prevent exacerbations?

Approaches to improving asthma control include patient and HCP education, regular review and assessment of asthma status and inhaler technique along with use of a wide range of interventions and technologies to try to improve adherence to inhaled asthma medications. These include enhancing communication skills, structured frameworks such as SIMPLES (Smoking status, Inhaler technique, Monitoring, Pharmacotherapy, Lifestyle, Education, Support) and various forms of electronic monitoring, with or without reminders for when to take controller medication.

Improving adherence

A recent Cochrane review included 28 studies regarding a range of interventions to improve adherence to ICS maintenance therapy for asthma. The authors concluded that patient education, electronic trackers or reminders and simplified regimens generally improved adherence but did not consistently translate into observable benefit for clinical outcomes. In a study by Foster et al. despite personalised adherence discussions or inhaler reminders and feedback in connection with prescribed fixed combination ICS/LABA controller therapy, adherence decreased over 6 months to as low as ~38% with personalised advice whilst electronically measured adherence decreased to 60% even in patients given inhaler reminders and feedback. Even after potentially life-threatening emergency department visits, adherence to ICS maintenance decreased to 50% within the first week after discharge.

Asthma action plans

Optimal self-management involving provision of a written asthma action plan was shown to reduce unscheduled primary care visits and hospitalisations in a Cochrane review. However, education alone was not included in the analysis as previous work had shown that without an action plan, self-monitoring or regular review, information-only education had no significant impact on objective health outcomes. All asthmatics should be offered a self-management action plan that advises them how to recognise and respond to a deterioration in their level of asthma control. Self-management plans that involve patients doubling their ICS dose when symptoms worsen do not appear to be fully effective in preventing exacerbations, although it has recently been shown that a temporary four-fold increase in ICS had some beneficial effects.

### Options for self-management education for adults with asthma [^116Jg7NY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma education and self-management are key recommendations of asthma management guidelines because they improve health outcomes. There are several different modalities for the delivery of asthma self-management education.

Objectives

We evaluated programmes that: 1) Optimised asthma control through inhaled corticosteroid use by regular medical review or optimised asthma control by individualised written action plans 2) Used written self-management plans based on peak expiratory flow self-monitoring compared with symptom self-monitoring 3) Compared different options for the delivery of optimal self-management programmes.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of asthma self-management education interventions in adults over 16 years of age with asthma.

Data Collection and Analysis

Fifteen trials met the inclusion criteria. Trial quality was assessed and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Study authors were contacted for confirmation.

Main Results

1) Six studies compared optimal self-management allowing self-adjustment of medications according to an individualised written action plan to adjustment of medications by a doctor. These two styles of asthma management gave equivalent effects for hospitalisation, ER visits, unscheduled doctor visits and nocturnal asthma. 2) Self-management using a written action plan based on PEF was found to be equivalent to self-management using a symptoms based written action plan in the six studies which compared these interventions. 3) Three studies compared self-management options. In one, that provided optimal therapy but tested the omission of regular review, the latter was associated with more health centre visits and sickness days. In another, comparing high and low intensity education, the latter was associated with more unscheduled doctor visits. In a third, no difference in health care utilisation or lung function was reported between verbal instruction and written action plans.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Optimal self-management allowing for optimisation of asthma control by adjustment of medications may be conducted by either self-adjustment with the aid of a written action plan or by regular medical review. Individualised written action plans based on peak expiratory flow are equivalent to action plans based on symptoms. Reducing the intensity of self-management education or level of clinical review may reduce its effectiveness.

### Comparison of national and global asthma management guiding documents [^1152timh]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic disease that affects both adults and children, and that continues to have a high economic burden. Asthma management guidelines were first developed nearly 30 years ago to standardize care, maintain asthma control, improve quality of life, maintain normal lung function, prevent exacerbations, and prevent asthma mortality. The two most common asthma guidelines used today were developed by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Expert Panel Working Group and the Global Initiative for Asthma Science Committee. Both guiding documents use scientific methodology to standardize their approach for formulating recommendations based on pertinent literature. Before the 2020 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (Expert Panel Report 4), nothing had been released since the 2007 guidelines, whereas the Global Initiative for Asthma publishes updates annually. Although each of these asthma strategies is similar, there are some noted differences. Over the years, the focus of asthma treatment has shifted from acute to chronic management. Frontline respiratory therapists and other health-care providers should have a good understanding of these 2 guiding references and how they can impact acute and chronic asthma management. The primary focus of this narrative is to look at the similarities and differences of these 2 guiding documents as they pertain to the 6 key questions identified by the Expert Panel of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program.

Despite these worrying trends, the disease management approach to asthma control can help most asthma patients achieve a 'normal' way of life. The increased prevalence and greater diagnostic awareness of asthma have placed increased demands on healthcare resources, but effective asthma control can minimize the personal, social and economic burdens of asthma. Early diagnosis and immediate anti-inflammatory treatment is the first step in gaining control of symptoms. A stepwise approach is then used to classify asthma severity and treatment, with the number and frequency of medications increasing (step up) as asthma severity increases and decreasing (step down) when asthma is under control. This stepwise approach to asthma management necessitates regular review of treatment once asthma is under control. However, effective asthma management is dependent on successful patient education, adherence to prescribed medication and good doctor patient partnerships. Current treatment guidelines recommend the use of a written asthma management plan that should be agreed between the doctor and patient. These plans should cover all aspects of asthma treatment, including prevention steps for long-term control and action steps to stop attacks once a worsening in asthma has been recognized. This comprehensive approach to asthma management increases the likelihood of achieving asthma control, which in turn reduces the need for emergency visits to the hospital or clinic and reduces the limitations on physical activity previously imposed by the condition.

Discussion

Summary of key findings

Overall, our synthesis of the evidence regarding educational initiatives for professionals involved in self-management support for people with asthma determined that what evidence exists is of unclear or high risk of bias. We synthesised evidence from 15 studies; seven reported at least one positive outcome. Three of six initiatives improved action plan provision/ownership; one of two improved asthma control; and two of seven decreased rates of unscheduled care. All initiatives used educational materials and addressed participants' knowledge; most used educational meetings and addressed skills. Initiatives with some evidence of effectiveness were more often identified as being explicitly based on clinical practice guidelines; involving local opinion leaders; and including inter-professional education. Effective initiatives were also more likely to have addressed the TDF domains 'social influences', 'environmental context and resources', 'behavioural regulation', 'beliefs about consequences', and 'social/professional role and identity'. It was not possible to draw any conclusions relating to potential links between initiative features and specific outcomes. Due to the complex multi-component nature of these initiatives and the diverse contexts in which they were delivered, it is not possible to conclude with certainty that using these strategies and targeting these domains will result in an intervention being effective. Rather, this initial evidence indicates that these represent plausible approaches and targets for future implementation studies aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies in improvng the provision of supported self-management for asthma.

### Diagnosis and management of asthma in children [^114PfQ9H]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Asthma is the the most common chronic respiratory condition of childhood worldwide, with around 14% of children and young people affected. Despite the high prevalence, paediatric asthma outcomes are inadequate, and there are several avoidable deaths each year. Characteristic asthma features include wheeze, shortness of breath and cough, which are typically triggered by a number of possible stimuli. There are several diagnostic challenges, and as a result, both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of paediatric asthma remain problematic. Effective asthma management involves a holistic approach addressing both pharmacological and non-pharmacological management, as well as education and self-management aspects. Working in partnership with children and families is key in promoting good outcomes. Education on how to take treatment effectively, trigger avoidance, modifiable risk factors and actions to take during acute attacks via personalised asthma action plans is essential. This review aimed to provide an overview of good clinical practice in the diagnosis and management of paediatric asthma. We discuss the current diagnostic challenges and predictors of life-threatening attacks. Additionally, we outline the similarities and differences in global paediatric asthma guidelines and highlight potential future developments in care. It is hoped that this review will be useful for healthcare providers working in a range of child health settings.

Assess control and follow-up — before stepping therapy, "First check adherence, inhaler technique, environmental factors, and comorbid conditions". If control is inadequate, "Step up if needed; reassess in 2–6 weeks", and if control is maintained, "Step down if possible (if asthma is well controlled for at least 3 consecutive months)". Referral guidance states, "Consult with asthma specialist if Step 4 or higher is required. Consider consultation at Step 3". The figure emphasizes that "Control assessment is a key element of asthma care. This involves both impairment and risk. Use of objective measures, self-reported control, and health care utilization are complementary and should be employed on an ongoing basis, depending on the individual's clinical situation".

### Using a narrative approach to enhance clinical care for patients with asthma [^114oPgGP]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

There are currently > 230 million people in the world with asthma, and asthma attacks result in the hospitalization of someone every 7 min. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute outlines four components of clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma, which tend to take a biomedical focus: (1) measures of assessment and monitoring, obtained by objective tests, physical examination, patient history, and patient report, to diagnose and assess the characteristics and severity of asthma and to monitor whether asthma control is achieved and maintained; (2) education for a partnership in asthma care; (3) control of environmental factors and comorbid conditions that affect asthma; and (4) pharmacologic therapy. Many national guidelines include providing patients with asthma with (1) written action plans, (2) inhaler technique training, and (3) structured annual reviews. Although current guidelines help improve clinical processes of care for asthma, there is also a need to improve self-care of asthma by empowering individuals to take more control of their condition. There is a growing appreciation that a narrative approach with patients with asthma, which focuses on the illness experience and aims to enhance patient-clinician understanding, might improve self-care. We explore how a framework for clinicians to listen to patients' stories, developed from research on individuals with asthma, might enhance communication, improve patient-clinician relationship, and foster better patient self-care. The article closes with the implications of this approach for clinical practice and future research.

Making decisions about asthma treatment — Asthma treatment is adjusted in a continual cycle of assessment, treatment, and review of the patient's response in both symptom control and future risk (of exacerbations and side-effects), and of patient preferences. For population-level decisions about asthma medications, the 'preferred' regimens in Steps 1–4 represent the best treatments for most patients based on evidence about safety, efficacy and effectiveness, with emphasis on symptom burden and exacerbation risk, and for Steps 1–5 there are different preferred population-level recommendations for adults/adolescents, children 6–11 years, and children 5 years and younger, with Step 5 also differing by inflammatory phenotype (Type 2 or non-Type 2). For individual patients, shared decision-making about treatment should also consider characteristics, phenotype or environmental exposures that predict risk or response, together with the patient's goals or concerns and practical issues (inhaler technique, adherence, medication access and cost to the patient). Optimize asthma management, including inhaled therapy and non-pharmacologic strategies, to reduce the need for oral corticosteroids (OCS) and their multiple associated adverse effects.

Asthma step-down — general principles: Consider stepping down when asthma symptoms have been well controlled and lung function has been stable for at least 3 months, choose an appropriate time (no respiratory infection, patient not travelling, not pregnant), approach each step as a therapeutic trial with documentation, action plan, monitoring and follow-up, and if risk factors such as a history of exacerbations or persistent airflow limitation are present, step down only with close supervision; stepping down inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) doses by 25–50% at 3-month intervals is feasible and safe for most patients.

### Personalised care planning for adults with chronic or long-term health conditions [^115feiaN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Personalised care planning is a collaborative process used in chronic condition management in which patients and clinicians identify and discuss problems caused by or related to the patient's condition, and develop a plan for tackling these. In essence it is a conversation, or series of conversations, in which they jointly agree goals and actions for managing the patient's condition.

Objectives

To assess the effects of personalised care planning for adults with long-term health conditions compared to usual care (i.e. forms of care in which active involvement of patients in treatment and management decisions is not explicitly attempted or achieved).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ProQuest, clinicaltrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to July 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials and cluster-randomised trials involving adults with long-term conditions where the intervention included collaborative (between individual patients and clinicians) goal setting and action planning. We excluded studies where there was little or no opportunity for the patient to have meaningful influence on goal selection, choice of treatment or support package, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two of three review authors independently screened citations for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes were effects on physical health, psychological health, subjective health status, and capabilities for self management. Secondary outcomes included effects on health-related behaviours, resource use and costs, and type of intervention. A patient advisory group of people with experience of living with long-term conditions advised on various aspects of the review, including the protocol, selection of outcome measures and emerging findings.

Main Results

We included 19 studies involving a total of 10,856 participants. Twelve of these studies focused on diabetes, three on mental health, one on heart failure, one on end-stage renal disease, one on asthma, and one on various chronic conditions. All 19 studies included components that were intended to support behaviour change among patients, involving either face-to-face or telephone support. All but three of the personalised care planning interventions took place in primary care or community settings; the remaining three were located in hospital clinics. There was some concern about risk of bias for each of the included studies in respect of one or more criteria, usually due to inadequate or unclear descriptions of research methods. Physical healthNine studies measured glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), giving a combined mean difference (MD) between intervention and control of -0.24% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.35 to -0.14), a small positive effect in favour of personalised care planning compared to usual care (moderate quality evidence). Six studies measured systolic blood pressure, a combined mean difference of -2.64 mm/Hg (95% CI -4.47 to -0.82) favouring personalised care (moderate quality evidence). The pooled results from four studies showed no significant effect on diastolic blood pressure, MD -0.71 mm/Hg (95% CI -2.26 to 0.84). We found no evidence of an effect on cholesterol (LDL-C), standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.01 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.11) (five studies) or body mass index, MD -0.11 (95% CI -0.35 to 0.13) (four studies). A single study of people with asthma reported that personalised care planning led to improvements in lung function and asthma control. Psychological healthSix studies measured depression. We were able to pool results from five of these, giving an SMD of -0.36 (95% CI -0.52 to -0.20), a small effect in favour of personalised care (moderate quality evidence). The remaining study found greater improvement in the control group than the intervention group. Four other studies used a variety of psychological measures that were conceptually different so could not be pooled. Of these, three found greater improvement for the personalised care group than the usual care group and one was too small to detect differences in outcomes. Subjective health statusTen studies used various patient-reported measures of health status (or health-related quality of life), including both generic health status measures and condition-specific ones. We were able to pool data from three studies that used the SF-36 or SF-12, but found no effect on the physical component summary score SMD 0.16 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.38) or the mental component summary score SMD 0.07 (95% CI -0.15 to 0.28) (moderate quality evidence). Of the three other studies that measured generic health status, two found improvements related to personalised care and one did not. Four studies measured condition-specific health status. The combined results showed no difference between the intervention and control groups, SMD -0.01 (95% CI -0.11 to 0.10) (moderate quality evidence). Self-management capabilitiesNine studies looked at the effect of personalised care on self-management capabilities using a variety of outcome measures, but they focused primarily on self efficacy. We were able to pool results from five studies that measured self efficacy, giving a small positive result in favour of personalised care planning: SMD 0.25 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.43) (moderate quality evidence). A further five studies measured other attributes that contribute to self-management capabilities. The results from these were mixed: two studies found evidence of an effect on patient activation, one found an effect on empowerment, and one found improvements in perceived interpersonal support. Other outcomesPooled data from five studies on exercise levels showed no effect due to personalised care planning, but there was a positive effect on people's self-reported ability to carry out self-care activities: SMD 0.35 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.52). We found no evidence of adverse effects due to personalised care planning. The effects of personalised care planning were greater when more stages of the care planning cycle were completed, when contacts between patients and health professionals were more frequent, and when the patient's usual clinician was involved in the process.

Authors' Conclusions

Personalised care planning leads to improvements in certain indicators of physical and psychological health status, and people's capability to self-manage their condition when compared to usual care. The effects are not large, but they appear greater when the intervention is more comprehensive, more intensive, and better integrated into routine care.

### Self-management interventions to reduce healthcare use and improve quality of life among patients with asthma: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113jnGPG]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Understanding the action to take if asthma deteriorates is a core component of supported self-management of a variable condition such as asthma. Our finding that self-monitoring as an isolated intervention was ineffective raises concerns about the plethora of available smartphone applications enabling logging of symptoms or peak flows but with no advice on how to respond to deterioration. Only a few of the available applications adhere to the legislative requirements so that they can link monitoring to personalised actions recommended by the patient's healthcare adviser.

For three decades, guidelines have recommended written action plans as a device for summarising the self-management discussion between the patient and their professional adviser. Not all the randomised controlled trials included in our analysis used written action plans to reinforce advice in their self-management interventions. The format in which information is given to patients is not necessarily the crucial component, as long as the actions to be taken if asthma deteriorates are discussed, understood, agreed, and reinforced regularly. Crucially, information on managing an unexpected acute event needs to be available for reference when the attack arises (whether written, digital, online, or whatever medium is most convenient). A copy stored on the patient's electronic health record would help to ensure consistency in advice from different professionals.

Implementation remains challenging. Pressures of time, organisational barriers, and the need to develop professional skills, as well as negative views about the usefulness of action plans, are barriers to adoption of supported self-management into routine clinical practice. Our findings suggest that initiatives that facilitate regular review (including mobile phone and internet interventions), ensure that reviews are appropriate (for example, to cultural needs), or involve non-medical or peer supportmay offer promise for future implementation and research endeavours.

Conclusions

Our findings not only confirm the clinical benefit of supported self-management for adults, adolescents, and children with asthma but provide practical guidance for models of service that are likely to be effective. Future research and policy investments should focus on implementing regularly supported self-management offering regular reviews totalling at least two hours to establish self-management skills. This investment in time is offset by a reduction in unscheduled healthcare use. Multidisciplinary case management should be reserved for patients with complex disease. Our analysis thus brings clarity to the support needed for effective asthma self-management, which will inform guidelines, influence policy based decisions, and enable healthcare professionals and managers to optimise self-management programmes to realise the potential benefits for people living with asthma.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^113cb6mr]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD asthma guideline — considerations for stepping down therapy detail patient selection, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) tapering, long-acting beta agonist (LABA) discontinuation, and action planning. Do not reduce ICS dose in patients who cannot be closely monitored, such as those who are planning to travel or have inconsistent follow-up appointments, and avoid stepping down in individuals at high risk of severe exacerbations, such as pregnant individuals or those with recent acute illnesses. For tapering, decrease the ICS dose gradually by 25–50% every 3 months with the goal to reach the lowest effective maintenance dose that continues to control asthma symptoms, and assess asthma symptoms regularly throughout the tapering process to ensure stable control. LABAs can generally be discontinued without a taper, as they do not require a gradual reduction like ICS. Patients should have a written action plan to monitor for any signs of worsening asthma; ensure that the patient has a written asthma action plan that includes instructions for recognizing early signs of worsening asthma and steps to take, including medication adjustments and when to seek medical attention, and make sure they have access to adequate medication and know what actions to take if symptoms return or worsen after discontinuing LABA or stepping down the ICS.

### Overview of changes to asthma guidelines: diagnosis and screening [^112EVSqA]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

The Expert Panel Report 3 of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program represents a major advance in the approach to asthma care by emphasizing the monitoring of clinically relevant aspects of care and the importance of planned primary care, and by providing patients practical tools for self-management. Treatment of asthma should be guided by a new system of classification that assesses severity at initial evaluation and control at all subsequent visits. Asthma severity is determined by current impairment (as evidenced by impact on day-to-day activities) and risk of future exacerbations (as evidenced by frequency of oral systemic corticosteroid use), and allows categorization of disease as intermittent, persistent-mild, persistent-moderate, and persistent-severe. Initial treatment is guided by the disease-severity category. The degree of control is also determined by the analysis of current impairment and future risk. Validated questionnaires can be used for following the impairment domain of control with patients whose asthma is categorized as "well controlled", "not well controlled", and "very poorly controlled". Decisions about medication adjustment and planned follow-up are based on the category of disease control. Whereas a stepwise approach for asthma management continues to be recommended, the number of possible steps has increased.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111vtVHL]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbation self-management with a written asthma action plan — All patients with asthma, and parents/caregivers of children with asthma, should be provided with guided self-management education that includes monitoring of symptoms and/or lung function, a written asthma action plan, and regular review by a health professional; a written (i.e., documented) asthma action plan may be printed, digital, or pictorial, to suit the patient's needs and literacy. A written asthma action plan should include specific instructions for the patient about changes to reliever and/or maintenance medications, when and how to use oral corticosteroids (OCS) if needed, and when and how to access medical care. In studies that evaluated an increase in maintenance ICS-containing treatment, this was usually initiated when there was a clinically important change from the patient's usual level of asthma control, for example if asthma symptoms were interfering with normal activities, or PEF had fallen by > 20% for more than 2 days. For patients prescribed an anti-inflammatory reliever (as-needed combination ICS-formoterol or ICS-SABA), this provides a small extra dose of ICS as well as a rapid-acting bronchodilator without delay whenever the reliever is used, as the first step in the patient's action plan; this approach reduces the risk of progressing to severe exacerbation and need for oral corticosteroids. In the case of as-needed ICS-formoterol, both the ICS and the formoterol appear to contribute to the reduction in severe exacerbations compared with using a SABA reliever. A specific action plan template is available for patients prescribed maintenance-and-reliever therapy with ICS-formoterol; it can also be modified for patients prescribed as-needed-only ICS-formoterol.

### Asthma action plans are highly variable and do not conform to best visual design practices [^11541cQU]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma action plans improve asthma outcomes and are recommended in guidelines. However, delivery by physicians and usage by patients remain low. This may be because of variability in existing plans and a failure to consider visual design and usability factors in plan development.

Objective

To characterize the variability in both the content and the format of existing plans, and the extent to which their format conforms to evidence-based visual design recommendations.

Methods

We collected plans from the internet, Canadian experts and associations, guidelines, and published trials. We inductively developed analytic criteria for format and content analyses.

Results

We collected 69 unique English or French-language adult outpatient plans from around the world. We found large variability in format, and plans fulfilled a mean of only 3.5 out of 8 evidence-based visual design recommendations. Content was also variable, including different descriptions of the baseline clinical state and descriptions and instructions at each "action point" (point recommending a change in treatment).

Conclusion

Existing plans vary widely in content and format. Accordingly, studies evaluating the effectiveness of action plans may not be directly comparable. Also, visual design may affect usability, uptake, and effectiveness. Our results suggest that this has not been adequately addressed in most plans, and design evidence and experts should be included in future development.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^11392SEF]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Sidebar E: Asthma education and self-management support — Patients and caregivers should be informed of the diagnosis of asthma, their current understanding and treatment adherence should be assessed, they should be provided evidence-based education and materials/resources, and they should be given the opportunity to ask questions so they can fully understand their asthma; consistent follow-up should ensure confidence to self-manage and take a more active role with their healthcare team. Asthma education should include basic pathophysiology of asthma, typical asthma symptoms, how to identify well-controlled asthma, asthma patterns (exercise, nocturnal symptoms, and seasonal allergens) and risk factors, asthma exacerbations and precipitating triggers, goals of treatment and use of Asthma Action Plan, medication use (e.g., what it does, how to use it, potential side effects, and rationale for why each medication was selected) including assessment of device technique, how to recognize loss of asthma control and steps to take to regain control of symptoms, and when and how to seek emergency care for asthma exacerbations. The guideline further states to consider a personalized written asthma action plan and consider a team approach to asthma management, and to address lifestyle changes and psychosocial considerations.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Childcare centers and preschool settings — because young children spend much time in daycare, childcare centers can be an essential focus to implement the recommendations by the NAEPP's plan for asthma preparedness, and availability of asthma medications, current AAPs, and asthma policies can enhance asthma management and increase cooperation with clinicians and childcare centers in low-income areas. Without a nurse in most daycare facilities, a multilayered approach providing education to staff, parents, children, and primary care providers can strengthen asthma control in preschoolers.
