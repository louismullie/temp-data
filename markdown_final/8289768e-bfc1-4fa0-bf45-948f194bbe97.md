## Question

Male fertility after chemo

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how chemotherapy affects male fertility, including mechanisms, risk stratification, recovery, preservation strategies, and post-treatment planning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline fertility status of men with cancer before therapy. Then, I should verify the principal mechanisms of gonadotoxicity. Next, I will risk-stratify by regimen and dose, followed by examining recovery kinetics and genetic risks. After that, I need to check fertility preservation options and their timing. Then, I should review post-treatment assessment and assisted reproduction. Finally, I will consider special populations, counseling gaps, and synthesize practical recommendations with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the baseline fertility context, because I need to ensure I am not attributing all impairment to treatment alone. Many men with cancer already have abnormal semen parameters at diagnosis, so baseline semen analysis and counseling should occur before any therapy, and the urgency of cancer treatment may limit the number of specimens that can be banked, which should not deter sperm cryopreservation when feasible [^114EhWMM] [^111PbgZ4].

> I will now examine the mechanisms of gonadotoxicity, and I should double-check that I capture both germ cell and somatic effects. Chemotherapy damages rapidly dividing germ cells, with spermatogonia being particularly vulnerable, and can also injure Sertoli and Leydig cells and disrupt the hypothalamic–pituitary–testicular axis, leading to impaired spermatogenesis, endocrine dysfunction, and ejaculatory problems depending on the regimen and surgical exposures [^113Nqz9H] [^116motMS].

> Next, I should review risk stratification by regimen, and hold on, let me verify the highest-risk classes. Alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide and platinum-based agents like cisplatin carry the greatest risk of prolonged or permanent azoospermia, with dose-dependent effects captured by the cyclophosphamide-equivalent dose model, where each 1 g/m² increase in CED associates with about a 22% higher risk of persistent oligospermia and high-dose regimens can approach 60% irreversible azoospermia in some series [^114RHqoS] [^1141gybL]. In contrast, topoisomerase inhibitors, antimetabolites, and microtubule-targeted agents often cause transient declines with recovery in 1–2 years, though I should confirm that individual responses vary and combinations can alter risk [^1141gybL] [^113Nqz9H].

> Wait, let me verify the dose thresholds and exemplar regimens so I do not overgeneralize. High cumulative cyclophosphamide above roughly 9.5 g/m² and pelvic radiation markedly increase the risk of permanent azoospermia, whereas CED below about 4 g/m² is associated with preserved normospermia in most patients, albeit with individual variability and no absolute safe threshold [^113L8d8n] [^114RHqoS]. For testicular cancer, contemporary BEP regimens carry a 10–42% risk of long-term azoospermia, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation conditioning is consistently high risk, reinforcing the need for early sperm banking when possible [^117QX1xY] [^113Nqz9H].

> I need to check the recovery timeline carefully, because patients often ask when normal spermatogenesis returns. Declines in semen quality can begin within 1–2 months of therapy, and recovery is variable, with many recovering within 2–3 years but some remaining azoospermic beyond 5 years. Importantly, even when counts recover, persistent DNA damage and chromosomal abnormalities may persist, so I should confirm the recommendation to delay conception for at least 12 months after therapy completion [^1141gybL] [^115iNtac] [^115QWFY8].

> Hold on, I should verify the genetic risks and timing of mutagenesis, since this affects contraceptive advice. Alkylating agents and radiation can induce mutations in spermatozoa detectable within 1–2 weeks of initiation, with topoisomerase II inhibitors peaking around weeks 5–7 and nucleoside analogs and bleomycin showing mutagenic effects around weeks 7–10, supporting a minimum 12-month contraception interval and the caution that sperm banking after therapy has begun may carry higher genetic risk [^112rLAT6] [^115Poe4F].

> Next, I should review fertility preservation, and I need to ensure I state the standard of care clearly. Sperm cryoppreservation is the gold standard and should be offered to all pubertal and postpubertal males before gonadotoxic therapy, with collection every 24 hours if time permits to maximize yield; when ejaculation is not possible, testicular sperm extraction can be considered, and for prepubertal boys, testicular tissue cryopreservation remains experimental with unknown reproductive potential [^111QgL2g] [^115iNtac] [^111Y52T2] [^111PbgZ4].

> Let me consider post-treatment assessment and assisted reproduction, and I should double-check the timing of semen analysis. Semen analysis is most informative 2–3 years after therapy completion, as early testing within 12 months often underestimates recovery; for men with persistent azoospermia, TESE yields sperm in roughly 37–44% with live birth rates per couple of 40–59% using ICSI, and I must remember to counsel that children conceived with banked or surgically retrieved sperm generally show no increased congenital anomaly risk when conception occurs after the recommended interval [^115iNtac] [^116gw6p3] [^111ySNbo].

> But wait, what about special populations and counseling gaps, since these often change practice. Prepubertal boys cannot bank sperm and rely on experimental testicular tissue cryopreservation, and prepubertal status does not protect from gonadal injury; testicular cancer patients frequently have baseline semen abnormalities and should be offered sperm banking before orchiectomy or adjuvant therapy; and despite guideline emphasis, real-world counseling remains suboptimal, with men less likely than women to receive fertility discussions, highlighting the need for system-level integration and early referral [^111Y52T2] [^113crxGg] [^112f54Ty] [^115ZBctq].

> I should confirm the practical, multidisciplinary workflow to avoid missed opportunities. Early, individualized counseling at diagnosis, expedited referral to reproductive specialists, and coordination with oncology to balance treatment urgency with fertility preservation are essential. When time is constrained, even a single sperm collection can be valuable, and emerging options like in vitro spermatogenesis and spermatogonial stem cell approaches remain investigational but may expand future options [^111PbgZ4] [^1153Ggpz].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize the clinical message to ensure internal consistency. Chemotherapy impairs male fertility through direct germ cell toxicity, endocrine disruption, and potential ejaculatory effects, with risk modulated by agent class, cumulative dose, and combination therapies. Recovery is unpredictable and may take years, with persistent genetic damage early after treatment. Therefore, sperm banking before therapy is the cornerstone, contraception for at least 12 months is advised, and post-treatment semen analysis at 2–3 years guides management, with TESE-ICSI as an effective path for persistent azoospermia [^113Nqz9H] [^1141gybL] [^111ySNbo].

Chemotherapy can cause **temporary or permanent infertility** in men, depending on the drugs, doses, and patient factors [^117QX1xY]. Alkylating agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide, procarbazine) and cisplatin carry the **highest risk** of azoospermia, especially at high cumulative doses or with pelvic/testicular radiation [^114RHqoS] [^113L8d8n]. Recovery may occur within 1–3 years, but some remain azoospermic long term; **sperm banking before treatment is the standard of care** [^1116raan] and should be offered to all pubertal males [^111QgL2g]. Post-treatment, **avoid conception for ≥ 12 months** [^111ySNbo] due to potential genetic damage, and use assisted reproduction (ICSI/TESE) if needed [^116gw6p3]. Early counseling and individualized risk assessment are essential [^1136PUui].

## Mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced male infertility

Chemotherapy impairs fertility via **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Direct germ cell damage**: Cytotoxic agents destroy rapidly dividing spermatogonia, causing azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia [^113Nqz9H] [^116motMS].

- **Hormonal disruption**: Chemotherapy can impair the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, reducing testosterone and altering gonadotropins [^113Nqz9H] [^116yHf7B].

- **Genetic damage**: Chemotherapy-induced DNA damage in sperm may persist after treatment, raising concerns about offspring health [^112rLAT6] [^1141gybL].

---

## Chemotherapy agents and their impact on male fertility

| **Chemotherapy agent** | **Impact on male fertility** | **Recovery potential** |
|-|-|-|
| Alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, procarbazine) | High risk of azoospermia; dose-dependent | Recovery possible in 1–3 years; risk of permanent infertility |
| Cisplatin | High risk of azoospermia; dose-dependent | Recovery in 1–3 years; permanent infertility in some |
| Carboplatin | Moderate risk; lower than cisplatin | Recovery within 1–2 years |
| Methotrexate | Moderate risk; transient effects | Recovery within 1–2 years |
| Vinblastine | Moderate risk; transient effects | Recovery within 1–2 years |
| Bleomycin | Low to moderate risk | Recovery within 1–2 years |
| Etoposide | Moderate risk; transient effects | Recovery within 1–2 years |

---

High-risk regimens (e.g. BEP for testicular cancer, CHOP for lymphoma) can cause **prolonged or permanent azoospermia**, especially with high cumulative doses or pelvic/testicular radiation [^113L8d8n] [^117QX1xY].

---

## Factors influencing recovery of spermatogenesis

Recovery depends on several factors:

- **Age**: Younger patients have higher recovery rates.

- **Cumulative dose**: Higher doses, especially alkylating agents, increase permanent infertility risk [^114RHqoS].

- **Radiation exposure**: Pelvic/testicular radiation significantly impairs recovery [^113L8d8n].

- **Baseline fertility**: Pre-existing subfertility reduces recovery likelihood [^notfound].

---

## Timeline of spermatogenesis recovery

Recovery is **highly variable**:

- **Initial recovery**: Sperm may return within 6–12 months post-treatment [^111Y52T2].

- **Peak recovery**: Most recover by 2–3 years; some remain azoospermic beyond 5 years [^115iNtac].

- **Permanent infertility**: Occurs in ~10–20% depending on regimen and dose [^notfound].

---

## Fertility preservation strategies

### Sperm cryopreservation

- **Standard of care**: Offer to all pubertal males before gonadotoxic therapy [^111QgL2g] [^1116raan].

- **Timing**: Ideally before treatment; multiple samples improve yield [^111PbgZ4].

- **Success**: Widely available; > 95% can bank sperm [^11797dqH].

---

### Testicular sperm extraction (TESE)

TESE is indicated for **persistent post-treatment azoospermia**; success rates are 37–44% per patient, with live birth rates of 40–59% per couple using ICSI [^116gw6p3].

---

### Experimental techniques

Testicular tissue cryopreservation is an **experimental option for prepubertal boys** with unknown reproductive potential [^111Y52T2] [^114bgnoC].

---

## Post-treatment fertility evaluation and management

- **Semen analysis**: Perform at 12–24 months post-treatment; limited value at < 12 months [^111ySNbo].

- **Hormonal assessment**: FSH, LH, testosterone to assess axis function [^113crxGg] [^111usey5].

- **Assisted reproduction**: ICSI with cryopreserved or surgically retrieved sperm is effective [^111Y52T2] [^116gw6p3].

- **Contraception**: Avoid conception for ≥ 12 months post-therapy due to genetic risks [^111ySNbo] [^112rLAT6].

---

## Psychological and emotional impact

Infertility after chemotherapy can cause **significant distress, anxiety, depression, and relationship strain**. Early counseling and psychological support are essential [^1151N59F] [^115v5iMz].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Early counseling**: Discuss fertility risks and preservation before treatment [^114zAQuF].

- **Sperm banking**: Offer to all pubertal males before gonadotoxic therapy [^111QgL2g] [^1116raan].

- **Individualized risk assessment**: Use regimen, dose, age, and baseline fertility to guide counseling [^1115oy7T].

- **Post-treatment follow-up**: Semen analysis and hormonal evaluation at 12–24 months [^111ySNbo].

---

Chemotherapy can cause **temporary or permanent infertility** in men, with risk driven by agent, dose, and patient factors. Sperm banking before treatment is the **standard of care** [^111QgL2g]; post-treatment recovery is variable, and assisted reproduction enables many survivors to father children.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor effects on male reproduction… [^111NGnoc]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract e16528 Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to improve overall survival in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma as compared to previous therapy with multi-kinase inhibitors. However, little is known about the effects of these drugs on male reproductive capacity and the current data regarding effects of MKI and ICI therapies on gonadal function and fertility are both limited and conflicting. We sought to evaluate effects of MKI and ICI on male reproductive function in patients with RCC. Methods: Male patients with RCC receiving MKI or ICI for a period of at least 3 months were identified. Inclusion criteria included age ≤ 50 years, no prior history of chemotherapy, and no prior history of medical or surgical conditions that would affect spermatogenesis such as hypogonadism, Klinefelter syndrome, or vasectomies. Patients were instructed to abstain from ejaculation 2 to 7 days prior to study collection.

Follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, morning testosterone, and a semen analysis was obtained for each patient and analyzed. Results: Of 10 patients, 5 were on ICI and 5 were on MKI. Of the patients on ICI, 2 exhibited abnormal semen morphology, motility, and sperm concentration. Of the patients on ICI, one exhibited elevated LH and FSH levels and one exhibited elevated LH levels only. Of the patients on MKI, 2 exhibited abnormal semen morphology, motility, and sperm concentration. One patient on MKI exhibited elevated LH and FSH levels. All patients had normal testosterone levels. Conclusions: Our preliminary descriptive data analysis suggests that both ICI and MKI may affect semen morphology and motility, sperm concentration, and LH and FSH levels, but does not affect testosterone levels.

Due to the currently limited sample size, abnormal semen analysis and hormone levels may be attributable to confounding factors, such as performance status, the metastatic disease itself, comorbidities, etc. Study recruitment and analysis are ongoing.

### Fertility perspectives and priorities among male adolescents and young adults in cancer survivorship [^116wN1eT]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Infertility is a common and distressing late effect of cancer treatment among male survivors. Investigators examined desire for parenthood, prioritization of fertility compared to other life goals, and reports of fertility-related discussions among a cohort of male adolescent and young adult survivors. Eighty percent desired a biological child, yet only 31% ranked having a child among their "top 3" life goals. Only 40% reported fertility-related discussions with their health care providers in survivorship. Given the importance of biological children among this cohort, future guidelines should encourage a more proactive approach to providing fertility counseling and offering testing, to mitigate distress and prevent unplanned pregnancies.

### Pediatric cancer immunotherapy and potential for impact on fertility: a need for evidence-based guidance [^11777Xud]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

The use of immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer in children, adolescents, and young adults has become common. As the use of immunotherapy has expanded, including in earlier lines of therapy, it has become evident that several aspects of how these immunotherapies impact longer-term outcomes among survivors are understudied. Traditional cancer therapies like alkylating and platin agents carry the greatest risk of infertility, but little is known about the impact of novel immunotherapies on fertility. This topic is of great interest to patients, patient advocates, and clinicians. In this article, we review immunotherapeutic agents used to treat childhood and young adult cancers and discuss potential mechanisms by which they may impact fertility based on the known interplay between the immune system and reproductive organs. We highlight the relative paucity of high-quality literature examining these late effects. We discuss interventions to optimize fertility preservation (FP) for our patients. Conducting longitudinal, collaborative, and prospective research on the fertility outcomes of pediatric and young adult patients with cancer who receive immunotherapy is critical to learn how to effectively counsel our patients on long-term fertility outcomes and indications for FP procedures. Collection of patient-level data will be necessary to draft evidence-based guidelines on which providers can make therapy recommendations.

### Fertility (male and female) and menopause [^112Bf9Cw]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

The impact of oncologic treatments on fertility and menopausal symptoms is often significant for patients with cancer. Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy can all damage the reproductive organs or the hypothalamic pituitary axis that controls them, impairing fertility and causing hormonally mediated symptoms such as hot flashes. Understanding these risks and strategies to mitigate them may substantially improve cancer survivorship care. For both female and male patients who desire a future biologic child, there are a variety of fertility preservation techniques that should be considered. For cancer survivors who experience menopausal symptoms, lifestyle changes may be beneficial, and hormonal and nonhormonal pharmacologic agents are well proven to reduce symptom burden.

### What advances may the future bring to the diagnosis, treatment, and care of male sexual and reproductive health? [^1153Ggpz]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

The promise of novel therapeutic development in areas such as stem cell rejuvenation after spermatogenic failure of toxic insult or in vitro spermatogenesis may be realized

Over the past 70 years, the treatments available for male reproductive failure (with the exception of surgical approaches for obstructive and nonobstructive azoospermia/testicular microdissection with ICSI) remained relatively stagnant. Nevertheless, there are novel methods under development to effectively use spermatogonial stem cells to rejuvenate spermatogenesis after gonadotoxin exposures (e.g. chemotherapy). The initial studies were predominantly performed in rodent models. A challenge with these studies in mouse models was that only a small fraction of transplanted spermatogonial stem cells could repopulate the tubules. However, Nakamura et al. developed a strategy to rejuvenate the host mouse fertility using transient treatment with a chemical inhibitor of retinoic acid synthesis. If this therapy works well in humans, it will greatly enhance the likelihood of successful treatment of patients with secondary infertility after chemotherapy or radiation therapy by direct treatment of either the host or the cells in vitro. This advance using mouse models, together with the in vitro reconstitution of male germ cell development from mouse pluripotent stem cells, should result in a paradigm changes in not only our understanding of spermatogenesis but the ability to translate these in vivo and in vitro findings to the human.

### Impact of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for benign and malignant haematologic and non-haematologic disorders on fertility: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116N31Cp]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the gonadotoxicity of specific chemotherapies can be estimated using risk calculators, the assessment should be provided also for benign diseases requiring gonadotoxic treatment. As for the cyclophosphamide Equivalent Dose (CED) Calculator, it offers information about the risk of infertility but does not address the availability of multiple treatment options in the same way as other tools do.

There are some limitations to our study, although we strictly followed the recommendations to produce high quality evidence summaries: Firstly, most of the included studies were based on retrospective or registry data and lacked data on treatment protocols or dosimetry of chemotherapy combination and dosage, as well as combination with TBI as an important risk factor for long-term fertility outcomes. Secondly, the heterogeneity of the included studies, due to treatment variations and the diverse characteristics of the study populations, with wide age ranges, did not allow for further subgroup analyses depending on pubertal status, which is of great relevance for pre-treatment fertility protection measure counseling. Thirdly, the absence of data on the dosage of chemotherapy (in mg/m² or CED) precluded the possibility of performing a sub-analysis of CED to assess the aggressiveness of the therapy. A standard conversion to m² was not performed, in order to avoid bias in the results.

In conclusion, this first review and meta-analysis assessed the pooled prevalence of suspected infertility after HSCT in malignant and non-malignant haematologic disease. It provides clinically relevant information for fertility prognosis and patient counselling. Given the high prevalence of infertility and the associated risk of long-term complications, fertility preservation methods should be recommended prior to HSCT.

### Fertility preservation in men: a contemporary overview and a look toward emerging technologies [^115bEtHz]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

Cancer and oncologic therapies can have significant adverse effects on male reproductive potential, leaving many men permanently infertile. Fertility preservation has emerged as a key survivorship issue over the past 20 years, and numerous professional societies have published guidelines calling for fertility preservation to become a routine component of oncologic care. Most males with cancer are able to produce a semen specimen for fertility preservation, but numerous other methods of sperm procurement are available for patients who cannot provide a sufficient sample. Despite these options, fertility preservation will remain a challenge for prepubertal boys and men without sperm production. For these patients, experimental and investigational approaches offer the hope that one day they will translate to the clinical arena, offering additional pathways for successful fertility preservation care.

### Fertility preservation in people with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^113VJE8c]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for fertility preservation, more specifically with respect to fertility preservation in females, oocyte/embryo cryopreservation, ASCO 2025 guidelines recommend to consider assessing viable ovarian reserve by markers such as anti-Müllerian hormone levels and antral follicle count in the post-treatment setting. Recognize that the reproductive potential of gametes may be affected by the proximity to cancer treatment, and due to timelines of oocyte development, there may be no oocyte yield within 3 months of the last chemotherapy dose. Counsel patients on the unknown reproductive potential and offspring health of gametes obtained proximal to gonadotoxic therapy.

### FIGO statement: fertility preservation [^111nrUCu]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Fertility preservation is a growing field in reproductive medicine that may raise ethical questions. Preservation of fertility must be discussed with the patient if gonadotoxic treatment is required, whether in the case of benign or malignant pathology, or in the management of transgender identity. As a result, surgery or chemotherapy that has fewer adverse impacts on fertility should be proposed if this does not alter the prognosis of the disease. If the risk of infertility persists, then fertility cryopreservation should be proposed for children and adults of reproductive age. Sperm, oocytes, and gonadal tissue can be cryopreserved for many years. FIGO wishes to emphasize the importance of fertility preservation in the medical and surgical management of patients, and the importance of a specialized, multidisciplinary approach.

### Update and new advances in fertility preservation and cancer [^116CRmAQ]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

THE IMPACT OF CANCER THERAPY ON MALE FERTILITY

Cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, can all significantly affect fertility potential in male AYA patients. The particular therapeutic approach for each patient is individualized according to cancer type, stage of disease, patient and physician objectives, and shared decision making. Current medical therapies have widely expanded beyond conventional chemotherapeutic agents to include checkpoint inhibitors and other immunotherapies, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and biologics such as monoclonal antibodies and cytokines. Although oncologic control is the primary objective of any therapeutic regimen, the risks and toxicities of each treatment must be considered in the context of reproductive health, especially among reproductive‐aged AYA men.

### Cancer and fertility management: FIGO best practice advice [^117Wbemz]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Cancer diagnoses in patients of reproductive age require balancing urgent oncological treatment with the need to preserve fertility. This FIGO Best Practice Advice outlines key considerations for fertility management in this population given the rising cancer incidence among young women and the reproductive risks posed by cancer treatments. The guidance evaluates the impact of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, and emerging therapies — such as targeted agents and immunotherapies — on gonadal function and fertility. Established fertility preservation methods, including oocyte/embryo cryopreservation, sperm banking, and ovarian tissue freezing, are detailed alongside barriers to their adoption, such as cost and limited access. Early collaborative counseling with oncologists and fertility specialists is central to addressing timelines, psychological impacts, and priorities. Post‐treatment pathways, including assisted reproduction and surrogacy, are also explored. The guidance stresses the importance of integrating fertility‐sparing interventions and fertility preservation into cancer care while advocating for equitable access to resources. Further research is needed to refine preventive interventions, evaluate long‐term outcomes, and expand options for survivors globally. By prioritizing fertility preservation within oncological care, healthcare providers can better support the holistic needs of young individuals facing cancer.

Table 3
The choices regarding fertility preservation of female cancer patients enrolled in the Italian study

Greater effort is needed to improve both the communication between patients and physicians about fertility risks and preservation options, and the collaboration among oncologists and fertility specialists to give patients the opportunity to undergo well-timed and complete reproductive counseling. Further research is needed to better understand the preferences of patients among the available strategies for fertility preservation: this information would have great importance from a public health perspective and for resource allocation standpoint. Moreover, a better understanding of the factors that influence patients' choice would help physicians to improve the quality of their fertility counseling.

Recommendation 4

In men, sperm cryopreservation is an easily accessible and widely available option in more than 95% of patients and should be encouraged for those who want to preserve fertility (III, A). On the contrary, from 2% to 65% of women undergo one of the available cryopreservation options: oncologists should discuss with them the fertility issues and secure proper counseling in appropriate centers prior to cancer treatment (IV, A).

Which are the results and the safety of assisted reproduction technologies (ART) in male patients previously treated with chemotherapy?

Anticancer treatments (i.e. chemotherapy and radiotherapy) can damage the germinal epithelium in men resulting in oligozoospermia or azoospermia: in fact, a large proportion of patients treated for cancer have lower sperm concentrations than matched controls. Currently, no strategies for medical protection of the germinal epithelium are available. Further, prepubertal age cannot be considered a protective factor from gonadotoxic insults. Data suggest that cancer itself can influence spermatogenesis. However, no correlation between semen alterations and cancer stage or associated symptoms has been detected.

Sperm cryopreservation before gonadotoxic therapies is the standard strategy for fertility preservation in adult men. A large proportion of treated patients maintains or regains a level of spermatogenesis adequate to obtain spontaneous conception. However, male cancer survivors who don't recover spermatogenesis nor had their semen cryopreserved before cytotoxic therapy may need ART, and specifically intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI), in order to reproduce. Therefore, when considering the safety of conception after radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, there are three different scenarios: a) spontaneous conception in patients with continued post radiotherapy/chemotherapy spermatogenesis; b) ART conception with normal or abnormal cryopreserved sperm; c) ART conception with post radiotherapy/chemotherapy residual spermatogenesis (ICSI particularly).

### Fertility in young-onset colorectal patients with cancer: a review [^111CzdDY]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Commonly used chemotherapy drugs and related reproductive toxicity for patients with colorectal cancer.

The effect of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody inhibitors such as bevacizumab on patients' long-term fertility was unknown. The rate of ovarian failure among patients with CRC who received bevacizumab + FOLFOX was 34%, as compared with 2% among those who did not utilize bevacizumab, and approximately 20% of women regained ovarian function at the end of bevacizumab therapy. Animal repeated dose toxicity studies have shown that VEGF can cause decreased ovarian maturity, reduction/loss of corpus luteum, loss of ovarian and uterine weight, and reduced number of menstrual cycles. Thus it may reduce female fertility. However, its impact on male fertility has not been studied.

Immunotherapy has been one of the research hotspots in the field of CRC in recent years. Studies have shown that patients with mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high were the main beneficiaries of immunotherapy. Patients with partial mismatch repair-proficient or microsatellite stability CRC receiving combination therapy with other treatments such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy can respond to neoadjuvant immunotherapy. Although immunotherapy has certain effects on CRC patients, it also affect the reproductive function of young patients to a certain extent. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have been shown to cause primary and secondary hypogonadism and, theoretically, sexual dysfunction(Table 2). However, the actual effects on gonadal function and ovarian reserve remain unknown. Animal studieshave shown that ICI antibodies can bind to ovarian tissue, increase immune cell infiltration and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression in the ovary, reduce ovarian follicular reserve, and impair oocyte maturation and ovulation ability; it binds to testicular tissue and impacts gametes and fertility. Impaired spermiograms and testicular histopathology have been found in men treated with ICI in different case reports and case series, and there is evidence that ICI causes primary hypogonadism or direct testicular damage. In few case reports published to date, no malformation or serious disease has been reported in children born to mothers treated with ICI during pregnancy. However, a 4-month-old infant developed immune-related enteritis after in utero exposure to pembrolizumab. In current clinical trials, the main focus was on the pathological response rate of patients, and the impact of ICI on fertility, the possibility of subsequent conception and potential pregnancy complications are important issues that need to be addressed urgently.

### Cancer and fertility preservation: international recommendations from an expert meeting [^115v5iMz]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although cancer incidence increases with age and peaks after the age of 50, thousands of young women and men are diagnosed with cancer every year. Modern anticancer treatments have led to significant reduction in mortality, but also to an increase in unwanted side effects such as reduced fertility. Combined with an increased age for childbearing, a higher number of cancer survivors require fertility preservation to complete their families.

The threat or experience of treatment-related infertility can lead to psychological distress, and many patients are interested in maintaining fertility and future reproductive function at the time of cancer diagnosis. Moreover, fertility concerns may also substantially affect their treatment decisions. Thus, great attention to fertility issues is warranted at the time of cancer diagnosis.

International guidelines recommend that physicians discuss, as early as possible, with all patients of reproductive age their risk of infertility from the disease and/or treatment and their interest in having children after cancer, and help with informed fertility preservation decisions. As recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), sperm cryopreservation and embryo/oocyte cryopreservation are standard strategies for fertility preservation in male and female patients, respectively. Other strategies (e.g. pharmacological protection of the gonads and gonadal tissue cryopreservation) are still generally considered experimental techniques. However, new data in this field have become available over the past few years for consideration. Furthermore, several issues remain controversial with regard to the safety and efficacy of fertility preservation strategies in cancer survivors. In the present manuscript, we summarize and discuss the up-to-date knowledge on ten controversial topics in the field of fertility preservation in young patients with cancer.

### Sexual function in male cancer survivors is not correlated to sperm quality [^114qeCx7]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Survival rates of young cancer patients are constantly rising, reaching 5-year survival rates of up to 80–98%, depending on cancer type and stage. This creates a new group of patients: cancer survivors who face the long-term consequences of their treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or radiotherapy), which include transient or permanent infertility. During the last decades, the awareness of clinicians for this problem has risen. As a result, sperm cryopreservation prior to the initiation of gonadotoxic treatment is routinely offered to male cancer patients to fulfill their desire for children in their later lives.

However, fertility is only one facet of sexual function that is possibly impacted by cancer therapies, and few studies have aimed to understand the association between cancer and sexual function besides fertility, such as erectile dysfunction (ED). Male cancer survivors frequently suffer from ED, which depends on the type of cancer, and treatment regimes, but also age and comorbidities. In testicular cancer patients, for example, the rate of ED was reported to be as high as 37%. A Danish testicular cancer cohort study reported different rates and manifestations of ED according to the applied therapies. ED was described in men who underwent radiotherapy, BEP (bleomycin, etoposide, and platinum) chemotherapy with subsequent surgery, or more than one line of treatment. The latter group also reported orgasmic dysfunction, while the group treated with radiotherapy also reported decreased sexual satisfaction.

### Long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers [^113crxGg]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Chemotherapy — health counseling and further testing after alkylating agents notes the need for contraception, that fertility recovery can be seen in the early years after completion of therapy and occasionally thereafter, and to review previous fertility preservation counseling/interventions; for sexually mature patients who desire information about potential future fertility, listed options are semen analysis (optimal) and/or FSH and inhibin B (alternative if unable or unwilling to provide semen sample), with reproductive endocrinology/urology referral for infertility evaluation and consultation regarding assisted reproductive technologies, and it states that alkylating agent doses that cause gonadal dysfunction show individual variation, that germ cell function (spermatogenesis) is impaired at lower doses compared to Leydig cell (testosterone production) function, and that prepubertal status at treatment does not protect from gonadal injury in males.

### The pediatric patient and future fertility: optimizing long-term male reproductive health outcomes [^114GZy3d]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). Medium credibility.

Globally, male factor infertility accounts for 20%-70% of couples struggling to conceive. Certain male pediatric developmental conditions, such as cryptorchidism, hypospadias, testicular and other childhood cancers, infections, and pediatric varicocele have been associated with future infertility. Early fertility preservation, especially in those with pending chemotherapy or genetic conditions such as Klinefelter syndrome, should be strongly considered in patients expected to experience testicular loss. Although optimal treatment timing may be unknown owing to a paucity of long-term prospective studies, early diagnosis and targeted treatment may optimize fertility potential in adulthood.

### Update and new advances in fertility preservation and cancer [^1141gybL]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

Exposure to chemotherapeutic agents causes a decline in semen parameters within 1–2 months, but azoospermia may not occur until after 2 months of treatment. After treatment, recovery of spermatogenesis is variable and depends on the agent, dose, and duration of exposure. Alkylating agents, followed by platinum‐based analogs, have produced the most severe effects on long‐term outcomes for the recovery of spermatogenesis. For example, Kenney et al. analyzed 17 patients who received high‐dose cyclophosphamide and reported rates of irreversible azoospermia approaching 60%. In contrast, topoisomerase inhibitors, nucleoside analogs, metabolic and synthesis inhibitors, and microtubule‐targeted drugs cause transient decreases in semen parameters that often recover to pretreatment levels within 1–2 years. However, even when sperm counts recover after treatment, chemotherapy can have persistent, detrimental effects on sperm quality. Prior studies demonstrated increased rates of sperm aneuploidy, DNA fragmentation, germline hypermutation, and de‐novo mutations that can increase the risk of birth abnormalities among children of paternal cancer survivors. Given this finding, current societal guidelines recommend couples avoid pregnancy for at least 12 months after chemotherapy.

### Fertility preservation for male patients with childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer: recommendations from the panCareLIFE consortium and the international late effects of childhood cancer guideline harmonization group [^113xp8hV]. The Lancet: Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Male patients with childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer are at an increased risk for infertility if their treatment adversely affects reproductive organ function. Future fertility is a primary concern of patients and their families. Variations in clinical practice are barriers to the timely implementation of interventions that preserve fertility. As part of the PanCareLIFE Consortium, in collaboration with the International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group, we reviewed the current literature and developed a clinical practice guideline for fertility preservation in male patients who are diagnosed with childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer at age 25 years or younger, including guidance on risk assessment and available methods for fertility preservation. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was used to grade the available evidence and to form the recommendations. Recognising the need for global consensus, this clinical practice guideline used existing evidence and international expertise to rigorously develop transparent recommendations that are easy to use to facilitate the care of male patients with childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer who are at high risk of fertility impairment and to enhance their quality of life.

### Fertility preservation in people with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^113Nqz9H]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Male fertility risk mechanisms — cancer treatments in males impact fertility through mechanisms such as spermatogonial stem cell and testicular somatic cell destruction, impaired ejaculatory function, and disruption of the hypothalamic–pituitary–testes axis; alkylating chemotherapy, platinum agents, radiation to the testes, and hematopoietic cell transplants are particularly harmful to spermatogenesis; while lower doses of testicular radiation and unilateral orchiectomy have less long-term impact, consensus on risk stratification cut points is lacking; and evidence regarding potential reproductive toxicity from novel therapies is scarce and requires further human study.

### Effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy on spermatogenesis in humans [^116motMS]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment of cancer with chemo- or radiotherapy causes reduction of sperm counts often to azoospermic levels that may persist for several years or be permanent. The time course of declines in sperm count can be predicted by the sensitivity of germ cells, with differentiating spermatogonia being most sensitive, and the known kinetics of recovery. Recovery from oligo- or azoospermia is more variable and depends on whether there is killing of stem cells and alteration of the somatic environment that normally supports differentiation of stem cells. Of the cytotoxic therapeutic agents, radiation and most alkylating drugs are the most potent at producing long-term azoospermia. Most of the newer biologic targeted therapies, except those used to target radioisotopes or toxins to cells, seem to have only modest effects, mostly on the endocrine aspects of the male reproductive system; however, their effects when used in combination with cytotoxic agents have not been well studied.

### Infertility and testis cancer [^1155RHZw]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Testicular cancer is the most common solid organ tumor in young men and affects men during their reproductive years. Current therapeutic regimens have significantly improved survival but often adversely impact fertility. Understanding the effects of testicular cancer, the systemic effects of neoplasia, and the effects of treatment protocols, such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, is essential to restoring and maintaining fertility in men who have germ cell neoplasms.

Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy targets and damages rapidly dividing neoplastic cells. Traditional chemotherapeutic agents, such as alkylating agents, antimetabolites, topoisomerase inhibitors, and platinum‐based agents, aim to interfere with DNA transcription and translation, inhibit cell microtubule formation, and cross‐link DNA. Chemotherapy is still considered the mainstay of treatment for many malignancies that affect AYA men, including leukemia, lymphoma, and testicular cancer after orchiectomy. However, these agents often have systemic effects and indiscriminately destroy rapidly dividing cells, including germ cells. The majority of established chemotherapeutic regimens involve multiple agents (and may include concurrent radiation), making it difficult to quantify or predict the chance of impaired fertility on an individual basis.

In an attempt to risk‐stratify patient exposure, organizations such as the Oncofertility Consortium have published tools to aide in predicting the effect of chemotherapy on fertility for both pediatric and adult patients who have cancer. The most common risk‐stratification scheme is based on the cyclophosphamide‐equivalent dose (CED), a standardized metric of equivalency based on the highly spermatotoxic alkylating agent. Increasing CED is negatively associated with sperm concentration in a dose‐dependent manner, where each 1 g/m² of increased CED exposure is associated with a 22% increased risk of persistent posttreatment oligospermia. Although no CED is considered benign, in a cohort of 214 patients who had hematologic, genitourinary, central nervous system, bone, or skin or soft tissue cancers, the majority (89%) had normospermia after receiving < 4 g/m² of CED. This cutoff has become the standardized metric to delineate minimally increased versus high‐level or increased risk for male infertility among alkylating agents. Among platinum‐based analogs, high‐dose cisplatin (> 500 mg) is considered a significantly increased risk, whereas low‐dose cisplatin and carboplatin exhibit a minimally increased risk to male infertility.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men: AUA / ASRM guideline part II [^115iNtac]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Male infertility after chemotherapy — sperm banking and semen analysis (SA) timing: Studies report that "20 to 50% of men will bank sperm prior to chemotherapy", and azoospermia is "highest within the first 12 months after completion of therapy and nadir between 2 to 6 years after chemotherapy, with most recovering sperm in the ejaculate 2 to 3 years following treatment completion". Consequently, "limited value of performing a SA within the first 12 months after treatment completion" is noted and SA "is most valuable at a time point 2 to 3 years after treatment ends".

### Cancer therapy and reproductive impact [^114eCScB]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

All patients where the cancer treatment has gonadotoxic potential should be referred for oncofertility advice. The effect of chemotherapy and radiotherapy on the human ovary can vary from no impact to full‐blown premature ovarian failure due to hormonal and follicular depletion. Total contraindications to fertility cryopreservation include acute malignancy that requires immediate lifesaving therapy. In prepubertal girls, the only option for urgent fertility preservation is ovarian tissue cryopreservation. Prepubertal testicular tissue cryopreservation is experimental.

### Fertility preservation in people with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^114EhWMM]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for fertility preservation, more specifically with respect to fertility preservation in males (general principles), ASCO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that sperm counts and quality may be diminished even before initiation of therapy and that the need to initiate chemotherapy quickly may limit the time to obtain optimal numbers of ejaculate specimens. Do not allow these concerns to dissuade patients from banking sperm.

### Preservation of fertility in testis cancer management [^116s67JJ]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The presence of cancer in the testis, as well as the therapies used to treat testis cancer, can impair fertility potential for affected men. Fertility preservation is an important aspect of survivorship care and should be offered to all patients before initiating treatment. The only established means of fertility preservation in men is cryopreservation of sperm. Methods for fertility preservation in prepubertal boys are still experimental. Physicians treating men with testicular cancer should be familiar with the available options. This article outlines testicular cancer and its treatment's effects on fertility, fertility preservation options, and barriers to accessing this specialized care.

### AGA clinical practice update on young adult-onset colorectal cancer diagnosis and management: expert review [^114yZZLP]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Fertility preservation in young adult–onset colorectal cancer: Based on current evidence, surgery for CRC does not appear to negatively impact fertility, but the moderate risk for impaired fertility associated with chemotherapy based on type, dose and duration warrants discussion. Banking of cryopreserved sperm is recommended prior to gonadotoxic chemotherapy, although it is not universally offered to cancer patients. In women, embryo cryopreservation is the most established option and unfertilized oocyte cryopreservation is available for those who cannot or do not wish to use donor sperm; ovarian tissue cryopreservation and later transplantation is not yet approved beyond use in clinical trials but has the potential to restore fertility even in young girls who have not yet ovulated. Ovarian translocation away from radiation fields and use of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist to prevent chemotherapy induced ovarian failure are 2 more components of a complete discussion about fertility preservation.

### Adverse effects of common medications on male fertility [^1169gKMZ]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

An increasing number of patients require long-term medication regimens at a young age, but the adverse effects of medications on male reproduction are often inadequately considered, recognized and investigated. Medications can affect male reproduction through central hormonal effects, direct gonadotoxic effects, effects on sperm function or on sexual function. For example, exogenous testosterone inhibits spermatogenesis through central suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal hormonal axis. 5α-reductase inhibitors can impair sexual function, decrease semen volume and negatively affect sperm parameters, depending on dose and treatment duration. α-Blockers might decrease seminal emission and cause retrograde ejaculation, depending on the receptor specificity and dose of the agent. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors seem to have variable effects based on the isoform inhibited and evidence is conflicting. Antihypertensive and psychotropic agents can affect sperm, sexual function and hormonal parameters. For antibiotics, the literature on effects on sperm and sperm function is limited and dated. Many chemotherapeutic agents have a direct gonadotoxic effect, depending on agents used, dosing and number of treatment cycles. Overall, many medications commonly used in urology can have effects on male fertility (mostly reversible) but conclusive evidence in humans is often limited. Men should be counselled appropriately about potential drug-related adverse effects on their fertility.

### Male prepubertal fertility preservation: a review [^113Xa5MN]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). Medium credibility.

Chemotherapy, radiation, and hormonal therapies often compromise future fertility. Preserving reproductive potential in pediatric patients that undergo treatment with such gonadotoxic therapies has emerged as a critical concern, particularly for prepubertal boys who are not yet producing mature sperm and therefore cannot utilize traditional sperm cryopreservation. Here we explore the current landscape of prepubertal male fertility preservation, highlighting the most common: testicular cryopreservation. Despite some encouraging findings in animal models, clinical application in humans remains limited due to the lack of developments finding a way to mature harvested spermatogonia. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of fertility preservation methods and identify areas requiring further research to advance fertility preservation in prepubertal male patients.

### Fertility preservation in people with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^111PbgZ4]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Patient and clinician communication — Time considerations: Time is of the essence and ideally, fertility preservation (FP) treatments need to be completed before the start of chemotherapy and/or radiation, though in some patients FP treatments post-treatment may be indicated. For males, sperm banking can be done quickly and a collection can be done once every 24 hours to collect the desired number of samples. For females, FP may take 2–3 weeks for established techniques that involve collection of eggs (either egg or embryo freezing), although some other approaches, including some emerging ones, can implemented sooner, so timely referral to a reproductive specialist is important.

### Cancer and fertility preservation: international recommendations from an expert meeting [^1155sTJA]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

As recommended by major international guidelines on fertility preservation in cancer patients, clinicians should discuss with their patients the potential impact of anticancer treatment on fertility as early as possible and help with fertility preservation decisions among at-risk survivors interested in having children after cancer.

However, the rate of treatment-related infertility is variable and depends on several factors: type of cancer, age of the patient, history of previous treatment for infertility and comorbidities, type and dose of the chemotherapy regimen used, method of administration (oral versus intravenous), size and location of the radiation field and its dose, need of adjuvant endocrine therapy (Table 2). Specifically, type of treatment and patients' age are the most important factors to be taken into account when counseling the patients.

### Iatrogenic effects of radical cancer surgery on male fertility [^116LRtpT]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

Iatrogenic causes of male infertility can include medications, chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. In this review, we discuss commonly performed urologic cancer surgeries and nonurologic surgeries that harbor a high risk of iatrogenic infertility. These include radical prostatectomy, radical cystectomy, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, pelvic colon surgery, and anterior spine surgery. In addition, we review the anatomy and surgical strategies that help to reduce the risks of infertility. With an increase in life expectancy and improvements in fertility preservation, it is important to properly counsel patients about the risks of infertility and provide options for fertility preservation before surgery.

### Fertility preservation in pediatric leukemia and lymphoma: a report from the children's oncology group [^114yRVHT]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Certain chemotherapy agents, radiation, and surgery can all negatively impact future fertility. Consults regarding treatment-related risk for infertility and gonadal late effects of these agents should occur at the time of diagnosis as well as during survivorship. Counseling on fertility risk has traditionally varied significantly across providers and institutions. We aim to provide a guide to standardize the assignment of gonadotoxic risk, which can be used in counseling patients both at the time of diagnosis and in survivorship. Gonadotoxic therapies were abstracted from 26 frontline Children's Oncology Group (COG) phase III protocols for leukemia/lymphoma, in use from 2000–2022. A stratification system based on gonadotoxic therapies, sex, and pubertal status was used to assign treatments into minimal, significant, and high level of increased risk for gonadal dysfunction/infertility. Risk levels were assigned to protocols and different treatment arms to aid oncologists and survivor care providers in counseling patients regarding treatment-related gonadotoxicity. Males were most commonly at high risk, with at least one high-risk arm in 14/26 protocols (54%), followed by pubertal females (23% of protocols) and prepubertal females (15% of protocols). All patients who received direct gonadal radiation or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) were considered at high risk. Partnering with patients and their oncology/survivorship team is imperative for effective fertility counseling both prior to and post treatment, and this comprehensive guide can be used as a tool to standardize and improve reproductive health counseling in patients undergoing COG-based leukemia/lymphoma care.

Starting: Recommendation 12 — men and reproductive risks: Clinicians should counsel men with MS on their reproductive plans regarding treatment implications before initiating treatment with teriflunomide or cyclophosphamide (Level B). Chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, may affect male fertility, and with teriflunomide treatment, there may be a risk of teratogenicity from male sperm, which could last for 2 years after treatment cessation if the patient is not treated with chelation therapy.

### Sex differences in fertility-related information received by young adult cancer survivors [^116anEZD]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim was to investigate male and female cancer survivors' perception of fertility-related information and use of fertility preservation (FP) in connection with cancer treatment during reproductive age.

Methods

The study sample consisted of cancer survivors diagnosed from 2003 to 2007 identified in population-based registers in Sweden. Inclusion criteria included survivors who were age 18 to 45 years at diagnosis and had lymphoma, acute leukemia, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, or female breast cancer treated with chemotherapy. Of 810 eligible participants, 484 survivors (60% response rate) completed a postal questionnaire.

Results

The majority of male participants reported having received information about treatment impact on fertility (80%) and FP (68%), and more than half of the men banked frozen sperm (54%). Among women, less than half (48%) reported that they received information about treatment impact on fertility, and 14% reported that they received information about FP. Only seven women (2%) underwent FP. Predictors for receiving information about treatment impact on fertility were a pretreatment desire to have children (odds ratio [OR], 3.5), male sex (OR, 3.2), and being ≤ 35 years of age at diagnosis (OR, 2.0). Predictors for receiving information about FP included male sex (OR, 14.4), age ≤ 35 at diagnosis (OR, 5.1), and having no children at diagnosis (OR, 2.5).

Conclusion

Our results show marked sex differences regarding the receipt of fertility-related information and use of FP. There is an urgent need to develop fertility-related information adapted to female patients with cancer to improve their opportunities to participate in informed decisions regarding their treatment and future reproductive ability.

### Cancer and fertility management: FIGO best practice advice [^116eWLSJ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Current fertility preservation methods, including oocyte/embryo cryopreservation, sperm banking, and ovarian tissue freezing, remain cornerstone options. However, their integration into care pathways for patients receiving novel therapies is inconsistent. Emerging techniques, such as in vitro follicle maturation or testicular stem cell preservation, offer hope but require validation. A critical gap exists in understanding how these interventions interact with targeted therapies. For instance, ovarian stimulation protocols may need adjustment for patients on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), while the timing of tissue cryopreservation relative to immunotherapy cycles remains unexplored. Despite increasing availability, significant barriers persist, including limited awareness among healthcare providers, time constraints before treatment initiation, and inequitable access to fertility preservation technologies. Given the potential impact of cancer treatments on fertility, various preservation options are available for both men and women. For women, embryo cryopreservation is a well‐established method that involves creating embryos from harvested eggs and sperm, which are then frozen for future use. Oocyte cryopreservation allows for the harvesting and freezing of eggs, providing an option for women who may not have a partner at the time of treatment. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation involves removing and freezing ovarian tissue, which can potentially be reimplanted after cancer treatment. Additionally, the use of gonadotropin‐releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) — although their protective effect on ovarian function has been most robustly demonstrated in breast cancer patients — may help suppress ovarian activity during chemotherapy. For men, sperm banking is the most common and effective method of fertility preservation, allowing them to freeze sperm prior to treatment for future use. In cases of azoospermia, testicular sperm extraction (TESE) can be performed to retrieve sperm directly from the testes.

### Evaluation of reported fertility preservation counseling before chemotherapy using the quality oncology practice initiative survey [^115bfLhr]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

As cancer survival increases, quality of life is becoming increasingly important to patients, with fertility preservation of significant importance for both men and women. Whereas chemotherapy and radiotherapy are effective in eliminating cancer cells, adverse effects on the reproductive system persist. In males, this toxic environment can directly damage the germinal epithelium, causing azoospermia or oligozoospermia, or can compromise the neural pathway responsible for erection and ejaculation. In females, cancer therapies can deplete both the number and integrity of oocytes.

The American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommend that health care clinicians caring for adult and pediatric patients with cancer discuss fertility preservation before the initiation of anticancer therapy. Although the initial guidelines were published in 2006, ASCO has since released 3 iterations; the most recent guidelines were published in 2018. Current guidelines recommend that clinicians address the possibility of infertility as early as possible before treatment starts and refer to an appropriate specialist for patients who express an interest in fertility preservation. Whether a patient is a candidate for or chooses to pursue fertility preservation, having this discussion may be associated with reduced distress and improved quality of life. A studyevaluating the ASCO Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI), a nationwide database reporting 150 quality measures, found that only 6% of US patients had a fertility preservation discussion before undergoing chemotherapy between 2006 and 2010. In recent years, there has been increased effort to improve the rates of fertility counseling before chemotherapy, including increased education for oncologists regarding the risks of infertility associated with chemotherapy, additional updates of ASCO guidelines, and an increased number of states passing legislative initiatives requiring insurance carriers to cover fertility preservation for those requiring chemotherapy. Given these efforts to improve fertility counseling, we used recent data from the ASCO QOPI to assess current rates of fertility counseling in reproductive-aged patients and evaluated factors associated with discussion of fertility risks and fertility preservation before initiation of chemotherapy.

### Male fertility after cancer [^115HK9pJ]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

The increasing incidence of cancer among the reproductive population, especially Hodgkin's disease (HD) and testicular cancer, has been paralleled by a substantial improvement in survival rates. In addition to survival and recurrence rates, preserving future fertility and subsequent offspring welfare have become a main focus of modern treatment modalities and current extensive research. This article reviews contemporary data on the effects of cancer and cancer treatment on male fecundity. Gonadotoxicity of cytotoxic therapy will be discussed together with the current measures to preserve fertility. Finally, recent data on potential harm to future offspring of cancer survivors will be addressed.

### Therapy insight: fertility in women after cancer treatment [^1136SXio]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

Cancer is the second-commonest cause of death in women under 40 years of age in Western Europe and the US. The survival of cancer patients has, nevertheless, improved during the past two decades. During this period, and especially during the last decade, there have been ground-breaking advances in the optimization of the quality of life of patients treated for cancer, in particular by the development of fertility-enhancing and fertility-preserving procedures in young patients treated for cancer. Surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy affect the fertility potential of women in different ways. Surgery to remove the uterus and ovaries has a direct impact on fertility. Radiation therapy (external or brachytherapy) can affect ovarian and also uterine function. Different drugs used in chemotherapy can directly influence ovarian function. Some markers have now been evaluated that are predictive of the potential toxic injury to the gonads and uterus. Various procedures have been proposed to preserve the fertility potential in women before anticancer treatment begins or after the tumor is treated; however, such optimization of management should only be undertaken if it does not have a deleterious effect on the survival of the patient.

However, it is not clear yet the ideal interval to wait between the end of anticancer treatments and conception. Two main interval issues should be considered: to wait until the patient is at lower risk of relapse, and to wait until the anticancer therapy is out of a patient's system (i.e. up to 3–6 months following the last administered dose). According to expert opinion, the timing should be "personalized" taking into account age and ovarian reserve of the patient, previous treatments and time of their completion, and individual risk of relapse. In breast cancer patients with hormone receptor-positive disease, the need for adjuvant endocrine therapy is another important issue to be considered: its use for up to 5–10 years can lead to a natural decline in ovarian reserve due to age, thus hindering the chances of future pregnancies. An international prospective study with the aim to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a temporary interruption of endocrine therapy to allow pregnancy is ongoing (the POSITIVE study).

Recommendation 2

Pregnancy in cancer survivors, after adequate treatment and follow up, should not be discouraged, including among patients with endocrine-sensitive breast cancer (III, A).

Should all patients be referred to a fertility unit before initiating anticancer treatments?

Anticancer treatments (surgery, radiotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy) may affect male and female fertility transiently or permanently. Surgery can have a direct impact on patients' fertility causing anatomic or vascular problems (e.g. retrograde ejaculation or impaired ejaculation, changes to the uterus, cervix or vagina). Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have a direct gonadotoxic effect by destroying ovarian follicles that constitute woman's ovarian reserve and by compromising sperm number, motility, morphology, and DNA integrity in male patients. Finally, endocrine treatments used in breast cancer patients have both a direct and indirect effect on fertility and ovarian function: the direct effect, occurring during treatment only, is due to an impairment in ovulatory and endometrial functions, while the indirect effect is associated with the delay to conception that allows ovarian aging.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men: AUA / ASRM guideline part II [^117QX1xY]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Male infertility in oncology — effects of cancer therapy and preservation considerations indicate that radiotherapy and chemotherapy used for treatment of cancer and other medical conditions can often lead to temporary or even long-term gonadal injury in men, and patients should be informed of the short and long-term implications of these therapies on future fertility potential prior to initiation of treatment. Men with testicular cancer who undergo orchiectomy and chemotherapy have a 10% to 42% risk of long-term azoospermia, and for azoospermic men with an intratesticular lesion, cryopreservation of testicular tissue should be considered during orchiectomy or excisional biopsy of the testicular lesion (Onco-TESE approach). Based on the known mutagenic effects of gonadotoxic therapies it is recommended to use contraception for a period of at least 12 months after completion of therapy, and studies on the health and genetic integrity of children fathered by men exposed to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy more than a year prior to conception have generally been reassuring.

### Effects of taxane-based chemotherapy on inhibin B and gonadotropins as biomarkers of spermatogenesis [^116yHf7B]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effects of taxane-based chemotherapy on the male reproductive axis, and, therefore, its impact on spermatogenesis and fertility.

Design

Controlled clinical study.

Setting

Patients with cancer in an academic research environment.

Patient(S)

Forty male patients of reproductive age with cancer with solid tumor at diagnosis, who had been scheduled to receive taxane-based chemotherapy.

Intervention(S)

The patients were given treatment with docetaxel or paclitaxel combined with gemcitabine or carboplatin. Blood sampling and testicular ultrasonography were performed before and after completion of chemotherapy.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

In all patients, serum levels of inhibin B, FSH, and LH were measured, and, in half of the patients, bilateral testicular volume was also measured.

Result(S)

There was a statistically significant decrease in serum inhibin B and increase in serum FSH in all patients after the completion of the taxane-based chemotherapy. The median LH levels did not exhibit a statistically significant increase after the last cycle. Bilateral testicular volume exhibited a statistically significant decrease in 19 out of 20 patients (95%) after completion of chemotherapy.

Conclusion(S)

Taxane-based chemotherapy induces the reduction of inhibin B and the reciprocal elevation of FSH, which are associated with significant gonadal damage in the early stages after completion of chemotherapy.

### Cancer and fertility management: FIGO best practice advice [^1111Lyzq]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Cancer diagnoses in patients of reproductive age require balancing urgent oncological treatment with the need to preserve fertility. This FIGO Best Practice Advice outlines key considerations for fertility management in this population given the rising cancer incidence among young women and the reproductive risks posed by cancer treatments. The guidance evaluates the impact of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, and emerging therapies-such as targeted agents and immunotherapies-on gonadal function and fertility. Established fertility preservation methods, including oocyte/embryo cryopreservation, sperm banking, and ovarian tissue freezing, are detailed alongside barriers to their adoption, such as cost and limited access. Early collaborative counseling with oncologists and fertility specialists is central to addressing timelines, psychological impacts, and priorities. Post-treatment pathways, including assisted reproduction and surrogacy, are also explored. The guidance stresses the importance of integrating fertility-sparing interventions and fertility preservation into cancer care while advocating for equitable access to resources. Further research is needed to refine preventive interventions, evaluate long-term outcomes, and expand options for survivors globally. By prioritizing fertility preservation within oncological care, healthcare providers can better support the holistic needs of young individuals facing cancer.

### Impact of sex on multiple sclerosis therapy [^1113bmGk]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Male-specific AAN Practice Guidelines pointed out that chemotherapy such as cyclophosphamide can affect male fertility. This drug is not FDA-approved for MS, and is now rarely used for MS. The Practice Guidelines also note that teriflunomide can enter semen, and can remain in the body for up to 2 years, if chelation therapy is not done. In a study of ten couples where the male was on teriflunomide, 4 females had detectable blood levels (mean 0.046 mcg/ml, range 0.22–077). Male age was younger in the positive female group. Mitoxantrone is a DMT that is also noted to cause male infertility, as well as ovarian failure, but is no longer used in MS due to its toxicity and the availability of alternative options.

Finally, low testosterone levels are noted in up to 40 ​% of MS males. Levels have correlated with disability. There have been limited therapeutic trials. Whether there is a future in using testosterone to treat MS remains to be determined. Treatment would be limited by sex, unless a designer hormone with accentuated beneficial impact, and without endocrinologic impact, was developed.

### Cancer and fertility management: FIGO best practice advice [^1151N59F]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The psychological impact of cancer and subsequent fertility concerns can be profound for young survivors. Early individualized discussions about reproductive risks at diagnosis are crucial, as even a single chemotherapy cycle can have detrimental effects. Early comprehensive counseling — ideally before starting cytotoxic therapy — enables patients to understand their risks and make informed, values‐based decisions.

The intersection of cutting‐edge cancer therapies and reproductive health demands a proactive, patient‐centered approach. While survival gains are paramount, preserving fertility and addressing reproductive concerns are integral to holistic care. Clinicians must address knowledge gaps openly and support research into gonadal toxicity, pregnancy outcomes, and long‐term safety. Embedding oncofertility into routine care empowers young patients to pursue both life and parenthood. As cancer survival rates continue to improve, addressing fertility issues becomes increasingly critical for adolescent and young adult cancer survivors. Healthcare providers play a vital role in guiding patients through the complexities of oncofertility, ensuring access to necessary resources and support to navigate reproductive health after a cancer diagnosis.

### Clinical guidelines for sperm cryopreservation in cancer patients [^111cyrg2]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

No clear clinical guidelines exist on how to counsel male cancer patients about fertility preservation. Detailed counseling is recommended before treatment when issues of collection and storage need to be highlighted. Concern about the quality of sperm collected before and/or after treatment in terms of assisted reproduction is needed, and the potential outcomes should be discussed early as part of cancer survivorship. The discussion should be sensitive and tailored to the ethical situation based on the age of the patient, the severity of the illness, the need to initiate treatment, and genetic risk. Cryopreservation should be attempted/achieved before cancer treatment is initiated. Cryopreservation should not be performed during treatment or for some time after treatment because of the chromosomal and structural damage to sperm from cancer treatment. Contraception should be instigated during this period.

### Female cancer survivors are low responders and have reduced success compared with other patients undergoing assisted reproductive technologies [^1145jAV2]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effect of prior chemotherapy and radiation on assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

University-based infertility clinic.

Patient(S)

Female cancer survivors who had received chemotherapy or radiation and all other women undergoing first-fresh IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles.

Intervention(S)

Survivors' ART outcomes were compared with all women undergoing first-fresh IVF/ICSI cycles and those with male-factor infertility only. Multivariate logistic and Poisson regression analyses were used to estimate the effect of cancer therapy on ART outcomes.

Main Outcomes Measure(S)

Number of oocytes retrieved and embryos obtained; odds of cycle cancelation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth.

Result(S)

Compared with others undergoing IVF/ICSI, survivors had significantly fewer oocytes retrieved and embryos available for transfer. In addition, survivors were significantly more likely to be canceled (odds ratio [OR] 5.60, 95% CI 2.94–10.66) and had lower pregnancy and live birth rates (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.13–0.68; and OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10–0.69; respectively). Odds ratios were stronger when the comparison group was restricted to those with male-factor infertility only.

Conclusion(S)

Women who have received systemic therapy for malignancy should be considered to be low responders and counseled that their per-cycle live birth rate is lower than that of their peers. These data strongly support offering fertility preservation before cancer therapy when possible.

### American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations on fertility preservation in cancer patients [^114ds2Km]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To develop guidance to practicing oncologists about available fertility preservation methods and related issues in people treated for cancer.

Methods

An expert panel and a writing committee were formed. The questions to be addressed by the guideline were determined, and a systematic review of the literature from 1987 to 2005 was performed, and included a search of online databases and consultation with content experts.

Results

The literature review found many cohort studies, case series, and case reports, but relatively few randomized or definitive trials examining the success and impact of fertility preservation methods in people with cancer. Fertility preservation methods are used infrequently in people with cancer.

Recommendations

As part of education and informed consent before cancer therapy, oncologists should address the possibility of infertility with patients treated during their reproductive years and be prepared to discuss possible fertility preservation options or refer appropriate and interested patients to reproductive specialists. Clinician judgment should be employed in the timing of raising this issue, but discussion at the earliest possible opportunity is encouraged. Sperm and embryo cryopreservation are considered standard practice and are widely available; other available fertility preservation methods should be considered investigational and be performed in centers with the necessary expertise.

Conclusion

Fertility preservation is often possible in people undergoing treatment for cancer. To preserve the full range of options, fertility preservation approaches should be considered as early as possible during treatment planning.

### Fertility preservation in patients undergoing gonadotoxic therapy or gonadectomy: a committee opinion [^116BNkpU]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). High credibility.

GnRH analog therapy in men — although used during chemotherapy to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in an effort to protect the germinal epithelium, human studies failed to demonstrate fertility preservation or more rapid return of spermatogenesis, and it is, therefore, not appropriate to use in males for fertility preservation.

### Male adolescent fertility preservation [^1156GZW1]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

Until the 1960s, few adolescents and young adults (AYAs) survived their initial cancer diagnoses. Now, ∼12,400 AYA patients are diagnosed with cancer each year, and almost 80% will now achieve a long-term cure. This dramatic improvement in survival is primarily due to multimodal treatments and combined chemotherapeutic regimens. Unfortunately, the increase in survival is often accompanied by treatment-related toxicities due to chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgical procedures. Despite guidelines published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and numerous other professional organizations, high percentages of male AYA oncology patients are not properly counseled regarding their fertility preservation options before cancer treatment. Although administering fertility preservation care to adolescent males can be challenging in many ways, numerous studies show that this care can be delivered with high degrees of success and high levels of patient and parent satisfaction. The key to this success at many institutions has been the implementation of formalized integrated fertility preservation programs with infrastructure geared toward the delivery of comprehensive expedited care.

### Fertility preservation in people with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^111Y52T2]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Table 1 — key outcomes and risks for fertility preservation (FP) options for males — describes three approaches. Sperm cryopreservation requires repeated clinic visits before therapy, is a gold standard proven to result in successful pregnancies and live births, and is safe and noninvasive but requires inseminations or in vitro fertilization (IVF) and incurs storage costs. Testicular sperm extraction (TESE) with cryopreservation for postpubertal males is a surgical procedure that should occur before therapy or > 6–12 months after completion of therapy for individuals azoospermic after therapy; it is an effective alternative when ejaculation is not possible and is capable of resulting in successful pregnancies with IVF, but requires IVF and carries surgical risks, psychological impacts, and storage costs. Testicular tissue cryopreservation (TTC) for prepubertal males should occur before therapy and is experimental, currently the only option for prepubertal males, with unknown reproductive potential and uncertain storage costs.

1 INTRODUCTION

For adolescents and young adults facing a cancer diagnosis, the fight for survival is often intertwined with concerns about their future, particularly the ability to have children. Among women of reproductive age, approximately 1 million cancers are diagnosed every year. In 2021, over 383 000 new cancer cases were diagnosed in women aged 15–39 years globally, causing over 81 000 deaths. Epidemiological data indicate a concerning rise in incidence among this demographic over the past three decades. Adolescents and young adults (15–39 years) face a disproportionate burden, with an incidence twice as high in women (52.9 vs. 28.3 per 100 000) and higher mortality (13.1 vs. 10.6 per 100 000) compared with men in 2022.

The most common cancers in adolescents and young adults include breast, cervical, ovarian, endometrial, thyroid, and colorectal cancers, as well as leukemia, lymphomas, and melanoma. Cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, can pose a substantial threat to fertility by causing premature ovarian failure and diminished ovarian reserve. In affected males, these treatments can result in azoospermia. For young patients, the ability to conceive and give birth is critical for quality of life and long‐term well‐being, making fertility preservation an essential component of comprehensive cancer care.

Chemotherapy, particularly alkylating agents, can severely impact female fertility by damaging ovarian follicles, with the risk of infertility increasing with age and specific drugs used; cyclophosphamide for breast cancer is notably linked to premature ovarian insufficiency. While younger women are less likely to experience permanent amenorrhea, they still face a heightened risk of premature menopause, even if menstruation resumes after treatment. Radiation therapy also threatens fertility, especially when the pelvic region is targeted. The extent of ovarian damage depends on the dose and treatment area. Pelvic radiation can also impair uterine function through fibrosis and reduced myometrial elasticity, raising the risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, and low birth weight — even when ovarian function remains intact. The increasing incidence of young‐onset colorectal cancer presents unique challenges concerning treatment and reproductive function. Recognizing that fertility concerns are often second only to survival for these young individuals underscores the necessity of integrating fertility preservation into oncological care.

3 FERTILITY PRESERVATION IN PATIENTS OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE

In line with the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines, oncologists, surgeons, gynecologists, and reproductive specialists should address and discuss with patients of reproductive age the possibility of fertility preservation prior to the oncologic therapy. The patient should be immediately referred to an institution that possesses the appropriate facilities for these procedures, including the means for oocytes, sperm, and ovarian or testicular tissue cryopreservation and storage.

The trajectory for this referral should begin with the first‐line therapists where the diagnosis was initially raised, continue in the oncology center where the diagnosis is confirmed, and proceed in a tertiary hospital that has direct connections with an assisted reproductive technology unit and women's hospital performing these procedures.

From diagnosis there are four options for oncology treatment: surgery only, adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant radiotherapy, and various combinations. The key to an effective referral process is to consider discussing fertility impact early in the process to facilitate timely referral for fertility advice and potential cryopreservation.

Chemotherapy destroys growing follicles and causes ovarian atrophy and apoptosis of ovarian cortex cells. As described by Meirow et al.the destruction is caused by two mechanisms: one causing a vascular injury and therefore an impaired blood supply to the cortex, and the other a direct toxic effect. However, Gosden et al. and Oktay et al.have shown in experiments and in respective publications that primordial follicles are not affected by chemotherapy. To safeguard a patient's reproductive potential, pretreatment with GnRH agonists for downregulation prior to initiating chemotherapy may be considered. However, the evidence remains limited and sometimes contradictory, leaving the use of GnRH agonists for all patients a subject of ongoing debate.

Unfortunately, GnRH agonists do not protect the ovary from the insult of radiation therapy. In cases of irradiation with more than 600 cGy, total ovarian failure will occur. Where less than 300 cGy is used, about 10% of patients will develop premature ovarian failure.

### Testicular cancer and male infertility [^116Zv9WN]. Current Opinion in Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Testicular cancer and infertility affect a similar age group of patients and have common biologic, epidemiologic, and environmental backgrounds. In this review, we provide current literature on links between infertility and testicular cancer, and new developments in the management of testicular cancer aimed at improving quality of life in men with testicular cancer.

Recent Findings

In-utero environmental exposure to endocrine disruptors modulates the genetically determined fate of primitive gonad and results in testicular dysgenesis syndrome, which may result in infertility and testicular cancer. Excellent response of testicular cancer to radiation and chemotherapy results in over 90% of survival and quality of life — fertility and sexual function — is of significant concern to patients and clinicians. The testicular-sparing management of testicular masses emerges as a sound alternative to radical orchiectomy and allows for preservation of spermatogenesis and hormonal function, and at the same time achieving similar survival rates. Secondary malignancies, pulmonary, and cardiovascular complications are recognized as late complications of treatment for testicular cancer.

Summary

Better understanding of common mechanisms involved in infertility and testicular cancer, and scientifically driven evidence-based treatment options should improve quality of life in young men faced with this potentially life-threatening disease.

3 EFFECT OF CANCER THERAPIES ON FERTILITY ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CANCER

The impact of cancer therapies on fertility varies significantly depending on the type of cancer, the treatment regimen, and patient‐specific factors such as age and baseline reproductive health. Table 1 summarizes the fertility risks associated with common cancer types and therapies, as well as the recommended fertility preservation options based on current evidence and international guidelines. Factors such as chemotherapy regimen, radiation field and dose, surgical extent, and patient age all contribute to gonadal toxicity.

Risks of infertility from cancer treatment — clinicians should offer an evaluation and counseling regarding the risk of reproductive function impairment and infertility to ensure that all patients are appropriately informed and supported in managing the potential reproductive impacts of their cancer treatment (Evidence quality: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Strong). This assessment should consider specific patient groups known to be at increased risk due to the gonadotoxic nature of the therapies they receive or could receive in the future, and those on longer-term treatments that delay or preclude the ability to conceive. It should also consider those for whom the risk remains uncertain due to the unknown reproductive toxicity of many cancer-directed therapies, and the effect of chronologic age should also be taken into account for females due to increased infertility risk with concomitant aging.

### Fertility issues in cancer survivorship [^1129WK4F]. CA (2013). Low credibility.

Breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis and treatment have led to dramatic improvements in survival and the need to focus on survivorship issues. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be gonadotoxic, resulting in impaired fertility. Techniques to help cancer survivors reproduce have been improving over the past decade. Discussion of the changes to a patient's reproductive health after cancer treatment is essential to providing comprehensive quality care. The purpose of this review is to aid in pre- and posttreatment counseling, focusing on fertility preservation and other strategies that may mitigate risks to the patient's reproductive, sexual, and overall health.

### Impact of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for benign and malignant haematologic and non-haematologic disorders on fertility: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114H6CxF]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative or consolidative therapy which is widely used in patients with either malignant and benign disorders (Snowden et al; Saad et al.). The most common indications for HSCT include haematological diseases (e.g. haematological malignancies such as leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma) and haematological non-malignancies (e.g. aplastic anemia, thalassemia and Fanconi's anemia), among other diseases.

Due to the continuous expansion of HSCT indications, the number of HSCT continues to increase. In Europe in 2021, 47,412 HSCT were performed in 43,109 patients (19,806 (42%) allogeneic and 27,606 (58%) autologous). Simultaneously, 5-year survival rates after HSCT have improved, reaching 90% for some diseases. Consequently, there is increased awareness of various long-term complications such as infertility in patients receiving these highly effective therapies with high long-term survival. Previous reports show that the pregnancy rate after HSCT is less than 5%.

The knowledge regarding the toxicity of cancer treatments is expanding. Furthermore, treatment protocols are undergoing a transformation, resulting in enhanced outcomes, elevated survival rates, and a reduction in irreversible side effects. Given the high risk of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) or testicular failure following HSCT conditioning and the negative impact of POI on fertility, it is imperative to consider protection of patients' fertility prior to commencing HSCT.

Consequently, counselling about fertility preservation measures before the start of gonadotoxic therapies is crucial. However, fertility preservation in the context of diseases requiring HSTC is complex. For benign diseases in which HSTC is not urgently required or in which patients have not been pretreated with some kind of gonadotoxic therapies within a few month before the start of HSTC, all kind of fertility preservation measures such as freezing of oocytes, ovarian tissue, sperm and testicular tissue are feasible options. Conversely, in malignant diseases such as leukemia the situation is more complex. In males sperm can be frozen just before the start of the induction chemotherapy but in females time to freeze oocytes is too short. In some cases freezing of ovarian tissue can still be performed after induction chemotherapy and before HSTC has started if blood is free of leukemia cells. The situation becomes even more complex in case of prepubertal females and males in which only cryopreservation of ovarian and testicular tissue are feasible but experimental options in prepubertal cases.

### Evaluation of reported fertility preservation counseling before chemotherapy using the quality oncology practice initiative survey [^115ZBctq]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

The opportunity to discuss fertility preservation is essential for patients of reproductive age with newly diagnosed cancer before the initiation of treatment.

Objective

To identify factors associated with fertility preservation counseling among patients of reproductive age before initiating chemotherapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used data obtained from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Quality Oncology Practice Initiative, an oncologist-led quality assessment program that surveys approximately 400 oncology practices biannually, from January, 2015, to June, 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was whether reproductive risks were discussed before initiation of chemotherapy. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with fertility preservation counseling, controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, cancer type, year of study, region, clinic type (academic vs private), annual clinic volume, and rates of insurance coverage.

Results

Among the 6976 patients of reproductive age (3571 men [51%]; mean (SD) age, 42.5 [7.1] years), with reproductive age ranging from 18 to 40 years for 3405 women and from 18 to 50 years for 3571 men, clinics reported that 3036 of 6976 patients (44%) received counseling regarding the risk of infertility associated with chemotherapy. Women were more likely to be informed (1912 of 3405 [56%]) compared with men (1126 of 3571 [32%]) (P < .001). Factors associated with reduced likelihood of fertility risk discussion included male sex (odds ratio [OR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60–0.90), increasing age (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.92–0.94), private practice setting (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53–0.93), and lack of multidisciplinary team planning (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41–0.70). Factors associated with increased likelihood of fertility risk discussion included having breast cancer (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.12–1.73) and lymphatic or hematopoietic cancers (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.33–2.40), participating in each subsequent study year (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.08–1.24), receiving care in an academic clinic (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.05–2.01), and being a practice offering clinical trial enrollment (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.13–2.29). States with legislatively mandated coverage of fertility preservation had significantly higher rates of fertility risk discussion compared with states without legislation (48.6% vs 39.6%, P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings suggest that clinicians are more likely to counsel younger patients and female patients about reproductive risks before initiation of chemotherapy. State laws mandating fertility preservation coverage may be associated with improved frequency of fertility counseling before chemotherapy. Further awareness and implementation of ASCO guidelines appear to be needed to improve rates of fertility risk discussion and referrals to fertility specialists before chemotherapy.

### Long-term reduction in sperm count after chemotherapy with and without radiation therapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas… [^113L8d8n]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract Purpose Treatment of lymphomas with combination chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy can result in long-term or permanent azoospermia. Patients and Methods Semen analyses of lymphoma patients were performed before, during, and after treatment with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin chemotherapy. Some of the patients also received other drugs or radiation therapy. Results Although no patients were azoospermic before treatment, all were rendered azoospermic during treatment. Following the completion of treatment, the fraction of patients whose sperm counts recovered increased gradually over 5 years and plateaued by 7 years, with two thirds of the men achieving normospermic levels.

Scattered gonadal radiation dose and cumulative cyclophosphamide dose were found to be independently significant determinants of recovery: the fraction of patients whose sperm counts recovered to 10 × 10/mL were 83%, 47%, and 20% for those who received less than 9. 5 g/m² of cyclophosphamide, greater than
9. 5 g/m² of cyclophosphamide, and pelvic XRT, respectively. The inclusion of additional drugs and interferon alfa did not significantly affect the long-term recovery of spermatogenesis. Conclusion Pelvic XRT and cumulative cyclophosphamide dosages greater than 9. 5 g/m2 are associated with a high risk of permanent sterility in lymphoma patients treated with the CHOP-Bleo regimen.

### Current options for preservation of fertility in the male [^113h9Lk4]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Modern cancer therapies have greatly improved survival rates in men of reproductive age and younger; however, surgery, chemotherapy, and irradiation may lead to male infertility. Men with cancer should be counseled about fertility preservation before initiating therapy, when possible. Currently, options for male fertility preservation include cryopreservation of semen or testicular tissue. However, prepubertal boys pose a special problem in this area.

2 PATIENT COUNSELING

Beyond immediate medical needs and emotional strain, a cancer diagnosis can severely impact fertility. The narrow timeframe for fertility preservation often conflicts with the urgency of cancer treatment, making timely, collaborative counseling essential. This counseling, ideally provided at diagnosis before treatment, should involve oncologists, reproductive endocrinologists, and fertility specialists to ensure personalized patient support.

Balancing urgent cancer therapy with the limited window for fertility preservation necessitates compassionate, personalized counseling. Even in highly urgent clinical scenarios requiring immediate therapy, where options may be limited, rapid multidisciplinary coordination remains critical to explore any feasible options, such as emergency sperm banking or ovarian suppression during chemotherapy. This approach aims to integrate treatment with fertility preservation considerations while addressing patient burdens, including financial concerns, and respecting individual parenthood desires.
Education on gonadotoxicity: Initiate timely discussions about potential reproductive risks, emphasizing their time‐sensitive nature: ⚬ High‐risk therapies: Clearly explain the significant risks of ovarian failure or azoospermia associated with alkylating agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide), pelvic radiation, and total body irradiation. ⚬ Emerging therapies: Acknowledge the uncertain long‐term gonadotoxic effects of newer agents such as PARP inhibitors and TKIs, necessitating tailored fertility preservation strategies and ongoing research.
Fertility preservation options: Provide comprehensive information regarding realistic fertility preservation options: ⚬ Female patients: Standard options include oocyte, embryo, or ovarian tissue cryopreservation, with success rates influenced by age and ovarian reserve markers (e.g. anti‐Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels). Discuss potential protective role of GnRH agonists, particularly in breast cancer. ⚬ Male patients: Offer sperm banking as the standard. In cases of azoospermia, inform patients about the availability of TESE. ⚬ When gamete collection is not feasible or is unsuccessful, discuss the use of donor gametes and related ethical, legal, and psychological implications, including potential cross‐border treatment and relevant regulations.
Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT‐M): Patients with hereditary cancer syndromes (e.g. BRCA, Lynch syndrome) may benefit from PGT‐M to reduce the transmission risk to offspring, requiring coordination with genetic counselors or clinical geneticists.
Psychosocial and financial support: Recognize the significant emotional impact of a cancer diagnosis and the potential for infertility. Counseling should address the psychological and emotional aspects of fertility preservation, ensuring patients have access to mental health resources and relevant support networks. Financial barriers often limit access to fertility preservation options, particularly in low‐resource settings. Therefore, it is crucial to provide transparent information about the costs of fertility preservation and explore available options if appropriate, including insurance coverage, charitable programs, or institutional support.
Legal and ethical considerations: Patients should be informed about the legal frameworks governing fertility preservation in their region, including issues related to ownership and disposition of cryopreserved gametes or embryos, as well as the legal implications surrounding the use of donor gametes.

### Fertility preservation in people with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^1136PUui]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for fertility preservation, more specifically with respect to risk assessment, ASCO 2025 guidelines recommend to offer an evaluation and counseling regarding the risk of reproductive function impairment and infertility in patients with cancer to ensure they are informed and supported in managing the potential reproductive impacts of their cancer treatment. Take into account the following in the assessment:

- specific patient groups at high risk due to the gonadotoxic nature of therapies they receive or could receive in the future, and those on longer-term treatments delaying or precluding the ability to conceive

- patients for whom the risk remains uncertain due to the unknown reproductive toxicity of many cancer-directed therapies

- the effect of chronologic age for females due to increased infertility risk with concomitant aging.

4 FERTILITY OUTCOMES AFTER CANCER TREATMENT

Improved cancer survival often comes at the cost of fertility, which is a key concern for adolescents and young adults. This section explores the factors affecting the postcancer reproductive potential of this population.

4.1 Impact of cancer on subsequent pregnancy

Studies involving both childhood cancer survivors and population‐based cohorts have demonstrated a markedly decreased chance of pregnancy. Azoospermia may cause permanent sterility in male survivors without prior sperm banking. A recent cohort study in Scotland found a 38% reduction in pregnancy likelihood after a cancer diagnosis compared with the general population. This decrease was consistent across all age groups and cancer types. Beyond conception rates, pregnancies in cancer survivors carry specific risks, with a meta‐analysis showing a 45% higher risk of preterm labor for breast cancer survivors compared with the general population.

FIGO's Best Practice Advice on pregnancy after cancer highlights that survivors, depending on their cancer type and treatment, may face increased risks for various obstetric and perinatal complications, including cardiovascular, endocrine, respiratory, renal, and hepatic issues.

4.2 Impact of cancer treatments on fertility

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may impair fertility based on treatment type, dose, and radiation site. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines classify risk by treatment protocol and patient‐specific factors (e.g. characteristics, drug dosages). Alkylating agents, for example, reduce primordial follicle counts, with greater ovarian damage in older patients. Pelvic radiation can damage reproductive organs, including the uterus, leading to scarring and reduced flexibility that may affect future pregnancies. Cranial radiation can disrupt hormonal regulation. The likelihood and timing of ovarian failure depend on ovarian radiation dose.

4.3 Estimation of ovarian reserve after cancer

Predicting ovarian function after cancer treatment involves assessing reduced follicle counts using ultrasound and endocrine evaluations of follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH), AMH, inhibin B, and luteinizing hormone. While AMH has been identified as a clinically useful indicator of gonadotoxicity in young women undergoing cancer treatment, recent research suggests that oocyte quality, rather than solely AMH levels, may be a critical factor in fertility potential. Furthermore, it is important to note that AMH levels do not directly and definitively correlate with the chance of spontaneous conception; women with low AMH may still conceive. Accurate fertility prediction in survivorship is crucial, highlighting the importance of fertility preservation strategies like oocyte vitrification and ovarian tissue cryopreservation, especially for individuals at high risk of treatment‐induced infertility. For males, semen analysis is the standard and critical method for assessing fertility status.

### Preserving fertility: using cyclophosphamide and other cytotoxics in young people [^114dyZje]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Cytotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide are infrequently used in neurological practice. When they are, it is commonly in critically ill patients or in those with refractory inflammatory disorders. Cyclophosphamide in particular has a well-recognised negative impact on both female and male long-term fertility. This article summarises the data with regards the impact of cytotoxics on long-term fertility and describes the current options to preserve fertility in these patients. We hope this will provide neurologists with a useful aid for counselling patients for whom they are considering these treatments.

### Infertility rates following POMB / ACE chemotherapy for male and female germ cell tumours-a retrospective long-term follow-up study [^112pGCpd]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

A number of important questions remain unanswered. New drugs, specifically the taxanes, are being used to treat GCTs. Very little is known about the long-term effects of these. We mention that seven of the infertile male patients' partners were treated successfully with IVF and donor sperm. In addition, a further two couples were treated successfully with IVF and their own sperm. The impact of new techniques such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) on couples who are sub-fertile after chemotherapy is not yet known. Indeed, the relative success of IVF is not known in couples who have received chemotherapy, although sperm storage prior to treatment is routinely offered.

We conclude that rates of infertility after treatment for GCTs in our series are 28% in men and 25% in women. The contribution of chemotherapy to this is likely to be very small. Moreover, we could not confirm a significant relationship between dose of cisplatin received and chance of infertility. Nevertheless, we still recommend that all male GCT patients are offered sperm storage and when the technology is available, equivalent oocyte storage for female GCT is performed prior to chemotherapy. While there are many theoretical reasons why chemotherapy may induce infertility, it would appear that the risks of this occurring are small.

7 FERTILITY TREATMENT OPTIONS AFTER CANCER

Fertility loss is nearly as significant a concern for reproductive‐aged women diagnosed with cancer as survival itself. Initial fertility assessments after cancer treatment typically include serum levels of FSH, estradiol, and AMH. Ideally, transvaginal ultrasound to assess antral follicle count provides insight into ovarian reserve and reproductive potential. For male survivors, a semen analysis is the standard evaluation.

Clinicians should adopt a holistic approach to counseling, considering factors such as patient age, initial diagnosis, medical history, body mass index, life expectancy, treatment modalities, pregnancy‐associated risks, and reproductive history. All pregnancies achieved following cancer diagnosis and treatment require high‐risk obstetric surveillance.

7.1 Spontaneous pregnancy

Pregnancy rates among cancer survivors are lower than those of age‐matched peers. When couples achieve spontaneous pregnancy, an individualized approach regarding the interval between treatment and conception is essential. Current evidence lacks consensus on the most effective interval; some guidelines recommend postponing pregnancy for 6–12 months, while others suggest a delay of up to 2 years in case there is early recurrence during pregnancy. Pregnancy should not be attempted during active cancer therapy, as short intervals between treatment and conception are associated with increased risks of preterm birth and low birth weight. One study indicated that survivors who delayed conception for 1 year after starting chemotherapy (without radiation), 2 years after starting chemotherapy (with radiation), and 1 year after cervical cancer diagnosis experienced the lowest risks of preterm birth. Survivors of childhood or adolescent cancer are less likely to achieve pregnancy and face higher risks of severe maternal morbidity and preterm birth. Delaying conception is also advised to allow time for detection of recurrences (as these patients may not be suitable for fertility‐sparing surgery or treatment), to minimize potential toxic effects of treatment on gametes, and to mitigate complications from immunosuppression, anemia, cardiovascular effects, physical stress, or insufficient weight gain during pregnancy. A multidisciplinary approach and consultation with the treating team are crucial for optimizing survival likelihood while maintaining the chance of pregnancy.

### Surviving childhood and reproductive-age malignancy: effects on fertility and future parenthood [^114NrL7d]. The Lancet: Oncology (2010). Medium credibility.

Annually, more than 50,000 cancer diagnoses are made in the USA in patients under the age of 35 years. Despite this staggering statistic, medical advancements have substantially improved survival rates. Thus, for both male and female patients with cancer, quality-of-life issues, such as fertility preservation and parenthood, have become an essential component of treatment. Unfortunately, many of the treatments to eradicate malignant processes can also compromise reproductive function. In these cases, fertility preservation should be discussed and initiated with early treatment planning, to allow the best chance for future parenthood, when appropriate. The effects of cancer and cancer treatments on fertility and future parenthood, including health risks for patients, their gametes, and offspring are discussed.

### Improving male reproductive health after childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer: progress and future directions for survivorship research [^111usey5]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Reproductive health is a common concern and often a source of distress for male childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer survivors. Clinical and epidemiologic research in survivor populations has identified alkylating agent chemotherapy, testicular radiation, and surgery or radiation to the genitourinary organs, lower spine, or the hypothalamic-pituitary region as risk factors for adverse reproductive outcomes, including impaired spermatogenesis, testosterone insufficiency, and sexual dysfunction. Much of the research on male survivors has focused on the outcome of fertility, using spermatogenesis, serum gonadotropins, and paternity as the measures. However, these studies often fail to account for the clinically relevant but difficult-to-quantify aspects of fertility such as sexual function, cancer-related delayed psychosocial development, medical comorbidities, and socioeconomic concerns. Clinical and basic science research has made significant contributions to improving reproductive outcomes for survivors, with recent advancements in the areas of fertility preservation, clinical assessment of reproductive function, and treatment of adverse reproductive outcomes. Furthermore, there is an emerging qualitative literature addressing the psychosexual aspects of male reproductive health, the clinical application of which will improve quality of life for survivors. This review summarizes the current survivorship literature on reproductive health outcomes for male survivors, including the epidemiology of impaired spermatogenesis, testosterone insufficiency, and sexual dysfunction; clinical and laboratory assessment of reproductive function; and established and investigational interventions to preserve reproductive function for patients newly diagnosed and survivors. Although survivorship research has made significant contributions to improving reproductive outcomes, additional scientific progress is needed in the areas of fertility preservation, risk assessment, and psychosexual support with the aim of optimizing reproductive health for current and future survivors.

### Fertility preservation in people with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^112rLAT6]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Male fertility preservation — treatment-related genetic risks to sperm: Updated evidence confirms that antineoplastic agents and radiation therapy (RT) can cause significant genetic damage in conceptuses. Alkylating agents and radiation can induce a high risk of mutations in spermatozoa and can be observed within 1–2 weeks after initiation of therapy; topoisomerase II inhibitors, and potentially microtubule inhibitors, pose the greatest risk between weeks 5 and 7 of treatment; and nucleoside analogs, antimetabolites, and bleomycin induce mutagenic effects on spermatozoa during weeks 7–10 of therapy.

### ESHRE guideline: female fertility preservation [^114B5PJ8]. Human Reproduction Open (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for fertility preservation, more specifically with respect to fertility preservation in females, ovarian tissue cryopreservation, ESHRE 2020 guidelines recommend to consider offering ovarian tissue cryopreservation as an option for fertility preservation in patients already received low gonadotoxic treatment or a previous course of chemotherapy.

### Association of impaired spermatogenesis with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors for metastatic melanoma… [^113CQXG4]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors has provided previously unachievable curative therapy for many patients, particularly those with metastatic melanoma. 1 However, the long-term outcomes for patients using ICIs are only beginning to be investigated. One important potential unexplored adverse effect is impaired male fertility. The current American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines state that "sperm cryopreservation is effective, and health care providers should discuss sperm banking with postpubertal males receiving cancer treatment. "2 The direct association of ICI treatment with spermatogenesis has not been explored, to our knowledge. 3 It will be critical to determine the risk to future male fertility for patients undergoing ICI therapy to accurately guide pretreatment counseling.

To address the association between the potential gonadotoxic effect of ICIs and spermatogenesis, to our knowledge, we performed the first retrospective review of an index patient who became infertile after ICI therapy and subsequently died, and we performed a retrospective cohort cadaver study of patients with metastatic melanoma. Six of the 7 men with metastatic melanoma who received ICI therapy had impaired spermatogenesis, including focal active spermatogenesis, hypospermatogenesis, and Sertoli-cell–only syndrome. Two of the 6 men who were untreated had impaired spermatogenesis. We did not identify any increased peritubular hyalinization or fibrosis in the treated group, and there were no Leydig cell abnormalities noted in any patients. Fertility preservation is an important facet in the care of men with cancer who are within their reproductive years.

5, 6 One key to improving cancer survivorship and quality of life is to anticipate potential treatment-associated sequelae. Identifying the association of ICIs with future fertility will be an important step in determining whether male fertility preservation is an essential component to pretreatment counseling. A limitation of our study was the small sample size. To our knowledge, the data herein are the first to evaluate the association of ICIs with testicular function, but prospective evaluations will be essential to determining the gonadotoxic effect of ICIs.

### Fertility preservation in people with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^115QWFY8]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Patient and clinician communication — Risks of pregnancy and children after cancer: Data are very limited, but there appears to be no increased risk of cancer recurrence from fertility preservation (FP) methods or pregnancy, even in hormonally sensitive tumors. Aside from hereditary genetic syndromes and in utero exposure to some chemotherapy treatments, there is no evidence that a history of cancer, cancer therapy, or fertility interventions increase the risk of cancer or congenital abnormalities in the progeny.

### Fertility preservation in people with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^115KHTVw]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Clinical interpretation — Cancer-directed treatments pose differential risks to future fertility, so risk stratification should be part of clinical infertility risk counseling and fertility preservation (FP) decision making; preclinical and prospective clinical data on reproductive risks of novel cancer-directed treatments are lacking and needed; and ongoing discussions on reproductive health with documentation is warranted not only to address fertility needs post-treatment but also to provide post-treatment FP in some females.

In this review, the reproductive impact of treatments for several common cancers and options to maintain fertility in women and men undergoing treatment for these cancers will be discussed. The options available to any particular cancer survivor will depend on her or his age at the time of diagnosis and treatment, cancer type and primary site, stage, and type of treatment.

### The effect of red blood cell disorders on male fertility and reproductive health [^1162UnPy]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2024). High credibility.

Male infertility is defined as a failure to conceive after 12 months of unprotected intercourse owing to suspected male reproductive factors. Non-malignant red blood cell disorders are systemic conditions that have been associated with male infertility with varying severity and strength of evidence. Hereditary haemoglobinopathies and bone marrow failure syndromes have been associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis dysfunction, hypogonadism, and abnormal sperm parameters. Bone marrow transplantation is a potential cure for these conditions, but exposes patients to potentially gonadotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation that could further impair fertility. Iron imbalance might also reduce male fertility. Thus, disorders of hereditary iron overload can cause iron deposition in tissues that might result in hypogonadism and impaired spermatogenesis, whereas severe iron deficiency can propagate anaemias that decrease gonadotropin release and sperm counts. Reproductive urologists should be included in the comprehensive care of patients with red blood cell disorders, especially when gonadotoxic treatments are being considered, to ensure fertility concerns are appropriately evaluated and managed.
