## Question

Is it appropriate to insert an estrogen-progesterone IUD in a patient with migraine with aura?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an "estrogen-progesterone IUD" is appropriate for a patient with migraine with aura. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the terminology around IUDs and whether any IUD actually contains estrogen. Then, I should evaluate the vascular risk profile of migraine with aura and how estrogen exposure modifies that risk. Next, I will review guideline-based contraceptive contraindications, especially for combined hormonal contraception, and confirm the safety of progestin-only methods, including levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs, as well as the copper IUD. Finally, I'll synthesize a clear recommendation and counseling points with supporting evidence from AAFP, ACOG, FDA labeling, and stroke literature [^116hxHpe] [^114Yvuko] [^113daFXA] [^117C3vcA].

> Wait, let me verify the terminology before anything else. There is no such thing as an "estrogen-progesterone IUD"; currently available IUDs are either nonhormonal copper devices or levonorgestrel-releasing devices that contain only a progestin and no estrogen, so the phrase "estrogen-progesterone IUD" is a misnomer and likely reflects confusion with combined estrogen-progestin methods such as pills, patches, or rings [^114Yvuko] [^1172NS8g] [^115Vj6ag].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should confirm the stroke risk context. Migraine with aura confers an increased risk of ischemic stroke, and exposure to estrogen in combined hormonal contraceptives amplifies that risk; accordingly, combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives are contraindicated in women with migraine with aura per evidence summaries and FDA labeling, and large claims-based analyses show the joint risk is highest in aura plus combined hormonal contraceptive users [^116hxHpe] [^113daFXA] [^114LjaY2] [^117C3vcA] [^114aP3Xf].

> I need to check whether progestin-only contraception remains acceptable here. Evidence-based guidance indicates that progestin-only methods — including levonorgestrel IUDs, the implant, and progestin-only pills — are safe for women with migraine, including those with aura, and do not carry the estrogen-related stroke signal; population data also show very few category 3 or 4 contraindications to progestin-only methods compared with combined methods in reproductive-age women [^116hxHpe] [^112DZNVe] [^114ezGPs].

> Let me consider the levonorgestrel-releasing IUD specifically. It contains no estrogen, thus avoiding the estrogen-mediated amplification of stroke risk seen with combined hormonal contraception, and is endorsed as a highly effective long-acting reversible contraceptive with few contraindications; counseling should include expected bleeding changes and reassurance regarding their benign nature to optimize continuation and satisfaction [^114Yvuko] [^115HUoCk] [^116hxHpe].

> Next, I should review the copper IUD option. The copper IUD is hormone-free, eliminates any concern about hormonal stroke risk, is among the most effective contraceptives, and is recommended broadly — including for emergency contraception — with no migraine-related contraindication in major guidance when standard IUD eligibility criteria are met [^114Yvuko] [^116hxHpe] [^115Vj6ag] [^112nmy8u].

> I will now synthesize the recommendation. No, it is NOT appropriate to insert an "estrogen-progesterone IUD" because such a product does not exist — because such a product does not exist — wait, I should double-check my wording, but the core point stands; instead, for a patient with migraine with aura, a levonorgestrel-releasing (progestin-only) IUD or a copper IUD is appropriate and preferred, and combined estrogen-containing contraceptives (pills, patch, ring) should be avoided due to increased ischemic stroke risk [^116hxHpe] [^114Yvuko] [^113daFXA] [^114LjaY2].

> But wait, what if there are additional risk modifiers? I need to ensure counseling includes assessment of other vascular risks (e.g., smoking, hypertension) and clear documentation of aura history; reinforce that progestin-only methods and the copper IUD do not add estrogen-related stroke risk, which aligns with the risk-avoidance rationale and with widely used medical eligibility frameworks referenced by AAFP, while estrogen-containing methods remain contraindicated in migraine with aura [^116hxHpe] [^117C3vcA] [^114LjaY2].

---

No — estrogen-progestin IUDs are not available or approved [^114Yvuko]; only progestin-only IUDs exist [^112WSCvt]. In migraine with aura, **estrogen-containing contraceptives are contraindicated** [^113daFXA] due to increased ischemic stroke risk [^114LjaY2]. Progestin-only (levonorgestrel) IUDs are **safe and recommended** [^114Yvuko], as they do not increase stroke risk or exacerbate aura [^112DZNVe]. If estrogen is needed, use the lowest effective dose and monitor closely; nonetheless, avoid estrogen-containing contraceptives in migraine with aura [^116hxHpe].

---

## Availability of estrogen-progestin IUDs

Currently, **no estrogen-progestin IUDs are available or approved** [^114Yvuko]; all IUDs are either progestin-only (levonorgestrel) or non-hormonal (copper) [^1172NS8g]. Levonorgestrel IUDs release progestin locally [^112WSCvt], resulting in minimal systemic estrogen exposure.

---

## Risks associated with estrogen-containing contraceptives in migraine with aura

Estrogen-containing contraceptives (COCs, patch, ring) are **contraindicated in migraine with aura** [^116hxHpe] due to increased ischemic stroke risk [^114LjaY2]. The risk is highest in women with migraine with aura who use estrogen-containing contraceptives [^113daFXA], especially when additional risk factors are present (smoking, hypertension, age > 35) [^117C3vcA].

---

## Safety of progestin-only IUDs in migraine with aura

Progestin-only IUDs are **safe and effective** in migraine with aura [^112WSCvt], with no increased ischemic stroke risk or aura exacerbation [^112DZNVe]. They are recommended for women with migraine with aura who require contraception [^114Yvuko].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines **recommend avoiding estrogen-containing contraceptives** in migraine with aura [^116hxHpe] due to stroke risk [^114LjaY2], and endorse progestin-only IUDs as safe and effective alternatives [^114Yvuko] [^112WSCvt].

---

## Alternative contraceptive options

Alternative contraceptive options for women with **migraine with aura** include:

- **Progestin-only pills**: Safe and effective alternative to estrogen-containing contraceptives [^112DZNVe].

- **Copper IUD**: Non-hormonal, safe, and effective [^114Yvuko].

- **Barrier methods**: Condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps [^116hxHpe].

- **Permanent sterilization**: Tubal ligation or vasectomy [^116hxHpe].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

If estrogen-containing contraceptives are considered (e.g. for non-contraceptive indications), use the lowest effective dose and monitor closely for neurological symptoms or aura exacerbation; however, estrogen-containing contraceptives **should generally be avoided** in migraine with aura due to stroke risk [^117C3vcA].

Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets are contraindicated in females who have headaches with focal neurological symptoms or have migraine headaches with aura and in women over age 35 years who have migraine headaches with or without aura [see CONTRAINDICATIONS].

If a woman using levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, it is important to evaluate the cause. Discontinue levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated. Consider discontinuing them if there is an increased frequency or severity of migraines during the use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs), as this may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event.

### An evidence-based approach to hormonal contraception and headaches [^112DZNVe]. Contraception (2009). Low credibility.

Some controversy exists regarding contraceptive management in women with migraines, particularly migraines with aura. The available scientific literature indicates that combined hormonal contraception is safe with most headache subtypes; however, it should be avoided in women with migraine with aura and in women with simple migraines who have other risk factors for stroke. Progestin-only contraceptives, as well as the copper intrauterine device, can be safely used in women with migraines. Accurate classification of a patient's headache type can avoid unnecessary restriction of effective contraceptive methods, particularly those containing estrogen.

### Headache as a side effect of combination estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives: A systematic review [^1173hfFF]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

We conducted a two-part systematic review of published studies to examine the evidence that combination oral contraceptives can aggravate or cause headaches.

- **Study design**: We used trials with a control group to assess the headache risk attributable to oral contraceptive use. Prospective cohort trials were utilized to answer important clinical questions about the natural history and treatment response of headaches occurring with oral contraceptive use.

- **Results**: Due to differences in study populations, oral contraceptive formulations, trial endpoints, and trial duration, it was not feasible to pool data. However, the evidence supports several conclusions. There is little indication that oral contraceptives have a clinically significant effect on headache activity in most women.

- **Conclusion**: Headache that occurs during early cycles of oral contraceptive use tends to improve or disappear with continued use. No evidence supports the common clinical practice of switching oral contraceptives to treat headaches; however, manipulating the extent or duration of estrogen withdrawal may provide benefits.

### Assessment of erenumab safety and efficacy in patients with migraine with and without aura: A secondary analysis of randomized clinical trials [^112LkaP4]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Previous studies indicated that patients with migraine with aura may respond differently to acute therapies compared with those with migraine without aura. Furthermore, CGRP was found to provoke migraine attacks without aura in patients with a history of aura. Thus, it was not known whether erenumab was efficacious in patients with migraine with a history of aura. Findings of this post hoc secondary analysis support the safety and efficacy of erenumab in patients with migraine with or without a history of aura. Those who received erenumab in both subgroups attained greater reductions in MMDs from baseline than those who received placebo, with an increased proportion of patients achieving 50% or greater reductions in MMDs. Among patients who used AMSM, monthly AMSM days were reduced. These clinical responses were maintained in the longer term, with a treatment time frame ranging from 1 to 1.25 years and up to 5 years in some cases.

In this post hoc analysis, no differences were found in the safety profiles of patients with and without a history of aura, and no unexpected safety findings were observed. Most of the reported AEs were mild or moderate.

### Contraindications to hormonal contraception among postpartum women in Texas [^114ezGPs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Of the 1,700 women enrolled in the study, 1,452 (85.4%) completed the 6-month survey and were included in these analyses. The most commonly reported contraindications included migraine with aura (12.4%), hypertension (4.8%), and gall bladder disease (1.7%); all other contraindications were reported by less than 1.0% of the sample. Among participants, 19.1% (278/1,452) had any category 3 or 4 contraindication to combined hormonal contraception (2.3% [34/1,452] category 3 only), and 5.4% (78/1,452) had any category 3 or 4 contraindication to DMPA (5.3% [77/1,452] category 3 only). Only 0.8% (11/1,452) of the sample had any category 3 or 4 contraindication to progestin-only pills and 0.6% (9/1,452) to the implant. A total of 19.1% (278/1,452) of the sample had any contraindication to hormonal contraception (2.3% [34/1,452] category 3 only).

### Identification and characterization of migraine in pregnancy: A Norwegian registry-based cohort study [^1149gEfz]. Cephalalgia (2024). Low credibility.

Migraine is common in women of reproductive age. Its episodic manifestation and the challenges associated with both acute and preventive pharmacological treatment options complicate the study of drug safety for migraines during pregnancy. To improve such studies, we aimed to develop algorithms to identify and characterize migraines in electronic healthcare registries and assess the level of care provided.

- **Methods**: We linked four registries to detect pregnancies from 2009 to 2018 and used three algorithms for migraine identification: (i) diagnostic codes, (ii) triptans dispensed, and (iii) a combination of both. We assessed migraine severity using dispensed drugs as proxies. ICD-10 diagnostic subcodes of migraine (G43) allowed the allocation of four subtypes: complicated and/or status migrainosus, with aura, without aura, and other/unspecified.

- **Results**: We included 535,089 pregnancies in 367,908 women with an available one-year lookback. The prevalence of migraines identified was 2.9%-4.3% before pregnancy and 0.8%-1.5% during pregnancy, depending on the algorithm used. Pregnant women with migraines were mostly managed in primary care.

- **Conclusions**: Primary care data combined with drug dispensation records were instrumental for the identification of migraines in electronic healthcare registries. Data from secondary care and drug dispensations allow better characterization of migraines. Jointly, these algorithms may contribute to improved perinatal pharmacoepidemiological studies in this population by addressing confounding by maternal migraine indication.

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and self-reported aura: Post hoc analysis of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 [^115puMDR]. Cephalalgia (2022). High credibility.

Most treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in patients with migraine and self-reported aura were mild or moderate in severity. TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 15 patients (100 mg: n = 7, 2.5%; 300 mg: n = 3, 1.0%; placebo: n = 5, 1.7%). Serious TEAEs occurred in 18 patients (100 mg: n = 6, 2.1%; 300 mg: n = 5, 1.7%; placebo: n = 7, 2.4%). Compared to the established safety and tolerability profile of eptinezumab, no new safety signals were identified specifically in this subgroup of patients self-reporting a history of aura.

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and self-reported aura: Post hoc analysis of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 [^1159rbWs]. Cephalalgia (2022). High credibility.

This post hoc subgroup analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of eptinezumab for migraine prevention in patients with migraine and self-reported aura. PROMISE-1 (NCT02559895; episodic migraine) and PROMISE-2 (NCT02974153; chronic migraine) were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that evaluated eptinezumab for migraine prevention. In both studies, the primary outcome was the mean change from baseline in monthly migraine days over Weeks 1–12. Patients in this analysis included those who self-reported migraine with aura at screening.

- **Results**: Of patients with episodic migraine, approximately 75% reported a history of aura at screening; of patients with chronic migraine, approximately 35% reported a history of aura. Changes in monthly migraine days over Weeks 1–12 were -4.0 (100mg) and -4.2 (300mg) with eptinezumab versus -3.1 with placebo in patients with episodic migraine with aura, and were -7.1 (100mg) and -7.6 (300mg) with eptinezumab versus -6.0 with placebo in patients with chronic migraine with aura. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 56.0% (100mg), 57.4% (300mg), and 55.4% (placebo) of patients.

- **Conclusions**: The preventive migraine efficacy of eptinezumab in patients in the PROMISE studies who self-reported aura was comparable to the overall study populations, demonstrating a similarly favorable safety and tolerability profile.

### Sumatriptan-naproxen sodium in migraine: A review [^116fUG59]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Menstrual migraine, a common umbrella term that covers the definitions of pure menstrual migraine and menstrually-related migraine, describes a diagnosis of migraine with or without aura that commonly occurs on or between days −2 to +3 of menstruation in at least two of three consecutive menstrual cycles. Menstrual migraine without aura is estimated to affect up to one-quarter (18%–25%) of female migraineurs, while in populations from headache clinics, the proportion of women affected is estimated to be even higher (22%–70%).

In women diagnosed with menstrual migraine, perimenstrual attacks are associated with a significantly longer attack duration, greater work disability, reduced pharmacological response compared with non-menstrual attacks, and the presence of non-neurological symptoms, mainly dysmenorrhea, which increase the burden of disease. The management of menstrual migraine is not vastly different from the management of non-menstrual migraine. However, consideration must be given to the longer attack duration, often requiring several consecutive days of treatment and additional treatment for headache recurrence, and that patients may be relatively refractory to medicines that work in non-menstrual attacks.

Two replicate randomized, placebo-controlled trials investigating sumatriptan-naproxen sodium showed excellent efficacy in the treatment of a single menstrual migraine attack associated with dysmenorrhea. The studies included 312 and 311 participants in the intention-to-treat (full analysis set), respectively, who were randomly assigned.

### New directions in migraine [^117AxcCQ]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Migraine is a common, episodic neurological disorder characterized by severe headaches, and in about one-third of cases, it is preceded by a focal, transient neurological phenomenon termed the 'aura'. Whether migraine with aura (MA) and migraine without aura (MO) are distinct or overlapping entities is somewhat contested, but it is not uncommon for patients to experience both forms of migraine. Migraine affects up to 18% of women and 6% of men, with a peak incidence between 25 and 55 years of age. The disease has long fascinated clinicians and scientists, with descriptions of migraine-like symptoms appearing in antiquity. However, only recently have the pathogenic mechanisms started to be unraveled. This is particularly true for MA, which is perhaps a more homogeneous and tractable condition for study than MO because the phenotype of MA is well-defined, and genetics likely play a greater role.

The migraine aura is likely caused by 'cortical spreading depression' (CSD), a wave of intense neuronal and glial depolarization followed by a period of inactivity, slowly progressing over the cortex. The trigeminal system (TGVS), consisting of the meningeal and superficial cortical blood vessels that are innervated by the trigeminal nerve, is strongly implicated in the initiation of the headache pain. The TGVS projects to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) in the brainstem, which in turn projects to higher-order pain centers. Animal models provide evidence that CSD could be linked to activation of the TGVS, thus providing a hypothetical triggering mechanism for the migraine attack.

### Migraine and its major subtypes - with and without aura are associated with polygenic scores for autism [^111QfR6i]. Cephalalgia (2025). Low credibility.

Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience a wide array of neurological, psychiatric, and medical comorbidities, yet little attention has been given to the potential link between ASD and migraine, one of the most prevalent neurological disorders worldwide. This study aimed to investigate whether a genetic predisposition for ASD is linked to migraine and its major subtypes, with and without aura. Additionally, potential moderators and mediators of the association between ASD and migraine were explored.

- **Methods**: Polygenic scores (PGS) for ASD were constructed based on the genome-wide association study by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, on the UK Biobank cohort dataset comprising 337,386 participants using PRSice-2. Regression analyses were performed to investigate the association of ASD PGS with migraine and its major subtypes, with and without aura. Sex was explored as a potential moderating factor. The mediation analyses took into consideration variables such as education, personality trait neuroticism, body mass index (BMI), and four categories of comorbidities (psychiatric, vascular, neurologic, and others).

- **Results**: ASD PGS were significantly and positively associated with migraine (odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02–1.05, p < 0.002), migraine without aura (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02–1.07, p < 0.002), and migraine with aura (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02–1.07, p < 0.002). No moderating effect of sex on the association between ASD PGS and migraine was observed. As for potential mediators, only the personality trait neuroticism significantly influenced the association.

### CGRP-targeted migraine therapies in patients with vascular risk factors or stroke: A review [^115eoNRD]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

A case report describes a 41-year-old woman with episodic migraine without aura who received preventive mAb therapy with erenumab 70 mg. The report notes an acute right-sided thalamic infarction on MRI 34 days after the first dose of erenumab. A CT angiography detected a right-sided near-occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery P1 segment, with a large right posterior communicating artery. It is worth noting that the erenumab injection was only administered on one occasion, and the subsequent stroke occurred after the half-life was exceeded. Additionally, the patient had been on an estrogen-containing oral contraceptive for approximately 10 years and had taken a triptan to treat her acute migraine attack just before the stroke, which raises the possibility that erenumab may not have been the sole contributing factor.

Two case reports have described reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) in women who were undergoing preventive therapy with fremanezumab and erenumab. The diagnostic workup did not identify any causality for RCVS except for the newly initiated therapies with mAbs.

### Health technology assessment for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine: A position statement of the International Headache Society [^116CVzmL]. Cephalalgia (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with prior treatment failure, intolerance to prior treatment, contraindications to treatment, or with chronic migraine and medication overuse merit special consideration when evaluating technologies intended for the preventive treatment of migraine.

- **Prior treatment failure**: New technologies for the preventive treatment of migraine can be compared with placebo in patients in whom two classes of preventive treatments, each taken regularly in adequate doses for at least 3 months, were considered to have failed.

- **Intolerance to prior treatment**: New technologies for the preventive treatment of migraine can be compared with placebo in patients who have terminated two or more classes of migraine preventive treatments due to adverse effects. Classes are defined as medications or devices that have been approved or cleared for migraine, or have demonstrated efficacy in two or more randomized controlled trials.

- **Contraindications to treatment**: New technologies for the preventive treatment of migraine can be compared with placebo in patients in whom two or more classes of migraine preventive therapies are contraindicated. Valproate and related substances (valproic acid, sodium valproate, valproate semisodium, and valpromide) are contraindicated in pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective methods of contraception.

- **Chronic migraine and medication overuse**: New technologies for the preventive treatment of migraine can be compared with placebo in patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse who failed preventive treatment.

### Relpax [^116HCaaZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Relpax is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.

- **Limitations of use**: Use only if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to the first migraine attack treated with Relpax, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before administering Relpax to treat any subsequent attacks. Relpax is not intended for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of Relpax have not been established for cluster headache.

Relpax is a serotonin (5-HT1B/1D) receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.

- **Limitations of use**: Use only following a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. Relpax is not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine. It is also not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache.

### Loryna [^116nQWAQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The adverse reactions seen across the two indications overlapped and are reported using the frequencies from the pooled dataset. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were headache/migraine (6.7%), menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage, primarily spotting, and metrorrhagia) (4.7%), nausea/vomiting (4.2%), breast pain/tenderness (4%), and mood changes (mood swings, depression, depressed mood, and affect lability) (2.2%).

- **Pmdd clinical trials**: Safety data from trials for the indication of PMDD are reported separately due to differences in study design and setting in the contraception and acne studies compared to the PMDD clinical program. Two (one parallel and one crossover designed) multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials for the secondary indication of treating the symptoms of PMDD evaluated the safety and efficacy of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol during up to three cycles among 285 women aged 18–42, diagnosed with PMDD, and who took at least one dose of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol.

Common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage, primarily spotting, and metrorrhagia) (24.9%), nausea (15.8%), headache (13.0%), breast tenderness (10.5%), fatigue (4.2%), irritability (2.8%), decreased libido (2.8%), increased weight (2.5%), and affect lability (2.1%).

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^116vNnhh]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

1. Clinical trials for the acute treatment of migraine attacks

- **Subject selection**: Eligible subjects should fulfill the diagnostic criteria for migraine according to the most recent version of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) by the International Headache Society (IHS).

Clinical trials of acute treatments for migraine can include subjects who have migraine without aura, migraine with aura, and both migraine types, but the ICHD diagnostic criteria should be fulfilled to avoid population heterogeneity. In trials focusing on the acute treatment of migraine with aura, subjects with both migraine types can be included, as aura symptoms are recognizable, the attack types are distinguishable, and most people who have migraine with aura also have attacks of migraine without aura. (Refer to Section 2.1 for more information about migraine with aura.) In trials enrolling participants with a history of both types of attacks, the type of the treated attack should be classified according to ICHD criteria based on the clinical features captured in a diary. Note that this requirement may be impractical when subjects are instructed to treat early, because early treatment of migraine can modify the clinical features of an attack and thereby prevent analysis by type. (Refer to Section 2.2 for more information about early intervention trials.) In some instances, after efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in subjects with confirmed diagnoses of migraine without aura and migraine with aura, trials targeting subjects with probable migraine may proceed.

### Practice bulletin no. 186: Long-acting reversible contraception: Implants and intrauterine devices [^115HUoCk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for intrauterine devices, more specifically with respect to considerations for intrauterine contraception, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend including information on expected bleeding changes and reassurance of their non-harmful nature in patient counseling. This approach aims to improve satisfaction and continuation of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^117EDtQ2]. Cephalalgia (2019). High credibility.

- **Age at entry**: Adult subjects participating in clinical trials should be between 18 and 65 years of age at entry. Only people who are at least 18 years old can provide informed consent. The inclusion of subjects older than 65 years is encouraged in post-marketing surveillance studies. After age 65, those with migraine are more likely to have (and be taking medications for) coexistent conditions than a younger population, which can confound assessments of safety and drug-drug interactions. Adverse health-related outcomes due to coexistent disease may be difficult to separate from a complication of the treatment under investigation.

- **Sex**: Males and females with migraine are eligible to participate in clinical trials of acute migraine medications. Migraine is at least three times more prevalent in females than in males. Special caution should be taken to avoid enrolling women who may be pregnant or lactating, unless they are the target of the trial. Partners of fertile-age women should practice effective contraception (refer to Section 2.3 for information about menstrual migraine).

- **Concomitant drug use**: Trials allowing participants to treat conditions other than migraine should pre-specify the permitted uses of concomitant therapies (i.e. open or restricted). The use of contraceptive medication should also be pre-specified. In phase II clinical trials, subjects should not be allowed to treat conditions other than migraine.

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and self-reported aura: Post hoc analysis of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 [^114aHDb8]. Cephalalgia (2022). High credibility.

This post hoc subgroup analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of eptinezumab for migraine prevention in patients with migraine and self-reported aura.

- **Methods**: PROMISE-1 (NCT02559895; episodic migraine) and PROMISE-2 (NCT02974153; chronic migraine) were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that evaluated eptinezumab for migraine prevention. In both studies, the primary outcome was the mean change from baseline in monthly migraine days over Weeks 1–12. Patients in this analysis included those who self-reported migraine with aura at screening.

- **Results**: Of patients with episodic migraine, approximately 75% reported a history of aura at screening; of patients with chronic migraine, approximately 35% reported a history of aura. Changes in monthly migraine days over Weeks 1–12 were –4.0 (100 mg) and –4.2 (300 mg) with eptinezumab versus –3.1 with placebo in patients with episodic migraine with aura. In patients with chronic migraine with aura, the changes were –7.1 (100 mg) and –7.6 (300 mg) with eptinezumab versus –6.0 with placebo. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 56.0% (100 mg), 57.4% (300 mg), and 55.4% (placebo) of patients.

- **Conclusions**: The preventive migraine efficacy of eptinezumab in patients in the PROMISE studies who self-reported aura was comparable to the overall study populations, demonstrating a similarly favorable safety and tolerability profile.

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and self-reported aura: Post hoc analysis of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 [^112YRjXE]. Cephalalgia (2022). High credibility.

In this subgroup analysis of patients with migraine and a self-reported history of aura, efficacy results were consistent with the full population results of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2, with patients experiencing reductions in migraine frequency (4 [EM] to 8 [CM] fewer MMDs vs. baseline), proportion of migraine attacks with aura (decrease from baseline of approximately 5 percentage points), and acute medication use (4 fewer acute medication days per month). Also, the tolerability profile of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and a self-reported history of aura was consistent with what was previously reported in the full EM and CM populations. These findings suggest that eptinezumab may be clinically useful in the migraine with aura subpopulation.

Eptinezumab decreased the percentage of migraine attacks with aura relative to baseline (percentage-point decreases of 5.0 and 4.7) and to a larger extent than placebo (percentage-point decrease of 3.1), suggesting a small treatment effect on aura frequency beyond reducing migraine frequency. The effects of eptinezumab on the severity of aura and specific aura presentations were not specifically evaluated in the PROMISE studies, and only limited data with respect to effects on aura have been reported for the entire CGRP monoclonal antibody drug class. A single report of a post hoc analysis of data from three phase 3 clinical studies indicated that galcanezumab reduced both the frequency of prodromal symptoms relative to placebo (in patients with EM and with CM) and the number of migraine headache days with aura.

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and self-reported aura: Post hoc analysis of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 [^111xYHDW]. Cephalalgia (2022). High credibility.

The full methodologies of PROMISE-1 (NCT02559895) and PROMISE-2 (NCT02974153) have been published; key elements are reviewed here. Both studies were conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable local regulatory requirements. Independent ethics committee or institutional review board approval was obtained for each study site, with all patients providing written informed consent prior to study participation.

Both studies were phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials that evaluated the preventive efficacy, tolerability, and safety of eptinezumab in adults with migraine. PROMISE-1 enrolled patients with episodic migraine (EM), and PROMISE-2 enrolled patients with chronic migraine (CM). Migraine was defined using the International Classification for Headache Disorders (ICHD) definitions for migraine broadly. Patients separately reported any experience of aura with their migraine, being asked if they experienced aura at the screening visit (and if it was ever experienced without headache pain). To improve the accuracy of self-reporting, investigators confirmed each patient's understanding of aura during the screening visit and provided additional description and/or explanation, if needed. Educational materials pertaining to aura were also provided as part of electronic Diary (eDiary) training.

### Practice guideline update summary: Pharmacologic treatment for pediatric migraine prevention: Report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^112b6LRE]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for migraine, particularly concerning pediatric and adolescent patients in the context of pharmacologic prophylaxis, the AAN/AHS 2019 guidelines make several recommendations. They advise that patients of childbearing potential should be counseled about the potential of topiramate to decrease the efficacy of oral combined hormonal contraceptives, especially at doses greater than 200 mg daily, when offering topiramate for migraine prevention. Additionally, these patients should be encouraged to discuss optimal contraception methods with their healthcare provider during treatment when topiramate or valproate is offered for migraine prevention.

### Migraine headache: An under-appreciated risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women [^116WRZGD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

- **Role of sex hormones**: As noted previously, the prevalence of migraine and frequency of attacks rise abruptly after puberty and decline around the time of menopause. Studies have consistently shown that women suffer more frequent, longer, and more severe episodes of headache. Women are also less likely to have episodes of remission or migraine-free periods. Moreover, women are more likely to experience severe associated symptoms like photophobia, nausea, and vomiting compared with men.

In addition, some women experience more frequent episodes of migraine around the time of their menstrual cycle (i.e. menstrual-related migraine) or exclusively during menstruation (i.e. pure menstrual migraine). Another important observation is that women who use combined oral contraceptive pills have a higher prevalence of headache, especially migraine. Notably, women are more likely to experience improvement in their symptoms during pregnancy. These observations suggest that sex hormones, particularly estrogen, play an important role in the sex-related differences in migraine prevalence.

It has been postulated that estrogen withdrawal triggers migraine episodes and/or lowers the pain threshold among women. One study found that women suffering from menstrual-related migraine had a lower level of peak estradiol compared with controls, and another study found that women with migraine had a faster late luteal phase estrogen decline compared with healthy controls. Stemming from this concept, small studies have suggested that testosterone therapy may play a role; however, the text cuts off here and requires further information for completion.

### Prevention of episodic migraine headache using pharmacologic treatments in outpatient settings: A clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111vLknW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for migraine, and more specifically with respect to migraine prophylaxis, the CGRP inhibitors, ACP 2025 guidelines recommend considering monotherapy with a CGRP antagonist (atogepant or rimegepant) or a CGRP antibody (eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, or galcanezumab) for the prevention of episodic migraine in nonpregnant adults in outpatient settings. These treatments are advised for individuals who do not tolerate or inadequately respond to a trial or trials of a β-blocker (metoprolol or propranolol), valproate, venlafaxine, or amitriptyline.

### Evaluation and management of migraine in midlife women [^112Q9cuL]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

Migraine is highly prevalent in women and, in addition to the pain component, can be associated with significant disability and loss of productivity. It is often connected to fluctuations in hormones, primarily estrogen, commonly arising in puberty, worsening in perimenopause, and quiescing in late menopause. This Practice Pearl discusses the various types of migraine with respect to hormone fluctuations and details acute as well as preventive treatment.

### Estrogens, migraine, and stroke [^117C3vcA]. Stroke (2004). Low credibility.

Epidemiological studies suggest the existence of close but complex relationships between estrogens, migraine, and stroke in women before menopause. Migraine, particularly without aura, is strongly influenced by estrogens, as illustrated by the frequency of onset at puberty, the prevalence of menstrual migraine, and the improvement of symptoms during pregnancy. Migraine with aura, however, is a risk factor for ischemic stroke, with a relative risk of 3. This risk is further increased by tobacco smoking and oral contraceptive use. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying these relationships remains unknown.

In practice, given the very low absolute risk of stroke in young women, there is no systematic contraindication to oral contraceptive use in young female migraineurs. However, there is a firm recommendation for avoiding smoking and using low-estrogen-content pills or progestogens only, particularly in cases of migraine with aura.

### Migraine with and without aura in relation to the menstrual cycle and other hormonal milestones: A prospective cohort study [^112BLEgR]. Cephalalgia (2023). High credibility.

Previous studies have shown that the perimenstrual window is associated with an increased susceptibility to migraine attacks without aura, but they have had conflicting results regarding attacks with aura.

- **Methods**: We performed a longitudinal E-diary study among 526 premenopausal women with migraines. Differences in the occurrence of perimenstrual migraine attacks between women with migraine with aura and without aura were assessed using a mixed-effects logistic regression model. Additionally, participants completed a questionnaire about the influence of hormonal milestones on migraine frequency.

- **Results**: The prevalence of menstrual migraine did not differ between women with migraine without aura and those with migraine with aura (59% versus 53%, p = 0.176). The increased risk of migraine attacks without aura during the perimenstrual window was similar for women with migraine without aura (OR [95% CI]: 1.53 [1.44–1.62]) and those with migraine with aura (1.53 [1.44–1.62]). The perimenstrual window was not associated with an increased risk of migraine aura attacks (1.08 [0.93–1.26], p = 0.314). Women with migraine with aura more often reported increased migraine frequency during pregnancy and breastfeeding compared to women with migraine without aura, but not during hormonal contraception use.

- **Conclusion**: Sex hormone levels seem to differently affect the trigeminovascular system (migraine headache) and the susceptibility to cortical spreading depolarization (aura). Exclusively, migraine attacks without aura should be interpreted as perimenstrual attacks.

### Effects of an estrogen-free, desogestrel-containing oral contraceptive in women with migraine with aura: a prospective diary-based pilot study [^115yhZur]. Contraception (2011). Low credibility.

Migraine with aura (MA) is a contraindication to the use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) because of the increased risk of ischemic stroke. The progestogen-only contraceptive pill (POP) is a safe alternative to COCs and is preferable for women with cerebrovascular diseases or risk factors for stroke.

- **Study design**: Prospective diary-based pilot study. Thirty women with MA, including 15 who have never used COCs and 15 who had previously used COCs, were diagnosed according to the International Headache Society criteria. The observational period lasted 9 months, during which women filled in a diary with the clinical characteristics of headache attacks. After a 3-month run-in period, each subject received an estrogen-free desogestrel (DSG) (75 mcg/day)-containing OC (Cerazette®; Schering-Plough, formerly NV Organon, Oss, The Netherlands). Follow-up evaluations were planned at the end of the third and sixth months of treatment.

- **Results**: The number (mean ± S.D.) of migraine attacks was significantly reduced both in previous COC users (from 3.9 ± 1.0 to 2.9 ± 0.8; p < .001) and non-users (from 3.2 ± 0.9 to 2.6 ± 1.3; p < .02) following 6 months of POP use compared with the run-in period. The duration of headache pain did not differ significantly in both groups throughout the study. Interestingly, a beneficial POP effect on the duration (mean ± S.D.) of visual aura (from 16.3 ± 9.5 to 11.4 ± 5.6 min) and on the total duration (mean ± S.D.) of neurological symptoms (from 33.6 ± 23.3 to 18.6 ± 18.0 min) was only significantly reported by previous COC users (p < .001 for both) by the end of the study.

### Migraine with aura and risk of cardiovascular and all cause mortality in men and women: Prospective cohort study [^116ajZnv]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

Overall, using total mortality, our model suggests that at age 50, men and women with migraine with aura had a median loss of 1.5 and 1.4 years of life, respectively, compared with those without headache (see appendix 3 on bmj.com).

At age 50, the absolute risk of all-cause mortality was low but still considerably higher for men than for women. For example, the 10-year risk for men aged 50 was 6.8% in those with no headache and 8.0% in those with migraine with aura; the corresponding values for women were 3.0% and 3.6%. At age 70, the absolute 10-year risk had risen to 40.6% and 46.1% for men and 24.1% and 27.9% for women (see appendix 4 on bmj.com).

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and self-reported aura: Post hoc analysis of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 [^113jG2tR]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

Patients were randomized to receive eptinezumab 30 mg (PROMISE-1 only), 100 mg, 300 mg, or placebo administered intravenously every 12 weeks. Patients in PROMISE-1 received up to four treatments (48 weeks), while those in PROMISE-2 received up to two treatments (24 weeks). This post hoc analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of eptinezumab for the preventive treatment of migraine in the subgroup of patients who self-reported a history of aura at screening in either study. It included only those patients who received approved eptinezumab dose levels (i.e. 100 mg or 300 mg) or placebo.

Outcome measures included changes in migraine frequency (i.e. monthly migraine days, MMDs), migraine responder rates (≥ 50% and ≥ 75%) over weeks 1–12 and 13–24, percent of migraine attacks with aura, acute medication days, and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Patients from PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 were pooled for all analyses except for the change from baseline in MMDs due to differences in patient populations at baseline. Monthly migraine days were derived from eDiary data and were based on 4-week intervals. A 50% responder was a patient who achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in MMDs, and a 75% responder was a patient who achieved a ≥ 75% reduction in MMDs. These reductions were evaluated by comparing the baseline frequency of migraine days to the migraine frequency in 4-week intervals. Results from the 4-week intervals were combined to produce 12- and 24-week responder endpoints.

In the daily eDiaries, patients indicated whether they experienced aura symptoms as discussed with the investigator during screening.

### Prevention of menstrual attacks of migraine: A double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study [^112r5zYG]. Neurology (2006). High credibility.

To assess the effect of perimenstrual estradiol supplements on menstrual attacks of migraine associated with estrogen withdrawal, a study was conducted. Women with regular menstrual cycles and menstrual migraine or menstrually related migraine completed an initial three-cycle assessment confirming eligibility for a six-cycle crossover study using estradiol or placebo to prevent menstrual attacks of migraine.

Women collected early morning urine samples daily for laboratory assay and used a fertility monitor to identify peak fertility associated with ovulation. Estradiol gel or placebo was first applied on the tenth day following the first day of peak fertility and continued daily until, and including, the second full day of menstruation. Women kept a daily migraine diary and continued their usual treatment for migraine. The main outcome was the number of days during gel use on which a migraine occurred.

Data from 35 women were available for a paired analysis. Percutaneous estradiol was associated with a 22% reduction in migraine days (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.99, p = 0.04); these migraines were less severe and less likely to be associated with nausea. This was, however, followed by a 40% increase in migraine in the 5 days following estradiol vs. placebo (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.92, p = 0.03).

Although perimenstrual percutaneous estradiol showed benefit during treatment, this was offset by deferred estrogen withdrawal, triggering post-dosing migraine immediately after the gel was stopped. Further work could assess if this could be avoided by extending the treatment duration.

### Migraine and menopause - a narrative review [^115dER7k]. Menopause (2020). Low credibility.

This narrative review addresses common clinical questions and concerns of both physicians and patients about migraine during and after the perimenopausal transition, specifically:

- **How the perimenopausal transition affects migraine prevalence**: Does this vary by migraine type?
- **Stroke risk associated with migraine and hormone therapy (HT)**: Does the magnitude of stroke risk increase with HT?
- **Best practices for migraine treatment in perimenopausal women**

We searched PubMed from 2010 through the present. Search terms included migraine, menopause, and HT. Articles were included if they were in English and had full text availability. In addition, key references identified in the search articles were included.

Many women are informed that their migraines will disappear postmenopause. There are some data to support this, but a specific time frame has not been evidenced. Stroke risk in women with migraine with aura is small in absolute terms but important at the population level because migraine is so prevalent. The risk becomes clinically important in the context of additional stroke risk factors, which increase with aging, such as hypertension. Estrogen in combined hormonal contraception increases the risk of an ischemic stroke; however, the lower amount of estrogen in HT may not contribute to a meaningful increase in stroke risk. HT is a preventative sex-specific treatment for female migraineurs during the menopausal transition.

### Comparing perimenstrual and nonperimenstrual migraine attacks using an e-diary [^115x5C3B]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Cortical spreading depression (CSD), which is thought to be the underlying mechanism of the migraine aura, is also suggested to be affected by estrogen levels. High estrogen levels were shown to increase CSD susceptibility, whereas estrogen withdrawal and low estrogen levels appeared to decrease the risk for CSD, which may explain why perimenstrual migraine attacks are less likely to be associated with aura in women with MRM. The observed more pronounced photophobia during perimenstrual migraine attacks seems noteworthy in that light because previous studies suggested photophobia to be associated with visual aura. Greater visual cortex hyperexcitability in migraine with aura may induce abnormal processing of light sensitivity and may be the link between symptoms of photophobia and CSD susceptibility.

Women with MRM did not have a higher PMS prevalence compared to women with non-MRM, in contrast to what some small diary-based pilot studies suggested. The prevalence of PMS in our large cohort of women with migraine is comparable to the prevalence in the general population, which ranges between 5% and 20%. Our finding corresponds with previous studies reporting PMS in 10%–30% of women with migraine, and we did not find a difference in PMS between women with and without MRM. However, as there is important overlap in symptomology between PMS and the prodromal phase of migraine, it is conceivable that women with MRM are less likely to differentiate between these two phenomena. Importantly, we did find slightly higher PMS symptom scores and functional impairment scores in women with MRM.

### Migraine headache: An under-appreciated risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women [^114aP3Xf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Considerable evidence links migraine, particularly with aura, to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. These data have been studied more frequently among women. In a prospective cohort of over 27,000 healthy women older than 45 years with no prior ischemic events from the Women's Health Study, a self-reported diagnosis of migraine with aura was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and a major cardiovascular event (defined as the first instance of non-fatal ischemic stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or death due to ischemic event). This was after adjusting for traditional CVD risk factors, oral contraceptive pill use, hormonal replacement therapy, and statins, but not for the use of NSAIDs, since women enrolled in the Women's Health Study had to be willing to forgo the use of NSAIDs throughout the trial.

These findings were further confirmed in another prospective cohort of approximately 115,000 women aged 25 to 42 years at baseline from the Nurse's Health Study. Women with a physician's diagnosis of migraine had an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular mortality, over 20 years of follow-up after adjusting for traditional CVD risk factors, oral contraceptive pill use, hormonal replacement therapy, and NSAID use. A similar observation was seen in middle-aged women with signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease, where migraine was associated with an increased risk of major cardiac events driven by a twofold increase in the risk of stroke.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^116e4Jvx]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Migraine often remits during pregnancy, but if treatment is continued, the potential for harm to the fetus demands special consideration. Despite relatively poor efficacy, paracetamol should be used as the first-line medication for acute treatment of migraine in pregnancy. NSAIDs can be used only during the second trimester. Triptans should be used only under the strict supervision of a specialist, as the safety data available are limited and originate from post-marketing surveillance. Most data relate to the use of sumatriptan. For nausea associated with migraine in pregnancy, metoclopramide can be used.

Preventive migraine medications are best avoided during pregnancy owing to the potential for fetal harm. However, if preventive therapy is considered clinically indicated because of frequent and disabling migraine attacks, the best available safety data support the use of propranolol or, if propranolol is contraindicated, amitriptyline. Both should be used under specialist supervision to adequately monitor any potential fetal harm. Topiramate, candesartan, and sodium valproate are contraindicated; sodium valproate is known to be teratogenic and must not be used, and the use of topiramate and candesartan is associated with adverse effects on the fetus.

Migraine medication therapy in the postpartum period also requires caution because of potential risks to the infant. Paracetamol is the preferred acute medication, although ibuprofen and sumatriptan are also considered safe. If preventive medication is required, propranolol is the recommended choice.

### Use of combined hormonal contraceptives among women with migraines and risk of ischemic stroke [^114LjaY2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Migraine with aura and combined hormonal contraceptives are independently associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. However, little is known about whether there are any joint effects of migraine and hormonal contraceptives on the risk of stroke.

- **Objective**: We sought to estimate the incidence of stroke in women of reproductive age and examine the association among combined hormonal contraceptive use, migraine type (with or without aura), and ischemic stroke.

- **Study design**: This study used a nationwide health care claims database and employed a nested case-control study design. Females aged 15–49 years with first-ever stroke during 2006 through 2012 were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification inpatient services diagnosis codes. Four controls were matched to each case based on age. Migraine headache with and without aura was identified using inpatient or outpatient diagnosis codes. Combined hormonal contraceptive use was identified using the National Drug Code from the pharmacy database. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of ischemic stroke by migraine type and combined hormonal contraceptive use.

- **Results**: From 2006 through 2012, there were 25,887 ischemic strokes among females aged 15–49 years, for a cumulative incidence of 11 strokes/100,000 females. Compared to those with neither migraine nor combined hormonal contraceptive use, the odds ratio of ischemic stroke was highest among those with migraine with aura using combined hormonal contraceptives.

### Combined hormonal contraception use in reproductive-age women with contraindications to estrogen use [^113NeM76]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's US Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use recommends that combined hormonal contraceptives (e.g. birth control pills, contraceptive patch, vaginal ring) should be avoided in women with specific medical conditions because of the increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with estrogen use. Whether women with category 3 (theoretical or proven risk usually outweighs the advantages) or category 4 (unacceptable health risk) contraindications are appropriately avoiding estrogen-containing combined hormonal contraceptives is unknown.

- **Objective**: We describe the prevalence of combined hormonal contraceptive use among a sample of reproductive-age women with medical contraindications to estrogen use. Our hypothesis was that women with categories 3 and 4 contraindications would use estrogen-containing contraception less often than women without medical contraindications. We also explored whether inappropriate estrogen-containing contraceptive use is related to contraceptive provider characteristics.

- **Study design**: Data are from the baseline survey of the MyNewOptions study, which included privately insured women residing in Pennsylvania aged 18–40 years, who were sexually active and not intending pregnancy in the next year. Women were surveyed about their medical conditions, contraceptive use, and characteristics of their contraceptive provider. Women were considered to have a contraindication to combined hormonal contraceptives if they reported a category 3 or category 4 contraindication: hypertension, smo…

Regarding preventative measures for migraine, specifically in relation to migraine prophylaxis with anticonvulsants, SIGN 2023 guidelines recommend informing female patients of the following before initiating treatment with sodium valproate:

- **Risks associated with taking valproate during pregnancy**: Patients should be made aware of the potential risks to the fetus.

- **Risk of potentially harmful exposure**: There is a possibility of exposure to valproate before a woman is aware of her pregnancy.

- **Need for effective contraception**: Women should use reliable contraception during treatment with valproate.

- **Further advice during pregnancy**: Women should seek additional advice on migraine prophylaxis if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy.

### Assessment of erenumab safety and efficacy in patients with migraine with and without aura: A secondary analysis of randomized clinical trials [^112uBqMG]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

This post hoc secondary analysis of four randomized clinical trials found that erenumab reduced migraine frequency and average monthly migraine days in patients with and without a history of aura. The safety profile of long-term erenumab treatment was similar for patients with and without a history of aura and was comparable to that of placebo over 12 weeks, with no increased emergence of adverse events over time. These findings suggest that erenumab may be safe and effective for this patient population.

- **Bleeding irregularities**: Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use. Nonhormonal causes should be considered, and adequate diagnostic measures should be taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was preexistent.

- **Ectopic pregnancy**: Ectopic as well as intrauterine pregnancy may occur in contraceptive failures.

### Brain lesions and cerebral functional impairment in migraine patients [^114dZPAx]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

Migraine is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke, mainly in women with migraine with aura who are younger than 45 years, particularly those using estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. However, migraine should be considered a benign condition, as the absolute increase in stroke risk is small. It is also associated with a high prevalence of cerebral white matter hyperintensities, occurring in the deep and periventricular white matter as well as infratentorially, mainly pontine. The pathogenesis and clinical significance of these hyperintensities are unclear.

We do not know whether migraine may be considered a progressive disorder in a subset of patients due to the accumulation of these hyperintensities over time. Studies on the relationship between migraine and cognitive functioning have yielded conflicting results. Two recent studies have provided reassuring news for migraine patients. A population-based twin study showed that a lifetime migraine diagnosis was not associated with cognitive deficits in middle-aged subjects. Additionally, a long-term prospective study assessed cognitive and memory changes in aging individuals with and without a history of migraine and showed that migraineurs do not exhibit more decline on cognitive tests over time compared to controls. Migraine is certainly not a recognized risk factor for (vascular) dementia.

### Hormonal influences in migraine - interactions of oestrogen, oxytocin and CGRP [^115N6txp]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Migraine is ranked as the second highest cause of disability worldwide and the first among women aged 15–49 years. Overall, the incidence of migraine is threefold higher among women than men, though the frequency and severity of attacks vary during puberty, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, the postpartum period, and menopause. Reproductive hormones are clearly a key influence in the susceptibility of women to migraine. A fall in plasma oestrogen levels can trigger attacks of migraine without aura, whereas higher oestrogen levels seem to be protective. The basis of these effects is unknown.

In this review, we discuss what is known about sex hormones and their receptors in migraine-related areas in the central nervous system and the peripheral trigeminovascular pathway. We consider the actions of oestrogen via its multiple receptor subtypes and the involvement of oxytocin, which has been shown to prevent migraine attacks. We also discuss possible interactions of these hormones with the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) system in light of the success of anti-CGRP treatments. We propose a simple model to explain the hormone withdrawal trigger in menstrual migraine, which could provide a foundation for improved management and therapy for hormone-related migraine in women.

### Contraindications to IUD and IUS use [^111n3moG]. Contraception (2007). Low credibility.

Contraindications to IUD or IUS use can be found on product labeling, in the guidelines of various specialty groups, and in recommendations from peer-reviewed articles. Overly restrictive contraindications block access to this top-tier method for many women who would be candidates based on scientific evidence. Assuming that a condition should be listed as a contraindication only if the risk of IUD/IUS use by a woman with that condition exceeds her risk with pregnancy, the list of contraindications is reduced to pregnancy, active uterine infection, malignancy in the uterus or cervix, an inability to place or retain the device, unexplained abnormal bleeding, and adverse reaction to product ingredients.

Adverse reactions are comprehensively outlined, considering that clinical trials occur under varied conditions. This variability may result in adverse reaction rates that do not directly compare to those from other studies and may differ from those observed in practice.

For women taking MPA tablets without concomitant estrogen treatment, the following adverse reactions have been reported:

- **Genitourinary system**: Abnormal uterine bleeding (irregular, increase, decrease), changes in menstrual flow, breakthrough bleeding, spotting, amenorrhea, changes in cervical erosion, and cervical secretions.

- **Breasts**: Breast tenderness, mastodynia, or galactorrhea have been reported.

- **Cardiovascular**: Thromboembolic disorders, including thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism, have been observed.

- **Gastrointestinal**: Nausea and cholestatic jaundice have been experienced.

- **Skin**: Sensitivity reactions, such as urticaria, pruritus, edema, and generalized rash, have occurred. Instances of acne, alopecia, and hirsutism have been reported.

- **Eyes**: Neuro-ocular lesions, for example, retinal thrombosis and optic neuritis, have been noted.

- **Central nervous system**: Mental depression, insomnia, somnolence, dizziness, headache, and nervousness have been recorded.

- **Miscellaneous**: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, rash (allergic) with and without pruritus, and changes in weight (increase or decrease), pyrexia, edema/fluid retention, fatigue, and decreased glucose tolerance have also been reported.

### Oestrogen and attacks of migraine with and without aura [^111nfDH9]. The Lancet Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

During women's reproductive years, migraine is three times more common than in men of a similar age. Although this female preponderance is commonly assumed to be associated with the additional trigger of fluctuating sex hormones of the menstrual cycle, few studies have been done to confirm or refute this. This review is confined to the relation between oestrogen and attacks of migraine. The evidence for an association between oestrogen "withdrawal" and attacks of migraine without aura is presented, as well as evidence for an association between high oestrogen states and attacks of migraine with aura. Only clinical data are presented here.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^116XHMJM]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

- **Stratification**:

	- **Recommendations**:
		1. There is usually no need for stratification in acute treatment trials.

		2. Stratification may be considered when an imbalance between the treatment groups or an important factor may influence the results of a trial.

	- **Comments**:

		Randomization alone may not ensure full comparability between subjects in different treatment groups, especially in smaller trials, and stratified randomization is sometimes used to circumvent potential imbalances. The EMA recommends that stratification variables usually be included as covariates in primary analyses, regardless of their prognostic value. In controlled trials for migraine, the use of stratification by prognostic factors should be limited to a few variables and only to those that have historically demonstrated effects on primary efficacy endpoint(s). Stratification variables that have been used in acute treatment trials include age, body weight, headache intensity at baseline, migraine type (i.e. with or without aura), menstrual versus non-menstrual attacks, and concomitant preventive treatment. Given the preponderance of females with migraine, sex may also be used as a stratification factor to control for imbalances in treatment groups.

- **Intention to treat**:

	- **Recommendations**:
		1. Randomized controlled trials of acute treatments for migraine should follow the principle of intention to treat (ITT), which implies that analyses should include all randomized subjects in the groups to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of treatment received.

### Assessment of erenumab safety and efficacy in patients with migraine with and without aura: A secondary analysis of randomized clinical trials [^1176Prwa]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Migraine with aura may respond differently to therapies than migraine without aura. Individuals with migraine with aura have an elevated vascular risk, necessitating a safety assessment of migraine preventive treatments in this patient subgroup.

The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety profiles of erenumab in patients with migraine with aura.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This post hoc secondary analysis evaluated 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials conducted in treatment centers in North America, Europe, Russia, and Turkey between August 6, 2013, and November 12, 2019. Participants were adults aged 18 to 65 years with episodic migraine or chronic migraine, randomized to receive either erenumab or placebo.

- **Interventions**: One or more doses of erenumab (70 mg or 140 mg once per month) or placebo were administered by subcutaneous injection in the double-blind treatment phase. In the open-label or dose-blinded active treatment phase, erenumab, 70 mg or 140 mg, was administered once per month by subcutaneous injection during extension phases.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Efficacy assessments included change from baseline monthly migraine days (MMDs) and monthly acute migraine-specific medication (AMSM) days. Safety end points included patient incidences of adverse events. Subgroups of patients were categorized according to their history of aura.

Results indicated that of the 2682 patients randomized in the 4 trials, 1400 (52.2%) received 1 or more doses of erenumab, 70 mg or 140 mg, and 1043 (38.9%) received placebo.

### Cumulative exposure to estrogen may increase the risk of migraine in women [^111CZhoG]. Cephalalgia (2024). High credibility.

Migraine is a common disorder, particularly affecting women during their reproductive years. This female preponderance has been linked to exposure to female sex hormones.

- **Methods**: We used self-reported data from women born in 1943–1965, enrolled in the Norwegian Women and Cancer Study, to examine the differences between women with migraine and women without migraine. This study used a prospective design concerning both endogenous and exogenous female sex hormone exposure.

- **Results**: In total, 62,959 women were included in the study, of whom 24.8% reported previous migraine (n = 15,635). Using a Cox proportional hazards model, we found that higher age at menarche reduced the risk of migraine (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95–0.98) and that oral contraceptive use and parity increased the risk of migraine (HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.06–1.18 and HR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.29–1.46, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: Older age at menarche appears to reduce migraine risk, whereas oral contraceptive use and having children appear to increase the risk. Further research is required to investigate the causality of these associations.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^1165UkGN]. Cephalalgia (2019). High credibility.

- **Menstrual migraine**: In menstruating females, the peak incidence of migraine occurs in the interval beginning 2 days before and extending through the first few days of menstruation. The Appendix of ICHD-3 provides criteria for pure menstrual migraine and menstrually-related migraine. For both disorders, attacks occur on days −2 to +3 of menstruation in at least two out of three menstrual cycles. For pure menstrual migraine, attacks occur at no other time of the month, while in menstrually-related migraine, attacks may occur at other times. Pure menstrual migraine is less common than menstrually-related migraine; in one study, only 7% of females had pure menstrual migraine while 34.5% had menstrually-related migraine.

Migraine attacks occurring in association with menstruation are generally noted to be severe, of long duration, and associated with higher relapse rates. Acute treatment trials might therefore investigate the efficacy of a new therapy by comparing its rate of relapse with those of standard treatments in subjects with menstrually-related migraine, pure menstrual migraine, or both conditions. If the effect of an acute treatment on pure menstrual migraine is to be investigated, accurate diagnosis is essential. It is recommended that subjects record migraine attacks and menstrual periods prospectively in a headache diary for two to three cycles before entering the trial and that investigators apply the strict definition provided above to distinguish them from subjects with menstrually-related migraine. Three months of prospective diary information may be needed.

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and self-reported aura: Post hoc analysis of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 [^1138K8G4]. Cephalalgia (2022). High credibility.

Migraine with aura is a distinct diagnosis characterized by the presence of one or more fully reversible focal neurologic symptoms, which are usually followed by headache and associated migraine symptoms. Most patients with migraine with aura report visual disturbances, such as visual scintillations and scotoma, that spread gradually over ≥ 5 minutes, last 5‒60 minutes, and precede headache onset within 60 minutes. Migraine with aura reportedly comprises approximately one-third of all migraine diagnoses and has been associated with increased risk of cerebro- and cardiovascular disease.

Eptinezumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody specific for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and is indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. In the pivotal PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 trials, eptinezumab 100 mg and 300 mg, the approved dose levels, met the primary efficacy endpoint; that is, they statistically significantly reduced mean monthly migraine days (MMDs) over Weeks 1–12 in patients with migraine, with sustained efficacy occurring as early as Day 1 after infusion. Given the high prevalence of migraine with aura, the associated medical risks, and the scarcity of published data specific to this population, we conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis of pooled data from the PROMISE trials to assess the efficacy and safety of eptinezumab for the preventive treatment of migraine in patients who self-reported a history of aura.
