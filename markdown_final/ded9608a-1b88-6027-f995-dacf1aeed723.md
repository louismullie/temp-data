## Question

Treatment of porphyria cutanea tarda

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of porphyria cutanea tarda. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should identify and address modifiable susceptibility factors. Next, I will compare first-line therapies, namely phlebotomy versus low-dose hydroxychloroquine, including efficacy, safety, and relapse. After that, I should consider special populations and alternatives like iron chelation or antiviral therapy. Finally, I will outline monitoring, relapse prevention, and a practical decision framework, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to treatment before excluding mimics. PCT presents with photosensitive skin fragility, bullae, erosions, milia, and hypertrichosis on sun-exposed sites, and the biochemical hallmark is elevated urinary uroporphyrin with a characteristic pattern; I should verify this with a 24-hour urine porphyrin profile and consider plasma porphyrins if needed, while remembering that pseudoporphyria lacks porphyrin elevation and requires different management, so I need to ensure porphyrins are truly elevated before labeling PCT [^236577f9] [^1f91e2da].

> Next, I should review susceptibility factors because removing them is foundational to durable remission. Alcohol, smoking, hepatitis C virus, HIV, estrogens, and iron overload are key drivers; I need to check for HFE mutations given their frequency in PCT and the implications for family screening, and I should screen for HCV and HIV in all patients, as well as assess iron indices and liver disease given the elevated risk of fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in PCT cohorts [^236577f9] [^852f69d3] [^9cceadf5] [^4acbd356].

> Hold on, let's not conflate PCT with acute porphyrias; I initially thought to counsel on avoiding porphyrinogenic drugs broadly, but wait, that applies to acute hepatic porphyrias, not PCT, so I should correct that and focus PCT counseling on alcohol, smoking, and estrogen modulation rather than a blanket drug list meant for AIP or VP, even though some labels still carry warnings that reflect older, conservative language [^501b71bd] [^0277a41f].

> Now, I will examine first-line therapy. Phlebotomy remains the most established and durable approach, typically 450 mL every 2 weeks until ferritin falls to about 20 ng/mL, with remission in roughly 6–12 months; I should confirm that patients can tolerate volume removal and adjust cadence if anemia emerges, and I need to remember that phlebotomy is endorsed in hemochromatosis guidelines for PCT even when other liver diseases coexist, which supports its primacy when iron overload is present [^236577f9] [^4935e334].

> Let me consider the alternative, low-dose hydroxychloroquine. The prospective pilot showed 100 mg twice weekly achieved remission in a median of about 6 months, comparable to phlebotomy, with better adherence and lower cost, but I should double-check relapse data; indeed, meta-analytic follow-up suggests higher relapse after antimalarials than after phlebotomy, so durability remains a concern despite initial equivalence in time to remission [^14f96f80] [^51125b13].

> But wait, what about safety signals for hydroxychloroquine in PCT. Multiple FDA labels warn of hepatotoxicity in PCT, with marked transaminase elevations reported days to a month after initiation; I need to ensure baseline and early liver tests are obtained and stop the drug if ALT exceeds 3 times the upper limit of normal or bilirubin exceeds 2 times the upper limit, and I should also remember that labels state the safety and effectiveness for PCT are not established, so off-label use requires informed consent and close monitoring [^c793f9fd] [^ff289ea6] [^7628414f].

> I should confirm special populations and alternatives. In patients with contraindications to repeated phlebotomy or in whom venesection is impractical, oral iron chelation with deferasirox has pilot-level evidence showing clinical and biochemical improvement over 6 months, though larger trials are needed; similarly, in HCV-associated PCT, curing HCV with direct-acting antivirals can lead to resolution of skin disease, so I need to coordinate antiviral therapy when HCV is present and monitor for extrahepatic improvement thereafter [^444ea3cc] [^c1180897].

> Let me think about estrogen-related PCT, which is increasingly recognized in transgender women on gender-affirming hormone therapy. Temporary dose reduction or route change can induce remission, and I should engage in shared decision-making given the psychological stakes; case reports show remission with holding or lowering estradiol and switching to transdermal routes, with successful reintroduction after control, so I need to tailor hormone regimens while addressing other risks like alcohol and smoking [^639049ca] [^1c7bec5a] [^90c1c43d].

> Next, I should review monitoring and relapse prevention. During active therapy, I will track ferritin and CBC for phlebotomy, or liver enzymes and porphyrins for hydroxychloroquine, and after remission I should monitor urinary porphyrins and iron studies annually because relapse is common, especially after antimalarial-induced remissions; I also need to maintain vigilance for liver disease and HCC with periodic liver imaging in those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, aligning with oncologic risk guidance for PCT-associated HCC risk [^236577f9] [^4acbd356].

> I will now examine supportive care that meaningfully improves symptoms while definitive therapy takes effect. Strict photoprotection with clothing and broad-spectrum mineral sunscreens reduces new lesions, and I should counsel on trauma minimization and gentle skin care; importantly, patients often report pruritus and nocturnal scratching that delay healing, so I need to ask about sleep disruption and consider strategies to mitigate itch and mechanical injury during the treatment phase [^236577f9] [^4da4aa46].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and sanity-check it against the evidence. If iron overload is significant or HFE hemochromatosis is present, I favor phlebotomy given superior durability; if iron is normal and patient preference leans away from venesection, low-dose hydroxychloroquine is reasonable with explicit hepatotoxicity counseling and close labs; if neither is suitable, deferasirox is a consideration off-label; and if HCV is present, prioritize DAA therapy and reassess skin disease after sustained virologic response, all while removing alcohol, tobacco, and modifiable estrogens whenever feasible [^236577f9] [^14f96f80] [^444ea3cc] [^c1180897].

> Finally, I should confirm long-term follow-up elements. Annual urinary porphyrins, ferritin, and liver enzymes are prudent, with liver ultrasound every 6–12 months in those with cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis; I should also revisit family screening for HFE mutations in appropriate relatives and reinforce lifestyle modification to sustain remission, aligning with hepatology and dermatology best practices for this chronic, relapsing hepatocutaneous disease [^236577f9] [^4acbd356] [^9cceadf5].

---

The cornerstone of PCT management is **iron reduction** [^a250bdf7] via therapeutic phlebotomy [^236577f9] (typically 450 mL every 2 weeks until ferritin ≤ 50 ng/mL) or low-dose hydroxychloroquine [^14f96f80] (100 mg twice weekly) [^236577f9], both effective and safe [^14f96f80]. Phlebotomy is preferred in patients with iron overload or HCV, while hydroxychloroquine is an alternative when phlebotomy is contraindicated or impractical [^notfound]. Address **modifiable triggers** (alcohol, estrogens, HCV) [^a72d2df7] and monitor liver disease, as PCT increases HCC risk [^4acbd356]. Relapse is more common after hydroxychloroquine than phlebotomy, so ongoing surveillance is essential [^51125b13].

---

## Pathophysiology and clinical features

PCT results from **reduced hepatic UROD activity** [^a250bdf7], causing uroporphyrin accumulation and photosensitivity [^236577f9]. Clinical features include fragile skin, bullae, erosions, milia, hypertrichosis, and scarring on sun-exposed areas, often with hepatic iron overload and liver disease [^a250bdf7].

---

## General principles of management

Management focuses on **reducing hepatic iron** [^a250bdf7], removing triggers, and monitoring for complications [^236577f9]. Both phlebotomy and low-dose hydroxychloroquine are effective first-line options [^14f96f80].

---

## Therapeutic phlebotomy

### Mechanism of action

Phlebotomy reduces hepatic iron, thereby restoring UROD activity and lowering porphyrins [^a250bdf7].

---

### Clinical evidence and efficacy

Phlebotomy achieves remission in 6–12 months [^236577f9] and is durable; relapse is lower than with antimalarials [^51125b13].

---

### Practical considerations

- **Frequency**: 450 mL every 2 weeks until ferritin ≤ 50 ng/mL.
- **Monitoring**: CBC, ferritin, and liver function tests.
- **Contraindications**: Severe anemia, cardiovascular instability, or patient refusal.

---

## Low-dose hydroxychloroquine

### Mechanism of action

Hydroxychloroquine increases porphyrin excretion by forming water-soluble complexes, reducing hepatic porphyrin burden [^notfound].

---

### Clinical evidence and efficacy

Low-dose regimens (100 mg twice weekly) achieve remission in 6–12 months [^14f96f80] and are noninferior to phlebotomy in some studies, though relapse may be higher [^51125b13].

---

### Safety considerations

Hydroxychloroquine is generally safe at low doses, but **hepatotoxicity** can occur; monitor liver enzymes and discontinue if ALT > 3× ULN or bilirubin > 2× ULN [^c793f9fd]. Retinal toxicity is rare at low doses but warrants periodic ophthalmologic exams [^06e54a21].

---

## Comparison of phlebotomy and hydroxychloroquine

| **Parameter** | **Phlebotomy** | **Hydroxychloroquine** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Iron reduction | Porphyrin excretion |
| Efficacy | High; durable remission | High; higher relapse |
| Safety | Excellent; minimal adverse effects | Generally safe; hepatotoxicity risk |
| Practicality | Requires venous access; may cause anemia | Oral; convenient; no anemia |
| Relapse rate | Lower | Higher |

---

## Adjunctive and alternative therapies

- **Deferasirox**: Oral iron chelation for patients intolerant to phlebotomy or with iron overload; limited data [^444ea3cc].
- **Antiviral therapy**: Treat HCV with DAAs; improves PCT in coinfected patients [^c1180897].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Alcohol abstinence, smoking cessation, and estrogen adjustment reduce relapse risk [^236577f9].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Initial phase**: Monitor CBC, ferritin, liver enzymes, and urinary porphyrins every 2–3 months.
- **Maintenance**: Annual monitoring of porphyrins, iron indices, and liver function; ultrasound for HCC in cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis [^236577f9].
- **Long-term**: Lifelong surveillance for relapse and complications, especially HCC [^4acbd356].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

- **Iron overload**: Prefer phlebotomy [^a250bdf7].
- **Contraindications to phlebotomy**: Consider hydroxychloroquine [^14f96f80].
- **HCV coinfection**: Prioritize antiviral therapy [^c1180897].
- **Patient preference**: Shared decision-making is essential [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Phlebotomy and low-dose hydroxychloroquine are both effective first-line therapies for PCT [^14f96f80]; phlebotomy offers more durable remission, while hydroxychloroquine provides a convenient oral alternative [^51125b13]. Address modifiable triggers and monitor liver disease to reduce relapse and complications [^a72d2df7].

### Ledipasvir-sofosbuvir for porphyria cutanea tarda in patients with hepatitis C… [^c1180897]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Report of Case Previous HCV treatments, such as interferon, have shown mixed responses in the resolution of PCT. 3 One case report demonstrated the resolution of PCT after HCV treatment with the direct-acting antiviral agent boceprevir. 5 Boceprevir, however, still requires interferon therapy in the treatment regimen, which may have contributed to PCT resolution. We describe 3 men with HCV who had resolution of their PCT manifestations months after completing an 8- or 12-week combination regimen of ledipasvir, 90 mg and sofosbuvir, 400 mg. A, Bullae and erosions of porphyria cutanea tarda are seen in a patient with hepatitis C before treatment. B, Five months after completing an 8-week regimen of combination therapy with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, the lesions are cleared. Discussion A literature search revealed 1 case report of successful PCT clearance following treatment with another DAA agent, boceprevir.

5 This suggests that the marked improvement in PCT is likely related to the cure of HCV that can be achieved by DAA agents in general and not necessarily only ledipasvir-sofosbuvir combination therapy. The improvement of PCT following DAA treatment further suggests that viral activity is directly linked with disease severity and may provide important insight into therapeutics for HCV-associated PCT. The development of DAA agents heralds a new direction for infectious diseases and hepatology in the fight against hepatitis C. Our case series highlights the potential secondary benefits in improving cutaneous skin diseases of hepatitis C with DAA agents. Further investigations are needed to corroborate our findings regarding PCT resolution in patients with HCV following DAA treatment. Hepatitis C also has known associations with other extrahepatic manifestations such as mixed cryoglobulinemia and lichen planus, which require further investigation.

### The management of porphyria cutanea tarda [^7c857bcd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), the commonest of all porphyrias, is usually characterized by blisters and fragility of skin in light-exposed areas. It can be clinically indistinguishable from other disorders including variegate porphyria and the diagnosis can only be made by rigorous biochemical analysis. PCT does not cause acute attacks of porphyria. It is usually an acquired condition caused by inhibition of the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase enzyme in the liver. Hereditary haemochromatosis, hepatitis C virus infection, alcohol, oestrogens and a family history of PCT are the major risk factors for the condition and should be searched for specifically in all patients. Liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma, is common in patients with PCT, and should be investigated for at presentation by means of a liver biopsy where possible. Patients with severe hepatic pathology or longstanding untreated PCT need to be monitored for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in the long term. Low dose twice weekly chloroquine is the mainstay of treatment, but venesection should be used in patients with severe iron overload or hepatitis C-related liver disease. Subsequently, long-term follow-up is needed in all patients to monitor for relapse.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda: recent update [^236577f9]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common human porphyria, due to hepatic deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), which is acquired in the presence of iron overload and various susceptibility factors, such as alcohol abuse, smoking, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, HIV infection, iron overload with HFE gene mutations, use of estrogens, and UROD mutation. Patients with familial or type II PCT due to autosomal dominant UROD mutation also require other susceptibility factors, as the disease phenotype requires hepatic UROD deficiency to below 20% of normal. PCT clinically manifests with increased skin fragility and blistering skin lesions on sun exposed areas. The common age of presentation is 5th to 6th decade and occurs slightly more commonly in males. Although mild liver biochemical profile are common, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can occasionally develop. Screening for HCC using ultrasound examination is recommended in PCT patients, especially with cirrhosis and advanced fibrosis. PCT is effectively and readily treatable with the use of either repeated phlebotomy or use of 100 mg hydroxychloroquine orally twice a week, and both the treatments are equally effective and safe. With the advent of new or direct antiviral agents for HCV infection, treatment of concomitant HCV has become safer and effective. Data are emerging on the benefit of these drugs as monotherapy for both PCT and HCV. After the achievement of remission of PCT, there remains a potential for relapse, especially when the susceptibility factors are not adequately controlled. Scanty data from retrospective and observational studies shows the relapse rate to be somewhat higher after remission with low-dose hydroxychloroquine as compared to phlebotomy induced remission. Future studies are needed on exploring mechanism of action of 4-aminoquinolines, understanding interaction of HCV and PCT, and relapse of PCT on long-term follow-up.

### The porphyrias: advances in diagnosis and treatment [^cdfceb8e]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

The inborn errors of heme biosynthesis, the porphyrias, are 8 genetically distinct metabolic disorders that can be classified as "acute hepatic", "hepatic cutaneous", and "erythropoietic cutaneous" diseases. Recent advances in understanding their pathogenesis and molecular genetic heterogeneity have led to improved diagnosis and treatment. These advances include DNA-based diagnoses for all the porphyrias, new understanding of the pathogenesis of the acute hepatic porphyrias, identification of the iron overload-induced inhibitor of hepatic uroporphyrin decarboxylase activity that causes the most common porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, the identification of an X-linked form of erythropoietic protoporphyria due to gain-of-function mutations in erythroid-specific 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS2), and new and experimental treatments for the erythropoietic prophyrias. Knowledge of these advances is relevant for hematologists because they administer the hematin infusions to treat the acute attacks in patients with the acute hepatic porphyrias, perform the chronic phlebotomies to reduce the iron overload and clear the dermatologic lesions in porphyria cutanea tarda, and diagnose and treat the erythropoietic porphyrias, including chronic erythrocyte transfusions, bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplants, and experimental pharmacologic chaperone and stem cell gene therapies for congenital erythropoietic protoporphyria. These developments are reviewed to update hematologists on the latest advances in these diverse disorders.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda: a unique iron-related disorder [^a250bdf7]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

The porphyrias are a group of disorders of heme biosynthesis, each characterized by an enzymatic defect in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) arises due to the inhibition of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) in the presence of hepatic iron and oxidative stress. Most patients with PCT have evidence of siderosis on liver biopsy, and the disease resolves with iron depletion. PCT manifests as skin fragility, blistering cutaneous lesions on sun-exposed areas, dark urine, and elevated plasma and urine porphyrins. Factors contributing to the development of PCT include alcohol use, hepatitis C virus infection, human immunodeficiency virus, estrogen use, UROD pathogenic variants, and hereditary hemochromatosis. Treatment includes therapeutic phlebotomy to decrease total body iron levels and low-dose hydroxychloroquine, which reduces hepatic porphyrin content. The following review explores the biology of PCT, the critical role of iron in disease pathogenesis, and our approach to the management of these patients.

### Low-dose hydroxychloroquine is as effective as phlebotomy in treatment of patients with porphyria cutanea tarda [^14f96f80]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is an iron-related disorder caused by reduced activity of hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase; it can be treated by phlebotomy or low doses of hydroxychloroquine. We performed a prospective pilot study to compare the efficacy and safety of these therapies.

Methods

We analyzed data from 48 consecutive patients with well-documented PCT to characterize susceptibility factors; patients were treated with phlebotomy (450 mL, every 2 weeks until they had serum ferritin levels of 20 ng/mL) or low-dose hydroxychloroquine (100 mg orally, twice weekly, until at least 1 month after they had normal plasma levels of porphyrin). We compared the time required to achieve a normal plasma porphyrin concentration (remission, the primary outcome) for 17 patients treated with phlebotomy and 13 treated with hydroxychloroquine.

Results

The time to remission was a median 6.9 months for patients who received phlebotomy and 6.1 months for patients treated with hydroxychloroquine treatment (6.7 and 6.5 mo for randomized patients), a difference that was not significant (log-rank, P = 0.06 and P = 0.95, respectively). The sample size was insufficient to confirm noninferiority of hydroxychloroquine treatment (hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.95–5.06) for all patients. Patients who received hydroxychloroquine had substantially better compliance. There were no significant side effects of either treatment.

Conclusions

Hydroxychloroquine, 100 mg twice weekly, is as effective and safe as phlebotomy in patients with PCT, although noninferiority was not established. Given these results, higher-dose regimens of hydroxychloroquine, which have more side effects, do not seem justified. Compliance was better and projected costs were lower for hydroxychloroquine than phlebotomy treatment. Long-term studies are needed to compare durability of response. ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01573754.

### Relapse of porphyria cutanea tarda after treatment with phlebotomy or 4-aminoquinoline antimalarials: a meta-analysis [^51125b13]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common human porphyria. It is caused by hepatic deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity, which is acquired in the presence of multiple susceptibility factors. PCT presents clinically with cutaneous blistering photosensitivity and is readily treatable with either repeated phlebotomy or 4-aminoquinoline antimalarials.

Objectives

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of these quite different treatment approaches, especially on relapse rates (RRs) after achieving remission.

Methods

Published studies that included follow-up for at least 1 year after treatment of PCT were included. The primary study outcome was PCT relapse. Pooled data are reported as the RRs per person-year of follow-up with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Of 375 articles identified as pertaining to PCT treatment, 12 were eligible for analysis. Of these, five used high-dose 4-aminoquinoline regimens (two combined with phlebotomy and three without phlebotomy), five used low-dose 4-aminoquinoline regimens and three used phlebotomy. RRs during the year after treatment were similar for the high- and low-dose 4-aminoquinoline groups (35–36%) and lower in the phlebotomy group (20%). The pooled RRs with their 95% CIs were 8·6 (3·9–13·3) per 100 person-years in the high-dose 4-aminoquinoline group, 17·1 (8·9–25·3) per 100 person-years in the low-dose 4-aminoquinoline group and 5·1 (0·5–10·6) per 100 person-years in the phlebotomy group. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar results.

Conclusions

Clinical or biochemical RRs ranged from 5 to 17 per 100 person-years after remission of PCT. Relapses were somewhat more frequent after remission with 4-aminoquinoline regimens than after remission following phlebotomy. Prospective studies are needed to define better how often relapses occur with these treatments after documenting both clinical and biochemical remission of PCT.

### Severe radiation therapy-related soft tissue toxicity in a patient with porphyria cutanea tarda: a literature review [^f25ebb7a]. Head & Neck (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Some porphyrias are associated with cutaneous phototoxicity due to photoactivation of porphyrins, but whether ionizing radiation can have an additive effect is not clear. We report a case of severe radiation therapy-related toxicity in a patient with porphyria cutanea tarda and review the literature.

Methods

A 50-year-old man with porphyria cutanea was treated for lower lip squamous cell carcinoma with definitive radiation therapy. During radiation therapy, acute toxicity was of an expected onset and severity. Six months after treatment completion, he developed skin hypopigmentation, soft tissue fibrosis, and areas of painful denuded skin and crusting within the previous treatment field.

Results

Reports of 7 patients with porphyria receiving radiation therapy to at least 9 separate sites were reviewed, with only 1 previous report suggestive of increased radiation therapy-related toxicity.

Conclusion

Based on this and 1 other report, caution is warranted when considering radiation therapy in patients with active porphyria.

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^c1aa9b1a]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is characterized by fragile skin with blistering on sun-exposed areas. Symptoms typically develop in late adulthood and can be triggered by iron overload, alcohol intake, oestrogens and various liver diseases. Treatment consists of phlebotomy to reduce iron, or increasing urinary porphyrin excretion by administering chlorochin. To optimize patient care, health personnel need to understand the subjective experiences of PCT.

Objectives

To explore the experiences of persons with PCT with regard to symptoms, treatment, follow-up and prevention of the disease.

Methods

Interpretive description was used as a qualitative approach. Twenty-one participants attended three focus groups. All participants had experienced PCT symptoms during the last 5 years.

Results

Participants' experiences varied from trivializing symptoms and fragile skin to what was described as a desperate situation, with huge blisters, skin falling off and feeling as if one was in a 'horror movie'. For some, itching was very troublesome, preventing sleep and delaying skin healing. In managing PCT a shift in focus from skin to blood was described. PCT was perceived as a chronic and systemic disease causing a range of health problems. Strategies for preventing symptoms ranged from doing nothing to frequent controls and check-ups.

Conclusions

Participants had a systemic perception of PCT, and a tendency to attribute a range of health problems to the condition. This study adds insight into the experiences patients have with PCT.

### How I treat erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria [^3e6057d4]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The porphyrias are a diverse group of metabolic disorders, each characterized by alterations in 1 of the 8 enzymatic steps in heme biosynthesis (Figure 1). Porphyrias can be classified as hepatic or erythropoietic, reflecting whether porphyrin precursors or porphyrins accumulate initially in the liver or bone marrow. A clinical classification of acute, blistering cutaneous, and nonblistering cutaneous is also useful because it is based on 3 very distinct presentations that should prompt different first-line diagnostic testing. The 3 most common porphyrias, acute intermittent porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, and erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) are examples of these 3 clinical categories. This How I Treat article focuses on the 2 nonblistering cutaneous porphyrias, EPP and X-linked protoporphyria (XLP), collectively called protoporphyria.

Figure 1.
The heme biosynthetic pathway. Heme biosynthesis occurs by 8 sequential enzymatic steps. Decreased activity of ferrochelatase, the final enzyme in the pathway, leads to EPP. XLP is caused by gain-of-function mutations in ALAS2, the enzyme that catalyzes the initial step in this pathway within the erythroblast.

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^2d547f19]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Theme 2: a skin disease, a blood disease or something in between?

A shift in focus from skin to blood

After their diagnosis was established, participants described a shift in focus. One participant explained that she was surprised when she understood that PCT was not a simple skin disease. At first, PCT presented as skin symptoms, and diagnosis was based on patients seeking medical care for this. However, after diagnosis was established, the focus shifted from the skin to the blood. The use of phlebotomy as a treatment for PCT emphasized this. Blood samples, blood values and phlebotomy introduced a technical aspect, and many participants displayed a keen interest. They brought copies of their blood work to the focus groups and compared and discussed who had the highest ferritin levels and at what level they preferred to undergo prophylactic phlebotomy. Nora said:

Yes, and it's like I can feel something crawling in my skin. And after I learned about this, I just feel the porphyrins flying around.

Suspecting porphyria cutanea tarda caused more health problems than skin symptoms

Many participants suspected PCT caused health problems that were not limited to the skin. They felt that porphyrins were in their blood, and that genes and enzymes were involved, which made them comment that things in the body were connected. A variety of symptoms caused by PCT were proposed and the participants showed a growing need to find legitimate reasons for other health complaints. Maria explained:

Perhaps it is a bit more complicated than what is believed? That there are actually more symptoms? That more things are connected to it? Because this is something that happens inside the body; that's what I think, that there might be.

Their suspicion was explained by the fact that the symptom in question arose at the same time as their skin symptoms appeared, and that other explanations had not been detected. Participants learned that they had similar health problems after speaking with other patients, which confirmed their suspicions. Fatigue was explicitly discussed as being related to PCT, but known acute porphyria symptoms, such as stomach pains and muscle aches, were also attributed to PCT, both by participants and sometimes by local health personnel. Participants questioned why these symptoms were not recognized by medical experts as being related to PCT and pointed to the need for further research. However, the focus on what could be attributed to PCT was so evident in the groups that some participants commented that surely not everything could be caused by the disease.

### Hydroxychloroquine treatment of porphyria cutanea tarda… [^6db8bb0e]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Six patients with skin changes and urinary porphyrin excretion patterns characteristic for porphyria cutanea tarda were treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate therapy. During treatment periods ranging from five to 13 months, cutaneous symptoms disappeared and urinary porphyrin excretion abnormalities were completely or almost completely reversed. In three subjects, hydroxychloroquine therapy was accompanied by changes in the urinary excretion of iron. The first four patients, followed up for nine to 24 months after treatment, all had relapse, and substantial porphyrinuria developed once more; cutaneous symptoms recurred in two of these. Three of the four patients were re-treated, and their conditions again improved or went into remission with hydroxychloroquine therapy.

In two patients, treatment responses were slower than those initially seen, despite the use of higher drug doses; in the third patient, the response to re-treatment was more rapid than that seen during the first treatment course.

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^c4fb0ed3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

PCT is generally defined as a skin disease but, aetiologically, it is also a hepatic and metabolic disorder. Because the symptoms are of a cutaneous nature, one would expect that the patients experienced PCT as a skin condition. However, participants in this study described a shift in focus from skin to blood and began to perceive PCT as a chronic and systemic disease. The tendency to attribute health problems to PCT was striking. We are all 'naïve psychologists' seeking to explain why events occur and to attribute causal explanations. According to the common sense model (CSM) of illness, there are five components of illness representations that help people make sense of their symptoms: the identity or the label given to the condition; the perceived cause of the condition; the predictive understanding of how long the condition will last; the individual's beliefs about the consequences of the condition; and whether the condition can be cured or controlled. In this case, the identity of the condition is 'porphyria'. Porphyrias are a group of diseases, and separating PCT from other porphyrias can be difficult for both patients and healthcare providers. Patients with PCT may perceive the disease as being chronic and systemic because porphyrins, enzymes, blood and genes are involved, and treatment consists of bloodletting. This perception can, in turn, explain why participants in this study attributed a number of their health problems to PCT. The CSM uses the perception of the condition to guide which further actions are taken. Lilly stated that medical experts do not fully understand the possible long-term complications that this patient group might expect, and therefore phlebotomies cannot be an 'easy fix' if symptoms arise. As Lilly commented, 'if it's just a rash that can be treated with draining blood, well, then we can just do whatever we want to, can't we?' The genetic component of PCT also seemed intriguing to the participants. A worry that a PCT mutation might prevent anyone from having children, as was the case in the family of one participant, emphasizes that the perceived cause of the condition and the understanding of its consequences should not be underestimated. When addressing the issue of symptoms, consequences and controllability of PCT in clinical consultation, it is therefore important to recognize that the patient's illness representation can influence perception of risk and how they express and act upon this information.

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^8a0bdae9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Some participants with PCT mentioned itching to be a troublesome symptom. Although pruritus is not well documented in PCT, it has been reported previously. Itching is common in many skin conditions and is likely to delay skin healing, and is associated with reduced QoL, depression and sleep disturbances.–Consequently, this unsuspected finding warrants further investigation. To obtain more information on this topic, the Norwegian Porphyria Registry has introduced this as a variable in the questionnaire sent to patients.

Based on the experiences of the participants in this study, venesection was an acceptable first choice in treatment; however, some problematic aspects were introduced and, as low-dose chloroquine is widely used, this might be preferable for some patients. Our findings suggest that too vigilant a strategy in the prevention of symptoms might lead to medicalization rather than benefitting the patient. To the best of our knowledge, there seems to be a lack of data regarding biochemical and clinical relapse frequency. However, an annual assessment of urinary porphyrin concentration and iron metabolism is suggested in the detection of relapses. Although PCT has been associated with changes in glucose metabolism, and an increased risk of liver cancer, the mechanisms are unclear and do not warrant the frequent check-ups (every 2 weeks or every month) reported by some participants.–

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^3d820d47]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a rare disease characterized by fragile skin and blistering on sun-exposed areas. Increased urinary porphyrin excretion causes red- or dark-coloured urine. Symptoms typically develop in late adulthood and can be triggered by hepatic iron overload, alcohol intake, oestrogens, hepatitis C and various liver stressors, in combination with exposure to light. The prevalence of symptomatic disease is estimated to be 1 in 10 000. The condition exists in both a familial and sporadic subtype. Compared with 25% of cases worldwide, about 50% of cases of PCT in Norway are hereditary because of two founder mutations. Penetrance is very low, and only an estimated 10% of mutation carriers develop symptoms throughout life. Treatment consists of avoidance of precipitating factors, phlebotomy to reduce iron or increasing urinary porphyrin excretion by administering chloroquine.

It might take 6–15 months before complete clinical and biochemical remission is reached, but the prognosis is good, and many patients experience lifelong remission. To detect relapse, urinary porphyrin concentration, iron and liver functions should be assessed annually.

The principal aim of the Norwegian Porphyria Centre is to optimize the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with porphyria. Although the clinical benefits of mutation screening are controversial, distinguishing between sporadic and familial cases appears to be important to many patients and their relatives, and NAPOS therefore offers, in hereditary cases, predictive genetic testing and counselling to at-risk adult family members.

Photodermatoses can have a high psychological impact. Jong et al.investigated quality of life (QoL) in patients with a range of photodermatoses, including PCT. They concluded that, overall, photodermatoses had a major impact on QoL, but that PCT had a lower impact on QoL than did other cutaneous porphyrias. Very little knowledge of the psychosocial impact of PCT is available and more information on the subjective experiences is therefore needed to secure optimal treatment, follow-up and counselling of this group. The aim of the present study was therefore to explore the experiences persons with PCT have regarding symptoms, treatment, follow-up and prevention of the disease.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda unmasked by supratherapeutic estrogen during gender-affirming hormone therapy [^639049ca]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

The treatment of PCT requires removing or reducing known risk factors. Although it was not an easy decision, our patient achieved clinical remission by temporary estrogen discontinuation followed by change in route of delivery. When gender-affirming HT is potentially contributing to PCT, a patient-centered discussion of risk versus benefits is paramount. HT for transgender patients is life long and addresses physical and psychological aspects of gender dysphoria. General distrust of the health care community among transgender patients may make conversations about adjusting HT better received when they involve the prescribing provider, with whom the patient has an established relationship of trust. Although our patient did not maintain other recommended lifestyle changes, such as smoking and alcohol reduction, lifestyle modifications should be encouraged.

HT and consideration of its cutaneous side effects will continue to grow as the number of transgender patients presenting for health care continues to increase. It is important to recognize the potential risk for PCT in this growing demographic and consider a multifaceted treatment approach that includes HT adjustment as a therapeutic option, while being mindful of its important role in affirming gender identity.

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^b2e7e7a2]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Analysis

Analysis was performed in accordance with interpretive descriptive guidelines and was also influenced by systematic text condensation. Analysis was primarily performed by the first author (J. A.), with discussions and guidance from the other authors (E.G. S.S. and M.R.). Audio recordings of the interviews were transcribed verbatim and initially read as a whole. In the first step, focus was on reflections and main impressions and four preliminary themes were identified: (i) large variations in symptom experience; (ii) taking control; (iii) treatment; and (iv) prevention of symptoms. In step two, coding and text condensation were performed based on these themes, while special attention was given to avoidance of premature closure of coding. Coding was first conducted cross-case, followed by longitudinal coding at an individual level. In step three, coding was elaborated with subgroups and further text condensation. Step four was an iterative process where focus shifted from the decontextualized codes and the transcripts as a whole; based on this, a synthesis of the coded material was presented as three main themes with subthemes. For validation, the full transcripts were re-read several times and systematically searched for data that challenged the results.

### A first report of porphyria cutanea tarda successfully treated with glycyrrhizin [^f7e85fd4]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a condition that affects liver and skin by reduction of hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity. It is characterized by blistering lesions, erosions and crusts on sun-exposed areas. We report a 51-year-old male presenting with recurrent episodes of bullae, erosions, and crust on his neck and dorsum of the hands for 3 months. Aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase levels, as well as total plasma porphyrin and urinary uroporphyrin levels were elevated. Based on the clinical manifestations, the history and laboratory findings, a diagnosis of PCT was made. The cutaneous and biochemical abnormalities of the patient improved with therapy of glycyrrhizin.

Theme 3: managing porphyria cutanea tarda – strategies for prevention, treatment and controls

Preventive strategies: frequent controls, taking calculated risks or doing nothing?

PCT was perceived as a chronic condition that patients needed to manage for the remainder of their lives. For some, this meant frequent controls and a vigilant lifestyle, with a focus on eating habits, avoiding the sun and generally being careful. For others, prevention involved taking blood samples and having control intervals. Control intervals varied greatly, from having ferritin levels never checked to having them checked every 2 weeks, every month and twice a year. The merits of this were debated by participants, and the more 'experienced' patients with PCT were asked for advice as to how often they should be tested, which test should be done and who should perform them. A few participants said they did nothing to prevent PCT. As Lilly said, 'I have a disease, but I'm not ill'. Most took calculated risks and would enjoy alcohol, sun and good food, but in moderation. They said they knew they risked skin symptoms, but it was worth it. However, the suspicion that PCT caused other problems was more worrying. Lilly said:

I think about it. But I choose to do it. And I think, like, if I'm traveling to sunny places, if I happen to get a blister, well that's just… I have a blister, blood samples and bloodletting. But what I might think about sometimes is, what does it do to other things in the body? Right? I'm thinking cirrhosis. Kidney failure? I mean, what if I defy this and perhaps avoid getting a blister. But perhaps I got it because I didn't take the precautions I should. And I just used bloodletting as a way to exceed my limitations. Do you understand what I'm saying? Because I don't want that, but this is something you don't know a lot about yet. Right? What it does to other organs? Because if it's just a rash that can be treated with draining blood? Well, then we can just do whatever we want, can't we?

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^73c21aef]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The results show that, at their worst, PCT symptoms can be experienced as dramatic, and that a shift in focus from skin to blood after establishing the diagnosis led to the perception of PCT as a chronic, systemic disease that may cause a range of unknown health problems. This suggests there is a need for information and reassurance in clinical consultations, and as long as patients are in biochemical remission and follow control guidelines, there is little reason for them to expect health problems related to PCT. The effects of itching in PCT should not be underestimated and was reported to be a severe problem for some participants. It is important that physicians and healthcare personnel, as well as specialist centres that give advice on PCT, are aware of the differences in how the patients experience their disease, and that many of them experience it as much more than a skin disease, so that patient care and disease management can be optimized.

### Novel treatment using cimetidine for erythropoietic protoporphyria in children [^42696c4e]. JAMA Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a rare hereditary disease of heme biosynthesis that manifests as severe photosensitivity and hepatotoxicity. There have been no effective treatments to date. Cimetidine has been shown to inhibit heme biosynthesis and results in symptomatic improvement in patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) and porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). There is only 1 report in the literature describing the use of cimetidine in the effective treatment of an adult patient with EPP.

Objective

To describe the successful use of cimetidine in pediatric patients with EPP.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective medical record review carried out in a pediatric dermatology practice at an academic institution of patients diagnosed with EPP who were younger than 18 years and treated with systemic cimetidine in the past 3 years.

Interventions

Systemic cimetidine.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Resolution of skin photodamage was evaluated on clinical examination. Subjective measures including tolerability to sun exposure, ability to participate in outdoor activities, and objective evaluation including serum erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels and liver function tests following treatment were assessed.

Results

All 3 cases reported a rapid reduction in photosensitivity within weeks following initiation of systemic therapy. Their skin photodamage were also improved or resolved completely on subsequent examination. Laboratory study results also revealed reduction in serum erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels and improved liver function. None of the patients have reported any adverse effects of the systemic treatment after more than 2 years of treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

Children with EPP currently have limited therapeutic options and experience substantial disease impact on their quality of life. This is the first case series demonstrating that cimetidine, a readily available oral medication, can be a promising treatment for children with EPP.

### Occurrence of porphyria cutanea tarda during peginterferon / ribavirin therapy for chronic viral hepatitis C [^00db05e1]. Journal of Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a metabolic disorder characterized by a reduced hepatic activity of uroporphynogen decarboxylase (URO-D), an enzyme of the heme synthesis. The clinical features of PCT may be brought into light by hepatic injury induced by hepatitis C virus (HCV). A significant association between HCV and PCT is well recognized, although the role of HCV in the appearance of PCT is still debated because confounding factors often coexist, such as alcohol, other viruses, drugs or iron overload (). HCV therapy may improve PCT although PCT was rarely reported as a de novo occurrence during an interferon/ribavirin therapy (Jessner et al. Hepatology 2002;36:1301–1302); here, we describe two such other cases.

### Clinical guide and update on porphyrias [^a72d2df7]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Physicians should be aware of porphyrias, which could be responsible for unexplained gastrointestinal, neurologic, or skin disorders. Despite their relative rarity and complexity, most porphyrias can be easily defined and diagnosed. They are caused by well-characterized enzyme defects in the complex heme biosynthetic pathway and are divided into categories of acute vs non-acute or hepatic vs erythropoietic porphyrias. Acute hepatic porphyrias (acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficient porphyria) manifest in attacks and are characterized by overproduction of porphyrin precursors, producing often serious abdominal, psychiatric, neurologic, or cardiovascular symptoms. Patients with variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria can present with skin photosensitivity. Diagnosis relies on measurement of increased urinary 5-aminolevulinic acid (in patients with aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficient porphyria) or increased 5-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen (in patients with other acute porphyrias). Management of attacks requires intensive care, strict avoidance of porphyrinogenic drugs and other precipitating factors, caloric support, and often heme therapy. The non-acute porphyrias are porphyria cutanea tarda, erythropoietic protoporphyria, X-linked protoporphyria, and the rare congenital erythropoietic porphyria. They lead to the accumulation of porphyrins that cause skin photosensitivity and occasionally severe liver damage. Secondary elevated urinary or blood porphyrins can occur in patients without porphyria, for example, in liver diseases, or iron deficiency. Increases in porphyrin precursors and porphyrins are also found in patients with lead intoxication. Patients with porphyria cutanea tarda benefit from iron depletion, hydroxychloroquine therapy, and, if applicable, elimination of the hepatitis C virus. An α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone analogue can reduce sunlight sensitivity in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria or X-linked protoporphyria. Strategies to address dysregulated or dysfunctional steps within the heme biosynthetic pathway are in development.

### Improvement in ocular cicatricial pemphigoid following treatment for porphyria cutanea tarda [^9db96eca]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old Caucasian male complaining of redness and tearing for 3 years in both eyes was referred for evaluation of cicatricial conjunctivitis. Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid was suspected and this diagnosis was confirmed through biopsy. The patient's condition showed moderate improvement following treatment with methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil. The patient was later diagnosed with porphyria cutanea tarda and phlebotomy treatments were subsequently initiated. The patient's ocular symptoms improved further after he began receiving these phlebotomy treatments, and conventional treatment was discontinued. The authors hypothesize that circulating porphyrins activated by ultraviolet light could be the cause of the ocular cicatricial pemphigoid in this patient.

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^bd28f415]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

This study was based on interpretive description, which is a well-documented qualitative approach with emphasis on clinical practice and exploration of health-related issues.–Focus groups with interactive discussions were deemed appropriate. The study complied with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Norwegian regional ethics committee (2012/1078).

Recruitment

A convenience sample was recruited in connection with a biennial patient seminar arranged by NAPOS in 2012. Information regarding the focus groups was included with invitations to the seminar. Experience with symptoms during the last 5 years was set as the inclusion criterion. Forty-six people with PCT participated at the seminar and 23 provided written consent to participate in the focus groups. Two were excluded because of clinical remission exceeding 5 years.

Data production and participants

The patient seminar consisted of joint sessions and lectures on symptoms and treatment, in addition to conversation groups for patients to share their experiences. Three focus groups with seven participants were held over two consecutive days at the seminar. In light of the rich information provided, the sample size was deemed satisfactory. The interviews lasted approximately 90 min. The participants included 11 women and 10 men, aged 31–77 years. Three participants reported having haemochromatosis (Table 1). The interviews were moderated by the first author (J. A.), who is experienced in counselling patients with porphyria. One co-moderator participated in the first two groups while a second participated in the third group. The interviews were semistructured and focused on three main themes with subquestions. The main themes of the interview guide were: (i) experience with symptoms; (ii) treatment; and (iii) future expectations. Emerging themes that were not addressed by the interview guide were followed up in consecutive interviews.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda in a child following multi-agent chemotherapy [^09578743]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a blistering skin disorder that occurs most commonly in middle-aged individuals. It is caused by decreased uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) activity, which results in elevated levels of uroporphyrinogen. Occurrence remains very rare in children with some sources quoting as few as 50 reports of childhood cases.1 The literature reports occasional cases of PCT onset with various drugs, including barbiturates, estrogens, griseofulvin, rifampicin, sulfonamides, imatinib, methotrexate, tamoxifen, and cyclophosphamide, however its incidence in childhood is uncommon.2–6 We present a case of new-onset PCT in an eight year-old following treatment of pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with multi-agent chemotherapy.

### A photodistributed eruption in an immunosuppressed patient [^e5d47e4b]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the best treatment for this patient?
A. Drug discontinuation
B. Hydroxychloroquine
C. Immediate initiation of valacyclovir
D. Phlebotomy
E. Supportive care

Answers:
A. Drug discontinuation – Incorrect. In phototoxic drug reactions, the mainstay of treatment is the identification and cessation of the causative agent. In cases where discontinuation is not possible, patients should be instructed to avoid the sun and practice strict sun protection.
B. Hydroxychloroquine – Incorrect. Antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and quinacrine are the first-line systemic therapy for cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Systemic medications are recommended in cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that are severe, widespread, or refractory to topical therapies.
C. Immediate initiation of valacyclovir – Correct. The treatment of choice for VZV infection in individuals at a greater risk for complications, including adults and immunocompromised patients, is antiviral therapy. The most commonly used antiviral agents are acyclovir and valacyclovir, which function by inhibiting viral DNA polymerase and subsequently VZV replication. Our patient was treated with 1 gram of valacyclovir 3 times daily for 14 days and reported significant improvement after completion of the treatment course.
D. Phlebotomy – Incorrect. The standard treatment for patients with porphyria cutanea tarda is regular phlebotomy to reduce iron and porphyrin levels in the liver.
E. Supportive care – Incorrect. Varicella has a low complication rate, especially in children, and can be treated symptomatically. However, in immunosuppressed patients, antivirals should be promptly initiated to minimize the risk of complications.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda unmasked by supratherapeutic estrogen during gender-affirming hormone therapy [^d9f2ccde]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Providing medically competent care for gender minorities has become a public health focus. Body-gender incongruence, antitransgender biases, and social isolation contribute to a lifetime risk of suicide attempts in this population greatly exceeding that of the overall US population (25%-43% vs 4.6%). Gender-affirming hormone therapy (HT) provides several desired physical and physiologic changes and can reduce suicidal ideation by nearly one half; however, it can also induce unwanted dermatologic side effects. A growing body of literature is emerging to define these effects and their management, which commonly include acne, changes in hair distribution or density, and hyperpigmentation. An increased susceptibility to female predominant autoimmune conditions has also been suggested, raising concern that transgender females on long-term HT may additionally be at risk for other conditions commonly linked to estrogen exposure, such as porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), erythema nodosum, vascular lesions, and cutaneous manifestations of changes in bile or lipid metabolism.

We report the case of a 55-year-old woman (male-to-female transgender) who presented with PCT following a change in HT that led to supratherapeutic estrogen. To our knowledge, PCT arising in a transgender patient taking HT has not been reported. The current lack of clear evidence-based HT treatment algorithms and barriers to HT access foster therapeutic inconsistency and hormone level fluctuations, which increase the risk of PCT and other cutaneous side effects of HT in transgender females.

### Desferrioxamine treatment of porphyria cutanea tarda in a patient with HIV and chronic renal failure [^a0a04942]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) can occur in HIV patients. Current evidence suggests that HIV infection may interfere with the hepatic cytochrome oxidase system, leading to porphyrin metabolism impairment. Moreover, chronic hemodialysis in renal failure may be a risk factor for PCT. In addition to the contributory factors for PCT associated to HIV infection, it is possible that porphyrin accumulation secondary to renal failure may play a role in the expression of this disease. We report a case of PCT in an HIV-1 infected patient under blood dialysis, refractory to antimalarials and controlled with desferrioxamine.

### Guide to porphyrias. A historical and clinical perspective [^6dd99949]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Porphyrias are a group of inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis classified as neurovisceral, cutaneous, or mixed. A deficiency of any of the 8 enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway can lead to a variety of clinical symptoms. Classification depends on the defective enzyme. Porphyrias often are misdiagnosed because patients have vague symptoms. However, acute forms of porphyria can be life-threatening, so it is important to make an accurate diagnosis and initiate proper medical management. We discuss the history, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of porphyrias and then briefly describe the 8 types of porphyrias and their distinguishing features.

### A rare case of porphyria cutanea tarda in a patient with a homozygous hereditary hemochromatosis gene H63D mutation in the setting of hereditary hemochromatosis [^de936da8]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

In this case, iron overload in the setting of HH played a vital role in the development of PCT in an otherwise healthy individual. The role of iron in PCT is complex, and several hypotheses have been proposed regarding the pathogenesis of the disease. Hepatic iron overload is present in nearly all cases, and elevation in plasma iron is present in 50% of cases. It is theorized that iron may inhibit UROD through direct suppression or indirectly as an essential co-factor in generating the UROD inhibitor uroporphomethene. The benefit of removing plasma iron through phlebotomy supports the critical role of iron overload in this disease.

HH is an autosomal recessive disorder and the most common genetic disease in populations of European descent. Mutations in the HFE gene located on chromosome 6p21.3, C282Y and H63D, are essential factors in the development of PCT. Studies have shown that homozygosity of C282Y mutation leads to earlier onset of symptoms in PCT. The H63D mutation has also been associated with PCT but is much less common. In 1 study, 15% of PCT patients carried the homozygous C282Y mutation, and 8% carried the homozygous H63D mutation. The H63D mutation alters the normal HFE product's affinity for its ligand, the transferrin receptor, contributing to an iron overload state. In patients with HH, iron overload tends to be higher in those homozygous for the C282Y mutation when compared to those that are homozygous for the H63D mutation. In the case presented, the patient was found to be homozygous for the H63D mutation and negative for the C282Y mutation.

Although treatment of PCT varies depending upon the severity of the condition, photoprotection and avoidance of well-known triggers, such as alcohol and estrogens, is both prophylactic and therapeutic in most cases of PCT. Other mainstays of treatment include hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and phlebotomy. Our patient achieved complete remission through serial therapeutic phlebotomies every 2 weeks.

In conclusion, we report the clinical, histological, laboratory, and genetic work-up of a 21-year-old Caucasian male with PCT in the setting of previously undiagnosed HH caused by a homozygous H63D mutation in the HFE gene, which has rarely been reported.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^4935e334]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Treatment of secondary iron overload — phlebotomy is useful in certain forms and is clearly indicated in porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), but there is no published evidence that phlebotomy is of benefit in alcoholic liver disease (ALD). In chronic hepatitis C, phlebotomy therapy reduces elevated ALT levels and achieves a marginal improvement in histopathology but has no effect on virologic clearance, and phlebotomy is not recommended for mild secondary iron overload (HIC < 2500 μg/g dry weight). In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), studies have shown a benefit of therapeutic phlebotomy with improvement in parameters of insulin resistance and reduction in elevated ALT levels. Iron chelation options include deferasirox, which has been approved in the United States for treatment of secondary iron overload due to ineffective erythropoiesis, and parenteral deferoxamine administered by continuous subcutaneous infusion at 40 mg/kg/day for 8–12 hours nightly for 5–7 nights weekly; a total dose of approximately 2 g per 24 hours usually achieves maximal urinary iron excretion. Chelation therapy to reduce HIC < 15,000 μg/g dry weight significantly reduces the risk of clinical disease, but ferritin levels can be misleading in secondary iron overload; in some patients repeat liver biopsy may be necessary, and monitoring 24-hour urinary iron excretion is sometimes helpful.

### Effect of an oral iron chelator or iron-deficient diets on uroporphyria in a murine model of porphyria cutanea tarda [^084ab66f]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Porphyria cutanea tarda is a liver disease characterized by elevated hepatic iron and excessive production of uroporphyrin (URO). Phlebotomy is an effective treatment that probably acts by reducing hepatic iron. Here we used Hfe(-/-) mice to compare the effects on hepatic URO accumulation of two different methods of hepatic iron depletion: iron chelation using deferiprone (L1) versus iron-deficient diets. Hfe(-/-) mice in a 129S6/SvEvTac background were fed 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), which results in hepatic URO accumulation, and increasing doses of L1 in the drinking water. Hepatic URO accumulation was completely prevented at low L1 doses, which partially depleted hepatic nonheme iron. By histological assessment, the decrease in hepatic URO accumulation was associated with greater depletion of iron from hepatocytes than from Kupffer cells. The L1 treatment had no effect on levels of hepatic cytochrome P4501A2 (CYP1A2). L1 also effectively decreased hepatic URO accumulation in C57BL/6 Hfe(-/-) mice treated with ALA and a CYP1A2 inducer. ALA-treated mice maintained on defined iron-deficient diets, rather than chow diets, did not develop uroporphyria, even when the animals were iron-supplemented either directly in the diet or by iron dextran injection.

Conclusion

The results suggest that dietary factors other than iron are involved in the development of uroporphyria and that a modest depletion of hepatocyte iron by L1 is sufficient to prevent URO accumulation.

We present a case of a woman who presented with a photosensitive skin rash and blisters on her extremities which did not improve with steroids. These were associated with polyarthralgia and a deranged liver function test on her admission. Further workup revealed that the patient has an undiagnosed porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) and hereditary haemochromatosis. The patient later underwent regular venesections which improved her condition. This case report not only illustrates the challenge in diagnosing PCT but also aims to highlight the association between PCT and hereditary haemochromatosis.

### Unusual pain disorders-what can Be learned from them? [^ec5a8b57]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Porphyrias

A group of rare, underdiagnosed conditions whose leading symptom is an acute, severe pain are the acute porphyrias. The porphyrias are a group of metabolic disorders. Several enzymatic steps are involved in the heme biosynthesis pathway (Figure 3). A malfunctioning of any of them leads to an accumulation of heme precursors like 5-aminolaevulinic acid (5-ALA) or porphobilinogen (PBG), predominantly in either the liver or bone marrow. Depending on the specific enzyme that is altered in its activity, eight different hereditary types of porphyrias are known. They can be classified as "hepatic" or "erythropoietic" (describing the location primarily affected from the precursor-accumulation) or as "acute" or "cutaneous" (based on clinical manifestations). Two types of porphyrias, the hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) and the variegate porphyria (VP), are classified as both acute and cutaneous.

The most common acute porphyria, the acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), is reported to affect 1:75,000 people in European countries. Sweden, where 1:1000 people are affected, is an exception due to a founder effect. The most common porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), has a prevalence of 1:10,000 according to European studies.

Blistering diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders that can affect either skin and mucous membrane, or both, varying in presentation, clinical course, pathohistology, immunopathology and treatment. Not infrequently the diagnosis is delayed. This can result in severe, and sometimes fatal consequences. Although these diseases are rare, it is very important to make an accurate diagnosis based on a combination of clinical profile and laboratory observations. A brief review is presented of the following bullous diseases: pemphigus, paraneoplastic pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, cicatricial pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, dermatitis herpetiformis, linear IgA bullous disease, porphyria cutanea tarda, and subcorneal pustular dermatitis. Their clinical, pathohistologic and immunopathologic features and recommendations for therapy are discussed.

### Safety of hydroxychloroquine: what a dermatologist should know [^06e54a21]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine, both 4-aminoquinoline drugs, were originally developed for malaria treatment. While chloroquine inhibits DNA and RNA polymerase, blocking Plasmodium 's use of hemoglobin, HCQ increases the pH in parasitic vacuoles, disrupting hemoglobin degradation. The key pharmacological properties of HCQ are summarized in Table 1. HCQ is widely used to treat rheumatological conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis, by virtue of their immunomodulatory properties. HCQ's lower cost, favorable safety profile compared to other immunomodulators, demonstrated effectiveness as a modifying agent, and survival benefits in SLE have increased its use in developed countries. Unlike chloroquine, HCQ rarely causes retinal toxicity over similar treatment periods, contributing to its widespread use. Particularly for the treatment of SLE according to current guidelines, HCQ dosages of 5 mg/kg per day or less are recommended to reduce the risk of toxicity, but this may lead to increased flare-ups. It is the clinician's responsibility to balance the right dosage to suit the individual patient. HCQ is also used in dermatological conditions, such as cutaneous lupus erythematosus, cutaneous and mucosal lichen planus, cicatricial alopecias, dermatomyositis, and porphyria cutanea tarda. Table 2 summarizes the indications, relevant posology, and clinical benefit for the main dermatological conditions. Except for porphyria cutanea tarda, generally, for dermatological diseases, the dosage of HCQ used is 5 mg/kg/day, administered in clinical practice with a flat dose of 200 mg twice a day, and based on clinical response, doses may be decreased.

### How I treat erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria [^9bd6b943]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

EPP and XLP are nonblistering cutaneous porphyrias characterized by excess protoporphyrin in the bone marrow and high levels of circulating protoporphyrin, resulting in photosensitivity and an increased risk of biliary stones and liver damage. Recommended management includes monitoring for liver damage and other disease-related complications. Although the understanding of the molecular basis and clinical presentation of protoporphyrias has advanced, the development of novel and promising new therapies has occurred only recently. Therefore, it is becoming even more important for physicians to be aware of the diagnosis and management of these rare, but often undiagnosed, conditions.

### Association of porphyria cutanea tarda with hereditary hemochromatosis [^852f69d3]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

An increased frequency of hereditary hemochromatosis gene mutations occurs in patients with porphyria cutanea tarda. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of peripheral blood for hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations is available for clinical use. Early detection and treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis limit disease progression and improve life expectancy.

Objective

We present 8 patients with porphyria cutanea tarda subsequently found to have hereditary hemochromatosis or mutations in the HFE gene.

Methods

Retrospective review of patients in whom both porphyria cutanea tarda and hereditary hemochromatosis or HFE gene mutations were diagnosed between 1976 and 2000.

Results

Eight patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (6 males, 2 females; age range, 4–60 years; mean age at diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda, 42 years) were subsequently found to have hepatic iron overload or HFE gene mutations. Two patients had liver biopsy findings compatible with homozygous hereditary hemochromatosis. In the other 6 patients, HFE gene analysis revealed 3 homozygous C282Y, 1 compound heterozygous C282Y/H63D, and 2 heterozygous C282Y mutations. Seven patients (88%) had no specific signs or symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis at diagnosis. In 5 patients (63%), the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis or HFE gene mutation was initially suspected by the dermatologist.

Conclusion

Porphyria cutanea tarda can be an important cutaneous marker for patients with mutations of the HFE gene. HFE gene analysis should be done in patients who present with porphyria cutanea tarda. The dermatologist may play a key role in the early diagnosis of subclinical hereditary hemochromatosis in patients who present with porphyria cutanea tarda.

We report a 33-year-old woman with haemodialysis-associated pseudoporphyria successfully responding to treatment with oral N-acetylcysteine. We briefly review the current literature on bullous skin disorders in end-stage renal disease, and compare and contrast the pathogenesis of pseudoporphyria and porphyria cutanea tarda in this context. We also discuss the antioxidant properties and clinical applications of N-acetylcysteine, including the treatment of haemodialysis-associated pseudoporphyria.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda unmasked by supratherapeutic estrogen during gender-affirming hormone therapy [^90c1c43d]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Here we report a case of PCT arising in a male-to-female transgender patient on gender-affirming HT. In PCT, decreased uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase activity in hepatocytes leads to the accumulation of porphyrins in the skin, provoking photosensitivity. PCT is uncommon but has been associated with estrogen, iron accumulation, hepatotoxins, alcohol consumption, tobacco use, hepatitis C, HIV, and mutations in the hemochromatosis alleles, HFE C282Y and H63D.

A growing number of patients are seeking out gender-affirming HT to achieve physical, emotional, and social characteristics consistent with their gender identity. The prolonged need to suppress endogenous sex hormone secretion and maintain hormone levels within the range consistent with gender identity exposes transgender patients to higher hormone doses relative to other indications for hormone administration. Lack of strong evidence-based guidelines and inadequate provider training regarding the optimal drugs, dosage, and routes lead to significant variability in gender-affirming HT regimens. Treatment is often guided by patients eager to maximize resultsand based on social media reports of what has worked for others. Pharmacokinetic variability is further driven by cost and drug shortages, which prompt changes in formulation and potential use of black-market products.

Our patient had PCT after 23 years taking 1 to 4 mg oral estradiol therapy daily. She had intermittently been on progesterone, and immediately prior to the onset of her symptoms simultaneously increased her estradiol and began a trial of oral micronized progesterone. Her subsequent supratherapeutic serum estrogen prompted discontinuation of micronized progesterone and a 1-month break in estradiol followed by dose reduction. The timeline suggests that supratherapeutic estrogen may have combined with other risk factors (HFE heterozygosity and tobacco and alcohol use) to trigger PCT. She previously tolerated 4 mg estradiol daily, raising concern that combination with micronized progesterone (selected for promotional pricing and reported anxiolytic effects) may have also contributed. Although total estrogen was elevated (goal, 600–1000 pg/mL), serum estradiol and prescribed HT dosing were within published expert opinion–based guidelines.

### Hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Sovuna) [^7628414f]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.5 Risks Associated with Use in Porphyria

Administration of SOVUNA to patients with porphyria may exacerbate porphyria. Avoid SOVUNA in patients with porphyria.

Hepatotoxicity Associated with Porphyria Cutanea Tarda

Cases of hepatotoxicity have been reported when hydroxychloroquine was used in patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). Patients received dosages ranging from 200 mg twice weekly to 400 mg daily. Most of the PCT-related cases presented with marked elevations in transaminases (> 20 times upper limit of the reference range) within days to a month of hydroxychloroquine initiation. In some cases, PCT was diagnosed only after the occurrence of treatment-induced liver injury, when hydroxychloroquine was prescribed for an approved indication. Some of the cases were associated with other risk factors for hepatic injury (e.g., alcohol use, concomitant hepatotoxic medications).

Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, such as fatigue, rash, nausea, dark urine, or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal serum liver tests (e.g. ALT level greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt treatment with SOVUNA, and investigate further to establish the probable cause.

The safety and effectiveness of SOVUNA for the treatment of PCT have not been established and SOVUNA is not approved for this use.

5.6 Hematologic Toxicity

SOVUNA may cause myelosuppression including aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia. Monitor blood cell counts periodically in patients on prolonged SOVUNA therapy. If the patient develops myelosuppression which cannot be attributable to the disease, discontinue the drug.

5.7 Hemolytic Anemia Associated with G6PD Deficiency

Hemolysis has been reported in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Monitor for hemolytic anemia as this can occur, particularly in association with other drugs that cause hemolysis.

### Treatment of porphyria cutanea tarda with phlebotomy in a patient on peritoneal dialysis [^da98cab7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is frequently described among patients with chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis. One patient who was receiving peritoneal dialysis and had PCT develop has been described in the literature. However, it was later determined that the patient's PCT was related to the hepatotoxic drug she was receiving rather than her peritoneal dialysis. Our patient is the first reported case, to our knowledge, of a patient with end-stage renal disease with negative hepatitis serology who was not receiving a hepatotoxic drug, or on hemodialysis, who had PCT develop while receiving peritoneal dialysis.

Living with a rare genetic disease

Individuals with protoporphyria can experience severe pain when exposed to sunlight, and efforts to avoid symptoms markedly impair quality of life. The pain experienced is out of proportion to the degree of visible skin damage, which is often minimal or absent. Therefore, patients, especially children and young adults, find explaining this "invisible" condition to others challenging., In managing patients with protoporphyria, addressing and validating psychosocial concerns and encouraging access to online resources, patient support groups, expert centers, clinical trials, and specialized programs for affected children is critical.

### Diagnosis and treatment of the hepatic porphyrias [^a2461e5c]. Dermatologic Therapy (2003). Low credibility.

Porphyrias are a peculiar group of diseases resulting from hereditary or acquired partial deficiencies in seven of the eight enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of heme. Biosynthesis of heme takes place in the erythropoietic system or in the hepatic tissue. Depending on the main location of the enzyme defect, porphyrias can be classified as erythropoietic or hepatic. There are seven basic clinical forms of porphyria related to a deficiency of each of the involved enzymes. Clinical manifestations in porphyria may be neurovisceral or cutaneous. Patients may present with acute attacks (acute porphyrias), cutaneous lesions (cutaneous porphyrias), or both (mixed porphyrias). Study of patients supected of having porphyria should include several steps: 1) clinical evaluation, 2) biochemical study, which enables us to classify the patient to a specific form of porphyria, followed if possible by 3) enzymatic assay(s), and 4) genetic studies to confirm an enzyme deficiency and its level and the causal genetic mutation. Unfortunately no curative treatment is available for any of the porphyrias. However, symptomatic treatments are available and are discussed in this article.

### Successful radiation therapy for breast cancer in a patient with hereditary coproporphyria [^0cdb30b8]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and Literature Review

We report a case of the safe use of adjuvant RT for a patient with breast cancer and HC, notable only for a potentially exaggerated acute pain response in the skin over her treated breast and axilla. Follow-up 1 year after completing RT suggests dramatic improvement of the noted hypersensitivity and pain in her breast and axilla to normal after surgery and adjuvant RT. Overall, this case supports the majority of scarce available literature displaying the safe use of RT for patients with porphyria and cancer, and is the only such example specific to HC to our knowledge. Most of the available literature reports on patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), which does not present with neurologic attacks, but shares the photosensitive features. A list of the case reports can be found in Table 1 and is summarized below.

Table 1
Summary of case studies of patients with porphyric syndromes treated with radiation therapy

Schaffer et alreported 2 cases of patients with porphyria receiving RT; a 48-year-old woman with acute intermittent porphyria and a 70-year-old man with PCT. The first patient with acute intermittent porphyria presented with left breast cancer, for which she received a radiation dose of 60 Gy to the left chest wall, and again received doses of 46 and 50 Gy to her head and mediastinum, respectively, for metastases a year later. The second patient with PCT presented with bladder cancer, for which he received a radiation dose of 51 Gy to the pelvis. Neither patient displayed abnormal acute or chronic reactions, or suffered acute porphyric attacks during treatment, leading to the conclusion that RT was a safe and reasonable choice for patients with porphyria.

### Hypoxia as a medicine [^34f7ccac]. Science Translational Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Procedures to decrease arterial oxygen content

For completeness, we consider medical or surgical procedures for achieving therapeutic hypoxia. Therapeutic phlebotomy is a useful tool in the modern treatment of conditions of iron overload including hemochromatosis, polycythemia vera and porphyria cutanea tarda, where long-term removal of up to 300 mL of blood monthly resulting in a hemoglobin around 10 g/dL has been well-tolerated. Another physical intervention to decrease the oxygen content of arterial blood is the purposeful creation of an anatomic shunt allowing deoxygenated blood to pass from the right side of the heart to the systemic circulation without becoming oxygenated in the lungs. Given that severe congenital heart defects resulting in hypoxemia require surgical correction, the notion of intentionally creating a cardiac shunt at first sounds as counter-intuitive as therapeutic hypoxia itself, but in fact, there is precedent for this approach. The intentional creation of an 8 mm atrial septal defect is under investigation for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (a condition in which decreased peripheral oxygen extraction during exercise is common). Neither phlebotomy nor shunt creation could feasibly be the primary means of safely achieving tissue hypoxia, but their use could serve as an adjunct and to blunt compensatory responses.

### Sclerodermatous changes of face, neck and scalp associated with familial porphyria cutanea tarda [^37145c33]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), the most common of the porphyrias, is a mainly acquired disease of the liver, which manifests with bullous skin lesions. However, up to 20% of patients with PCT, usually those with chronic untreated disease, are reported to develop some sclerodermatous changes that may affect both light-exposed and nonexposed areas and that can be histologically indistinguishable from true scleroderma. A small number of patients with PCT has severe or generalized scleroderma, which is not necessarily due to coexistent systemic sclerosis. There are few reports in the literature that detail whether the severe sclerodermatous changes respond to control of the porphyria. We report a case of familial PCT with associated severe sclerodermatous changes causing scarring alopecia, cicatricial ectropion and skin thickening over the upper trunk. The scleroderma improved slightly over a 4-year follow-up period after treatment to normalize porphyrin excretion and prevent relapse.

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^4da4aa46]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Itching – an underestimated problem?

It became evident that itching was a problem, with some considering itching to be the worst aspect of PCT. Itching was attributed to skin healing and seen as a sign of rising porphyrin levels. Participants would itch both when experiencing symptoms and when in remission. The itching was predominant at night, and would typically start after going to bed. It was debatable whether this was because of the warmth of the bed, or because it was more noticeable at this time. The itching disrupted or prevented sleep, and already fragile skin was easily ruptured, resulting in bleeding, further delaying skin healing and increasing the probability of infection. Some slept with gloves on to prevent inadvertently hurting themselves. Nick said:

It itches so much [several nods in agreement], so that's what I feel is the biggest problem. And then you lie awake at night and you scratch and it bleeds. Because of this, it never heals because it is scratched too often. It is there all the time, but it is at night that I scratch because I cannot help myself. So yes, that is when I notice it the most. It itches all the time, but that is when you might hurt yourself.

Hemochromatosis — symptoms and signs prompting evaluation are outlined as follows: When patients present with symptoms, hemochromatosis should be considered when there are complaints of fatigue, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, arthralgias (typically of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints), chondrocalcinosis, impotence, decreased libido, and symptoms of heart failure or diabetes. Similarly, physical findings of an enlarged liver, particularly in the presence of cirrhosis, extrahepatic manifestations of chronic liver disease, testicular atrophy, congestive heart failure, skin pigmentation, changes of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), or arthritis should raise the suspicion of hemochromatosis.

Acute hepatic porphyrias — diagnosis, acute attack treatment, and risk counseling — The key diagnostic test is a spot urine for ALA, PBG, porphyrins, and creatinine. Treatment of acute attacks should be with intravenous hemin given by peripherally inserted central catheter line or central port, 3–4 mg/kg body weight/d for 3–5 days, and givosiran should be considered in patients with biochemically and genetically documented AHP and with frequent attacks (4 or more per year). Acute attacks occur especially in women aged approximately 15–50 years, and long-term risks of AHPs include systemic arterial hypertension, chronic liver and renal diseases, and development of HCC even in the absence of cirrhosis, so patients should have ongoing assessments for such potential complications.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda unmasked by supratherapeutic estrogen during gender-affirming hormone therapy [^1c7bec5a]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 55-year-old woman (transgender male-to-female) maintained on oral estradiol for 23 years presented with a 3-month history of burning pain, pruritus, and recurrent blisters on her forearms and hands after exposure to sunlight. One month before symptom onset, the patient initiated a trial of micronized progesterone (100 mg/d) and increased her daily estradiol from 2 mg to 4 mg in an effort to better control gender dysphoria. Her subsequent laboratory findings were notable for a supratherapeutic total estrogen level (1945 pg/mL). Other medications included lisinopril, spironolactone, medroxyprogesterone, and occasional ibuprofen. She denied a personal or family history of liver disease, hepatitis, iron abnormalities, or blistering eruptions. She consumed 2 beers daily and had a 30-pack-year smoking history.

Physical examination confirmed the presence of vesicles and bullae on erythematous bases with scattered milia over the bilateral dorsal forearms, hands, and ears (Figs 1 and 2). Hypertrichosis was not observed or endorsed by the patient. Punch biopsy found a subepidermal blister overlying festooning of the dermal papillae with minimal superficial perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate and a negative immunofluorescence examination (Fig 3). A periodic acid–Schiff stain was negative. Laboratory findings revealed mild hepatic transaminitis, negative HIV and hepatitis C antibodies, unremarkable iron studies, elevated total serum porphyrins, urine uroporphyrin and heptaporphyrin, and HFE C282Y heterozygosity (Table I). A liver ultrasound scan was recommended but not obtained. A diagnosis of PCT was discussed with the patient. She was counseled on smoking cessation, limiting alcohol consumption, and photoprotection. She became distressed upon learning that estrogen may be contributing to her symptoms but ultimately decided to temporarily hold estrogen therapy. Hydroxychloroquine, 100 mg twice weekly, was initiated in lieu of repeated phlebotomy due to patient preference. She achieved clinical remission within 5 months without restricting her alcohol or tobacco use. At that time, estradiol was reintroduced via 0.025-mg patch twice weekly without recurrence.

### Ocular complications in 2 cases with porphyria [^d39f97c8]. Cornea (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

We aimed to report our observation regarding the long-term follow-up results of 2 cases with similar ophthalmic manifestations of 2 different porphyrias, congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), and porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT).

Methods

Both patients presented with ocular pain and photophobia in both eyes. The patient with CEP had a scleral necrosis of 3 mm in diameter at the lateral limbus of the right eye and medial limbus of the left eye, accompanied with cicatricial ectropion and lid swelling OU. The patient with PCT had scleral necrosis in the interpalpebral area nasally, OU.

Results

Both patients were followed-up for 4 years. The patients received intensive topical lubrication and topical and oral immune-suppressive medication. They underwent amniotic membrane grafting, when required, and were advised to wear UV glasses. The case with PCT followed a more salient course and remained symptom free until the end of the follow-up period. In contrast, the patient with CEP developed further scleral necrosis, despite the treatment and evisceration surgery were inevitable owing to endophthalmitis unresponsive to the treatment.

Conclusions

Ocular complications are rarely reported in porphyrias, and the studies on the long-term follow-up results are fewer. Despite careful follow-up and intensive treatment, scleral necrosis can be progressive and results in the loss of vision or even the loss of eye. Further studies regarding the care of patients with porphyrias are required to more effectively treat these rare ophthalmic conditions.

### Facial calcinosis cutis in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus: a case report of tissue injury owing to photosensitivity as the cause of dystrophic calcification [^f0444812]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Preauricular and scalp calcification is characteristic of the dystrophic calcification reported in porphyria cutanea tarda, another photosensitivity disorder. It has been hypothesized that inflammation and local tissue damage alters the physiologic mechanisms that normally inhibit calcification. Calcium then preferentially deposits at an anatomic site where tissue injury exists. Photosensitivity with sun-induced solar elastosis and elastic tissue damage in both SLE and porphyria cutanea tarda may explain the preferential deposition and unusual distribution of dystrophic calcinosis in this case of SLE and the one report of dystrophic calcinosis on the scalp of a patient with SLE.

Treatment options for dystrophic calcinosis are limited, and there is no universally accepted treatment algorithm. Case reports have shown variable success in management with diltiazem, topical/intralesional sodium thiosulfate, and surgical excision; however, no randomized controlled trials have analyzed outcome measures. Additional research to better understand the pathogenesis of this disorder should be pursued as more effective therapy is needed.

Methods

This was an institutional review board–approved clinical trial. Sequential patients with HS who presented to the Department of Dermatology, University of Pittsburgh, were enrolled. Treatment included 200-mg of hydroxychloroquine twice daily for 6 months. Patients were evaluated at baseline and at 3 and 6 months using Hurley staging (I-III), Sartorius scoring, and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) survey. Patients were allowed to continue topical therapies during treatment; however, no other oral or injectable HS treatments could be used. Participants had to be 18 years of age and had to be able to understand written informed consent. Patients could not have evidence of active infection, regardless of the degree of severity or localization. Patients with porphyria cutanea tarda, known retinal disease, psoriasis, or thrombocytopenia were excluded. Comparisons were to be performed using the 2-sided t test, with a P value of < .05 for statistical significance.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Best Practice Advice 1–6 for acute hepatic porphyrias (AHP) states that women aged 15–50 years with unexplained, recurrent severe abdominal pain after an initial workup should be considered for screening for an AHP; initial diagnosis of AHP should be made by biochemical testing measuring δ-aminolevulinic acid, porphobilinogen, and creatinine on a random urine sample; genetic testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of AHP in patients with positive biochemical testing; acute attacks of AHP that are severe enough to require hospital admission should be treated with intravenous hemin, given daily, preferably into a high-flow central vein; in addition to intravenous hemin, management of acute attacks of AHP should include pain control, antiemetics, and management of systemic arterial hypertension, tachycardia, hyponatremia, and hypomagnesemia, if present; and patients should be counseled to avoid identifiable triggers such as alcohol and porphyrinogenic medications.

### Variegate porphyria [^4610750a]. The Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Variegate porphyria is a rare, hereditary form of hepatic porphyria characterized by acute systemic symptoms as in acute intermittent porphyria in addition to cutaneous symptoms simulating porphyria cutanea tarda. We describe a 22-year-old female from India who first presented to the emergency department with acute symptoms and was later confirmed to have variegate porphyria.

### Successful radiation therapy for breast cancer in a patient with hereditary coproporphyria [^43040f0b]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The lack of any significantly acute side effects from our presented case supports the cautious use of RT in patients with porphyria. Longer-term follow-up is still needed to ensure the patient does not present with significant late outcomes, and the patient will be closely followed to monitor any new side effects. These present findings, combined with a review of the available literature, provide evidence for the effective use of RT in patients with porphyria, but with particular caution due to the limited data.

### Carbamazepine (Epitol) [^bbff0ac1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

Epitol has shown mild anticholinergic activity that may be associated with increased intraocular pressure; therefore, patients with increased intraocular pressure should be closely observed during therapy.

Because of the relationship of the drug to other tricyclic compounds, the possibility of activation of a latent psychosis and, in elderly patients, of confusion or agitation should be borne in mind.

The use of carbamazepine should be avoided in patients with a history of hepatic porphyria (e.g., acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda). Acute attacks have been reported in such patients receiving carbamazepine therapy. Carbamazepine administration has also been demonstrated to increase porphyrin precursors in rodents, a presumed mechanism for the induction of acute attacks of porphyria.

As with all antiepileptic drugs, Epitol should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency.

Hyponatremia can occur as a result of treatment with Epitol. In many cases, the hyponatremia appears to be caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The risk of developing SIADH with Epitol treatment appears to be dose-related. Elderly patients and patients treated with diuretics are at greater risk of developing hyponatremia. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, new or increased seizure frequency, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can lead to falls. Consider discontinuing Epitol in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^78c7c27c]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Best Practice Advice 6: Patients should be counseled to avoid identifiable triggers that may precipitate acute attacks, such as alcohol and porphyrinogenic medications.

The low penetrance of AHPs indicates the likely presence of additional factors that are required for clinical symptoms, including precipitating factors and other poorly defined modifying genes and/or epigenetic factors. Sex hormones, in particular progesterone, are known to precipitate attacks. Other common precipitating factors include medications that induce cytochrome P450, acute illness or infection, physical or psychological stress, excess alcohol intake, tobacco use, and caloric deprivation. These factors induce hepatocyte ALAS1 messenger RNA and protein expression.– All patients with AHP should be counseled to avoid identifiable triggers. Lists of safe and unsafe drugs are available online (and).

### Deferasirox for porphyria cutanea tarda: a pilot study… [^444ea3cc]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Author Affiliations: Department of Dermatology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas. Objective To determine the efficacy and safety of deferasirox in a pilot trial for the treatment of patients with porphyria cutanea tarda, the most common of the porphyrias and often difficult to treat. Main Outcome Measure The improvement in number of blisters at the end of the 6-month treatment period was assessed. Results Of 10 patients, 8 completed the study. Seven had resolution of blistering, 6 had a reduction in urinary porphyrin levels, and 7 had a reduction in ferritin levels. The treatment was well tolerated. Conclusions In this small pilot study, deferasirox induced improvement in cutaneous findings of PCT in 8 patients who completed 6 months of treatment.

Most patients also had a substantial reduction in urinary porphyrin and ferritin levels. Future larger controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings. Deferasirox may be a useful alternative to existing treatment modalities for PCT. The main clinical end point in the treatment of PCT is the reduction of symptomatic skin lesions. This is accomplished by the use of photoprotective clothing, zinc and titanium dioxide-containing sunscreens, therapeutic phlebotomy, and antimalarial medications. The relationship between the development of blisters and iron metabolism is not straightforward. Chronic iron overload is a serious complication of lifesaving blood transfusions, often requiring chelation therapy. The standard for iron chelation therapy for many years was deferoxamine mesylate; however, this treatment requires slow subcutaneous or intravenous infusion over 8 to 12 hours, 5 to 7 days per week; therefore, compliance is often poor.

4 Deferasirox is an oral medication approved for. Iron chelation therapy has infrequently been used in the treatment of PCT. Slow infusion of subcutaneous desferrioxamine, an iron chelator, has been reported to reduce iron stores in patients with PCT when given 5 days per week for 11 months, but again, this form of treatment is prolonged and cumbersome for patients. 7 The present trial was undertaken to determine if oral deferasirox could be useful in the treatment of PCT.

### A rare case of porphyria cutanea tarda in a patient with a homozygous hereditary hemochromatosis gene H63D mutation in the setting of hereditary hemochromatosis [^78a6a2b6]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT) is the most common cutaneous porphyria and manifests as photosensitivity, blistering, skin fragility, erosions, milia, and crusts on sun-exposed body areas.PCT is a hepatocutaneous disease of heme synthesis in which uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) has reduced activity, resulting in the accumulation of porphyrins and heme intermediates in the liver and skin. Alcohol consumption, tobacco use, estrogen therapy, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus infections, iron overload, hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), and polychlorinated hydrocarbons are all established causes of PCT., We present a case of PCT in a patient found to be homozygous for the hereditary hemochromatosis gene (HFE) H63D mutation in the setting of previously undiagnosed HH. Though the association between PCT and HH is well known, the association with the HFE H63D mutation, to our knowledge, has only been reported once in the medical literature.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^a0e6d1bc]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyrias (AHP) — epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, and management are outlined as follows: acute intermittent porphyria is the most common AHP with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 in 100,000; the major clinical presentation involves attacks of severe pain, usually abdominal and generalized, without peritoneal signs or abnormalities on cross-sectional imaging, occurring mainly in women in their childbearing years, and AHP should be considered especially in women aged 15–50 years with recurrent severe abdominal pain not ascribable to common causes; patients with elevations in urinary porphobilinogen and/or δ-aminolevulinic acid should initially be presumed to have AHP; the cornerstones of management include discontinuation of porphyrinogenic drugs and chemicals, administration of oral or intravenous dextrose and intravenous hemin, and use of analgesics and antiemetics; diagnosis can be confirmed after initial treatment by testing for pathogenic variants in HMBS, CPOX, PPOX, and ALAD; AHP is associated with chronic symptoms and long-term risks including systemic arterial hypertension, chronic renal and liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma; and liver transplantation is curative and reserved for patients with intractable symptoms who have failed other treatment options.

### Three cases of incident lichen planus after direct-acting antiviral treatment for hepatitis C [^f753a719]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with many extrahepatic manifestations, including skin diseases such as lichen planus (LP). New direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents are highly effective in treating HCV, and many extrahepatic manifestations of HCV improve after treatment. However, limited data exist regarding outcomes of HCV-associated skin disease after DAA treatment. Case reports and series have documented HCV-associated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, porphyria cutanea tarda, and oral and cutaneous LP, improving or resolving after DAA treatment. Conversely, new-onset LP developing 3 months after HCV treatment with elbasvir-grazoprevir was recently described, and a patient with pre-existing oral LP who had new cutaneous LP after treatment with ledipasvir-sofosbuvir was also reported. We present 3 patients in whom new LP developed within months after treatment of HCV with DAA. With these cases, we highlight the need to further understand the connection between HCV and LP.

### Chronic hand eczema [^965ecfd1]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Examination

Clinical examination requires the inspection of the hands as well as the whole skin, especially the feet. The clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis of CHE are broad and comprise a whole spectrum of different entities such as psoriasis, lichen planus, tinea manuum, secondary syphilis, scabies, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, drug eruption, pityriasis rubra pilaris, porphyria cutanea tarda, palmoplantar keratodermas, and Bowen´s disease.

Diagnosing CHE should always include the subjective perception of the patient and the individual's opinion on its cause. This may help to identify unexpected or unusual etiologies, especially in contact dermatitis. A recent study showed that the patient's perspective and the assessment of the individual disease in daily dermatological care of CHE differs between patients and dermatologists.

Diagnostic Tests

Assessment of exposure to contact allergens and irritants, qualitatively and quantitatively, is important to facilitate planning of skin test strategies, make a correct diagnosis, and establish preventive measures and a treatment plan.

### IgM-mediated epidermolysis bullosa acquisita [^6a3ae7d3]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

EBA must be differentiated from other disorders as there may be clinical overlap with other blistering diseases such as porphyria cutanea tarda, bullous pemphigoid, and dermatitis herpetiformis. In our case, the normal 24-hour urine porphyrin levels ruled out porphyria cutanea tarda. Dermatitis herpetiformis was excluded as the symmetric pruritic papulovesicular eruption on extensor surfaces was absent as was the histologic picture of neutrophilic microabscess formation and DIF IgA basement membrane and papillary dermal staining. The paucicellular subepidermal blister, lack of IgG and C3 DIF basement staining together with negative autoantibody testing for BP180 and BP230 would rule out bullous pemphigoid in our patient.

Our case highlights the importance of DIF in detecting immunobullous diseases as well as differentiating EBA from other autoimmune subepidermal bullous diseases. Standard ELISA serum testing for antibody to type VII collagen and regular indirect immunofluorescence would be negative as both tests use labeled antihuman IgG and do not specifically test for IgM in serum. Our case is similar to the 2 previous cases of IgM-mediated EBA and may represent a subtype of that disease with mechanobullous features. A significant difference was our patient's refractory response to treatment and further study will be needed to provide data-driven treatment for this rare subset.

### Carbamazepine (Tegretol) [^0277a41f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Tegretol has shown mild anticholinergic activity that may be associated with increased intraocular pressure; therefore, patients with increased intraocular pressure should be closely observed during therapy.

Because of the relationship of the drug to other tricyclic compounds, the possibility of activation of a latent psychosis and, in elderly patients, of confusion or agitation should be borne in mind.

The use of Tegretol should be avoided in patients with a history of hepatic porphyria (e.g., acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda). Acute attacks have been reported in such patients receiving Tegretol therapy. Carbamazepine administration has also been demonstrated to increase porphyrin precursors in rodents, a presumed mechanism for the induction of acute attacks of porphyria.

As with all antiepileptic drugs, Tegretol should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency.

Hyponatremia can occur as a result of treatment with Tegretol. In many cases, the hyponatremia appears to be caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The risk of developing SIADH with Tegretol treatment appears to be dose-related. Elderly patients and patients treated with diuretics are at greater risk of developing hyponatremia. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, new or increased seizure frequency, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can lead to falls.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^4acbd356]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) — non-viral and hepatitis B virus (HBV)–related risk factors: Non-viral causes associated with an increased risk for HCC include cirrhosis from any cause and inherited metabolic disorders (hereditary hemochromatosis, porphyria cutanea tarda, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency), Wilson's disease, and stage IV primary biliary cirrhosis; alcoholic cirrhosis is a well-known risk factor. An estimated 60% to 80% of persons with HCC have underlying cirrhosis, possibly approaching 90% in the United States. Certain HBV-infected populations have increased HCC risk even without cirrhosis, with annual incidence in inactive HBV without cirrhosis less than 0.3%; risk in HBV carriers is higher with active viral replication, high HBV DNA, or family history, and Asian males ≥ 40 years, Asian females ≥ 50 years, and Black/African American males and females with hepatitis B are also at increased risk. Although chronic liver disease represents a risk for development of HCC, HCC may also develop in patients with normal livers and no known risk factors.

### Psychiatric signs and symptoms in treatable inborn errors of metabolism [^2fdf3892]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment

Recognition and avoidance of precipitating events is a key initial part of treatment. Acute attacks of hepatic porphyrias should be treated by providing sufficient amounts of carbohydrate-derived calories (e.g. by glucose infusion), and intravenous infusion of hematin. Hemolytic anemia in erythropoietic porphyrias may be treated by blood transfusion. Cutaneous photosensitivity of erythropoietic protoporphyria may be treated using oral β-carotene, while photosensitivity associated with PCT can be treated by phlebotomy or oral chloroquine. Liver transplantation can be temporarily beneficial, but transplanted livers are susceptible to protoporphyrin-induced damage. Avoiding precipitating factors such as the use of illicit drugs, excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, and severe calorie restriction can help to prevent attacks. Additionally the maintenance of a regular, balanced diet, prompt treatment of infections, and reduction of stress can further reduce attacks.

### The cutaneous porphyrias [^aacc3935]. Dermatologic Clinics (2014). Low credibility.

The porphyrias are a group of mainly inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis where accumulation of porphyrins and/or porphyrin precursors gives rise to 2 types of clinical presentation: cutaneous photosensitivity and/or acute neurovisceral attacks. The cutaneous porphyrias present with either bullous skin fragility or nonbullous acute photosensitivity. This review discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, laboratory diagnosis, complications, and current approach to porphyria management. Although focusing mainly on their dermatological aspects, the article also covers the management of acute porphyria, which by virtue of its association with variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria, may become the responsibility of the clinical dermatologist.

Case report

A 21-year-old Caucasian male was referred to dermatology for a 3-month history of recurring, asymptomatic blisters on his hands and fingers. He had no history of chronic conditions and did not take any daily medications. Physical examination revealed non-inflammatory vesicles on his dorsal hands with hyperemic scars and crusting on his dorsal fingers (Fig 1). The differential diagnosis included PCT, bullous impetigo, immunobullous disorder, and phytophotodermatitis.

Fig 1
Numerous small noninflammatory vesicles are present on the patient's left hand, along with hyperemic scars and some crusting on the dorsal fingers.

A punch biopsy showed a cell-poor subepidermal split affecting acral skin with festooning of the dermal papillae and perivascular hyaline cuffing within the dermal papillae. Hyalinized material and dyskeratoic cells were noted in the overlying epidermis, forming "caterpillar bodies" (Fig 2). A periodic acid-Schiff stain highlighted the hyalinized perivascular cuffs in the papillary dermis, "caterpillar bodies" within the epidermis, and a thickened basement membrane (Fig 3). Uroporphyrins were elevated at 1093 μg/L, consistent with the diagnosis of PCT. Screening tests for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus were negative. Given the patient's age and no other predisposing factors, genetic testing for HH was performed, and a homozygous H63D mutation in the HFE gene was found using polymerase chain reaction amplification followed by restriction enzyme digestion analysis.

### Down-regulation of hepcidin in porphyria cutanea tarda [^81563e7b]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

Hepatic siderosis is common in patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). Mutations in the hereditary hemochromatosis (hh) gene (HFE) explain the siderosis in approximately 20% patients, suggesting that the remaining occurrences result from additional genetic and environmental factors. Two genes known to modify iron loading in hh are hepcidin (HAMP) and hemojuvelin (HJV). To determine if mutations in or expression of these genes influenced iron overload in PCT, we compared sequences of HAMP and HJV in 96 patients with PCT and 88 HFE C282Y homozygotes with marked hepatic iron overload. We also compared hepatic expression of these and other iron-related genes in a group of patients with PCT and hh. Two intronic polymorphisms in HJV were associated with elevated serum ferritin in HFE C282Y homozygotes. No exonic polymorphisms were identified. Sequencing of HAMP revealed exonic polymorphisms in 2 patients with PCT: heterozygosity for a G→ A transition (G71D substitution) in one and heterozygosity for an A→ G transition (K83R substitution) in the other. Hepatic HAMP expression in patients with PCT was significantly reduced, regardless of HFE genotype, when compared with patients with hh but without PCT with comparable iron overload. These data indicate that the hepatic siderosis associated with PCT likely results from dysregulated HAMP.

Acute hepatic porphyrias (AHPs) — renal involvement and monitoring — In the EXPLORE natural history cohort of patients with recurrent AHP attacks, 68% experienced reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during the study and 28% met the criteria for stage 3a, 3b, or 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on eGFR levels; importantly, therapeutic interventions such as givosiran may be associated with worsening eGFR and renal function in a subset of patients. Based on these findings, serum creatinine and eGFR should be monitored at least annually in patients with AHP and more frequently in patients receiving givosiran, and optimal control of systemic arterial hypertension is recommended to prevent additional renal risks.

Table 3
Principal Clinical Features in Hereditary Hemochromatosis

Table 4
Prevalence of C282Y Homozygotes Without Iron Overload in Large Screening Studies

When patients present with symptoms, hemochromatosis should be considered when there are complaints of fatigue, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, arthralgias, (typically of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints), chondrocalcinosis, impotence, decreased libido, and symptoms of heart failure or diabetes (Table 5). Similarly, physical findings of an enlarged liver, particularly in the presence of cirrhosis, extrahepatic manifestations of chronic liver disease, testicular atrophy, congestive heart failure, skin pigmentation, changes of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), or arthritis should raise the suspicion of hemochromatosis (Table 6). Many of these features are indicative of disease processes other than hemochromatosis, but the thoughtful clinician will make sure that hemochromatosis has been considered when patients who exhibit these symptoms or signs are seen. Currently, most new patients with HH come to medical attention because of screening, such as in family studies, or by evaluation of abnormal laboratory studies by primary care physicians. In older series of patients with HH, when patients were identified by symptoms or physical findings of the disease, women typically presented approximately 10 years later than men, and there were approximately 10 times as many men presenting as women. This sex difference is likely because of menstrual blood loss and maternal iron loss during pregnancy having a "protective" effect for women. More recently, with a greater proportion of patients identified by screening studies, the age of diagnosis for women and men has equalized, and the numbers of men and women identified are roughly equivalent. Nonetheless, the proportion of C282Y homozygous women with definite disease manifestations (e.g. liver disease, arthritis) is significantly lower than men (1% versus 25%, respectively).

Recommendations:

1. We recommend that patients with abnormal iron studies should be evaluated as patients with hemochromatosis, even in the absence of symptoms. (A)

2. All patients with evidence of liver disease should be evaluated for hemochromatosis. (1B)
