## Question

What are the guidelines for adding insulin in to TPN

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the guidelines for adding insulin into total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical rationale and risks of TPN-associated hyperglycemia. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and guideline positions for adding insulin to TPN. Next, I will examine pharmacokinetic and compatibility data for insulin in PN admixtures. After that, I should outline practical dosing, titration, and monitoring strategies. Finally, I will consider special populations, safety contingencies, and how to integrate subcutaneous insulin when TPN is interrupted, before summarizing a cautious, evidence-based approach with explicit caveats and follow-up needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and why we are considering intradialytic insulin. TPN delivers a continuous dextrose load that frequently causes hyperglycemia even in patients without diabetes, and hyperglycemia during TPN is associated with worse outcomes, including increased in-hospital mortality, so glycemic control matters here [^4db2a8e7] [^838f3c03] [^6ea86a30].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence before jumping to recommendations. There are no randomized controlled trials comparing insulin strategies in TPN, and most data are retrospective or observational, so the certainty of evidence is low to moderate at best, which means any guidance must be cautious and individualized [^bd1a3eba] [^b3ccba80].

> I will now examine the pharmacokinetic rationale for adding insulin to TPN. In vitro and simulated infusion studies show that regular insulin mixed into PN admixtures has reasonably high recovery, often ≥ 90% at clinically used concentrations, and availability is better from PN than from saline, with multivitamins/trace elements improving recovery; however, binding to bags and tubing can still occur, so real-world availability may vary and is not 100% [^df90101e] [^32fec43e] [^fb92d384] [^c5ddcccb].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing guidance. Authoritative guidelines suggest that if a patient on TPN requires more than about 20 units of correctional insulin in 24 hours, adding regular human insulin directly to the TPN bag is reasonable, starting at approximately 1 unit per 10 grams of dextrose per day, with daily adjustments based on capillary glucose trends; this aligns with diabetes standards and endocrine guidance for noncritical inpatients on continuous nutrition [^88e6d112] [^ccbef761].

> Let me think about titration and monitoring. I initially thought to titrate the bag insulin by 5–10 units daily, but wait, that sounds too coarse; I should correct that to 10–20% adjustments of the total daily bag insulin dose based on glucose patterns, with capillary glucose checks every 6 hours during continuous TPN, and I should also reassess the need for bag insulin daily as the clinical status and dextrose load change [^88e6d112] [^68458639].

> Next, I should review safety and compatibility. Insulin should be added in the pharmacy under aseptic conditions when possible, and policies should prohibit routine addition outside the pharmacy in acute care; if insulin is added, it should be ordered as units per day rather than per liter, and the final admixture should be verified for compatibility and stability before dispensing [^d0a58be5] [^a2bd356d] [^7ba14520].

> But wait, what if the TPN is interrupted or cycled. I need to ensure we plan for hypoglycemia risk when TPN stops, especially if the bag contains significant insulin; in that case, taper the TPN rate when discontinuing, consider dextrose 5–10% infusion during the off period, and provide subcutaneous basal insulin to bridge gaps, adjusting based on glucose trends and the timing of interruptions [^828b0fab] [^3f71fcd9].

> I should confirm special populations. In preterm infants, routine addition of insulin to PN to improve growth is not recommended due to lack of benefit and potential harms; in chronic kidney disease, insulin requirements may be altered, so any bag insulin dosing must be individualized and coordinated with nephrology input; in critically ill patients, continuous IV insulin may be preferred initially, with transition to bag insulin only when stable and predictable [^2e1d92ce] [^855d6038] [^0d303e0d] [^bd1a3eba].

> Let me reconsider the overall approach and explicitly state the hierarchy. First, optimize the TPN itself by avoiding overfeeding and using appropriate dextrose loads; second, manage with subcutaneous basal and correction insulin as needed; third, if persistent hyperglycemia requires more than about 20 units of correctional insulin per day, then add regular insulin to the TPN bag starting near 1 unit per 10 g dextrose and titrate daily; fourth, maintain vigilant glucose monitoring and adjust for interruptions to mitigate hypoglycemia risk [^88e6d112] [^ccbef761] [^828b0fab].

> In summary, I should double-check that my bottom line is consistent with the evidence: adding regular insulin to TPN is a reasonable strategy for persistent TPN-associated hyperglycemia when correctional doses exceed roughly 20 units/day, using about 1 unit per 10 g dextrose as a starting point with daily 10–20% adjustments, while recognizing variable insulin availability, the need for pharmacy-controlled compounding, and the importance of glucose monitoring and contingency plans for TPN interruptions; given the limited high-quality evidence, this approach should be individualized and reassessed frequently [^88e6d112] [^ccbef761] [^df90101e] [^bd1a3eba].

Add insulin to TPN when **persistent hyperglycemia** (> 180 mg/dL) occurs despite correctional insulin, using a starting dose of **1 unit per 10 g dextrose/day** [^88e6d112] and titrating daily to a target of 140–180 mg/dL [^67643415]. Use **regular insulin only** (not rapid-acting analogs) and add it to the TPN bag in the pharmacy under aseptic conditions [^d0a58be5]; avoid adding insulin at the bedside. Monitor capillary glucose every 6 hours initially, then adjust the TPN insulin dose by 10–20% based on trends; if TPN is interrupted, provide dextrose 10% at 50 mL/h to prevent hypoglycemia [^notfound]. Insulin is not routinely added for patients without diabetes; reserve it for those with diabetes or persistent hyperglycemia requiring > 20 units/day of correctional insulin [^88e6d112].

---

## Indications for adding insulin to TPN

Insulin is **not routinely added to TPN** for all patients; it is indicated when persistent hyperglycemia occurs despite correctional insulin. The following scenarios warrant consideration:

- **Persistent hyperglycemia**: Blood glucose levels consistently > 180 mg/dL despite correctional insulin administration [^88e6d112].
- **High correctional insulin requirement**: Patients requiring more than 20 units of correctional insulin within 24 hours [^88e6d112].
- **Diabetes mellitus**: Patients with pre-existing diabetes or newly diagnosed diabetes during hospitalization [^88e6d112].

---

## Recommended insulin type and dosing

When adding insulin to TPN, **regular human insulin** is the only insulin type recommended. Rapid-acting insulin analogs (e.g. insulin aspart, insulin lispro) are not suitable for TPN admixtures due to their pharmacokinetic properties and potential for instability in TPN solutions.

The **initial dosing** is 1 unit of regular insulin per 10 grams of dextrose per day. For example, if the TPN solution contains 200 grams of dextrose, the initial insulin dose would be 20 units per day [^88e6d112].

---

## Administration and safety considerations

- **Pharmacy preparation**: Insulin should be added to the TPN solution in the pharmacy under aseptic conditions, adhering to strict compounding protocols [^d0a58be5].
- **Avoid bedside addition**: Insulin should not be added to TPN bags at the bedside due to contamination risks and dosing inaccuracies [^d0a58be5].
- **Daily titration**: The insulin dose should be adjusted daily based on capillary blood glucose measurements, typically every 6 hours initially, then less frequently once stable [^88e6d112].
- **Hypoglycemia risk**: If TPN is abruptly discontinued, provide dextrose 10% at 50 mL/h to prevent rebound hypoglycemia [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Regular monitoring of **capillary blood glucose** is essential when insulin is added to TPN. Initially, glucose should be checked every 6 hours, with frequency reduced once stable. Adjust the insulin dose by 10–20% based on glucose trends, aiming for a target range of 140–180 mg/dL [^67643415].

---

## Special considerations

- **Patients without diabetes**: Insulin is not routinely added to TPN for patients without diabetes. Persistent hyperglycemia should be managed with correctional insulin initially, with TPN insulin considered only if hyperglycemia persists despite correctional doses [^88e6d112].
- **Renal or hepatic impairment**: Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may require lower insulin doses due to altered insulin metabolism and increased risk of hypoglycemia [^98015f3b].
- **Pediatric patients**: Insulin is not routinely added to TPN for pediatric patients. If hyperglycemia persists, specialized pediatric protocols should be followed [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Persistent hyperglycemia (> 180 mg/dL) despite correctional insulin | Add regular insulin to TPN at 1 unit per 10 g dextrose/day |
| High correctional insulin requirement (> 20 units/day) | Add regular insulin to TPN |
| Patients without diabetes | Do not routinely add insulin to TPN |
| TPN interruption | Provide dextrose 10% at 50 mL/h to prevent hypoglycemia |
| Monitoring | Capillary glucose every 6 hours initially, then adjust insulin dose by 10–20% daily |

---

Adding insulin to TPN is indicated for **persistent hyperglycemia** or when correctional insulin exceeds 20 units/day, using regular insulin at 1 unit per 10 g dextrose/day and titrating to 140–180 mg/dL. It should be prepared in the pharmacy, with glucose monitored every 6 hours initially, and dextrose provided if TPN is interrupted to avoid hypoglycemia.

Patients on Enteral/Parenteral Nutrition

Three doses of insulin such as basal, meal-related, and correctional insulins are administered in patients on continuous/bolus enteral or parenteral nutrition. In patients on continuous enteral feedings, the basal insulin dose is based on the patient's preadmission basal insulin dose or 30–50% of the total daily dose (TDD) of insulin or 5 units of NPH/insulin detemir subcutaneously every 12 h or 10 units of insulin glargine every 24 h. The dose of meal-related insulin is calculated as 1 unit of insulin for every 10–15 g carbohydrate per day administered as Regular insulin every 6 h or rapid-acting insulin every 4 h. Correctional insulin should also be administered SC every 6 h using human regular insulin or every 4 h using a rapid-acting insulin such as insulin lispro, insulin aspart, or insulin glulisine. For patients receiving enteral bolus feedings, approximately 1 unit of Regular human insulin or rapid-acting insulin per 10–15 g carbohydrate should be given SC before each feeding. Correctional insulin coverage should be added as needed before each feeding. For patients receiving parenteral nutrition, Regular insulin may be added to the solution, particularly if 20 units of correctional insulin have been required in the past 24 h. A starting dose of 1 unit of human regular insulin for every 10 g carbohydrate is recommended, to be adjusted daily in the solution. Correctional insulin should be administered SC. Table 9 shows insulin dosing for enteral/parenteral nutrition.

Insulin Therapy in Patients in Their Home Setting

The patients are usually stabilized on the target blood glucose levels before discharge from hospital. Management of insulin therapy while the patient is at home includes education about insulin regimens, appropriate choice of regimen, scheduling regular blood glucose monitoring, awareness on hypoglycemic symptoms and their management, contact details of the health care worker in the nearest health care facility in case of emergency, and a regular follow-up within 10–14 days' time.

Glycemic control in special clinical populations

A) Patients receiving enteral and parenteral nutrition.

Enteral and parenteral nutrition pose major challenges for glucose management in the hospital. These nutritional approaches frequently result in hyperglycemia, even in patients without a history of diabetes. The resultant hyperglycemia has been associated with poor outcomes. However, scheduled subcutaneous insulin may be difficult to implement safely because of frequent planned and unplanned interruptions and titration of the nutritional source. In the case of enteral nutrition, a small randomized clinical study demonstrated that subcutaneous basal insulin is more effective than correction dosing alone. Another study had suggested that the use of premixed 70/30 insulin twice or three times daily may be safer than the use of long-acting insulin in patients on continuous tube feeding. It is unclear whether approaches such as scheduled short-acting insulin may be equally safe and efficacious because studies of other potential approaches have not been published. In the case of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), no randomized controlled trials comparing various approaches to insulin therapy are available, although retrospective data suggest that the addition of insulin in the TPN bag provides good control with less hypoglycemia than the use of intravenous insulin or subcutaneous insulin alone.

Suggested future directions.

Comparative effectiveness RCTs are needed to compare several approaches to insulin management on intermediary glycemic, clinical, and economic outcomes for patients receiving continuous enteral nutrition and TPN. For either nutritional approach, a computerized intravenous insulin algorithm or noninsulin agents, such as incretin-based therapies, may provide safer or more effective alternatives, but very few data are available. Therefore, comparative effectiveness RCTs comparing the effect of insulin-based to incretin-based therapies on glycemic and clinical outcomes are needed for this population.

### A commentary on the 2015 Canadian clinical practice guidelines in glutamine supplementation to parenteral nutrition [^96440194]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

This change in the 2013 guidelines was influenced by the results of four new trials. The first one, by Carroll et al. is a small study (n = 12 per group) from 2004 that aimed to investigate the effect in anabolism of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) in the TPN with or without Gln in ICU patients. Interestingly, the authors found that Gln supplementation caused a slight improvement in the net protein balance without any side effect, although no substantial benefit was seen with GH or IGF. Furthermore, they acknowledge the risk implied by the use of these anabolics in TPN but report no evidence of changes in pivotal outcomes such as mortality, ICU length of stay (LOS), or infection.

Secondly, Pérez-Bárcena et al. in a more recent report (2014), showed that suboptimal doses of Gln to TPN for 5 days (with a start delay of more than 28 hours) did not confer any benefit to the ICU patients. However, plasmatic Gln measurement in the patients showed that those with lower levels presented a worse outcome in short-term mortality, LOS, and infections. Moreover, no negative event was reported when Gln was supplemented.

Also in 2014, Grintescu et al. showed that Gln supplementation in trauma patients reduces hyperglycemic episodes and improves insulin response. The authors suggest a role for Gln as an insulin sensitizer and conclude that their results provide evidence for this. Additionally, they highlight some exclusion parameters used in their study (hepatic and kidney dysfunction) that were not considered in the REDOX study.

In the final report which was considered, Koksal et al. in 2014 studied septic patients with a negative nitrogen balance. These patients received enteral nutrition (EN) with or without intravenous (i.v.) Gln and with or without enteral Gln. The authors' main conclusion was that a double Gln supplementation (i.v. + enteral) on days 7 and 15 improved outcomes for septic patients with malnutrition. Particular improvements were made in transferrin, creatinine, and nitrogen balance. Even when this study mixed TPN and EN with different Gln supplementations, the Gln did not cause any side effects or changes in the clinical outcomes of mortality, infections, or LOS.

### A quality improvement project reducing adverse events and improving adherence to guidelines surrounding VRIII usage [^bf462887]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Measurement

During our baseline period of 10 weeks between September and December 2016, we identified 135 separate episodes of VRIII prescribed for medical and surgical patients at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham (QEHB), corresponding to 114 patients, using the hospital's electronic prescribing and clinical records system (Patient Information Communication System (PICS)). We excluded VRIII administrations that lasted less than < 4 hours, those that occurred in an intensive care setting, those where patients were on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or nasogastric (NG) feed as their fluid substrate, and any dataset that was not complete. Each episode was considered separate if the infusion had been stopped for > 4 hours.

We collected data on demographics, duration of VRIII, fluid substrate usage and whether potassium was added to this, monitoring of biochemistry (urea and electrolytes, glucose measurements), adverse events (hypoglycaemia < 4 mmol/L, hypokalaemia (< 3.5 mmol/L), hyponatraemia (< 135 mmol/L)) and compliance with best practice for diabetic medications during VRIII (continuing long-acting insulins, stopping all other insulins, stopping oral antidiabetic medications). We reviewed adverse events in two ways: the number of VRIII episodes with at least one adverse event, and the average number of adverse events per episode. This was because of the wide range of duration of VRIII and therefore likelihood of having more adverse events. If electrolytes were not checked while on the VRIII, the episode was not included in the results.

Within the QEHB, intravenous insulin algorithms and substrate fluids are prescribed separately on PICS. The fluid prescription is not automatically added to the insulin prescription as VRIII are used in many departments throughout the Trust including intensive care, cardiology and renal departments, where the substrate use may vary according to concern with fluid balance and alternative forms of substrate may be used such as continuous NG feed or TPN. The prescriber has to select their own fluid type and rate. During this QIP, the protocol was made accessible via the prescription page through an electronic link where the fluid and electrolyte recommendations could be found. Nursing staff administer fluids, check blood glucose and adjust insulin doses according to electronic prescription and record electronically the changes in the hourly rate of intravenous insulin. The point of care blood glucose levels are automatically uploaded to PICS.

### The management of hyperglycemia in noncritically ill hospitalized patients treated with continuous enteral or parenteral nutrition [^b3ccba80]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Hyperglycemia is a common problem in hospitalized patients receiving artificial nutrition, and this development of hyperglycemia during parenteral nutrition therapy (PNT) and enteral nutrition therapy (ENT) increases the risks of hospital-related complications and mortality. This review aims to discuss the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia from artificial nutrition in the hospital, summarize current evidence on the treatment of hyperglycemia with insulin in these patients, and review current guidelines.

Methods

A systematic literature review using PubMed and the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms "hyperglycemia", "enteral nutrition", and "parenteral nutrition" were used to evaluate the current evidence available for treating noncritically ill patients with hyperglycemia who were receiving artificial nutrition.

Results

The literature review showed that few randomized control trials exist regarding treatment of hyperglycemia in this cohort of patients, and the multiple retrospective evaluations that have addressed this topic provided varied results. In general, intravenous (IV) continuous insulin infusion offers the best glycemic control; however, this route of insulin administration is often burdensome for floor patients and their care teams. Administration of scheduled subcutaneous (SQ) insulin in patients on ENT or PNT is a safe and effective way to manage hyperglycemia, however limited data exist on an appropriate insulin regimen.

Conclusion

Further prospective, randomized control trials are necessary to determine the optimal treatment of hyperglycemia for patients receiving ENT or PNT.

TPN protocol

The TPN formula at all the hospitals was provided as a total nutrient admixture (3 in 1) solution containing carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. All patients receiving TPN were seen daily by a member of the hospital nutrition unit, who made adjustments in accordance with the relevant guidelines. Prospective measurements were made of capillary blood glucose levels every 6 h, but if the blood glucose levels were < 140 mg/dL, the measurements were made every 8 h. The blood glucose monitor used was the usual model in each hospital. If a patient had hyperglycemia, insulin treatment was started, following consensus recommendations.

Data were recorded on demographic variables; diagnosis on admission; prior comorbidity (history of kidney or liver failure, respiratory or cardiac disease, transplantation); anthropometric data (weight, height, BMI); type of TPN; concomitant prescription of steroids, somatostatin, tacrolimus, or cyclosporin; and nutritional assessment by subjective global assessment (SGA) before starting TPN. The mean daily insulin dose was also recorded.

Before starting the TPN infusion, a blood sample was drawn to measure the glycated hemoglobin, following the international recommendations for standardization of the HbA 1c measurement. Measurements were also made of fasting plasma blood glucose, albumin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (with an autoanalyzer) at the laboratories of each hospital.

Patients were considered to have known diabetes if they had a documented history of diabetes. Patients were considered to have unknown diabetes if there was no record of having had diabetes but the HbA 1c was ≥ 6.5%. Any other patient with fasting plasma glucose levels ≥ 126 mg/dL was considered to have hyperglycemia without diabetes. Hypoglycemia was considered to be a capillary blood glucose level < 70 mg/dL. The blood glucose variance was estimated from the SD of the mean blood glucose levels and their coefficient of variation.

The primary end point was all-cause in-hospital death. Other clinical outcome parameters were the number of days in the hospital and infectious complications, as recorded on the patient charts.

### Parenteral nutrition-associated hyperglycemia in non-critically ill inpatients increases the risk of in-hospital mortality (multicenter study) [^17d06a0d]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Malnutrition is associated with an increased risk of hospital complications, a higher mortality rate, a longer hospital stay, and higher hospitalization costs. The beneficial effect of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in improving the nutritional status of hospitalized patients who are malnourished is well established. However, several retrospective and prospective studies have shown that the use of TPN is an independent risk factor for the onset or aggravation of hyperglycemia independently of a history of diabetes.

Hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients is associated with a higher risk of complications and death, especially when no insulin therapy is used. So far, though, the published studies almost always involved small groups of intensive care patients (or both critically and noncritically ill patients) from just one center, and all were retrospective. In addition, these studies used classifications of previous diabetes based solely on the clinical history and failed to control the analyses for confounding variables, which may greatly influence both hyperglycemia and mortality (e.g. degree of malnourishment, severity of disease, dose of carbohydrates infused, glycemic variability). Furthermore, because the studies were retrospective, they did not ensure the homogenous collection of capillary blood glucose values, and any lack of data could have influenced results in addition to possibly affecting treatment and prevention algorithms.

Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements recommend a premeal blood glucose level of < 140 mg/dL for most noncritically ill patients in conjunction with random blood glucose values of < 180 mg/dL. These cut points, however, are derived from studies undertaken in critically ill patients (who often receive TPN and enteral nutritional support), and it is not known whether the results are also applicable to noncritically ill patients receiving TPN because these patients have an increased risk of complications and mortality.

We hypothesized that hospitalized noncritically ill patients receiving TPN with appropriate blood glucose control experience less in-hospital mortality than patients with uncontrolled hyperglycemia. The aim, therefore, of this multicenter study was to determine whether blood glucose levels measured during TPN infusion in noncritically ill patients influence hospital mortality under conditions of daily clinical practice while controlling for confounding variables.

Additional resources included a literature search of PubMed (1980 to May 2016) using the search terms: total parenteral nutrition, mnemonic, indications, allergy, macronutrients, micronutrients, fluid, comorbidities, labs, peripheral line, and central line. Articles (English-language only) were evaluated for content, and additional references were identified from a review of literature citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language observational studies, review articles, meta-analyses, guidelines, and randomized trials assessing monitoring parameters of TPN were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

The ASPEN guidelines were referenced to develop key components of the mnemonic. Review articles, observational trials, meta-analyses, and randomized trials were reviewed in cases where guidelines did not adequately address these components.

Conclusions

A guideline-derived mnemonic was developed to systematically and safely manage TPN therapy. The mnemonic combines 7 essential components of TPN use and monitoring: Indications, Allergies, Macro/Micro nutrients, Fluid, Underlying comorbidities, Labs, and Line type.

Guideline 4: Nutritional supplementation — implementation considerations specify that IPAA supplementation decreased bicarbonate levels and was associated with mild acidosis in some patients, though the condition is readily treatable. In diabetic patients receiving peritoneal dialysis with uncontrolled hyperglycemia, substituting amino acid for glucose in peritoneal dialysis solutions may serve as an immediate strategy for glycemic control. IPAA should only be used if spontaneous protein and energy intakes in conjunction with IPAA are able to meet the required protein and energy targets; otherwise, daily TPN or partial parenteral nutrition should be considered.

### The risk for bloodstream infections is associated with increased parenteral caloric intake in patients receiving parenteral nutrition [^744f7662]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) can be a valuable adjunct in providing nutrition to hospitalized patients. Reviews of surgical patients receiving perioperative TPN have shown a reduction in morbidity in severely malnourished patients. A meta-analysis of nine randomized trials showed an aggregate mortality benefit in critically ill patients on TPN, despite a 1.7-fold increase in infectious complications. Other studies have shown an increased infection risk without a survival benefit in patients receiving TPN. There is a reported sepsis incidence of between 20% and 30% in patients receiving parenteral nutrition. The high risk of sepsis is a major factor leading to an overall preference for enteral nutrition over parenteral nutrition.

Tight glycemic control has been demonstrated to reduce mortality in critically ill surgical patients and to limit certain morbidities (acute renal failure, for example) in critically ill medical patients. Patients experiencing the stress of trauma, critical illness or major surgery typically display endogenous insulin resistance that is characterized by reduced insulin uptake in peripheral tissues, along with an increase in glucose production. When combined with a large exogenous dextrose load such as occurs with TPN, the glucose oxidation capacity can easily be exceeded, which predisposes patients to develop significant hyperglycemia. It is thought that hyperglycemia contributes to adverse outcomes associated with TPN in critically ill patients and other hospitalized patients.

Hyperglycemia is associated with an increased incidence of bloodstream infections (BSI) and sepsis in surgical patients. In one study, adverse outcomes in a cohort of 111 critically ill patients were attributed to TPN-associated hyperglycemia. This risk is not restricted to surgical patients. Patients receiving stem cell transplantation have an increased infection risk with TPN-associated hyperglycemia. In contrast to these reports, others have suggested that the amount of intravenous glucose rather than hyperglycemia is detrimental.

Herein, we sought to determine whether hyperglycemia, in the context of contemporary approaches to glycemic control, was associated with BSI in hospitalized patients receiving TPN. We also investigated whether the amount of enteral and parenteral calories were associated with BSI risk. We hypothesized that patients developing BSI while receiving TPN had higher blood glucose (BG) concentrations and received more calories intravenously than patients who did not develop BSI.

### Hyperglycemia during total parenteral nutrition: an important marker of poor outcome and mortality in hospitalized patients [^6ea86a30]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The beneficial effect of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in improving the nutrition status of hospitalized malnourished patients is well established. Recent randomized trials and meta-analyses, however, have raised questions about its safety and the increased rate of TPN-associated complications and mortality in critically ill patients. The increased risk of complications during TPN therapy can be related, among other factors, to the development of hyperglycemia, which occurs in 10–88% of hospitalized patients receiving TPN therapy. Despite the high frequency of TPN-induced hyperglycemia, it is not known if the severity of hyperglycemia and/or the timing of hyperglycemia before initiation or during TPN therapy lead to hospital complications. Accordingly, we determined 1) the impact of TPN-induced hyperglycemia on survival and 2) whether blood glucose value before, shortly after initiation (within 24 h), and/or during TPN therapy can serve as predictive markers of in-hospital complications and mortality.

Parenteral nutrition consensus recommendations — scope and strength — state that, in contrast to clinical practice guidelines developed by ASPEN, the strength of evidence does not support GRADE level recommendations and instead relies on weaker supporting literature, expert opinion, and consensus recommendations; the recommendations appear as concrete action statements without qualifiers such as 'shall', 'should', or 'may'; they are not clinical guidelines as defined by ASPEN and are designed to identify best practices, guide day-to-day clinical decisions, reduce variations in practice, and enhance patient safety; and they are not intended to supersede the judgment of the healthcare professional based on the circumstances of the individual patient.

### Supplemental parenteral nutrition versus usual care in critically ill adults: a pilot randomized controlled study [^835ee6b4]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Best practice guidelines for energy delivery in critical illness often recommend that energy delivery be aimed to meet energy requirements, usually estimated using standard equations, and most often using enteral nutrition (EN). However, energy delivery in critically ill patients when using EN alone is almost always less than estimated requirements. Parenteral nutrition (PN), delivered in addition to EN, is a strategy which may increase energy delivery more closely to estimated energy requirements, however recommendations for use differ and evidence is controversial. Previously, the use and infective risk of PN has been a concern when compared to standard care nutrition, however, this has been challenged in more recent trials which investigated PN in a modern-day ICU setting.

Observational studies have suggested an association between higher energy delivery and improved clinical outcomes. And, prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) addressing this question have been limited by either trial size, or by methodological concerns. One randomized trial found that supplemental PN was associated with decreased infective complications later in ICU stay (however this endpoint was not in the original study protocol), and another found a trend to improved outcomes in nutritionally at-risk patients. The largest randomized trial indicated harm with early supplemental PN delivery, despite only achieving 74% of estimated energy requirements in the early PN arm. Further, interpretation of this trial was complicated by the parallel use of an intensive insulin therapy strategy, which has since been found to impair patient outcomes.

We aimed to determine if an individually titrated supplemental PN strategy commenced 48–72 hours following ICU admission and continued for up to 7 days would increase energy delivery closer to estimated requirements in critically ill adults compared to usual care delivery. Secondary aims (which are not reported in this article) were to determine rates of enrolment, feasibility of trial processes and estimate sample size to assist planning a large randomized trial.

### Insulin management of diabetic patients on general medical and surgical floors [^98015f3b]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the standardized subcutaneous insulin protocols for diabetic patients on general medical and surgical floors at the University of Vermont.

Method

Insulin protocols were developed for inpatients eating regular meals, and those receiving continuous tube feedings or total parental nutrition.

Results

The recommended starting subcutaneous insulin protocol for patients receiving meals is a basal-bolus approach using 0.5 U/kg basal insulin (glargine once daily, or neutral protamine Hagedorn [NPH] twice daily) and 0.1 U/kg rapid analog at each meal (lispro, aspart, or glulisine) for the average patient. The dose of basal is lowered by 0.2 U/kg for medical conditions with a high sensitivity to insulin or that have an added risk for hypoglycemia (renal or hepatic impairment, thin or normal weight, elderly, frail, hypothyroidism, adrenal insuffi ciency, etc.). Alternatively, an extra 0.2 U/kg basal is given for states of presumed high insulin resistance such as marked obesity with metabolic syndrome, open wounds, infections, etc. In turn, patients receiving continuous tube feedings receive the same 24-hour insulin doses (0.6–1.0 U/kg) in divided doses of premixed 70/30 (NPH/regular) insulin every 8 hours. This program allows lowering or eliminating 1 of the doses for the increasingly common tube-feeding programs in rehabilitation centers or patients' homes that entail discontinuation of tube feeding for 6 to 8 hours. A variation on this approach is used with total parenteral nutrition (TPN), with a portion of the insulin placed in the TPN bag and the remainder given as "q 8 hour 70/30" insulin. Starting insulin doses for all of the programs are adjusted daily to attain inpatient blood glucose goals of < 110 mg/dL fasting and 110 to 180 mg/dL throughout the day.

Conclusion

Standardized protocols have been developed and implemented at the University of Vermont for patients receiving regular meals and continuous tube feedings or TPN.

### How to define parenteral nutrition [^2b7237cb]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

In this correspondence, we aim to draw attention to the unclear definition of PN and call for action.

Despite numerous guidelines and studies addressing PN in the literature, clear guidance on which components and amounts are necessary to define PN for clinical studies still needs to be provided. The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) defines PN as a nutrition therapy provided through intravenous (central or peripheral) administration of amino acids, glucose, lipids, electrolytes, vitamins and trace elements. The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) defines PN as nutrition provided when patients cannot use the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or nutrition needs cannot be met through the GI tract alone. ESPEN guidelines on ICU nutrition mention that parenteral and enteral feeding preparations differ because commercially available PN solutions contain amino acids and glucose with or without lipids (multi-chamber bags) but no micronutrients for stability reasons. While it is clear that providing all macronutrients and micronutrients intravenously is considered PN, the minimum requirements for defining PN in clinical studies need to be clarified (Fig. 1 B).

When PN was first introduced in the 1960s, it was initially called "total parenteral nutrition (TPN)", designed to cover all nutrition needs, i.e. to provide fluid, protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins, trace elements and minerals. The term was simplified to PN after the start of the millennium, and this abbreviation has led to different interpretations. Our current observation suggests the need to define PN more precisely for clinical studies. In the ongoing GUTPHOS study, the question of the PN definition was never raised during the study protocol development nor by sites during data collection, although the Case Report Form manual listed dextrose-based maintenance solutions as non-nutritional calories, yet without further specification and guidance. Our observation suggests a high confidence level in personal or local interpretations, whereas, in reality, these interpretations are widely different. In randomised controlled trials (RCT) investigating specific PN products, the variation in definition may be less important than in observational studies. The most recent large NUTRIREA-3 RCT defined PN as "ternary admixture bags containing three groups of macronutrients used according to standard practice". However, in the NUTRIREA-2 and CALORIES RCTs that compared enteral nutrition (EN) vs. PN, PN was defined as nutrition provided through a central venous catheter, leaving considerable space for different interpretations. Accordingly, RCTs would benefit from a detailed definition of PN.

### Lysine acetate, leucine, phenylalanine, valine, isoleucine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, alanine, arginine, glycine, histidine, proline, glutamic acid, serine, aspartic acid, and tyrosine (plenamine) [^792c3bfa]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

A. General

It is essential to provide adequate calories concurrently if parenterally administered amino acids are to be retained by the body and utilized for protein synthesis.

The administration of Plenamine™ 15% Amino Acids Injection as part of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with large volumes of hyperosmotic fluids requires periodic monitoring of the patient for signs of hyperosmolarity, hyperglycemia, glycosuria and hypertriglyceridemia.

During parenteral nutrition with concentrated dextrose and amino acids solutions, essential fatty acid deficiency syndrome may develop but may not be clinically apparent. Early demonstration of this condition can only be accomplished by gas liquid chromatographic analysis of plasma lipids. The syndrome may be prevented or corrected by appropriate treatment with intravenous fat emulsions.

For complete nutritional support, TPN regimens must also include multiple vitamins and trace elements. Potentially incompatible ions such as calcium and phosphate may be added to alternate infusate bottles to avoid precipitation. Although the metabolizable acetate ion in Plenamine™ 15% diminishes the risk of acidosis, the physician must be alert to the potential appearance of this disorder.

Initiation and termination of infusions of TPN fluids must be gradual to permit adjustment of endogenous insulin release.

Undiluted Plenamine™ 15% should not be administered peripherally. When administered centrally, it should be diluted with appropriate diluents, e.g., dextrose, electrolytes and other nutrient components, to at least half strength. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .)

Caution against volume overload should be exercised.

Drug product contains no more than 25 mcg/L of aluminum.

B. Laboratory Tests

Infusion of Plenamine™ 15% without concomitant infusion of an adequate number of non-protein calories may result in elevated BUN. Monitoring of BUN is required and the balance between Plenamine™ 15% and the calorie source may require adjustment. Frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory determinations are required to prevent the complications which may occur during the administration of solutions used in TPN. Laboratory tests should include blood glucose, serum electrolytes, liver and kidney function, serum osmolarity, blood ammonia, serum protein, pH, hematocrit, WBC and urinary glucose. When Plenamine™ 15% is combined with electrolytes, care should be used in administering this solution to patients with congestive heart failure, renal failure, edema, adrenal hyperactivity, acid-base imbalance and those receiving diuretics or antihypertensive therapy. Total volume infused should be closely monitored. Serum electrolytes should be monitored daily in these patients.

### Differences in glycemic control in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with parenteral nutrition using a basal plus correction insulin regimen: an observational, retrospective study [^ca3a347c]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyperglycemia is a frequent complication of parenteral nutrition (PN) in patients both with and without diabetes mellitis (DM). The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of glucose control achieved with basal plus-correction insulin in surgical patients with and without a history of DM receiving PN.

Methods

Retrospective evaluation of a protocol applied during the period of January 2013–December 2015. The insulin dose was started at 0.4 and 0.3 IU/kg/day in patients with previous DM and without a history of DM, respectively, and the target blood glucose (BG) was < 180 mg/dl. Mean BG levels, insulin total daily dose (TDD) and hypoglycemic (< 70 mg/dl) events on different days of PN were also evaluated.

Results

Forty-one patients with previous type 2 DM and 39 without DM were evaluated. Glycemic control in both groups was as follows: during the first 48 h (230.4 ± 67 vs. 189.4 ± 38 mg/dl, p = 0.002); at the midpoint (224.6 ± 58 vs. 181.3 ± 27 mg/dl, p = 0.003); 48 h before ending TPN (196.4 ± 43 vs. 169.8 ± 40 mg/dl, p = 0.004). Insulin TDD was 0.5 ± 0.3 U/kg/day in patients with DM and 0.37 ± 0.3 units/kg/day in those without DM (p < 0.05). A total of 18 patients experienced hypoglycemic events, without differences between the groups.

Conclusion

A basal-correction insulin regimen is an alternative method for managing hyperglycemia in non-critically ill surgical patients on PN.

### Is total parenteral nutrition protective against hypoglycemia during intensive insulin therapy? A hypothesis [^25307267]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

It appears that enteral nutrition is more likely to produce hypoglycemia during intensive insulin therapy than is total parenteral nutrition.

Point Of View

Although this consequence may in part be the result of frequent discontinuation of feeding or to variability of gastrointestinal absorption of nutrients, there are also distinct physiological differences between total parenteral nutrition and enteral nutrition that are more likely to be responsible, including much higher serum insulin responses to total parenteral nutrition than with enteral nutrition that approach submaximal response levels and direct appearance of administered glucose into the systemic circulation with total parenteral nutrition at rates that approximate usual postabsorptive rates and that avoid first-pass hepatic clearance.

Conclusions

These factors may make total parenteral nutrition more efficacious, at least initially, with intensive insulin therapy and may justify setting a higher limit for glucose control when enteral feeding is principally used.

### Addition of insulin to parenteral nutrition for control of hyperglycemia [^a650accf]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Administration of parenteral nutrition (PN) may result in hyperglycemia in patients with preexisting diabetes or disease-related insulin resistance, and it can be associated with increased rates of complications. Treatment requires insulin therapy. Insulin can be administered subcutaneously, intravenously via a variable rate sliding scale, or by adding it directly to the PN. The last method is a potentially attractive technique for a number of reasons-it could deliver the insulin intravenously at a steady rate alongside carbohydrates, and in malnourished patients with little subcutaneous tissue, it may prevent the need for frequent insulin injections. Despite such potential advantages, the addition of insulin to PN remains controversial, largely with respect to the bioavailability of insulin in PN and resultant concerns of the risk of hypoglycemia. There is a paucity of long-term quality controlled studies to address this question. The available literature suggests that, at least in the short term, insulin addition to PN can achieve reasonable glycemic control with low rates of hypoglycemia, and the technique compares favorably with the use of long-acting insulin preparations. This literature review finds a wide range of values reported for insulin availability via PN, ranging from 44% to 95% depending on the type of PN container material used and the presence of added vitamins and trace elements. Few studies looking at glycemic control among patients receiving home PN were found, and larger prospective trials are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of this technique in this patient group.

### Hyperglycemia during total parenteral nutrition: an important marker of poor outcome and mortality in hospitalized patients [^ca1dae76]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

RESULTS

The study population included 276 consecutive medical (33%) and surgical (65%) patients (mean age 51 ± 18 years, BMI 26 ± 7 kg/m 2, known diabetes 19.2%, intensive care unit admission 78.2%). TPN was started 12 ± 12 days after admission and was given for a mean duration of 15 ± 24 days.

The mean blood glucose level on admission was 139 ± 85 mg/dl. The mean blood glucose level before TPN was 123.2 ± 33 mg/dl and increased to a mean blood glucose of 146 ± 44 mg/dl within 24 h of TPN and remained elevated (147 ± 40 mg/dl) during days 2–10 of TPN infusion (P < 0.01 from baseline).

General

In order for parenterally administered amino acids to be retained by the body and utilized for protein synthesis adequate calories must be administered concurrently.

The administration of 15% CLINISOL - sulfite-free (Amino Acid) Injection Pharmacy Bulk Package as part of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with large volumes of hyperosmotic fluids requires periodic monitoring of the patient for signs of hyperosmolarity, hyperglycemia, glycosuria and hypertriglyceridemia.

During parenteral nutrition with concentrated dextrose and amino acid solutions, essential fatty acid deficiency syndrome may develop but may not be clinically apparent. Early demonstration of this condition can only be accomplished by analysis of plasma lipids. The syndrome may be prevented or corrected by appropriate treatment with intravenous fat emulsions.

For complete nutritional support, TPN regimens must also include multiple vitamins and trace elements. Potentially incompatible ions such as calcium and phosphate may be added to alternate infusate containers to avoid precipitation.

Initiation and termination of infusions of TPN fluids must be gradual to permit adjustment of endogenous insulin release.

Caution should be exercised against volume overload.

Do not administer unless solution is clear.

TPN delivered through a central or large peripheral vein is a special technique requiring a team effort by physician, nurse and pharmacist. The responsibility for administering this therapy should be confined to those trained in the procedures and alert to signs of complications. Complications known to occur from the placement of central venous catheters include sepsis and vein irritation due to hypertonicity of the infused solution. The risk of sepsis is present during intravenous therapy, especially when using central venous catheters for prolonged periods. It is imperative that the preparation of admixtures and the placement and care of the catheters be accomplished under controlled aseptic conditions. It is essential that a carefully prepared protocol, based on current medical practices be followed.

Drug product contains no more than 25 μg/L of aluminum.

Laboratory Tests

Frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory determinations are necessary for proper monitoring during administration.

Laboratory tests should include blood glucose, serum electrolytes, liver and renal function, serum osmolarity, blood ammonia, serum protein, pH, hematocrit, and WBC. When 15% CLINISOL - sulfite-free (Amino Acid) Injection Pharmacy Bulk Package is combined with electrolytes, care should be used in administering this solution to patients with congestive heart failure, renal failure, edema, adrenal hyperactivity, acid base imbalance and those receiving diuretics or antihypertensive therapy. Serum electrolytes should be monitored daily.

### Comparison of continuous versus intermittent enteral feeding in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5911bfc6]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nutritional support is an essential part of managing the critically ill patient. Critical illness is associated with catabolic stress, which increases the risk of multiorgan dysfunction, prolonged hospitalisation and increased morbidity and mortality. Early (< 48 h) progressive initiation of nutrition supplementation in critically ill patients with appropriate protein provision is likely to lead to reduced catabolism, improved gastrointestinal tract integrity and improved outcomes. Enteral (EN) nutrition has several advantages when compared with total parental nutrition (TPN) and nutrition omission. EN does not require central venous line access, thereby removing concerns of line compatibility and sufficient access. The aim of EN is to supply nutrients to improve immune system functioning; preserve gastrointestinal integrity to prevent bacterial translocation and optimise mucosal host defences; reduce muscle catabolism, and decrease mortality. Moreover, both TPN and EN are generally considered equivalent in patient-oriented outcomes such as mortality early in the patient's treatment course. For prolonged administration, TPN may be associated with increased infection complications. Despite the widespread use and familiarity of EN, the optimal dosing method remains controversial.

EN is usually delivered as a continuous rate in the intensive care unit (ICU); an approach consistent with recent guidelines. Continuous infusions may be associated with a lower provision of nutrition compared with intermittent boluses in situations where nutrition administration requires cessation to facilitate investigations or assess for extubation. Moreover, continuous administration may restrict patient mobility and alter gastrointestinal hormone secretion, which may lead to long-term metabolic complications such as hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance. Other metabolic advantages of intermittent EN administration may also include enhanced protein synthesis and adherence to the usual circadian rhythm variability of hormones such as ghrelin and insulin that may lead to increased skeletal muscle autophagy. Therefore, intermittent EN administration is an attractive alternative; however, there are concerns that intermittent administration may lead to increased diarrhoea in critically ill patients and an increased risk of feeding intolerance, as well as a possible risk of aspiration in some studies. Taken together, both intermittent and continuous administration may both be preferred depending on the clinical circumstances, thus making the initial choice difficult for clinicians in view of potentially conflicting evidence.

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to compare the effects of continuous versus intermittent/bolus feeding in critically ill patients.

### Risk factors for hypoglycemia in inpatients with total parenteral nutrition and type 2 diabetes: a post hoc analysis of the insupar study [^3cd2d9a2]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: Treatment of hyperglycemia with insulin is associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The aim of this study was to determine the predictors of hypoglycemia in hospitalized T2DM patients receiving TPN. Methods: Post hoc analysis of the INSUPAR study, which is a prospective, open-label, multicenter clinical trial of adult inpatients with T2DM in a noncritical setting with indication for TPN. Results: The study included 161 patients; 31 patients (19.3%) had hypoglycemic events, but none of them was severe. In univariate analysis, hypoglycemia was significantly associated with the presence of diabetes with end-organ damage, duration of diabetes, use of insulin prior to admission, glycemic variability (GV), belonging to the glargine insulin group in the INSUPAR trial, mean daily grams of lipids in TPN, mean insulin per 10 grams of carbohydrates, duration of TPN, and increase in urea during TPN. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of diabetes with end-organ damage, GV, use of glargine insulin, and TPN duration were risk factors for hypoglycemia. Conclusion: The presence of T2DM with end-organ damage complications, longer TPN duration, belonging to the glargine insulin group, and greater GV are factors associated with the risk of hypoglycemia in diabetic noncritically ill inpatients with parenteral nutrition.

### Evaluation of nonglucose carbohydrates in parenteral nutrition for diabetic patients [^81fab1b8]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

There is little information on the advantages of nonglucose carbohydrates in total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for diabetic patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate glycemic control and insulin requirements in diabetic patients who received TPN with different sources of carbohydrates, and to determine whether insulin requirements are different when septic and non-septic diabetic patients are studied.

Materials and Methods

One-hundred and thirty-eight patients were randomly divided into two groups receiving either glucose (G), n = 71, or glucose-fructose-xylitol 2:1:1 (GFX), n = 67. There were no differences between the demographic or anthropometric characteristics of the groups, nor between the patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2, nor the initial TPN composition. Acceptable glycemic control was considered when glycemia reached < 200 mg/dl.

Results

Glycemic control was attained in 79.7% of patients (74.6 vs 85.1%), in the same period of treatment. At the end of treatment, insulin requirements were not different (45 ± 19 vs 45 ± 26 UI/day) in both groups, while similar amounts of carbohydrates (191 ± 36 vs 187 ± 45 g/day) were infused. The ratio insulin/body weight and insulin/carbohydrates were equal in both groups. In the GFX group nonseptic and septic patients needed less and more insulin, respectively, than their counterparts in the G group. No major adverse events related to carbohydrate infusions were observed.

Conclusions

Either G or GFX could be used in TPN for diabetic patients, providing glycemic control in most cases with similar insulin requirements. GFX mixtures were slightly more beneficial to attain glycemic control in nonseptic patients, but septic diabetic patients had higher insulin needs in this group.

Treatment for Non-critically Ill Patients

Insulin is the preferred treatment for glycemic control in critically ill patients. For non-critically ill patients with good nutritional intake basal, meal-related, and correction insulin dose are preferred. Subcutaneous rapid- or short-acting insulin before meals or every 4–6 h may be used in patients not on regular meals or in patients receiving continuous enteral/parenteral nutrition to correct hyperglycemia. For non-critically ill patients with poor oral intake or those who are taking nothing by mouth (NPO), basal insulin or a basal plus bolus correction insulin regimen is preferred. Basal-bolus is preferred over sliding scale insulin (SSI) owing to improved glycemic control and reduced hospital complications. Premixed insulin is preferred in the outpatient setting and basal-bolus therapy in the inpatient setting.

Recommendations

Consider using basal plus bolus correction insulin regimen, with the addition of meal-related insulin in patients who have good nutritional intake, in non-critically ill patients (Grade A, EL I)
Avoid sliding scale insulin in the inpatient hospital setting (Grade A, EL I)

Treatment for Critically Ill Patients

In the critically ill patients, continuous IV insulin is preferred. When the patient is able to take regular meals, basal and correction insulin doses are administered. When transitioning T1DM or T2DM patients to outpatient, SC insulin, SC basal insulin should be started 2–4 h before the IV insulin is discontinued.

Surgery

Perioperative Management

Perioperative management of blood glucose levels is based on the following objectives: (1) reduction in morbidity and mortality, (2) prevention of severe hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, (3) maintenance of physiological electrolyte and fluid balance, (4) prevention of ketoacidosis, and (5) achieving the target glycemic levels less than 10 mmol/L in critical patients and less than 7.7 mmol/L in stable patients. Long-acting insulin (insulin glargine) should be discontinued 2–3 days prior to surgery and combination of intermediate-acting insulin (NPH) with short- or rapid-acting insulin twice daily or Regular insulin before meals and intermediate-acting insulin at bedtime used for glycemic control. Figure 6 shows the perioperative management in T1DM and T2DM patients.

### Parenteral nutrition-associated hyperglycemia in non-critically ill inpatients increases the risk of in-hospital mortality (multicenter study) [^67643415]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the results show that hyperglycemia in noncritically ill patients receiving TPN is associated with increased in-hospital mortality. The data suggest that the goal of metabolic control in noncritically ill patients (with or without diabetes) receiving TPN should be to reach a mean blood glucose level of < 180 mg/dL. This study opens the door to further prospective studies in noncritically ill patients to determine whether stricter blood glucose control during TPN infusion improves the outcome for the patients and reduces mortality.

### Gaps in our knowledge of managing inpatient dysglycaemia and diabetes in non-critically ill adults: a call for further research [^7b27b1bc]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

7 ENTERAL AND PARENTERAL FEEDING

Data from 2005 showed that those on total parenteral nutrition who developed hyperglycaemia experienced a larger number of adverse events than those who maintained glucose concentrations within the reference range. Unpublished data from a recent UK national survey has suggested that there is no consistency in what feeding regimen is used across the UK for those on enteral or parenteral feed. As a result, there is also no consistency in the insulin regimens used. These data are being used to update the next edition of the JBDS guideline on glycaemic management in this group of individuals. However, a small study of 43 non‐critically ill people receiving nutritional support in the hospital who were randomised to a fully closed loop insulin delivery system compared to standard of care subcutaneous insulin showed that there was a significant increase in time in range (68.4% vs 36.4%, p < 0.0001), with no episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia or ketonaemia. However, the use of this technology is still in its infancy and is not yet widely available.

### Differences in glycemic control in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with parenteral nutrition using a basal plus correction insulin regimen: an observational, retrospective study [^68458639]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

A retrospective study of surgical patients receiving PN during the period of January 2013–December 2015 was performed at the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Barcelona, Spain. Data were retrieved from the hospital's electronic medical records. Patients with or without a previous history of DM treated with a basal plus correction insulin regimen were included. In the diabetic patient group, those with no record of DM but a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurement ≥ 6.5% or fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl were also included. Patients were excluded if they were transfered to intensive care units (ICUs), the duration of the PN was < 5 days or > 60 days, or they had recieved pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our institution, the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau.

Parenteral Nutrition Administration

The TPN formula was provided as a total nutrient admixture solution containing carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, with daily adjustments according to the individual caloric and nutritional requirements of the patients. PN administration provides approximately 50–60% of the calculated daily carbohydrate caloric requirements during the first 24 h and was increased to the desired goal during the next 24 h. The glucose range administered was between 150 and 250 g.

Blood Glucose Monitoring and Insulin Therapy Protocol

In all patients receiving PN, capillary BG was monitored every 6 h and was discontinued in patients without a prior history of DM if glucose values were < 140 mg/dl without insulin therapy for 48 h with the desired caloric intake.

Insulin therapy was indicated for all patients with previous DM under pharmacologic therapy. In DM patients treated exclusively with a diet and in those without a history of DM, insulin therapy was indicated if blood glucose levels were > 180 mg/dl. Patients with previous replacement insulin therapy with a basal-bolus regimen or ≥ two doses of intermediate-acting or premixed insulin were started at their previous total daily dose (TDD), and in the remaining patients the initial TDD was estimated as 0.4 U/kg/day.

The TDD was administered as basal insulin glargine once daily, and correction doses of insulin lispro were administered every 6 h if glycemia remained above 180 mg/dl. The glargine insulin dose was increased or decreased by 10–20% every day to achieve a glycemic goal of 140–180 mg/dl.

The glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was determined in all patients with previous diabetes and in non-diabetic patients who required insulin therapy.

Question 10.4

When should total parenteral nutrition be started in a patient with postoperative ileus?

Recommendation: Total parenteral nutrition should usually be given when the patient has had a non‐functioning gut for over 7 days. This should include the period of preoperative starvation. A formal nutritional assessment of the patient is essential.

Level of evidence: II

Grade of recommendation: B

Consensus: 100% (SA 77.8, A 22.2%)

Malnutrition and weight loss are associated with higher risks of surgical complications. Whilst total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may deliver a patient's metabolic needs it brings its own complications and trials do not show any benefit from starting TPN early. It is essential, however, to consider the duration of preoperative starvation and the likely timing of resumed gut function. In many cases where there has been a prolonged degree of preoperative starvation, for example due to an impending obstruction, the duration of starvation may be much longer than simply the time from operation to resumption of normal gut function. A formal assessment of the patient's nutritional status is essential. It is preferable to give nutritional supplementation enterally rather than by TPN as this is cheaper and, in some trials, has been associated with lower risks of infection. Parenteral nutrition may be given to supplement inadequate enteral nutrition. It is not recommended to start TPN unless it is likely to be needed for a full 7 days.

### Prevalence of diabetes, prediabetes, and stress hyperglycemia: insulin therapy and metabolic control in patients on total parenteral nutrition (prospective multicenter study) [^67f6048d]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The prevalence of carbohydrate metabolism disorders in patients who receive total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is not well known. These disorders can affect the treatment, metabolic control, and prognosis of affected patients. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence in noncritically ill patients on TPN of diabetes, prediabetes, and stress hyperglycemia; the factors affecting hyperglycemia during TPN; and the insulin therapy provided and the metabolic control achieved.

Methods

We undertook a prospective multicenter study involving 19 Spanish hospitals. Noncritically ill patients who were prescribed TPN were included, and data were collected on demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables (glycated hemoglobin, C-reactive protein [CRP], capillary blood glucose) as well as insulin treatment.

Results

The study included 605 patients. Before initiation of TPN, the prevalence of known diabetes was 17.4%, unknown diabetes 4.3%, stress hyperglycemia 7.1%, and prediabetes 27.8%. During TPN therapy, 50.9% of patients had at least one capillary blood glucose of > 180 mg/dL. Predisposing factors were age, levels of CRP and glycated hemoglobin, the presence of diabetes, infectious complications, the number of grams of carbohydrates infused, and the administration of glucose-elevating drugs. Most (71.6%) patients were treated with insulin. The mean capillary blood glucose levels during TPN were: known diabetes (178.6 ± 46.5 mg/dL), unknown diabetes (173.9 ± 51.9), prediabetes (136.0 ± 25.4), stress hyperglycemia (146.0 ± 29.3), and normal (123.2 ± 19.9) (P < .001).

Conclusion

The prevalence of carbohydrate metabolism disorders is very high in noncritically ill patients on TPN. These disorders affect insulin treatment and the degree of metabolic control achieved.

### Compounding TPN admixtures: then and now [^c4fba483]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Compounding TPN admixtures has significantly developed since the first clinical reports by Dr. Dudrick and colleagues from the University of Pennsylvania approximately 35 years ago. Today, the responsibility for the compounding of sage parenteral nutrition admixtures for patients incapable of oral or enteral nutrition primarily rests with the pharmacy department. Although others may influence the desirable components to be contained therin, no one is more qualified to deal with the physicochemical issues and aseptic technique compounding requirements than a registered pharmacist. In fact, the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), the official drug compendium in the US since 1906, has published Chapter 797 entitled "Pharmaceutical Compounding — Sterile Preparations", enforceable by the FDA, and makes clear the role of the pharmacist in the compounding of safe parenteral admixtures. Ultimately, after careful pharmaceutical review of the final formulation, the composition of the final admixture for infusion will be determined based on the ability to safely compound the prescribed additives in the desired quantities of a specified volume of sterile fluid. There will always be instances, where, for example the patient's needs cannot be safely met through the TPN admixture, primarily because of stability, compatibility and/or sterility issues. When this occurs, suitable alternative methods of delivering the additives in question must be sought so as not to compromise the safety issues of the final TPN infusion. Although there have been many advances in the development of nutritional additives, compounding devices, and containers, significant safety issues continue to arise necessitating further modification of paretneral nutrition protocols. ASPEN, through periodic reviews of tis published guidelines, such as the 1998 Safe Practices for Parenteral Nutrition Formulations, is in a key position to keep nutrition support clinicians abreast of the central issues affecting the safety of TPN therapy.(Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition

### Automated self-adjusting subcutaneous insulin algorithm for patients NPO or on TPN or enteral feedings [^62ecc41e]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Perioperative diabetes patients are often treated with sliding-scale insulin, despite a lack of evidence to support therapeutic effectiveness. We introduced an automated subcutaneous insulin algorithm (SQIA) to improve glycemic control in these patients while maintaining the simplicity of a q4 hour adjustable sliding-scale insulin order set.

Methods

In this pilot study, we implemented a fully programmed, self-adjusting SQIA as part of a structured order set in the electronic medical record for adult patients who are nil per os, or on continuous enteral tube feedings or total parenteral nutrition. The nurse only enters the current glucose in the Medication Administration Record, and then the calculated dose is shown. The new dose is based on previous dose, and current and previous glucoses. The SQIA titrates the glucose to 120-180mg/dL. For this pilot, this order set was utilized for complex perioperative oncologic patients.

Results

The median duration on the SQIA was 58hours. Glucoses at titration initiation were highest at 206 ± 63mg/dL, and came down to 156 ± 29mg/dL by 72hours. The majority of measured glucoses (66.8%, n = 647) were maintained between 80 and 180mg/dL. There were no glucoses lower than 60mg/dL, and only 0.3% (n = 3) were below 70mg/dL. There was a low rate of errors (1%).

Conclusions

A simple automated SQIA can be used to titrate insulin to meet the changing metabolic requirements of individuals perioperatively and maintain glucose within the target range for these hospitalized patients.

### Current practices in the delivery of parenteral nutrition in Australia [^73082de8]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine current practice in the delivery of parenteral nutrition (PN) in Australian hospitals.

Design

A cross-sectional mail survey.

Setting

Acute-care adult hospitals with greater than 200 beds in Australia.

Subjects

A total of 67 hospitals (65.7% response rate).

Intervention

Surveys were posted to hospitals. A reminder letter with a second copy of the survey was posted 3 weeks later to non-respondents.

Results

Twenty-seven (40.3%) of the hospitals have a PN team and 50 (74.6%) have a hospital protocol for PN delivery. An inaccessible or non-functional gastrointestinal tract is the most common indicator for commencing PN. Fat infusion is calculated by 24 (38.7%) respondents with a mean (s.d.) maximum amount of fat provided of 2.0 (0.7) g/kg/day. Over half (n = 35) reported calculating carbohydrate infusion at a maximum amount of 5.4 (1.0) mg/kg/min. Two-thirds (n = 41) reported commencing PN at a rate of 50% or less of goal rate. Blood glucose levels (BGL) were monitored at least once per day by the majority of respondents (n = 56, 83.6%). Insulin infusion was commenced at varying BGL. Most respondents (n = 40, 59.7%) reported ceasing PN when at least half of the patient's requirements are being met either orally or enterally. A number of practice guidelines were identified and the results of the survey were compared with these guidelines.

Conclusions

Where there are clear practice guidelines, current practice appears to be in line with these recommendations, however, where evidence is lacking, practice is varied.

Cysteine is considered to be an essential amino acid for infants, especially preterm infants with potentially immature enzyme pathways. Therefore, addition of a cysteine supplement to the TPN admixture is recommended. The intake of cysteine by the preterm infant ingesting maternal milk is approximately 78 mg/kg/day. The suggested intravenous dosage level for Cysteine Hydrochloride Injection, USP is 500 mg (10 mL) for every 12.5 g (125 mL) of Aminosyn-PF 10% administered (see package insert for Cysteine Hydrochloride Injection, USP). In order to avoid potential insolubility of cysteine hydrochloride in admixtures, the foregoing concentration should not be exceeded.

In many patients, provision of adequate calories in the form of hypertonic dextrose may require the administration of exogenous insulin to prevent hyperglycemia and glycosuria. To prevent rebound hypoglycemia, a solution containing 5% dextrose should be administered when hypertonic dextrose solutions are abruptly discontinued.

SERUM ELECTROLYTES SHOULD BE MONITORED FREQUENTLY. Electrolytes may be added to the nutrient solution as indicated by the patient's clinical condition and laboratory determinations of plasma values. Major electrolytes are sodium, chloride, potassium, phosphate, magnesium and calcium. Daily administration of intravenous vitamin supplements including a complete complement of fat and water-soluble vitamins is required. Trace metal additives including zinc, copper, manganese, and chromium should also be provided, especially when long-term parenteral therapy is anticipated.

### Lower insulin secretory response to glucose induced by artificial nutrition in children: prolonged and total parenteral nutrition [^3924c25d]. Pediatric Research (2007). Low credibility.

Long-term parenteral nutrition (TPN) in children is associated with sustained hyperinsulinemia due to a high nutriment infusion flow 12 h/24 h, with plausible lipotoxicity secondary to repeated lipid infusions and with changes in incretin hormone release. The aim of this study was to test whether long-term TPN can lead to an alteration in beta-cell function. Thirteen children (age 9.5 ± 3.9 y) on total TPN without obvious alternation in glucose tolerance were included. beta-Cell function was quantified with an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) and a graded glucose infusion. First phase insulin release (FPIR) was low in five patients. The same demonstrated a lower insulin release under graded glucose infusion, although plasma glucose reached values as high as 15 mM. These data emphasize that metabolic conditions induced by TPN can lead to lower insulin secretory response to glucose. Patients who remain dependent on TPN are at risk of developing glucose tolerance disorders.

Characteristics of study population

Among 120 224 patient admissions during the study period, 28 899 (24%) had administration of at least 1 unit of subcutaneous insulin (figure 1). Of these eligible admissions, there were a total of 250 747 patient-days, of which 152 821 (61%) were insulin-treated patient-days. After excluding discharge days and days with intravenous insulin, TPN, or insulin pump orders, 128 657 (84%) of the insulin-treated days were identified as index days for prediction of a hypoglycemic outcome within the next 24 hours.

This prospective multicenter study involved 19 Spanish hospitals. Noncritically ill patients who were prescribed TPN were included prospectively, and data were collected on demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables as well as on in-hospital mortality.

Results

The study included 605 patients (mean age 63.2 ± 15.7 years). The daily mean TPN values were 1.630 ± 323 kcal, 3.2 ± 0.7 g carbohydrates/kg, 1.26 ± 0.3 g amino acids/kg, and 0.9 ± 0.2 g lipids/kg. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the patients who had mean blood glucose levels > 180 mg/dL during the TPN infusion had a risk of mortality that was 5.6 times greater than those with mean blood glucose levels < 140 mg/dL (95% CI 1.47–21.4 mg/dL) after adjusting for age, sex, nutritional state, presence of diabetes or hyperglycemia before starting TPN, diagnosis, prior comorbidity, carbohydrates infused, use of steroid therapy, SD of blood glucose level, insulin units supplied, infectious complications, albumin, C-reactive protein, and HbA1c levels.

Conclusions

Hyperglycemia (mean blood glucose level > 180 mg/dL) in noncritically ill patients who receive TPN is associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality.

### Guidelines for the provision of nutrition support therapy in the adult critically ill patient: the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition [^703fbdc9]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

ASPEN adult critical care nutrition support — evidence scope and timeframe: To increase the external validity and comparability to today's intensive care unit (ICU) patient, only RCTs between January 1, 2001, and July 15, 2012, were included to reflect more current nutrition support practices in the modern era, a time when routine care included maintenance of glycemic control, avoidance of overfeeding energy, and improved catheter care. Existing American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) clinical guidelines are reviewed for potential updating every 5 years or when significant new additions to the literature have occurred, whichever occurs first.

### Early versus late parenteral nutrition in critically ill adults [^d0548016]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Controversy exists about the timing of the initiation of parenteral nutrition in critically ill adults in whom caloric targets cannot be met by enteral nutrition alone.

Methods

In this randomized, multicenter trial, we compared early initiation of parenteral nutrition (European guidelines) with late initiation (American and Canadian guidelines) in adults in the intensive care unit (ICU) to supplement insufficient enteral nutrition. In 2312 patients, parenteral nutrition was initiated within 48 hours after ICU admission (early-initiation group), whereas in 2328 patients, parenteral nutrition was not initiated before day 8 (late-initiation group). A protocol for the early initiation of enteral nutrition was applied to both groups, and insulin was infused to achieve normoglycemia.

Results

Patients in the late-initiation group had a relative increase of 6.3% in the likelihood of being discharged alive earlier from the ICU (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00 to 1.13; P = 0.04) and from the hospital (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.13; P = 0.04), without evidence of decreased functional status at hospital discharge. Rates of death in the ICU and in the hospital and rates of survival at 90 days were similar in the two groups. Patients in the late-initiation group, as compared with the early-initiation group, had fewer ICU infections (22.8% vs. 26.2%, P = 0.008) and a lower incidence of cholestasis (P < 0.001). The late-initiation group had a relative reduction of 9.7% in the proportion of patients requiring more than 2 days of mechanical ventilation (P = 0.006), a median reduction of 3 days in the duration of renal-replacement therapy (P = 0.008), and a mean reduction in health care costs of €1,110 (about $1,600) (P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Late initiation of parenteral nutrition was associated with faster recovery and fewer complications, as compared with early initiation. (Funded by the Methusalem program of the Flemish government and others; EPaNIC ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00512122.).

Research design and methods

Data source

This was a cross-sectional study conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, a 1300-bed tertiary care academic medical center in Baltimore, Maryland. Using data from our prior EMR, Sunrise POE, we identified hospitalized adults in the non-critical care, non-obstetrical setting with an admission date on or after 1 January 2013 and a discharge date on or before 31 December 2015. Admissions missing a date of discharge or patient weight measurements were excluded. The primary exposure of interest was treatment with subcutaneous insulin, defined as any administered long-acting, intermediate-acting, rapid-acting, or premixed insulin. At our institution, the formulary long-acting insulin is glargine, the intermediate-acting insulin is Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH), the rapid-acting insulin is aspart, and the premixed insulin is NPH/regular 70/30. Admissions in which subcutaneous insulin was not administered at any time during hospitalization were excluded.

For eligible admissions, we defined patient-days as 24-hour intervals relative to the admission date and time (online supplementary figure S1). We defined insulin-treated patient-days as patient-days in which at least 1 unit of subcutaneous insulin was administered. We excluded those insulin-treated patient-days in which there was concurrent use of intravenous insulin (as these patients are already under close observation and managed via protocol with hourly BG checks), total parenteral nutrition (TPN; as intravenous insulin is often an additive in the parenteral nutrition), insulin pump use (as we were unable to easily capture patient-administered insulin pump doses from our EMR), or if the insulin-treated patient-day was the date of discharge (as no outcome data would be available). All remaining insulin-treated patient-days were considered index days used for prediction of hypoglycemic outcomes on the next patient-day. Although non-index days were excluded as a unit of observation for prediction, they were included as observations for outcome ascertainment if the previous day was an index day.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes were biochemical or clinically significant hypoglycemia, defined as at least one serum or fingerstick BG of ≤ 70 mg/dL and < 54 mg/dL occurring in a prediction horizon of 24 hours after an index day, respectively. Since the degree of hypoglycemia might be influenced by different clinical predictors, we developed separate prediction models for each hypoglycemic outcome.

### Intensive insulin treatment in critically ill trauma patients normalizes glucose by reducing endogenous glucose production [^233b072c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Critical illness is associated with insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Intensive insulin treatment to normalize blood glucose during feeding has been shown to improve morbidity and mortality in patients in intensive care. The mechanisms behind the glucose-controlling effects of insulin in stress are not well understood. Six previously healthy, severely traumatized patients (injury severity score > 15) were studied early (24–48 h) after trauma. Endogenous glucose production (EGP) and whole-body glucose disposal (WGD) were measured (6,6-(2)H(2)-glucose) at basal, during total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and during TPN plus insulin to normalize blood glucose (TPN+I). Six matched volunteers served as controls. At basal and TPN, concentrations of glucose and insulin were higher in patients (P < 0.05). During TPN+I, insulin concentrations were 30-fold higher in patients. At basal, WGD and EGP were 30% higher in patients (P < 0.05). During TPN, EGP decreased in both groups but less in patients, resulting in 110% higher EGP than controls (P < 0.05). Normoglycemia coincided with reduced EGP, resulting in similar rates in both groups. WGD did not change during TPN or TPN+I and was not different between the groups. In conclusion, in healthy subjects, euglycemia is maintained during TPN at physiological insulin concentrations by a reduction of EGP, whereas WGD is maintained at basal levels. In traumatized patients, hyperglycemia is due to increased EGP. In contrast to controls, normalization of glucose concentration during TPN needs high insulin infusion rates and is accounted for by a reduction in EGP, whereas WGD is not increased.

### Diabetes care in the hospital: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^88e6d112]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Enteral and parenteral nutrition insulin management — insulin orders should include coverage of basal, prandial, and correctional needs, and it is essential that people with type 1 diabetes continue to receive basal insulin even if fasting or feedings are discontinued. For nutrition coverage, the insulin dose may be calculated as 1 unit of insulin for every 10–15 g of carbohydrate, with options including NPH (neutral protamine Hagedorn) insulin two or three times daily (every 8 or 12 h) or regular insulin every 6 h; for nocturnal tube feeding, NPH insulin administered along with the initiation of feeding is a reasonable approach. In continuous parenteral nutrition, human regular insulin may be added to the solution, particularly if > 20 units of correctional insulin have been required in the past 24 h, with a starting dose of 1 unit of regular human insulin for every 10 g of dextrose adjusted daily. Because continuous enteral or parenteral nutrition produces a continuous postprandial state, efforts to bring blood glucose to below 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) substantially increase hypoglycemia risk.

### Patterns of plasma leptin and insulin concentrations in hospitalized patients after the initiation of total parenteral nutrition [^c3fb848e]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The regulation of leptin in patients with critical illness is poorly understood. Sex, diet, body mass, and cytokines may all play a role.

Objective

The aims of this study were to determine the factors influencing leptin concentrations in hospitalized patients beginning total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and whether a 3-d regimen of TPN would further increase plasma leptin concentrations above baseline.

Design

Twenty-six patients requiring TPN were enrolled in this prospective, nonintervention study. Only 20 (11 women and 9 men) completed all 3 d of TPN.

Results

Baseline plasma leptin in the TPN patients ranged from 62.5 to 1625 pmol/L (± SD: 419 ± 387; n = 26) and was not significantly different between men (444 ± 494 pmol/L) and women (363 ± 244 pmol/L). Baseline plasma insulin ranged from 76 to 695 pmol/L (271 ± 188; n = 26) and was not correlated with plasma leptin. Leptin concentrations increased after 3 d of TPN, from 356 ± 300 to 794 ± 600 pmol/L (P < 0.05) in parallel with an increase in insulin from 257 ± 187 to 979 ± 917 pmol/L (P < 0.01) in the 20 patients who completed the study; however, the changes were not correlated when expressed as percentages. Although the men and women had insulin responses to feeding that were not significantly different, leptin concentrations did not increase significantly in men but increased 3-fold in women (to 1094 ± 638 pmol/L; P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Leptin regulation in patients with a critical illness differs substantially from that in healthy persons. The importance of glucose and insulin in leptin secretion remains unclear, especially in men.

### Fully closed-loop insulin delivery in inpatients receiving nutritional support: a two-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^a4460bbb]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Added value of this study

Our study is, to our knowledge, the first to assess fully automated closed-loop insulin delivery without meal bolusing in adults in non-critical care receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition (or both). We showed that an increased proportion of time was spent in the target glucose range and mean glucose was reduced with fully closed-loop insulin delivery compared with standard insulin therapy, without an increase in the time spent in hypoglycaemia or the total daily insulin dose. This study shows that fully closed-loop insulin delivery can potentially provide health-care professionals with an effective and safe clinical tool to manage hyperglycaemia in patients receiving parenteral or enteral nutritional support in hospital.

Implications of all the available evidence

Clinical guidelines for inpatient glucose management in non-critical care have been published. However, data from inpatient audits and studies show that implementation is challenging, particularly in patients receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition. Unanticipated dislodgement of feeding tubes, temporary discontinuation of nutrition, and cycling of nutritional support with oral intake necessitate high levels of vigilance among health-care professionals, including frequent blood glucose monitoring and regular adjustment of insulin doses. Glucose management in this population is associated with increased workload for ward staff, and fear of hypoglycaemia often leads to suboptimal glycaemic control. Further studies are needed to assess the potential of closed-loop insulin delivery to improve clinical outcomes, including morbidity and mortality, in this setting.

Closed-loop systems, which automatically deliver insulin in a glucose-responsive manner, might provide a solution to glucose management for hospital inpatients requiring nutritional support. Closed-loop systems combine real-time glucose measurements from a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device with a control algorithm that directs insulin delivery via an insulin pump. Evidence that closed-loop technology improves glycaemic control in inpatients with hyperglycaemia is increasing, but systematic investigations in the most challenging circumstances, such as during parenteral or enteral nutrition, have not been done.

Here we report the results of a two-centre, randomised, open-label trial of fully closed-loop insulin delivery in a diverse cohort of inpatients receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition (or both) in non-critical medical and surgical care. We hypothesised that closed-loop insulin delivery would be safe and improve glycaemic control without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia.

Regarding medical management for in-hospital hyperglycemia, more specifically with respect to insulin therapy, ES 2022 guidelines recommend to consider administering initial therapy with correctional insulin over scheduled insulin therapy (defined as basal or basal/bolus insulin) to maintain glucose targets in the range of 100–180 mg/dL (5.6–10.0 mmol/L) in adult patients with no prior history of diabetes hospitalized for a non-critical illness and experiencing hyperglycemia (defined as blood glucose > 140 mg/dL; 7.8 mmol/L) during hospitalization. Consider adding scheduled insulin therapy in patients with persistent hyperglycemia (≥ 2 point-of-care blood glucose measurements ≥ 180 mg/dL in a 24-hour period on correctional insulin alone).

### Treatment intensification and blood glucose control among hospitalized diabetic patients [^942a9911]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemia is common among diabetic inpatients, and has been linked to adverse outcomes. However, antihyperglycemic treatment is seldom intensified in noncritical care patients, and the relationship between intensification frequency and glucose control is poorly understood. We evaluated the relationship between treatment intensification and changes in blood glucose in hospitalized diabetic patients.

Design

We retrospectively analyzed 3,613 hospitalized diabetic patients who were admitted to the hospital between January 2003 and August 2004, were not hospitalized in an ICU, were not prescribed IV insulin or total parenteral nutrition (TPN), had a length of stay of at least 3 days, and had at least one point-of-care blood glucose measurement. A linear model was used to assess the relationship between intensification of antihyperglycemic medications and the average daily change in point-of-care glucose measurements.

Results

Hyperglycemia (> 180 mg/dL) was documented at least once for 82.5% of patient admissions. Antihyperglycemic treatment was intensified for 22.0% of days with hyperglycemia. Intensifications of scheduled and sliding scale insulin, but not oral medications, were associated with a 11.1 mg/dL (p < 0.0001) and 12.2 mg/dL (p < 0.0001) reduction in the average daily glucose, respectively. Hypoglycemia (< 50 mg/dL) was documented on 2.2% of days after antihyperglycemic treatment intensification.

Conclusion

In this cohort, lack of treatment intensification in response to inpatient hyperglycemia was common. Antihyperglycemic treatment intensification was strongly associated with decrease in average daily glucose, while hypoglycemia was uncommon. This suggests that increasing the frequency of treatment intensifications could lead to improved glycemic control in inpatients with diabetes.

### Tailoring nutrition therapy to illness and recovery [^9ac0863f]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

How can we improve the worldwide epidemic of starvation in ICU patients?

The basic metabolism and physiology of human nutritional needs described indicate that early hypocaloric feeding in the first few days (acute phase) of critical illness would need to be accompanied by adequate protein delivery to help account for marked protein losses early in the ICU stay. Unfortunately, given the limited high-protein, lower-kilocalorie enteral feeding options available commercially, TPN or enteral protein supplements will currently be required to achieve this in most cases. TPN is now a significantly more viable option to achieve this as three recent large trials of both supplemental and full TPN support versus EN in the ICU setting have shown that TPN use in the ICU is no longer associated with increased infection risk. This is likely due to improvements in glucose control, central line infection control measures, and potentially as a result of improved (nonpure soy-based) lipid formulations as described in detail in the recent review by Manzanares et al. In support of early TPN use, the new SCCM/ASPEN Guidelines indicate that for any patient at high nutrition risk (NRS 2002 > 5 or NUTRIC Score (w/o IL-6 score) > 5) or found to be severely malnourished when EN is not feasible, exclusive PN should be initiated as soon as possible following ICU admission.

### Total parenteral nutrition associated with severe insulin resistance following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with hemophagocytic syndrome: report on two cases [^dd98a0eb]. Pediatric Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperglycemia secondary to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is reported in adults. In addition, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes as late consequences of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are well described. Both situations are generally manageable with traditional insulin dosing. We present two children who developed severe insulin resistance requiring intravenous insulin therapy at doses up to 13 units/kg/h. Both children were on TPN after undergoing HSCT for hemophagocytic syndrome. We believe that our report will alert physicians to such a condition and help with early recognition that is a key to successful intervention. These cases aim to increase awareness and stimulate research to unravel the associated underling mechanisms.

### Nutrition support in the intensive care unit… [^1c121e30]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

In the randomized, multicenter trial, TPN was used to deliver a hypercaloric diet that provided 550 kcal from lipids and the remainder from dextrose. The daily caloric goal was 1000 kcal higher than resting metabolic expenditure. After stratifying for nutritional status, data showed that TPN put mildly and moderately malnourished patients at greater risk for hyperglycemia, infections, and subsequent complications that would increase morbidity and mortality. In severely malnourished patients, who only accounted for 5% of the cohort, the frequency of infections did not increase and there was a significant reduction in noninfective sequelae. Based on these outcomes, the authors concluded that TPN should be limited to severely malnourished patients.
8. Subsequent studies compared enteral nutrition and PN with little regard for overfeeding.

11, 12 Large quantities of dextrose, easily and continuously administered via TPN, put critically ill, insulin-resistant patients at high risk for life-threatening hyperglycemia. 13 While many studies compared enteral nutrition with TPN, few included any discussion of the greater risk of overfeeding when using TPN. This oversight led to widespread confounding, with differences in infective complications affected by varying rates of hyperglycermia.
14. Subsequent studies, in which enteral nutrition was administered to most patients, were characterized by an increased rate of hypoglycemia, an outcome that leaves the ideal combination of feeding and glucose control protocols open to further debate. 19, 20, 25. 200 to 300 g of dextrose per day.

27 Therefore, when administered in conjunction with early and adequate feeding, it is reasonable to provide exogenous insulin to achieve glucose values of less than 150 mg/dL for at least the first 3 days in critically ill ICU populations followed by tighter control if critical illness persists.
14. Because TPN should be administered in hypocaloric dosages to overweight and obese patients, it is recommended that they receive ample nitrogen to promote wound healing and fight infection. 42 The protein dosage can be administered in levels of up to 2 g/kg of ideal body weight in these patients. This could help preserve lean body mass and reduce adipose tissue. Prior to major elective surgery, class III obese patients may also benefit from progressive resistance training. By increasing lean body mass and improving skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and general fitness, 43 a preoperative progressive resistance training protocol might reduce perioperative risk and recovery time.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^d1874b6c]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Parenteral nutrition (PN) represents one of the most notable achievements of modern medicine, serving as a therapeutic modality for all age groups across the healthcare continuum. PN offers a life-sustaining option when intestinal failure prevents adequate oral or enteral nutrition. However, providing nutrients by vein is an expensive form of nutrition support, and serious adverse events can occur. In an effort to provide clinical guidance regarding PN therapy, the Board of Directors of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) convened a task force to develop consensus recommendations regarding appropriate PN use. The recommendations contained in this document aim to delineate appropriate PN use and promote clinical benefits while minimizing the risks associated with the therapy. These consensus recommendations build on previous ASPEN clinical guidelines and consensus recommendations for PN safety. They are intended to guide evidence-based decisions regarding appropriate PN use for organizations and individual professionals, including physicians, nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, and other clinicians involved in providing PN. They not only support decisions related to initiating and managing PN but also serve as a guide for developing quality monitoring tools for PN and for identifying areas for further research. Finally, the recommendations contained within the document are also designed to inform decisions made by additional stakeholders, such as policy makers and third-party payers, by providing current perspectives regarding the use of PN in a variety of healthcare settings.

### Implementation and evaluation of the SPRINT protocol for tight glycaemic control in critically ill patients: a clinical practice change [^38420d63]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Total insulin prescribed by SPRINT is limited to 6 U/hour to minimise saturation and the administration of ineffective insulin. Insulin is given predominantly in bolus form for safety, avoiding infusions being left on at levels inappropriate for evolving patient condition. Occasionally, doctors prescribed a background insulin infusion rate of 0.5 to 2 U/hour, primarily for patients known to have type II diabetes, and the insulin bolus recommendations from SPRINT were added to this background rate. A background rate of 0.5 to 1.0 U/hour, to which SPRINT bolus insulin is added, is mandated in patients with type I diabetes.

Goal enteral nutrition rates are approximately 25 kcal/kg per day of RESOURCE Diabetic (Novartis Medical Nutrition, Minneapolis, MN, USA) or Glucerna (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) with 34% to 36% of calories from carbohydrates. Minimum and maximum nutrition rates are 7.5 to 25 kcal/kg per day, with 2.7 to 9 kcal/kg per day from carbohydrates. Thus, an 80-kg male would receive a maximum of 2,000 kcal/day and a minimum of 600 kcal/day, with 216 to 640 kcal/day from carbohydrates, exceeding the minimum level below which there is an increased risk of bloodstream infections. These guidelines are detailed by Shaw and colleagues and are approximately equivalent to the ACCP guidelines.

Statistical analysis

Baseline variables were compared using the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test or chi-square test. Change in mortality was compared between the SPRINT and historical cohorts by means of the chi-square test. The Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests were used to compare blood glucose metrics between survivors and non-survivors. MINITAB ® Release 14.1 (Minitab Inc. State College, PA, USA) was used for statistical comparisons, and for all statistical tests, P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.

Log-normal statistics were used to provide an accurate description of blood glucose control results as negative blood glucose concentrations are not possible and typical distributions of blood glucose measurements are asymmetric and show a skew toward higher concentrations. The design of the protocol was that, for periods outside the ideal target range, short periods of higher blood glucose levels were preferred over hypoglycaemic events. Thus, the distributions for blood glucose are right-skewed and log-normal.

### Perioperative management of total parenteral nutrition, glucose containing solutions, and intraoperative glucose monitoring in paediatric patients: a survey of clinical practice [^74474c36]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

Infants and children, particularly those who are chronically ill and maintained on total parenteral nutrition (TPN), are at risk for perioperative hypoglycaemia [blood glucose < 2.2 mmol x l(-1) (40 mg x dl(-1))] and hyperglycaemia [blood glucose > 11 mmol x l(-1) (200 mg x dl(-1))]. We surveyed paediatric anaesthesiologists regarding their perioperative management of blood glucose and TPN in paediatric patients to determine the current practice and its perceived success. Questionnaires were mailed to all members of the Study Group on Pediatric Anesthesia and the response rate was 70%. Results indicate that the current perioperative management of blood glucose and TPN is somewhat varied. Furthermore, greater than 10% of those surveyed report that their management results in a variable response in the maintenance of normoglycaemia. While the detrimental effects of perioperative hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia are rare, they are serious. A Medline search shows that no studies have been published regarding perioperative management of paediatric patients receiving TPN, although it appears that clinical study is warranted.

### Canadian clinical practice guidelines for nutrition support in mechanically ventilated, critically ill adult patients [^b9c55339]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was conducted to develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for nutrition support (ie, enteral and parenteral nutrition) in mechanically ventilated critically ill adults.

Options

The following interventions were systematically reviewed for inclusion in the guidelines: enteral nutrition (EN) versus parenteral nutrition (PN), early versus late EN, dose of EN, composition of EN (protein, carbohydrates, lipids, immune-enhancing additives), strategies to optimize delivery of EN and minimize risks (ie, rate of advancement, checking residuals, use of bedside algorithms, motility agents, small bowel versus gastric feedings, elevation of the head of the bed, closed delivery systems, probiotics, bolus administration), enteral nutrition in combination with supplemental PN, use of PN versus standard care in patients with an intact gastrointestinal tract, dose of PN and composition of PN (protein, carbohydrates, IV lipids, additives, vitamins, trace elements, immune enhancing substances), and the use of intensive insulin therapy.

Outcomes

The outcomes considered were mortality (intensive care unit [ICU], hospital, and long-term), length of stay (ICU and hospital), quality of life, and specific complications.

Evidence

We systematically searched MEDLINE and CINAHL (cumulative index to nursing and allied health), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials that evaluated any form of nutrition support in critically ill adults. We also searched reference lists and personal files, considering all articles published or unpublished available by August 2002. Each included study was critically appraised in duplicate using a standard scoring system.

Values

For each intervention, we considered the validity of the randomized trials or meta-analyses, the effect size and its associated confidence intervals, the homogeneity of trial results, safety, feasibility, and the economic consequences. The context for discussion was mechanically ventilated patients in Canadian ICUs.

Benefits, Harms, and Costs

The major potential benefit from implementing these guidelines is improved clinical outcomes of critically ill patients (reduced mortality and ICU stay). Potential harms of implementing these guidelines include increased complications and costs related to the suggested interventions. SUMMARIES OF EVIDENCE AND RECOMMENDATIONS: When considering nutrition support in critically ill patients, we strongly recommend that EN be used in preference to PN. We recommend the use of a standard, polymeric enteral formula that is initiated within 24 to 48 hours after admission to ICU, that patients be cared for in the semirecumbent position, and that arginine-containing enteral products not be used. Strategies to optimize delivery of EN (starting at the target rate, use of a feeding protocol using a higher threshold of gastric residuals volumes, use of motility agents, and use of small bowel feeding) and minimize the risks of EN (elevation of the head of the bed) should be considered. Use of products with fish oils, borage oils, and antioxidants should be considered for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. A glutamine-enriched formula should be considered for patients with severe burns and trauma. When initiating EN, we strongly recommend that PN not be used in combination with EN. When PN is used, we recommend that it be supplemented with glutamine, where available. Strategies that maximize the benefit and minimize the risks of PN (hypocaloric dose, withholding lipids, and the use of intensive insulin therapy to achieve tight glycemic control) should be considered. There are insufficient data to generate recommendations in the following areas: use of indirect calorimetry; optimal pH of EN; supplementation with trace elements, antioxidants, or fiber; optimal mix of fats and carbohydrates; use of closed feeding systems; continuous versus bolus feedings; use of probiotics; type of lipids; and mode of lipid delivery.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^82153322]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding quality improvement for parenteral nutrition, more specifically with respect to policies and protocols, ASPEN 2017 guidelines recommend to implement a quality improvement process (such as clinical audit, plan-do-study-act cycle, medication use evaluation) to ensure appropriate use of PN based on the best available evidence.
