## Question

Does metoprolol lower bp

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether metoprolol lowers blood pressure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory labeling and whether hypertension is an approved indication. Then, I should verify the magnitude of blood pressure reduction from randomized trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine the mechanism of action to ensure the effect is pharmacologically plausible. After that, I need to consider dose, formulation, and population differences that modify response. Finally, I should review guideline positioning and safety considerations to contextualize clinical use, before synthesizing a clear conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status, because that anchors the clinical claim. Multiple FDA labels state that metoprolol tartrate and metoprolol succinate are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, explicitly to lower blood pressure, which establishes that blood pressure reduction is a labeled therapeutic effect of metoprolol [^788bd29f] [^d79fcee2] [^74eb4b31].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of effect from controlled studies so I don't overstate it. In a large randomized, double-blind study of metoprolol succinate extended-release, placebo-corrected reductions in sitting blood pressure were about 6–8 mmHg systolic and 4–7 mmHg diastolic at 24 hours, with dose-related effects across 25–400 mg daily, and similar findings are reported across multiple FDA documents for both tartrate and succinate formulations [^a5937a89] [^1e7e212f] [^03624608]. Hold on, I should also check class-level data; a Cochrane review of beta-1 selective blockers, including metoprolol, found average reductions of roughly 10/8 mmHg versus placebo in mild-to-moderate hypertension, with a larger effect at peak than trough, which aligns with the FDA-reported ranges and supports clinical relevance [^3c0844cd].

> I need to ensure the mechanism is coherent with observed blood pressure changes. Metoprolol is a beta-1 selective antagonist that reduces heart rate and myocardial contractility, thereby decreasing cardiac output, and it suppresses renin release from the juxtaglomerular apparatus; these effects converge to lower blood pressure, although the exact dominant mechanism in essential hypertension remains multifactorial and not fully elucidated [^03997c52] [^ef0e7c7d] [^839a1a3a].

> Let me consider dose, formulation, and population modifiers, because response is not uniform. Dose-related blood pressure reductions are observed with both immediate-release tartrate and extended-release succinate, and many patients require 100–200 mg/day of succinate or 100–200 mg/day of tartrate in divided doses to achieve targets, with individual titration needed due to variable plasma levels and clinical response [^ec4fed04] [^9f4a5e3b] [^a5937a89]. I should double-check special populations; in children 6–16 years, ER metoprolol produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, indicating efficacy across ages, though pediatric labeling remains off-label in many regions [^d9b18316]. But wait, what if ancestry affects response? Evidence suggests patients of African ancestry may have a smaller average blood pressure response to beta-blocker monotherapy, reinforcing the need to individualize therapy and consider alternative or adjunctive classes when appropriate [^83c2c7f7] [^bd6643e3].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning to avoid overgeneralizing. Contemporary U.S. guidelines do not recommend beta-blockers as first-line therapy for uncomplicated hypertension because calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs have stronger outcome data, but beta-blockers remain appropriate when there are compelling indications such as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, coronary artery disease, or angina, and metoprolol succinate is among the preferred beta-blockers in HFrEF [^786570aa] [^a74f1acf] [^6240930a]. Hold on, I should verify pregnancy guidance; metoprolol is considered acceptable in pregnancy when a beta-blocker is indicated, with labetalol generally preferred, which is important when counseling patients with childbearing potential [^bc89c55a] [^b9f81b3a].

> I will now examine safety and tolerability, because efficacy must be balanced with adverse effects. Common adverse effects include bradycardia, dizziness, and hypotension, and abrupt withdrawal can precipitate rebound hypertension, so tapering is advised when discontinuing therapy; these risks are manageable with careful dosing and monitoring in appropriate patients [^6555f70b] [^5d891a94] [^786570aa]. Let me reconsider drug–drug interactions; strong CYP2D6 inhibitors can raise metoprolol levels and blunt cardioselectivity, so dose adjustments and monitoring are prudent when coadministered with agents like fluoxetine or paroxetine [^5d891a94].

> Synthesis and conclusion: Yes, metoprolol reliably lowers blood pressure in adults with hypertension, with average placebo-corrected reductions of about 6–8/4–7 mmHg in randomized trials and larger effects reported in meta-analyses of beta-1 blockers, and this effect is mechanistically consistent with beta-1 blockade reducing cardiac output and renin activity; however, it is generally not first-line for uncomplicated hypertension unless there are compelling cardiovascular indications, and response varies with dose, formulation, and patient factors, so individualized titration and, when needed, combination therapy are essential to optimize control [^a5937a89] [^3c0844cd] [^786570aa] [^788bd29f].

Metoprolol **lowers blood pressure** by reducing heart rate and cardiac output via beta-1 blockade [^03997c52], with average placebo-corrected reductions of 6–8 mmHg systolic and 4–7 mmHg diastolic at 24 hours for metoprolol succinate ER [^a5937a89] [^1e7e212f]. Immediate-release metoprolol tartrate is effective at 100–450 mg/day [^e23b76e6], and extended-release succinate at 50–400 mg/day [^ec4fed04] provides once-daily dosing with similar efficacy [^a5937a89]. Metoprolol is **not first-line** for uncomplicated hypertension [^786570aa] due to inferior stroke and mortality outcomes versus other classes [^5354f39c], but is indicated when there is coronary disease, heart failure, or arrhythmia [^6240930a]. It is less effective in Black patients [^83c2c7f7] and may worsen glycemic control in diabetes [^9151db90]; monitor for bradycardia, fatigue, and glucose effects [^6555f70b].

---

## Mechanism of action

Metoprolol is a **beta-1 selective blocker** [^03997c52] that reduces sympathetic activity, lowering heart rate and contractility, thereby decreasing cardiac output and blood pressure [^ef0e7c7d]. It also suppresses renin release, reducing angiotensin II and aldosterone, which further lowers vascular resistance and blood volume [^03997c52].

---

## Clinical evidence of blood pressure reduction

Multiple randomized trials and reviews show metoprolol **significantly reduces blood pressure** in hypertensive patients:

- **Metoprolol succinate ER**: 6–8 mmHg systolic and 4–7 mmHg diastolic reductions at 24 hours in placebo-controlled studies [^a5937a89] [^1e7e212f].
- **Immediate-release metoprolol tartrate**: 100–450 mg/day reduces blood pressure comparably to propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazides [^e23b76e6] [^088674bc].
- **Combination therapy**: Adding hydrochlorothiazide or felodipine to metoprolol produces additive blood pressure reductions, often achieving greater control than monotherapy [^4692eebd] [^7d627b5b].

---

## Dose and formulation considerations

| **Formulation** | **Typical dose range** | **Dosing frequency** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Metoprolol tartrate (immediate-release) | 100–450 mg/day | 2–4 times daily | - Shorter half-life <br/> - Requires frequent dosing <br/> - Flexible titration [^e23b76e6] |
| Metoprolol succinate (extended-release) | 50–400 mg/day | Once daily | - Steady plasma levels <br/> - Improved adherence <br/> - Comparable efficacy to IR [^a5937a89] [^1e7e212f] |

## Comparative effectiveness with other antihypertensive agents

Metoprolol **lowers blood pressure** but is generally less effective than other first-line agents for preventing cardiovascular events. Beta-blockers, including metoprolol, are not recommended as initial therapy for uncomplicated hypertension because they are inferior to thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs for reducing stroke and mortality [^5354f39c] [^786570aa]. However, metoprolol remains **first-line** in patients with coronary artery disease, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or arrhythmias, where it provides both blood pressure control and disease-specific benefits [^6240930a] [^786570aa].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Black patients**: Beta-blockers, including metoprolol, are less effective in Black patients due to lower renin levels; thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers are preferred [^83c2c7f7] [^bd6643e3].
- **Diabetes mellitus**: Metoprolol may worsen insulin sensitivity and glycemic control; consider carvedilol or nebivolol if a beta-blocker is needed [^9151db90] [^3f6724c3].
- **Pregnancy**: Metoprolol is considered safer than atenolol and may be used when beta-blocker therapy is indicated, though labetalol is preferred [^bc89c55a] [^b9f81b3a].

---

## Side effects and tolerability

Common adverse effects include **bradycardia**, fatigue, dizziness, and cold extremities [^6555f70b]; rare effects include bronchospasm, depression, and sexual dysfunction. Metoprolol is generally well tolerated, but **monitor for hypotension and bradycardia**, especially in elderly or frail patients [^7ebadec3].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend metoprolol for hypertension when there are **compelling indications** such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, or arrhythmias [^786570aa] [^6240930a]. It is not first-line for uncomplicated hypertension due to inferior cardiovascular outcomes compared with other classes [^5354f39c] [^786570aa].

---

Metoprolol **effectively lowers blood pressure** through beta-1 blockade, with average reductions of 6–8/4–7 mmHg for succinate ER [^a5937a89]. It is not first-line for uncomplicated hypertension but is indicated when coronary disease, heart failure, or arrhythmias are present; use is individualized, with attention to race, diabetes, and tolerability [^786570aa].

1.1 Hypertension

Metoprolol tartrate tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adult patients, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including metoprolol.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

### Factorial antihypertensive study of an extended-release metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide combination [^4692eebd]. American Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Background

To attain goal blood pressure (BP), many hypertensive patients require combination antihypertensive therapy. Thiazide diuretic/beta-blocker regimens lower BP, and clinical studies indicate that they reduce the risk for cardiovascular consequences of hypertension. Fixed-dose combination tablets can simplify multidrug treatment regimens.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, unbalanced factorial study (N = 1571) was designed to determine whether hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) and extended release (ER) metoprolol both contribute to an antihypertensive effect. Hypertensive adults with sitting diastolic BP (SiDBP) 95 to 114 mm Hg and systolic BP (SiSBP) < 180 mm Hg received one of three hydrochlorothiazide doses (6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, or 25 mg), one of four ER-metoprolol doses (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg), or one of nine of the combinations or placebo for 8 weeks.

Results

Blood pressure decreased with all combinations (P < .001 v placebo); reductions were dose related, ranging from 8.7 to 15.7 mm Hg (SiDBP) and 9.7 to 18.9 mm Hg (SiSBP) (model-derived values). Reductions with placebo were 5.3 (SiDBP) and 4.2 mm Hg (SiSBP). Both active agents contributed to the combination effect (P = 0.0015 for SiDBP; P = 0.0006 for SiSBP). Several low-dose combinations were approximately as effective as high doses of the individual agents (differences within 1 to 2.5 mm Hg). The adverse event discontinuation rate was 2.9%. Serum potassium decreased and uric acid increased with increasing doses of HCT.

Conclusions

Extended-release metoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide is an effective antihypertensive combination that offers additive antihypertensive contributions from both components.

### Metoprolol succinate [^a5937a89]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Hypertension

In a double-blind study, 1,092 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized to once daily metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets (25, 100, or 400 mg), PLENDIL®(felodipine extended-release tablets), the combination, or placebo. After 9 weeks, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets alone decreased sitting blood pressure by 6 to 8/4 to 7 mmHg (placebo-corrected change from baseline) at 24 hours post-dose. The combination of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets with PLENDIL has greater effects on blood pressure.

In controlled clinical studies, an immediate-release dosage form of metoprolol was an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics at dosages of 100 to 450 mg daily. metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, produces similar β1-blockade as conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily. In addition, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets administered at a dose of 50 mg once daily lowered blood pressure 24-hours post-dosing in placebo-controlled studies. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies, immediate-release metoprolol appeared comparable as an antihypertensive agent to propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, and affected both supine and standing blood pressure. Because of variable plasma levels attained with a given dose and lack of a consistent relationship of antihypertensive activity to drug plasma concentration, selection of proper dosage requires individual titration.

14.2 Angina Pectoris

In controlled clinical trials, an immediate-release formulation of metoprolol has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 to 400 mg daily. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, has been shown to possess beta-blockade similar to conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of β-1 selective beta blockers for primary hypertension [^3c0844cd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Beta blockers are commonly used to treat hypertension. The blood pressure reading is the primary tool for physicians and patients to assess the efficacy of the treatment. The blood pressure lowering effect of beta-1 selective blockers is not known.

Objectives

To quantify the dose-related effects of various doses and types of beta-1 selective adrenergic receptor blockers on systolic and diastolic blood pressure versus placebo in people with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) for related reviews. We searched the following databases for primary studies: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register (All years to 15 October 2015), CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (2015, Issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 15 October 2015), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 15 October 2015) and ClinicalTrials.gov (all years to 15 October 2015). The Hypertension Group Specialised Register includes controlled trials from searches of CAB Abstracts, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Food Science and Technology Abstracts (FSTA), Global Health, LILACS, MEDLINE, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, PsycINFO, Web of Science and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Electronic databases were searched using a strategy combining the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomized trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity-maximizing version (2008 revision) with selected MeSH terms and free text terms. No language restrictions were used. The MEDLINE search strategy was translated into CENTRAL, EMBASE, the Hypertension Group Specialised Register and ClinicalTrials.gov using the appropriate controlled vocabulary as applicable. Full strategies are in Appendix 1.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel or cross-over trials. Studies had to contain a beta blocker monotherapy arm with fixed dose. People enrolled into the studies had to have primary hypertension at baseline. Duration of studies had to be between 3 weeks to 12 weeks. Drugs in this class of beta blockers are atenolol, betaxolol, bevantolol, bisoprolol, esmolol, metoprolol, nebivolol, pafenolol, practolol.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data independently. Review Manager (RevMan) 5.3.5 was used to synthesise data.

Main Results

We identified 56 RCTs (randomised controlled trials) that examined the blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy of beta-1 selective blockers (beta-1 blocker) in 7812 primary hypertensive patients. Among the included trials, 26 RCTs were parallel studies and 30 RCTs were cross-over studies, examining eight beta-1 blockers. Overall, the majority of beta-1 blockers studied significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). In people with mild to moderate hypertension, beta-1 selective blockers lowered BP by an average of -10/-8 mmHg and reduced heart rate by 11 beats per minute. The maximum BP reduction of beta-1 blockers occurred at twice the starting dose. Individual beta-1 blockers did not exhibit a graded dose-response effect on SBP and DBP over the recommended dose range. Most beta-1 blockers tested significantly lowered heart rate. A graded dose-response of beta-1 blockers on heart rate was evident. Higher dose beta-1 blockers lowered heart rate more than lower doses. Individually and overall beta-1 blockers did not affect pulse pressure, which distinguishes them from other classes of drugs.

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides low quality evidence that in people with mild to moderate hypertension, beta-1 selective blockers lowered BP by an average of -10/-8 mmHg and reduced heart rate by 11 beats per minute as compared to placebo. The effect of beta-1 blockers at peak hours, -12/-9 mmHg, was greater than the reduction at trough hours, -8/-7 mmHg. Beta-1 selective blockers lowered BP by a greater magnitude than dual receptor beta-blockers and partial agonist beta-blockers, lowered BP similarly to nonselective beta-blockers. Beta-1 selective blockers lowered SBP by a similar degree and lowered DBP by a greater degree than diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Because DBP is lowered by a similar extent to SBP, beta-1 selective blockers do not reduce pulse pressure.

### Metoprolol succinate er tablets (metoprolol succinate) [^1e7e212f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Hypertension

In a double-blind study, 1092 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized to once daily metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets (25 mg, 100 mg, or 400 mg), PLENDIL® (felodipine extended-release tablets), the combination, or placebo. After 9 weeks, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets alone decreased sitting blood pressure by 6–8/4–7 mmHg (placebo-corrected change from baseline) at 24 hours post-dose. The combination of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets with PLENDIL has greater effects on blood pressure.

In controlled clinical studies, an immediate-release dosage form of metoprolol was an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics at dosages of 100 mg to 450 mg daily. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, in dosages of 100 mg to 400 mg once daily, produces similar β1-blockade as conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily. In addition, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets administered at a dose of 50 mg once daily lowered blood pressure 24-hours post-dosing in placebo-controlled studies. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies, immediate-release metoprolol appeared comparable as an antihypertensive agent to propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, and affected both supine and standing blood pressure. Because of variable plasma levels attained with a given dose and lack of a consistent relationship of antihypertensive activity to drug plasma concentration, selection of proper dosage requires individual titration.

14.2 Angina Pectoris

In controlled clinical trials, an immediate-release formulation of metoprolol has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 to 400 mg daily. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, has been shown to possess betablockade similar to conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily.

14.1 Hypertension

In a double-blind study, 1092 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized to once daily metoprolol succinate (25, 100, or 400 mg), PLENDIL®(felodipine extended-release tablets), the combination, or placebo. After 9 weeks, metoprolol succinate alone decreased sitting blood pressure by 6–8 mmHg /4–7 mmHg (placebo-corrected change from baseline) at 24 hours post-dose. The combination of metoprolol succinate with PLENDIL®has greater effects on blood pressure.

In controlled clinical studies, an immediate-release dosage form of metoprolol was an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics at dosages of 100 to 450 mg daily.

### A factorial study of combination hypertension treatment with metoprolol succinate extended release and felodipine extended release results of the metoprolol succinate-felodipine antihypertension combination trial (M-FACT) [^7d627b5b]. American Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Many hypertensive patients require combination therapy to achieve target blood pressure (BP). beta-Blockers and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are effective as monotherapy in hypertensive patients and have complementary mechanisms for lowering BP.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, unbalanced factorial study included a 4- to 5-week single-blind placebo, 9-week, double-blind treatment as well as a 2-week double-blind, down-titration period. Patients (N = 1092) were randomized to one of 16 treatment groups: extended-release (ER) metoprolol succinate (25, 100, or 400 mg), ER felodipine (2.5, 10, or 20 mg), ER felodipine/ER metoprolol succinate (2.5/25, 2.5/100, 2.5/400, 10/25, 10/100, 10/400, 20/25, 20/100, or 20/400 mg), or placebo.

Results

At baseline, treatment groups were well balanced; mean sitting BP was 152.6/99.9 mm Hg. Monotherapy with ER metoprolol succinate induced dose-related reductions in sitting systolic/diastolic BP (DBP) (mean 8.1/7.7 to 9.7/11.1 mm Hg) as did ER felodipine (mean 7.7/7.7 to 14.0/11.8) and the combinations reflected additive effects (mean 13.8/11.0 to 19.8/15.2). The decline in the placebo group was 2.1/4.0 mm Hg. All combinations were more effective than their components (P < .05 for all but ER metoprolol succinate 25/ER felodipine 20). When compared with the highest doses of the individual agents (ER metoprolol succinate 400 mg; ER felodipine 20 mg), the low-dose combination ER metoprolol succinate 25/ER felodipine 2.5 was approximately as effective (differences in DBP < 1 mm Hg). The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were peripheral edema (4%), headache (2%), and fatigue (1%). Higher rates of peripheral edema and flushing were associated with high-dose ER felodipine, either alone or in combination.

Conclusions

The antihypertensive effects of ER metoprolol succinate and ER felodipine are dose-related, and when given in combination, their BP-lowering effects are additive over a wide dose range. Low-dose combination therapy is comparable in effectiveness to high-dose monotherapy but is better tolerated.

### Metoprolol (Metoprolol tartrate) [^e23b76e6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Hypertension

In controlled clinical studies, metoprolol tartrate has been shown to be an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics, at dosages of 100 mg to 450 mg daily. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies, metoprolol tartrate has been shown to be as effective an antihypertensive agent as propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, to be equally effective in supine and standing positions.

14.2 Angina Pectoris

In controlled clinical trials, metoprolol tartrate, administered two or four times daily, has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 mg to 400 mg daily. A controlled, comparative, clinical trial showed that metoprolol tartrate was indistinguishable from propranolol in the treatment of angina pectoris.

### Pharmacokinetics and CYP2D6 genotypes do not predict metoprolol adverse events or efficacy in hypertension [^1a3317ae]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Beta-Blocker use can be associated with adverse effects that may have an impact on adherence or harm patients. The commonly prescribed beta-blocker metoprolol is metabolized by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 enzyme, resulting in widely variable drug exposure. We investigated whether metoprolol plasma concentrations, CYP2D6 polymorphisms, or genotype-derived phenotype was associated with adverse effects or efficacy in patients with hypertension.

Methods

Fifty hypertensive patients received metoprolol by use of a dose-titration algorithm until target blood pressure was reached, intolerable side effects occurred, or maximal daily dose was achieved. CYP2D6 genotype was determined by methods based on polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and included 19 allelic variants. Patients were assigned to standard phenotype groups on the basis of genotype. Patients were also assigned activity scores based on functional activity of the alleles. General and dose-limiting adverse events and blood pressure responses were analyzed in relation to metoprolol steady-state pharmacokinetic profile and CYP2D6 genotype-derived phenotype.

Results

Poor metabolizers had a significantly longer elimination half-life, higher S-metoprolol area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), and lower oral clearance (P ≤ .007 for all parameters). There was a 29.6-fold variability in AUC among extensive metabolizers, which was largely explained by CYP2D6 activity scores (P = 0.032 for ordered differences in AUC by activity score among extensive metabolizers). Overall general and dose-limiting adverse event rates were 46% and 14%, respectively. General adverse event rates did not differ by AUC quartile (66.7% [95% confidence interval (CI), 35.4%-88.7%] and 41.7% [95% CI, 16.5%-71.4%] in the lowest and highest quartiles, respectively; P = 0.09 among all quartiles). Dose-limiting adverse event rates were also not different by AUC quartile (16.7% [95% CI, 2.9%-49.1%] and 8.3% [95% CI, 0.4%-40.2%] in the lowest and highest quartiles; P = 0.35 among all quartiles). Furthermore, adverse event rates did not differ by activity scores or between extensive, intermediate, or poor metabolizers. Antihypertensive response rate and blood pressure changes also were not influenced by differences in plasma concentrations or CYP2D6 genotypes.

Conclusions

As expected, CYP2D6 genotype-phenotype correlates with differences in metoprolol pharmacokinetics. However, there was no association between variable pharmacokinetics or CYP2D6 genotype and beta-blocker-induced adverse effects or efficacy.

### Β-blockers: a review of their pharmacological and physiological diversity in hypertension [^72434254]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic properties of commonly used β-blockers (atenolol, carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, metoprolol tartrate, and nebivolol).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE literature search (1966-May 2013) was performed using the following key terms: hypertension, β-blockers, atenolol, carvedilol, metoprolol tartrate, metoprolol succinate, nebivolol, pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, blood pressure, metabolic, lipid, central aortic pressure, diabetes, and insulin resistance. References from publications reviewed were included.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language articles identified were reviewed. Animal studies and studies in patients for a primary diagnosis of coronary artery disease were excluded.

Data Synthesis

β-Blockers are no longer recommended first-line therapy for primary hypertension, based on data showing that β-blockers are inferior to other antihypertensives and no better than placebo, in spite of provision of blood pressure reduction. Because atenolol is the β-blocker used in 75% of these studies, uncertainty about widespread application to all β-blockers exists. Different pharmacological and physiological properties, both within β-blockers and compared with other antihypertensives, may explain divergent effects. Evidence shows that β-blockers have a truncated effect on central aortic pressure, an independent predictor of cardiovascular events, compared with other antihypertensive classes; differences within the class may exist, but the evidence is inconclusive. Metabolic effects differ within the β-blocker class, with evidence that carvedilol causes less metabolic dysregulation.

Conclusion

Emerging evidence reveals physiological differences within the β-blocker class and in comparison to other antihypertensives. These differences provide insight into the diverse clinical effects β-blockers provide in cardiovascular disease.

### Metoprolol prevents sodium retention induced by lower body negative pressure in healthy men [^47ef78ec]. Kidney International (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) has been shown to induce a progressive activation of neurohormonal systems, and a renal tubular and hemodynamic response that mimics the renal adaptation observed in congestive heart failure (CHF). As beta-blockers play an important role in the management of CHF patients, the effects of metoprolol on the renal response were examined in healthy subjects during sustained LBNP.

Methods

Twenty healthy male subjects were randomized in this double blind, placebo versus metoprolol 200 mg once daily, study. After 10 days of treatment, each subject was exposed to 3 levels of LBNP (0, -10, and -20 mbar) for 1 hour, each level of LBNP being separated by 2 days. Neurohormonal profiles, systemic and renal hemodynamics, as well as renal sodium handling were measured before, during, and after LBNP.

Results

Blood pressure and heart rate were significantly lower in the metoprolol group throughout the study (P < 0.01). GFR and RPF were similar in both groups at baseline, and no change in renal hemodynamic values was detected at any level of LBNP. However, a reduction in sodium excretion was observed in the placebo group at -20 mbar, whereas no change was detected in the metoprolol group. An increase in plasma renin activity was also observed at -20 mbar in the placebo group that was not observed with metoprolol.

Conclusion

The beta-blocker metoprolol prevents the sodium retention induced by lower body negative pressure in healthy subjects despite a lower blood pressure. The prevention of sodium retention may be due to a blunting of the neurohormonal response. These effects of metoprolol on the renal response to LBNP may in part explain the beneficial effects of this agent in heart failure patients.

### Metoprolol (Metoprolol tartrate) [^03997c52]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Metoprolol is a beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent. This preferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher plasma concentrations, metoprolol also inhibits beta2-adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature.

Metoprolol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and membrane-stabilizing activity is detectable only at plasma concentrations much greater than required for beta-blockade. Animal and human experiments indicate that metoprolol slows the sinus rate and decreases AV nodal conduction.

The relative beta1-selectivity of metoprolol has been confirmed by the following: (1) In normal subjects, metoprolol is unable to reverse the beta2-mediated vasodilating effects of epinephrine. This contrasts with the effect of nonselective beta-blockers, which completely reverse the vasodilating effects of epinephrine. (2) In asthmatic patients, metoprolol reduces FEV1 and FVC significantly less than a nonselective beta-blocker, propranolol, at equivalent beta1-receptor blocking doses.

Hypertension: The mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of beta-blocking agents has not been elucidated. However, several possible mechanisms have been proposed: (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output; (2) a central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery; and (3) suppression of renin activity.

Angina Pectoris: By blocking catecholamine-induced increases in heart rate, in velocity and extent of myocardial contraction, and in blood pressure, metoprolol reduces the oxygen requirements of the heart at any given level of effort, thus making it useful in the long-term management of angina pectoris.

Heart Failure: The precise mechanism for the beneficial effects of beta-blockers in heart failure has not been elucidated.

### Nebivolol, but not metoprolol, lowers blood pressure in nitric oxide-sensitive human hypertension [^3683a89f]. Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Nebivolol, unlike other selective β1-receptor blockers, induces vasodilation attributable to increased NO bioavailability. The relative contribution of this mechanism to the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects of nebivolol is unclear because it is normally masked by baroreflex buffering. Autonomic failure provides a unique model of hypertension devoid of autonomic modulation but sensitive to the hypotensive effects of NO potentiation. We tested the hypothesis that nebivolol would decrease BP in these patients through a mechanism independent of β-blockade. We randomized 20 autonomic failure patients with supine hypertension (14 men; 69 ± 2 years) to receive a single oral dose of placebo, nebivolol 5 mg, metoprolol 50 mg (negative control), and sildenafil 25 mg (positive control) on separate nights in a double-blind, crossover study. Supine BP was monitored every 2 hours from 8:00 pm to 8:00 am. Compared with placebo, sildenafil and nebivolol decreased systolic BP during the night (P < 0.001 and P = 0.036, by mixed-effects model, maximal systolic BP reduction 8-hour postdrug of -20 ± 6 and -24 ± 9 mm Hg, respectively), whereas metoprolol had no effect. In a subanalysis, we divided patients into sildenafil responders (BP fall > 20 mm Hg at 4:00 am) and nonresponders. Nebivolol significantly lowered systolic BP in sildenafil responders (-44 ± 13 mm Hg) but not in nonresponders (1 ± 11 mm Hg). Despite lowering nighttime BP, nebivolol did not worsen morning orthostatic tolerance compared with placebo. In conclusion, nebivolol effectively lowered supine hypertension in autonomic failure, independent of β1-blockade. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that NO potentiation contributes significantly to the antihypertensive effect of nebivolol.

The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide diuretics is unknown.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Metoprolol

Clinical pharmacology studies have confirmed the beta-blocking activity of metoprolol in man, as shown by (1) reduction in heart rate and cardiac output at rest and upon exercise, (2) reduction of systolic blood pressure upon exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia.

Significant beta-blocking effect (as measured by reduction of exercise heart rate) occurs within 1 hour after oral administration, and its duration is dose-related. For example, a 50% reduction of the maximum registered effect after single oral doses of 20, 50, and 100 mg occurred at 3.3, 5.0, and 6.4 hours, respectively, in normal subjects. After repeated oral dosages of 100 mg twice daily, a significant reduction in exercise systolic blood pressure was evident at 12 hours.

There is a linear relationship between the log of plasma levels and reduction of exercise heart rate. However, antihypertensive activity does not appear to be related to plasma levels. Because of variable plasma levels attained with a given dose and lack of a consistent relationship of antihypertensive activity to dose, selection of proper dosage requires individual titration.

The onset of action of thiazides occurs in 2 hours and the peak effect at about 4 hours. The action persists for approximately 6 to 12 hours.

### Efficacy and safety of extended release metoprolol succinate in hypertensive children 6 to 16 years of age: a clinical trial experience [^d9b18316]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and blood pressure (BP) lowering effect of extended release metoprolol succinate (ER metoprolol) in children 6 to 16 years of age with established hypertension.

Study Design

Patients were randomized to one of four treatment arms: placebo or ER metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, or 2.0 mg/kg). Data were analyzed on 140 intent-to-treat patients.

Results

Mean age (± SD) was 12.5 ± 2.8 years and mean baseline BP was 132/78 ± 9/9 mmHg. Following 4 weeks of treatment, mean changes in sitting BP were: placebo = -1.9/-2.1 mmHg; ER metoprolol 0.2 mg/kg = -5.2/-3.1 mmHg; 1.0 mg/kg = -7.7/-4.9 mmHg; 2.0 mg/kg = -6.3/-7.5 mmHg. Compared with placebo, ER metoprolol significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) at the 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg dose (P = 0.027 and P = 0.049, respectively), reduced diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at the 2.0 mg/kg dose (P = 0.017), and showed a statistically significant dose response relationship for the placebo-corrected change in DBP from baseline. There were no serious adverse events or adverse events requiring study drug discontinuation among patients receiving active therapy.

Conclusion

These data indicate that ER metoprolol is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for hypertension in children.

### Β-blockers in hypertension: is carvedilol different? [^63bae4f1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Most studies assessing the effects of beta-blockers were carried out with traditional, beta(1)-selective beta-blockers, such as metoprolol and atenolol. Pathophysiologic and pharmacologic studies have documented that not all beta-blockers are created equal. In particular, the pharmacologic and clinical profiles of the newer, vasodilating beta-blockers, such as carvedilol, have been shown to differ from those of the traditional beta-blockers. These differences, although relevant in the younger patient with hypertension, are particularly important in elderly patients in whom traditional beta-blockers may not be as effective or as well tolerated as the newer vasodilating agents.

(2) In asthmatic patients, metoprolol reduces FEV1and FVC significantly less than a nonselective beta-blocker, propranolol, at equivalent beta1-receptor blocking doses.

The precise mechanism of action of metoprolol tartrate injection in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction is not known.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

When the drug was infused over a 10-minute period, in normal volunteers, maximum beta blockade was achieved at approximately 20 minutes. Equivalent maximal beta-blocking effect is achieved with oral and intravenous doses in the ratio of approximately 2.5:1. There is a linear relationship between the log of plasma levels and reduction of exercise heart rate.

In several studies of patients with acute myocardial infarction, intravenous followed by oral administration of metoprolol tartrate injection caused a reduction in heart rate, systolic blood pressure and cardiac output. Stroke volume, diastolic blood pressure and pulmonary artery end diastolic pressure remained unchanged.

Special population

Geriatric patients: The geriatric population may show slightly higher plasma concentrations of metoprolol as a combined result of a decreased metabolism of the drug in elderly population and a decreased hepatic blood flow. However, this increase is not clinically significant or therapeutically relevant.

Renal impairment: The systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol tartrate in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in normal subjects.

Hepatic Impairment: Since the drug is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism, hepatic impairment may impact the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol. The elimination half-life of metoprolol is considerably prolonged, depending on severity (up to 7.2 h).

Clinical Studies:

Hypertension

In controlled clinical studies, metoprolol tartrate has been shown to be an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics, at dosages of 100–450 mg daily. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies, metoprolol tartrate has been shown to be as effective an antihypertensive agent as propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, to be equally effective in supine and standing positions.

Angina Pectoris

In controlled clinical trials, metoprolol tartrate, administered two or four times daily, has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100–400 mg daily. A controlled, comparative, clinical trial showed that metoprolol tartrate was indistinguishable from propranolol in the treatment of angina pectoris.

### Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics than to ACE inhibitors and β-adrenergic blockers? A systematic review [^83c2c7f7]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of systolic blood pressure lowering of β-adrenergic blockade as monotherapy in uncomplicated essential hypertension is not significantly different from placebo in patients of African ancestry, and some trials report significant placebo corrected increase in blood pressure with β-adrenergic blockade in this population group The main side effects are metabolic, including higher glucose levels.

Environmental factors

To our knowledge, there are no environmental factors reported that may help explain the attenuated blood pressure lowering response of patients of African ancestry to β-adrenergic blockade. In the TAIM study, adding sodium restriction (mean 100 mmol/day) to an atenolol regimen (usual/sodium restricted diet: atenolol n = 22/29; placebo n = 26/19) did not enhance the blood pressure lowering effect.

Pharmacokinetics

Studies on the differences in the pharmacokinetics of β-adrenergic blockers based on ancestry yielded heterogeneous results. Oral clearance of L-propranolol was reported to be similar, or higher in persons of African, than in persons of European, ancestry (respectively 28 ml/min/kg, SD 8; vs 21, SD 7; P < 0.05), with similar, or up to 25% lower peak plasma concentrations. In line with this, hepatic metabolism of propranolol via side chain oxidation, 4-hydroxylation or R-propranolol glucuronidation was observed to be higher in persons of African than in those of European ancestry. However, propranolol clearance after intravenous infusion (0.1 mg/kg), was similar in one study. On the other hand, around 30% higher plasma concentrations were found after 100 mg oral metoprolol in an indirect comparison between subjects of African vs European ancestry, respectively 154 ng/ml vs 117 at t = 3 h, while others observed no significant differences in plasma peak plasma concentrations or systemic clearance. Also, metabolism of metoprolol via CYP2D6 assessed with an oral dose of 200 mg, given to men of African and European ancestry (10 in each group) was not significantly different. Finally, pharmacokinetic studies of pindolol yielded similar results in both groups.

### Genetic variation in the CYP2D6 gene is associated with a lower heart rate and blood pressure in β-blocker users [^c2f5555d]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Several beta-blockers are metabolized by the polymorphic enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). CYP2D6✱4 is the main polymorphism leading to decreased enzyme activity. The clinical significance of impaired elimination of beta-blockers is controversial, and most studies suffer from inclusion of small numbers of poor metabolizers (PMs) of CYP2D6. In this study, the association between CYP2D6✱4 and blood pressure or heart rate was examined in 1,533 users of beta-blockers in the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort study. In CYP2D6 *4/✱4 PMs, the adjusted heart rate in metoprolol users was 8.5 beats/min lower compared with *1/✱1 extensive metabolizers (EMs) (P < 0.001), leading to an increased risk of bradycardia in PMs (odds ratio = 3.86; 95% confidence interval 1.68–8.86; P = 0.0014). The diastolic blood pressure in PMs was 5.4 mm Hg lower in users of beta-blockers metabolized by CYP2D6 (P = 0.017) and 4.8 mm Hg lower in metoprolol users (P = 0.045) compared with EMs. PMs are at increased risk of bradycardia.

### Differing β-blocking effects of carvedilol and metoprolol [^f042a0b9]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Metoprolol is a beta(1)-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist while carvedilol is a non-selective beta-blocker with additional blockades of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. Administration of metoprolol has been shown to cause up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptor density and to decrease nocturnal melatonin release, whereas carvedilol lacks these typical effects of beta-blocking drugs.

Aims

To compare beta-blocking effects of metoprolol and carvedilol when applied orally in healthy subjects.

Methods

We investigated the effects of single oral doses of clinically recommended amounts of metoprolol (50, 100 and 200 mg) and carvedilol (25, 50 and 100 mg) to those of a placebo in a randomised, double-blind, cross-over study in 12 healthy male volunteers. Two hours after oral administration of the drugs heart rate and blood pressure were measured at rest, after 10 min of exercise, and after 15 min of recovery.

Results

Metoprolol tended to decrease heart rate during exercise (-21%, -25% and -24%) to a greater extent than carvedilol (-16%, -16% and -18%). At rest, increasing doses of metoprolol caused decreasing heart rates (62, 60 and 58 beats/min) whereas increasing doses of carvedilol caused increasing heart rates (62, 66 and 69 beats/min), 50 and 100 mg carvedilol failed to differ significantly from the placebo (71 beats/min).

Conclusions

We conclude that clinically recommended doses of carvedilol cause a clinically relevant beta-blockade in humans predominantly during exercise where it appears to be slightly (although not significantly) less effective than metoprolol. On the other hand, the effects of carvedilol on heart rate at rest appear rather weak, particularly in subjects with a low sympathetic tone. This might be caused by a reflex increase on sympathetic drive secondary to peripheral vasodilation resulting from the alpha-blocking effects of the drug. These results might be helpful in explaining why carvedilol, in contrast to metoprolol, may fail to cause up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptor density and does not decrease nocturnal melatonin release. This, in turn, may be a reason for the weak side-effects of carvedilol resulting from the beta-blockade. In addition, our data might be of interest in the interpretation of the forthcoming results of the COMET trial, although it has to be emphasised that they were derived from healthy subjects and, therefore, cannot be directly extrapolated to patients with heart failure.

### Differential effects of nebivolol and metoprolol on insulin sensitivity and plasminogen activator inhibitor in the metabolic syndrome [^3f6724c3]. Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Early-generation β-blockers lower blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular morality in coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure but worsen glucose homeostasis and fibrinolytic balance. Nebivolol is a third-generation β-blocker that increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide. We compared the effect of nebivolol (5 mg/d) and the β(1)-selective antagonist metoprolol (100 mg/d) on glucose homeostasis and markers of fibrinolysis in 46 subjects with metabolic syndrome. Subjects underwent a frequently sampled IV glucose tolerance test after 3-week washout and placebo treatment and after randomized treatment with study drug. After 12-week treatment, nebivolol and metoprolol equivalently decreased systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate. Neither drug affected β-cell function, disposition index, or acute insulin response to glucose. Metoprolol significantly decreased the insulin sensitivity index. In contrast, nebivolol did not affect insulin sensitivity, and the decrease in sensitivity was significantly greater after metoprolol than after nebivolol (-1.5 ± 2.5×10(-4)×min(-1) per milliunit per liter versus 0.04 ± 2.19×10(-4)×min(-1) per milliunit per liter after nebivolol; P = 0.03). Circulating plasminogen activator inhibitor also increased after treatment with metoprolol (from 9.8 ± 6.8 to 12.3 ± 7.8 ng/mL) but not nebivolol (from 10.8 ± 7.8 to 10.5 ± 6.2 ng/mL; P = 0.05 versus metoprolol). Metoprolol, but not nebivolol, increased F₂-isoprostane concentrations. In summary, treatment with metoprolol decreased insulin sensitivity and increased oxidative stress and the antifibrinolytic plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 in patients with metabolic syndrome, whereas nebivolol lacked detrimental metabolic effects. Large clinical trials are needed to compare effects of nebivolol and the β(1) receptor antagonist metoprolol on clinical outcomes in patients with hypertension and the metabolic syndrome.

### Study on genotype and phenotype of novel CYP2D6 variants using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models with metoprolol as a substrate drug [^71c03a4b]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

To investigate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of volunteers carrying CYP2D6 genotypes with unknow metabolic phenotypes, a total of 22 volunteers were recruited based on the sequencing results. Peripheral blood and urine samples were collected at specific time points after oral administration of metoprolol. A validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was used to determine the concentrations of metoprolol and α-hydroxymetoprolol. Blood pressure and electrocardiogram were also monitored. The results showed that the main pharmacokinetic parameters of metoprolol in CYP2D6✱1/✱34 carriers are similar to those in CYP2D6✱1/✱1 carriers. However, in individuals carrying the CYP2D6✱10/✱87, CYP2D6✱10/✱95, and CYP2D6✱97/✱97 genotypes, the area under the curve (AUC) and half-life (t₁/₂) of metoprolol increased by 2–3 times compared to wild type. The urinary metabolic ratio of metoprolol in these genotypes is consistent with the trends observed in plasma samples. Therefore, CYP2D6✱1/✱34 can be considered as normal metabolizers, while CYP2D6✱10/✱87, CYP2D6✱10/✱95, and CYP2D6✱97/✱97 are intermediate metabolizers. Although the blood concentration of metoprolol has been found to correlate with CYP2D6 genotype, its blood pressure-lowering effect reaches maximum effectiveness at a reduction of 25mmHg. Furthermore, P-Q interval prolongation and heart rate reduction are not positively correlated with metoprolol blood exposure. Based on the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model, this study clarified the properties of metoprolol in subjects with novel CYP2D6 genotypes and provided important fundamental data for the translational medicine of this substrate drug.

### Β-blockers in hypertension, diabetes, heart failure and acute myocardial infarction: a review of the literature [^27d30f7d]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Metoprolol

The Metoprolol Atherosclerosis Prevention in Hypertensives (MAPHY) trial was a post hoc analysis of the metoprolol arm of the HAPPHY study. It focused on male patients between 40 and 64 years of age who had a history of HTN with an untreated diastolic BP of over 100 mm Hg and investigated the effects of metoprolol on the incidence of CHD events (sudden cardiac death (SCD) and MI) compared with thiazide diuretics. Patients receiving metoprolol were significantly less likely to experience a CHD event as compared with those on diuretics (111 vs 144 cases, p = 0.001, corresponding to 14.3 vs 18.8 cases/1000 patient years; RR = 0.76 at the end of the trial; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98). Moreover, the incidence of SCD, fatal and non-fatal MI was reduced with metoprolol as compared with the diuretic treatment (p = 0.024). Similarly, the risk of silent MI (p = 0.016) and first definite non-fatal MI (p = 0.0034, 10.6 vs 14.3 cases/1000 patient years at the end of the trial) were also lower with metoprolol. It is important to note that all baseline characteristics, including BP, were similar in the 255 participants who had a CV event versus those who did not. This suggests that the benefit demonstrated by metoprolol occurred due to something other than an anti-HTN effect. Despite these beneficial results, MAPHY should be interpreted with caution because of its post hoc subgroup design.

### Comparison of bisoprolol to a metoprolol CR / ZOK tablet for control of heart rate and blood pressure in mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients: the CREATIVE study [^ad820bb8]. Hypertension Research (2017). Low credibility.

This open-label study investigated the long action of bisoprolol compared with metoprolol CR/ZOK for controlling the mean dynamic heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) in patients with mild-to-moderate primary hypertension. Patients from seven centers in China were treated with either bisoprolol 5mg or metoprolol CR/ZOK 47.5mg once daily for 12 weeks. The primary end points were the mean dynamic HR reduction and the mean dynamic diastolic BP (DBP) control in the last 4h of the treatment period. Secondary end points included ambulatory monitoring of the BP and HR, safety and compliance. A total of 186 patients, with 93 patients in each group, were enrolled and analyzed. In the last 4h of the treatment period, patients receiving bisoprolol demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in the mean dynamic HR compared with patients receiving metoprolol CR/ZOK (least squares means (LSmeans) of difference: -3.79b.p.m.; 97.5% confidence interval (CI): -7.45, -0.14; P = 0.0202). Furthermore, in the last 4h of the treatment period, bisoprolol demonstrated non-inferiority vs. metoprolol CR/ZOK in lowering the mean dynamic DBP (LSmeans of difference: -1.00; 97.5% CI: -4.79, 2.78; P = 0.5495). Bisoprolol further significantly lowered the 24-h mean ambulatory, mean daytime and mean nighttime HR. The overall adverse event rate was similar between the two groups. Noncompliance was reported in 3 (3.53%) and 6 (7.32%) patients in the bisoprolol and metoprolol CR/ZOK groups, respectively. In conclusion, bisoprolol provided superior dynamic HR reduction and non-inferior dynamic BP reduction vs. metoprolol CR/ZOK in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. No new safety concerns were found.

### Differential effects of nebivolol versus metoprolol on functional sympatholysis in hypertensive humans [^7c154a19]. Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

In young healthy humans, sympathetic vasoconstriction is markedly blunted during exercise to optimize blood flow to the metabolically active muscle. This phenomenon known as functional sympatholysis is impaired in hypertensive humans and rats by angiotensin II-dependent mechanisms, involving oxidative stress and inactivation of nitric oxide (NO). Nebivolol is a β1-adrenergic receptor blocker that has NO-dependent vasodilatory and antioxidant properties. We therefore asked whether nebivolol would restore functional sympatholysis in hypertensive humans. In 21 subjects with stage 1 hypertension, we measured muscle oxygenation and forearm blood flow responses to reflex increases in sympathetic nerve activity evoked by lower body negative pressure at rest, and during rhythmic handgrip exercise at baseline, after 12 weeks of nebivolol (5–20 mg/d) or metoprolol (100–300 mg/d), using a double-blind crossover design. We found that nebivolol had no effect on lower body negative pressure-induced decreases in oxygenation and forearm blood flow in resting forearm (from -29 ± 5% to -30 ± 5% and from -29 ± 3% to -29 ± 3%, respectively; P = NS). However, nebivolol attenuated the lower body negative pressure-induced reduction in oxygenation and forearm blood flow in exercising forearm (from -14 ± 4% to -1 ± 5% and from -15 ± 2% to -6 ± 2%, respectively; both P < 0.05). This effect of nebivolol on oxygenation and forearm blood flow in exercising forearm was not observed with metoprolol in the same subjects, despite a similar reduction in blood pressure. Nebivolol had no effect on sympathetic nerve activity at rest or during handgrip, suggesting a direct effect on vascular function. Thus, our data demonstrate that nebivolol restored functional sympatholysis in hypertensive humans by a mechanism that does not involve β1-adrenergic receptors.

Genetic polymorphisms affecting β-blockers response

Although β-blockers are generally effective, their HR-lowering effects vary among individuals. Genetic factors have been identified as the cause of this variability in the HR. Approximately 25% of medications undergo biotransformation, significantly aided by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Several β-blockers, including metoprolol, carvedilol, propranolol, labetalol, nebivolol, and timolol, are substrates of the CYP2D6 enzyme. Metoprolol is a primary β-blocker whose pharmacokinetic variability, largely due to its dependence on CYP2D6 for metabolism, may lead to significant differences in pharmacodynamic responses among individuals. Many studies have shown that CYP2D6 poor and intermediate metabolizers exhibit decreased apparent oral clearance of metoprolol. These pharmacokinetic differences primarily result in variations in heart rate (HR) response; however, other CYP2D6 phenotypes do not appear to significantly affect the response to β-blockers –. The CYP2D6 genotype is linked to a changed HR response to β-blocker therapy, and it has been demonstrated that the CYP2D6 phenotype is one of the most important indicators of variation in HR response to metoprolol. Notably, the HR indicates the level of β1AR blockade when β-blocker therapy is administered. The correlations between HR and CYP2D6 genotype were consistent, but the correlations between blood pressure and other responses were weaker. However, some studies have shown a positive correlation between the CYP2D6 genotype and blood pressure response.

Sympathetic nervous system activation mediates chronotropic, dromotropic, and inotropic effects through β1AR, which are GPCRs encoded by adrenoceptor beta 1 (ADRB1). These receptors are mainly expressed in cardiac tissue. The ADRB1 variants rs1801252 (ADRB1 145 A > G; Ser49Gly) and rs1801253 (ADRB1 1165 C > G; Arg389Gly) are the most prevalent and well-studied. The variant rs1801252 causes agonist-promoted downregulation, whereas the variant rs1801253 modifies G-protein coupling and G-protein-coupled cyclase activity and decreases cAMP production. The strongest evidence points to a relationship between the ADRB1 genotype and reduced diastolic blood pressure observed in response to β-blockers. However, the ADRB1 genotype was not associated with changes in HR or systolic blood pressure. Additionally, the data indicated that patients with the ADRB1 haplotype would likely benefit the most from β-blocker therapy and have a lower chance of developing MACEs and chronic heart failure.

### Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics than to ACE inhibitors and β-adrenergic blockers? A systematic review [^eeb92601]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The AASK study yielded conflicting results as time to reach the target mean arterial pressure of 107 mm Hg with metoprolol (329 participants randomized) was not significantly different for Ser49 or Gly49 variants. In contrast with studies in other population subgroups, the "hazard" ratio of reaching goal blood pressure was lower, 0.68 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.93) in individuals with at least one 'responsive' Arg389 allele compared to individuals with Gly389/Gly389.

Finally, a series of pharmacogenomics studies did not further explain why patients of African ancestry respond less to β-adrenergic blockade. The G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) codes for a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates and desensitizes G-protein-coupled receptors. However, in a study of 154 healthy subjects (69 of African ancestry), GRK5 Gln41Leu polymorphism, present in approximately 40% of the persons of African and 2% of individuals European of ancestry, did not affect the response to atenolol. Furthermore, polymorphisms of the GRK2 gene (ADRBK1) and GRK5 Gln41Leu polymorphisms, studied in 418 patients (167 of African ancestry) from the PEAR study did not affect the blood pressure response to atenolol. Finally, the polymorphisms Arg65Leu, Ala142Val, and Ala486Val of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase gene, GRK4, were studied in the AASK Study. Only in men randomized to the usual blood pressure goal (mean arterial pressure 102 to 107 mm Hg), the adjusted "hazard" ratio to reach goal blood pressure with metoprolol was 1.54 (95% CI 1.11 to 2.44; P < 0.01) with Ala142Val. There was no association between GRK4 polymorphisms and blood pressure response to metoprolol in women. Thus, despite extensive research, there is no clear pharmacogenomic evidence why patients of African ancestry may have a differential response to β-adrenergic blockade.

### Metabolic effects of carvedilol vs metoprolol in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension: a randomized controlled trial [^9151db90]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Beta-blockers have been shown to decrease cardiovascular risk in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM); however, some components of the metabolic syndrome are worsened by some beta-blockers.

Objective

To compare the effects of beta-blockers with different pharmacological profiles on glycemic and metabolic control in participants with DM and hypertension receiving renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade, in the context of cardiovascular risk factors.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial (The Glycemic Effects in Diabetes Mellitus: Carvedilol-Metoprolol Comparison in Hypertensives [GEMINI]) conducted between June 1, 2001, and April 6, 2004, at 205 US sites that compared the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol tartrate on glycemic control. The 1235 participants were aged 36 to 85 years with hypertension (> 130/80 mm Hg) and type 2 DM (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c], 6.5%-8.5%) and were receiving RAS blockers. Participants were followed up for 35 weeks.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to receive a 6.25- to 25-mg dose of carvedilol (n = 498) or 50- to 200-mg dose of metoprolol tartrate (n = 737), each twice daily. Open-label hydrochlorothiazide and a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist were added, if needed, to achieve blood pressure target.

Main Outcome Measures

Difference between groups in mean change from baseline HbA1c following 5 months of maintenance therapy. Additional prespecified comparisons included change from baseline HbA1c in individual treatment groups, treatment effect on insulin sensitivity, and microalbuminuria.

Results

The 2 groups differed in mean change in HbA1c from baseline (0.13%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.22% to -0.04%; P = 0.004; modified intention-to-treat analysis). The mean (SD) HbA1c increased with metoprolol (0.15% [0.04%]; P < .001) but not carvedilol (0.02% [0.04%]; P = 0.65). Insulin sensitivity improved with carvedilol (-9.1%; P = 0.004) but not metoprolol (-2.0%; P = 0.48); the between-group difference was -7.2% (95% CI, -13.8% to -0.2%; P = 0.004). Blood pressure was similar between groups. Progression to microalbuminuria was less frequent with carvedilol than with metoprolol (6.4% vs 10.3%; odds ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.36–0.97; P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Both beta-blockers were well tolerated; use of carvedilol in the presence of RAS blockade did not affect glycemic control and improved some components of the metabolic syndrome relative to metoprolol in participants with DM and hypertension. The effects of the 2 beta-blockers on clinical outcomes need to be compared in long-term clinical trials.

### Β-blockers as initial therapy for hypertension [^5354f39c]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are β-blockers associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events when used as initial treatment in individuals with hypertension compared with placebo, no treatment, or other drugs?

Bottom Line

Initial therapy of hypertension with β-blockers is not associated with reduced all-cause mortality but is associated with modest reductions in cardiovascular events compared with placebo or no treatment. Calcium channel blockers and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are associated with greater reductions in cardiovascular event rates than β-blockers. This evidence derives from trials of traditional β-blockers (eg, atenolol and propranolol), because there are currently no mortality and cardiovascular event data on the new vasodilating β-blockers (eg, carvedilol and nebivolol).

### Metoroprolol tartrate (metoprolol tartrate) [^bb4c0a93]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Metoprolol is a beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent. This preferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher plasma concentrations, metoprolol also inhibits beta2-adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature.

Metoprolol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and membrane-stabilizing activity is detectable only at plasma concentrations much greater than required for beta-blockade. Animal and human experiments indicate that metoprolol slows the sinus rate and decreases AV nodal conduction.

The relative beta1-selectivity of metoprolol has been confirmed by the following: (1) In normal subjects, metoprolol is unable to reverse the beta2-mediated vasodilating effects of epinephrine. This contrasts with the effect of nonselective beta-blockers, which completely reverse the vasodilating effects of epinephrine. (2) In asthmatic patients, metoprolol reduces FEV1and FVC significantly less than a nonselective beta-blocker, propranolol, at equivalent beta1-receptor blocking doses.

The precise mechanism of action of Metoprolol Tartrate Injection in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction is not known.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

When the drug was infused over a 10-minute period, in normal volunteers, maximum beta blockade was achieved at approximately 20 minutes. Equivalent maximal beta-blocking effect is achieved with oral and intravenous doses in the ratio of approximately 2.5:1. There is a linear relationship between the log of plasma levels and reduction of exercise heart rate.

In several studies of patients with acute myocardial infarction, intravenous followed by oral administration of Metoprolol Tartrate Injection caused a reduction in heart rate, systolic blood pressure and cardiac output. Stroke volume, diastolic blood pressure and pulmonary artery end diastolic pressure remained unchanged.

### Effect of blood pressure lowering and antihypertensive drug class on progression of hypertensive kidney disease: results from the AASK trial [^46618e2d]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Hypertension is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States, with no known treatment to prevent progressive declines leading to ESRD.

Objective

To compare the effects of 2 levels of blood pressure (BP) control and 3 antihypertensive drug classes on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline in hypertension.

Design

Randomized 3 x 2 factorial trial with enrollment from February 1995 to September 1998.

Setting and Participants

A total of 1094 African Americans aged 18 to 70 years with hypertensive renal disease (GFR, 20–65 mL/min per 1.73 m²) were recruited from 21 clinical centers throughout the United States and followed up for 3 to 6.4 years.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 mean arterial pressure goals, 102 to 107 mm Hg (usual; n = 554) or 92 mm Hg or less (lower; n = 540), and to initial treatment with either a beta-blocker (metoprolol 50–200 mg/d; n = 441), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ramipril 2.5–10 mg/d; n = 436) or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, (amlodipine 5–10 mg/d; n = 217). Open-label agents were added to achieve the assigned BP goals.

Main Outcome Measures

Rate of change in GFR (GFR slope); clinical composite outcome of reduction in GFR by 50% or more (or ≥ 25 mL/min per 1.73 m²) from baseline, ESRD, or death. Three primary treatment comparisons were specified: lower vs usual BP goal; ramipril vs metoprolol; and amlodipine vs metoprolol.

Results

Achieved BP averaged (SD) 128/78 (12/8) mm Hg in the lower BP group and 141/85 (12/7) mm Hg in the usual BP group. The mean (SE) GFR slope from baseline through 4 years did not differ significantly between the lower BP group (-2.21 [0.17] mL/min per 1.73 m² per year) and the usual BP group (-1.95 [0.17] mL/min per 1.73 m² per year; P = 0.24), and the lower BP goal did not significantly reduce the rate of the clinical composite outcome (risk reduction for lower BP group = 2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -22% to 21%; P = 0.85). None of the drug group comparisons showed consistent significant differences in the GFR slope. However, compared with the metoprolol and amlodipine groups, the ramipril group manifested risk reductions in the clinical composite outcome of 22% (95% CI, 1%-38%; P = 0.04) and 38% (95% CI, 14%-56%; P = 0.004), respectively. There was no significant difference in the clinical composite outcome between the amlodipine and metoprolol groups.

Conclusions

No additional benefit of slowing progression of hypertensive nephrosclerosis was observed with the lower BP goal. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to be more effective than beta-blockers or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in slowing GFR decline.

### Nebivolol, but not metoprolol, treatment improves endothelial fibrinolytic capacity in adults with elevated blood pressure [^f47d54df]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Adults with elevated blood pressure (BP) are at increased risk of atherothrombotic events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. 1 Elevated oxidative stress in adults with hypertension likely contributes to alterations in vascular endothelial function leading to a prothrombotic state. 2, 3 Impairments in endogenous fibrinolysis play a mechanistic role in the development of atherothrombotic events in this high‐risk population. 1 The capacity of the vascular endothelium to release tissue‐type plasminogen activator (t‐PA) is a sensitive indicator of endogenous fibrinolytic potential. Endothelial t‐PA release has been mechanistically linked to the prevention of arterial thrombosis and clinical cardiovascular events and is impaired in humans with elevated BP. 4, 5, 6

Mitigation of clinical risk in adults with elevated BP has been generally attributed to the benefit of BP lowering independent of method. However, since the specific mechanisms underlying this benefit remain incompletely defined, it has been proposed that some BP‐lowering medications have unique end organ effects that might impart additional benefit. Indeed, in vivo studies have demonstrated that several agents improve endothelial t‐PA release in adults with hypertension while others show no benefit. 7, 8 However, there are no data regarding the influence of chronic β‐blocker therapy on endogenous fibrinolysis.

Nebivolol, a third‐generation β‐blocker with high selectivity for β 1 ‐adrenergic receptors and unique antioxidant effects, has proven to be highly effective in treating hypertension. 9, 10, 11 Nebivolol exhibits unique properties that distinguish it from other β‐blockers. For example, nebivolol has been shown to enhance both basal and stimulated nitric oxide (NO) release resulting in lower oxidative stress, 12, 13 peripheral vasodilation, and improved endothelial vasomotor function. 4, 14, 15 There are also data to suggest that nebivolol may have favorable effects on the fibrinolytic system, 16, 17 but there is currently no in vivo clinical evidence that treatment with nebivolol improves vascular endothelial t‐PA release. Enhancing endothelial fibrinolytic capacity may represent an important thromboprotective effect of nebivolol.

### The effect of blood pressure lowering medications on the prevention of episodic migraine: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^675a1966]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Currently, only a few specific blood pressure-lowering medications are recommended for migraine prevention. Whether benefits extend to other classes or drugs is uncertain.

Methods

Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials were searched for randomized control trials on the effect of blood pressure-lowering medications compared with placebo in participants with episodic migraine. Data were collected on four outcomes - monthly headache or migraine days, and monthly headache or migraine attacks, with a standardised mean difference calculated for overall. Random effect meta-analysis was performed.

Results

In total, 50 trials (70% of which were crossover) were included, comprising 60 comparisons. Overall mean age was 39 years, and 79% were female. Monthly headache days were fewer in all classes compared to placebo, and this was statistically significant for all but one class: alpha-blockers -0.7 (95% CI: -1.2, -0.1), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors -1.3 (95% CI: -2.9, 0.2), angiotensin II receptor blockers -0.9 (-1.6, -0.1), beta-blocker -0.4 (-0.8, -0.0) and calcium channel blockers -1.8 (-3.4, -0.2). Standardised mean difference was significantly reduced for all drug classes and was separately significant for numerous specific drugs: clonidine, candesartan, atenolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, propranolol, timolol, nicardipine and verapamil.

Conclusion

Among people with episodic migraine, a broader number of blood pressure-lowering medication classes and drugs reduce headache frequency than those currently included in treatment guidelines. Trial Registration: The study was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42017079176).

### Influence of heart rate, blood pressure, and β-blocker dose on outcome and the differences in outcome between carvedilol and metoprolol tartrate in patients with chronic heart failure: results from the COMET trial [^0c1f9641]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

We studied the influence of heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and beta-blocker dose on outcome in the 2599 out of 3029 patients in Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) who were alive and on study drug at 4 months after randomization (time of first visit on maintenance therapy).

Methods and Results

By multivariable analysis, baseline HR, baseline SBP, and their change after 4 months were not independently related to subsequent outcome. In a multivariable analysis including clinical variables, HR above and SBP below the median value achieved at 4 months predicted subsequent increased mortality [relative risk (RR) for HR > 68 b.p.m. 1.333; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.152–1.542; P < 0.0001 and RR for SBP > 120 mmHg 0.78; 95% CI 0.671–0.907; P < 0.0013]. Achieving target beta-blocker dose was associated with a better outcome (RR 0.779; 95% CI 0.662–0.916; P < 0.0025). The superiority of carvedilol as compared to metoprolol tartrate was maintained in a multivariable model (RR 0.767; 95% CI 0.663–0.887; P = 0.0004) and there was no interaction with HR, SBP, or beta-blocker dose.

Conclusion

Beta-blocker dose, HR, and SBP achieved during beta-blocker therapy have independent prognostic value in heart failure. None of these factors influenced the beneficial effects of carvedilol when compared with metoprolol tartrate at the pre-defined target doses used in COMET.

### First-line β-blocker use for hypertension in the veterans health administration [^481a752b]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Compared with first-line agents, β-blockers represent the most pharmacodynamically heterogenous antihypertensive medication class. Individual β-blockers vary by β-1 receptor selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and peripheral vasodilation via alpha-1 blockade or nitric oxide release. Atenolol, a β-1 selective antagonist without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity or vasodilation properties, was the β-blocker used in many early trials comparing β-blockers with placebo or other antihypertensives. These pivotal trials determined that β-blockers were superior to placebo to prevent CVD but inferior to thiazides, CCBs, or ARBs to prevent CVD, specifically stroke and all-cause mortality. These data, supported by subsequent meta-analyses, formed the basis for not recommending β-blockers as a first-line class due to both adverse effects (eg, fatigue and bradyarrhythmias) and inferior CVD clinical outcomes. Some argue that atenolol's shorter duration of action and once-daily dosing in these studies contributed to suboptimal BP-lowering, consequently leading to inferior stroke protection, although comparative data with other β-blockers are inconclusive. Nevertheless, the lack of efficacy was generalized to the class, despite the potential that β-blocker efficacy for essential hypertension may not be a class effect — similar to their use in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, where only metoprolol succinate, bisoprolol, and carvedilol have demonstrated outcome benefits. The 2023 ESH BP guideline takes a different stance by supporting β-blockers as first-line agents in part due to their broad utility in treating other cardiac and noncardiac conditions, facilitating individualized treatment. However, the observed high rate of β-blocker use without compelling indications suggests that prescribing patterns are driven by more than individualized treatment.

### Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics than to ACE inhibitors and β-adrenergic blockers? A systematic review [^bd6643e3]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Pharmacodynamics

The attenuated response of persons of African ancestry to β-adrenergic blockers was extensively studied. As renin lowering contributes to the antihypertensive effect of β-adrenergic blockers, these drugs were expected to be less effective in subjects of African ancestry. Indeed, renin correlated with the blood pressure lowering response to atenolol 50 to 100 mg/d in a study including 67 subjects (33 of African ancestry). However, renin did not predict the response to propranolol (80 to 640 mg/d) in 215 participants (132 of African ancestry) of a Veterans Administration study. The relative contribution of renin vs African ancestry (β ± SE) was calculated in multivariable regression analysis, to be respectively −4.05 ± 0.84 vs −7.45 ± 1.53; both P < 0.01. Finally, in a study of 335 subjects (152 of African ancestry), therapeutic responses to atenolol 25 to 100 mg were consistent with a baseline renin profile, but age-ancestry subgroup profiling was a better predictor of response.

β-blockers are thought to lower blood pressure predominantly through a reduction in cardiac contractility and heart rate. While early studies found a reduced sensitivity to isoprenaline in healthy men of African ancestry, reports on changes in heart rate after β-blockers in healthy volunteers were conflicting, with either a greater response in persons of African ancestry (to oral propranolol 240 mg/d); an attenuated response (to intravenous propranolol up to 0.15 mg/kg, or metoprolol 50 μg/mL); or no significant difference between groups (to intravenous propranolol 0.15 mg/kg). We retrieved no studies in hypertensives.

Pharmacogenomic studies focussed on the frequency of occurrence of the responsive β1-receptor (ADRB1) genotype Arg 389/Ser 49 in persons of African ancestry, which was associated with greater blood pressure lowering responses to β-adrenergic blockade in other population subgroups.

### Combined milrinone and enteral metoprolol therapy in patients with septic myocardial depression [^31ecda76]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Heart rate significantly decreased during combined milrinone infusion and enteral metoprolol therapy in patients with septic shock and cardiac depression.

- In 97.5% of patients, targeted heart rates of 65 to 95 beats per minute were achieved.

- Enteral metoprolol therapy appears to have no major adverse effects on cardiovascular or organ function.

- Mean arterial blood pressure increased despite decreasing norepinephrine, arginine vasopressin, and milrinone dosages.

- Cardiac function economized, resulting in a maintained cardiac index with a lower heart rate and a higher stroke volume index.

### Lack of difference between nebivolol / hydrochlorothiazide and metoprolol / hydrochlorothiazide on aortic wave augmentation and central blood pressure [^34320206]. Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The vasodilating beta-blocker nebivolol is thought to be superior in lowering wave reflection and central blood pressure (BP) compared to nonvasodilating beta-blockers. The results from studies comparing nebivolol with either metoprolol or atenolol, with or without hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), are not unequivocal.

Methods

We examined the effects of nebivolol 5mg and metoprolol 100mg with HCTZ 12.5mg on aortic wave augmentation, central BP and hemodynamics using a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. We included 22 patients (17 men, age 59.9 ± 6.4 years) with office SBP of 155 ± 16mmHg and DBP of 93 ± 10mmHg. Radial applanation tonometry and noninvasive, continuous finger arterial BP measurement was performed at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment with either drug regimen, separated by a 4-week washout period.

Results

Neither treatment affected aortic wave augmentation significantly. Augmentation index increased 1.0 ± 7.8% (P = 0.5) for nebivolol/HCTZ and 2.4 ± 6.6% (P = 0.07) for metoprolol/HCTZ. Nebivolol/HCTZ lowered central SBP by 15.8 ± 14.9mmHg and DBP 10.5 ± 8.4mmHg, and with metoprolol/HCTZ by 13.5 ± 12.3mmHg for SBP and 9.5 ± 6.8mmHg for DBP (all P < 0.001). Heart rate was lowered 8.1 ± 5.4 beats/min by nebivolol/HCTZ and 8.6 ± 4.9 beats/min by metoprolol/HCTZ. Peripheral BP was reduced to a similar extent as central BP. Peripheral BP decreased by 16.3 ± 14.9mmHg systolic and 10.1 ± 8.2mmHg diastolic with nebivolol/HCTZ, and by 15.2 ± 13.0mmHg systolic and 9.1 ± 6.9 mmHg diastolic with metoprolol/HCTZ. Both treatment modalities had a similar effect on stroke volume, cardiac output, left-ventricular contractility and peripheral resistance.

Conclusion

Nebivolol was not superior to metoprolol in reducing aortic wave augmentation or central BP when combined with HCTZ.

### Felodipine-metoprolol combination tablet: maintained health-related quality of life in the presence of substantial blood pressure reduction [^57b83859]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Most treated hypertensive patients do not achieve adequate blood pressure (BP) control. Initiating therapy with two drugs has been suggested when BP is > 20/10 mm Hg above goal. To ensure patients' compliance, such treatment needs to be well tolerated and must not compromise health-related quality of life (HRQL). The primary objective of this study was to compare the effects on HRQL of initiating treatment with felodipine + metoprolol (F+M) fixed combination tablets, or enalapril (E), or placebo (P).

Methods

A total of 947 patients of both sexes with primary hypertension (diastolic BP 95 to 110 mm Hg), aged 20 to 70 years, participated in this randomized, double-blind, parallel group, 12-week, multicenter trial. Treatment was initiated with F+M 5 + 50 mg, or E 10 mg, or P. Doses were doubled after 4 or 8 weeks if diastolic BP was > 90 mm Hg. The HRQL was measured at baseline and at the last visit using two validated questionnaires: the Psychological General Well-being Index (PGWB) and the Subjective Symptom Assessment Profile (SSA-P). Office BP was measured at trough, that is, 24 h after the previous dose.

Results

The HRQL was high at baseline and generally well maintained during the study. For example, the mean (SD) PGWB total score was 104 (16) at baseline and 105 (16) at 12 weeks in all three treatment groups. The BP reductions after F+M (18/14 mm Hg) and E (12/9 mm Hg) were significantly greater than after P (7/7 mm Hg), and the reduction after F+M was significantly greater than after E.

Conclusions

The HRQL is maintained in the presence of substantial BP reduction during antihypertensive treatment with F+M fixed combination tablets.

### Cost-effectiveness of nitrendipine and hydrochlorothiazide or metoprolol to treat hypertension in rural community health centers in China [^a6710c20]. Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hypertension, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease is a global public health issue. More than 50% of cardiovascular disease is associated with elevated blood pressure (BP), which is becoming one of the most costly health conditions, a problem that will only grow to the rising prevalence of obesity, sedentary lifestyles, and an ageing society.

Reducing BP significantly reduces the risk of major clinical cardiovascular outcomes (fatal and nonfatal stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure) and this has been shown in multiple randomized clinical trials. In addition, these trials confirmed that more hypertensive patients require at least two drugs to reduce BP to below 140/90 mmHg. Rational drug combinations at appropriate dose are helpful to improve tolerability and compliance, which are essential for hypertensive control. For many patients in China, low compliance is associated with drug cost.

Synergistic antihypertensive effects of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and thiazide diuretics or β-blockers and thiazide diuretics have been confirmed. In China, some CCBs and β-blockers as well as thiazide diuretics are low cost but whether these drugs are efficacious in this population is uncertain. To optimize limited healthcare resources in China or other developing countries, we assessed the pharmacoeconomics of nitrendipine and hydrochlorothiazide or nitrendipine with metoprolol and we measured reductions in hypertension in rural Chinese communities. These data will inform future drug-based decisions for areas with limited resources.

### Sustained restoration of autonomic balance with long-but not short-acting metoprolol in patients with heart failure [^60c51f59]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of immediate-release (IR) metoprolol and extended-release (XL) metoprolol on measures of heart rate variability in chronic systolic heart failure patients.

Methods and Results

Thirteen metoprolol-treated heart failure patients were randomized to a 2-way crossover study of equal daily doses of metoprolol IR and metoprolol XL, each administered for 3 weeks. After each 3-week interval, patients underwent 24-hour Holter and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Over the entire 24-hour period, the ratio of high to total variability (normalized measure of parasympathetic activity) was significantly greater (P < .05), the ratio of low to total variability (normalized measure of sympathetic activity) was significantly lower (P < .05), and the ratio of high to low variability (index of parasympathetic to sympathetic balance) was greater (P < .08) for metoprolol XL compared with metoprolol IR. Over the entire 24-hour period, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly lower for metoprolol XL compared with metoprolol IR (P < .0001, and .0005, respectively).

Conclusion

These data suggest that with twice daily dosing, metoprolol IR is inferior to metoprolol XL in its effects on heart rate variability, autonomic balance, and blood pressure in patients with heart failure.

### Nebivolol, but not metoprolol, treatment improves endothelial fibrinolytic capacity in adults with elevated blood pressure [^7d25d1ab]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current study is the first to determine the effects of β‐blockers on endothelial fibrinolytic regulation. We demonstrate that nebivolol, but not metoprolol, improves the capacity of the endothelium to release t‐PA in adults with elevated BP. Furthermore, the nebivolol‐induced improvement in endothelial t‐PA release occurs, at least in part, through the mitigation of oxidative stress. These data indicate a novel pleiomorphic effect of nebivolol, independent of BP lowering, on vascular endothelial function and, in turn, thrombogenic risk.

The ability of the endothelium to locally and rapidly release t‐PA is critical for efficient thrombolysis. Indeed, endothelial t‐PA release is an important endogenous defense mechanism against intravascular fibrin deposition and thrombosis. 26 Studies in both animal models and humans have demonstrated that diminished endothelial t‐PA release is associated with accelerated atherosclerotic vascular disease. 27, 28 For example, t‐PA–deficient mice demonstrate augmented rates of atherosclerotic fibrin deposition and extensive myocardial tissue necrosis. 28 Whereas in humans, impaired capacity of the endothelium to release t‐PA has been linked to atheromatous plaque development and higher rates of myocardial infarction. 29 We 4 and others 30 have previously demonstrated that endothelial t‐PA release is markedly blunted in adults with elevated BP and that the magnitude of impairment is similar between adults with prehypertension and stage 1 hypertension. 4 Impaired endothelial fibrinolytic function is considered to be an important factor contributing to the increased risk of atherothrombotic vascular disease associated with elevated BP. 31

Very little is known regarding the effects of BP‐lowering agents on endothelial control of the fibrinolytic system. 30, 32 While acutely lowering BP in adults with hypertension does not have beneficial effects on endothelial t‐PA release, 33 chronic BP control with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibition or calcium channel blockade, 8 but not angiotensin receptor blockade, 7 improves arterial t‐PA release. 31 The results of the present study significantly extend these findings by demonstrating that chronic nebivolol, but not metoprolol, treatment improves the capacity of the endothelium to release t‐PA. It is important to emphasize that the magnitude of the BP‐lowering effect (≈10 mm Hg) was similar between nebivolol and metoprolol, suggesting that the improvement in endothelial t‐PA release with nebivolol was independent of the reduction in BP and was a specific effect of the compound. Enhanced endothelial fibrinolytic potential may underlie the report that nebivolol prevents ischemic events in patients with heart failure. 34

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^a74f1acf]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension — beta blockers (cardioselective) include atenolol 25–100 with daily frequency 2, betaxolol 5–20 with daily frequency 1, bisoprolol 2.5–10 with daily frequency 1, metoprolol tartrate 100–200 with daily frequency 2, and metoprolol succinate 50–200 with daily frequency 1; beta blockers are not recommended as first-line agents unless the patient has CHD or HF, these are preferred in patients with bronchospastic airway disease requiring a beta blocker, bisoprolol and metoprolol succinate are preferred in patients with HFrEF, and avoid abrupt cessation.

### Endothelial function is unaffected by changing between carvedilol and metoprolol in patients with heart failure – a randomized study [^4e4ff07b]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Carvedilol has been shown to be superior to metoprolol tartrate to improve clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF), yet the mechanisms responsible for these differences remain unclear. We examined if there were differences in endothelial function, insulin stimulated endothelial function, 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate during treatment with carvedilol, metoprolol tartrate and metoprolol succinate in patients with HF.

Methods

Twenty-seven patients with mild HF, all initially treated with carvedilol, were randomized to a two-month treatment with carvedilol, metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate. Venous occlusion plethysmography, 24-hour blood pressure and heart rate measurements were done before and after a two-month treatment period.

Results

Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation was not affected by changing from carvedilol to either metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate. The relative forearm blood flow at the highest dose of serotonin was 2.42 ± 0.33 in the carvedilol group at baseline and 2.14 ± 0.24 after two months continuation of carvedilol (P = 0.34); 2.57 ± 0.33 before metoprolol tartrate treatment and 2.42 ± 0.55 after treatment (p = 0.74) and in the metoprolol succinate group 1.82 ± 0.29 and 2.10 ± 0.37 before and after treatment, respectively (p = 0.27). Diurnal blood pressures as well as heart rate were also unchanged by changing from carvedilol to metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate.

Conclusion

Endothelial function remained unchanged when switching the beta blocker treatment from carvedilol to either metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate in this study, where blood pressure and heart rate also remained unchanged in patients with mild HF.

Trial Registration

### Combination therapy in hypertension: an update [^0ffaab19]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Another double blind, parallel group randomized study for 12 weeks comparing the combination therapy of felodipine and metoprolol (5/50mg) with either monotherapy exhibited significantly greater antihypertensive response (98%) with combination compared to monotherapy (felodipine- 79% and metoprolol- 82%). A significant greater reduction in mean systolic/diastolic BP (28/18 mmHg) with combination therapy was evinced compared to either felodipine (18/12 mm hg) or metoprolol (19/12 mm hg).

The long-term (I year) efficacy and safety between lisinopril and trichlormethazide combination therapy and lisinopril monotherapy was investigated in a multi-centre open label trial on 466 patients. It showed effective BP reduction to < 150/90 mmHg in both the groups throughout the study period. Additionally the combination of trichlormethazide reversed the increase in serum potassium observed in the monotherapy group.

The results of these studies emphasize that multiple-drug therapy was both safe and effective compared to monotherapy and will be required in most patients to attain BP goals.

Many panels including Hypertension in African Americans Working Group (HAAWG), JNC 7, The Task Force for the Management of arterial Hypertension of the ESH and of the European Society of Cardiology have strongly supported that treatment initiation with 2 or if needed 3 drugs is justified in many cases of hypertension management. There are other various advantages with combination therapy. Combining the drugs makes them available in a convenient dosing format, lowers the dose and can be given in once daily schedule thus improving compliance. There is an additive or synergistic antihypertensive effect at lower doses of individual components and at the same time the drugs in combination counteract the side effects of each other. This helps more patients to achieve normal BP and even can be effective in hard-to-treat populations. Early normalization of BP may greatly motivate the patients to adhere to lifelong treatment.

### Use of blood pressure lowering drugs in the prevention of cardiovascular disease: meta-analysis of 147 randomised trials in the context of expectations from prospective epidemiological studies [^67027f34]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Despite the widespread use of blood pressure lowering drugs and the results of many randomised trials, w1-w162 uncertainty remains about which drugs to use and who to treat. Five questions encapsulate this uncertainty. Firstly, do β blockers have a special effect over and above lowering blood pressure in preventing coronary heart disease (CHD) events in people with a history of CHD? This view is widely held but such an effect has not been shown directly or quantified. We aimed to answer this question from an analysis of all relevant trials, and then to answer four further questions after excluding CHD events in trials of β blockers in people with a history of CHD if they did have a special effect. Secondly, does the effect of blood pressure lowering drugs in preventing CHD and stroke differ in people with and without a history of cardiovascular disease (that is, is there a different effect in secondary and primary prevention)? Thirdly, does blood pressure reduction alone explain the effect of blood pressure lowering drugs in preventing CHD and stroke? There are claims of additional non-blood pressure lowering (so called pleiotropic) effects of drugs. w135 w136 w139 Selected trial data have been used to suggest that each of the five main classes of blood pressure lowering drugs (thiazides, β blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers) has a greater preventive effect, w126 w129 and each a lesser preventive effect, w126 w135 than other drugs. Clinical guidelines tend to reflect the view that differences in efficacy exist. Fourthly, should the use of blood pressure lowering drugs be limited to people with "high" blood pressure and not given to those at high risk of cardiovascular disease who have a lower blood pressure? A corollary is whether blood pressure should be reduced to a limited extent only, a treat to target approach. Although cohort (prospective observational) studies do not show a lower blood pressure limit below which risk ceases to decline ("the lower the better"), this has not been shown in randomised trials across a wide range of blood pressure. Finally, what is the quantitative effect of taking one or more blood pressure lowering drugs in lowering blood pressure and preventing CHD events and stroke according to dose, pretreatment blood pressure, and age? To date no such quantitative summary of effect, taking account of these determining factors, has been made.

### Effects of metoprolol CR / XL on mortality and hospitalizations in patients with heart failure and history of hypertension [^03608632]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2002). Low credibility.

Background

We describe the effect of controlled-release/extended-release (CR/XL) metoprolol succinate once daily on mortality and hospitalizations among patients with a history of hypertension complicated by chronic systolic heart failure.

Methods and Results

We enrolled 3,991 patients with chronic heart failure of New York Heart Association functional class II-IV with an ejection fraction of ≤ 0.40, stabilized with optimum standard therapy, in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study. A total of 1,747 patients (44%) had a history of hypertension; 871 were randomized to receive metoprolol CR/XL and 876 to receive placebo. Treatment with metoprolol CR/XL compared with placebo resulted in a significant reduction in total mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44–0.84; P = 0.0022), mainly because of reductions in sudden death (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.33–0.79; P = 0.0022) and mortality from worsening heart failure (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25–0.99; P = 0.042). Total number of hospitalizations for worsening heart failure was reduced by 30% in the metoprolol CR/XL group compared with placebo (P = 0.015). Metoprolol CR/XL was well tolerated: 12% fewer patients withdrew from study medication (all-cause) compared with placebo (P = 0.048).

Conclusions

A subgroup analysis of MERIT-HF shows that patients with heart failure and a history of hypertension received a similar benefit from metoprolol CR/XL treatment as all patients included in the total study.

7.1 Catecholamine Depleting Drugs and Monoamine Oxidate (MAO) Inhibitors

Catecholamine depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Observe patients treated with metoprolol plus a catecholamine depletor for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.

7.2 Epinephrine

While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat an allergic reaction.

7.3 CYP2D6 Inhibitors

Drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and propafenone, were shown to double metoprolol concentrations. While there is no information about moderate or weak inhibitors, these too are likely to increase metoprolol concentration. Increases in plasma concentration decrease the cardioselectivity of metoprolol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitor patients closely when the combination cannot be avoided.

7.4 Digitalis, Clonidine, and Calcium Channel Blockers and Other Drugs
that Decrease Heart Rate

Digitalis glycosides, clonidine, diltiazem and verapamil slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant administration of beta-blockers with these and other drugs known to decrease heart rate such as sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators (e.g., fingolimod) may result in additive heart rate lowering effects.

If clonidine and metoprolol are coadministered, withdraw the metoprolol several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine because beta-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension that can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, delay the introduction of beta-blockers for several days after clonidine administration has stopped.

7.5 Drugs that Decrease Blood Pressure

Concomitant administration of beta-blockers with other drugs known to decrease blood pressure may result in an enhanced hypotensive effect.

Choice of antihypertensive medications.

Patient heterogeneity and scarcity of comparative evidence preclude recommending any one medication class over another for all patients. Antihypertensive medications considered first-line in the general population (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers) can also be considered first-line to lower BP in patients receiving dialysis. It is reasonable to choose medications based on patient characteristics, cardiovascular indications, and availability (Table 3).

Pharmacokinetics and dialyzability are also important considerations. For example, one retrospective study found that nondialyzable β-blockers (e.g. propranolol) but not highly dialyzable β-blockers (e.g. atenolol, metoprolol) are associated with lower mortality risk, possibly due to preserved intradialytic protection against arrhythmias. In contrast, another retrospective study showed higher mortality rates with the nondialyzable carvedilol versus the highly dialyzable metoprolol, which was attributed to a higher likelihood of intradialytic hypotension with carvedilol. Additionally, the data assessing drug dialyzability contain uncertainties. For example, a recent study suggests that bisoprolol may in fact be dialyzable, contrary to what had been previously thought. It is reasonable to consider intradialytic BP patterns with regard to drug dialyzability, and it may be prudent to avoid nondialyzable medications in the setting of frequent intradialytic hypotension. For relatively stable intradialytic BP, use of longer-acting, once-daily medication may improve adherence and reduce pill burden.

The timing of antihypertensive medication administration should be individualized, taking into account interdialytic BP and the frequency of intradialytic hypotension. The effectiveness of withholding antihypertensive agents before dialysis in reducing intradialytic hypotension is unknownand is being investigated in an ongoing RCT.

Results

Selected patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. There were no baseline differences in age or anthropometric, metabolic, or hemodynamic variables between the groups. In response to the interventions, there were clinically modest, albeit significant, reductions in total cholesterol and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol in the nebivolol group and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol in the placebo group. Table 2 shows the heart rate and BP responses among the groups. There were no differences in resting heart rate or BP between the groups. Both nebivolol and metoprolol treatment resulted in similar and significant reductions in heart rate and systolic (≈15 mm Hg), diastolic (≈10 mm Hg), and mean arterial (≈10 mm Hg) BP. There were no significant changes in heart rate and BP in the placebo group.

After each intervention, there was no change in the FBF responses to either bradykinin or sodium nitroprusside in the nebivolol, metoprolol, or placebo groups (data not shown).

### Are there meaningful differences in blood pressure control with current antihypertensive agents? [^23a944ac]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and small reductions in blood pressure can have a substantial impact on outcome. Effective control of hypertension per se is important in reducing morbidity and mortality, but there is growing evidence that the class of drug used in treatment may affect patient outcomes. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial provided evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), are particularly effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in a wide range of patients. These beneficial effects of ACEI may be independent of antihypertensive effect. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are the newest class of antihypertensive drug to enter clinical use. By blocking the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, ARB achieve more complete blockade of the RAS than ACEI. The ARB also have a substantially better side effect profile than ACEI, and early evidence suggests that ARB are beneficial in combating hypertension-related target organ damage. These favorable characteristics suggest that ARB should be considered as first-line treatment for hypertension. Based on comparative antihypertensive efficacy, olmesartan, a new ARB, may represent a significant addition to this drug class.

SUBSEQUENT TRIAL ACHIEVEMENTS IN PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION

The demonstration of the protective effect of antihypertensive treatment by earlier trials favored in the following decades the design and conduction of many more trials that allowed the effect of BP reduction on outcomes to be studied in several hundred thousand patients characterized by widely different demographic and clinical conditions. While confirming the protective nature of BP-lowering treatment, these trials (together with their subgroups analyses and meta-analyses) have enormously increased previous knowledge, with a crucial contribution to treatment guidelines in this medical area. A handful of trials (MAPHY [Metoprolol Arm of the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension], HAPPHY [Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension study], Medical Research Council I, Medical Research Council II, International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension) compared around 1990 outcomes on diuretics of the thiazide type with various beta-blockers without findings of major differences at least not in the primary end point. Further, a handful of trials in the mid-later 1990s compared ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and the alpha-blocker doxazosin with thiazide diuretics, thiazide/beta-blocker combination or chlorthalidone (Table) and found no differences in the primary end points, which were cardiovascular mortality, a composite of stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality, or incident myocardial infarction and fatal coronary disease. Already, in the year 2000, there was clear indication suggesting that BP-lowering treatment with these rather well-tolerated 5 main drug classes or their combinations was similarly effective in preventing hypertensive complications.

SECOND LINE HYPERTENSION DRUGS

The following classes are considered second-line therapy for the treatment of hypertension. More of these classes of drugs are GPCRs and thus better known relative to their potential new actions.

1. Beta adrenergic receptor antagonists/blockers

The β adrenergic receptors are GPCRs, and it is specifically the β 1 adrenergic receptor in the heart that is the target of this class of antihypertensives.

FDA-Approved Drugs: acebutolol, atenolol, betzxolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, labetalol, metoprolol, nadolol, nebivolol, pindolol, propranolol, and timolol.

Primary Mechanism of Action: By antagonizing the ability of endogenous norepinephrine to stimulate predominantly the β 1 adrenergic receptor that increases heart rate and force, these antagonists serve to lower the work of the heart. They can also modify renin release from the kidney. They antagonize the orthosteric bindings site of norepinephrine at this receptor.

New Mechanisms of Action:

Inverse Agonism: A number of related but non-FDA-approved antagonists have been tested in in vitro experiments to determine inverse agonism in cells transfected with multiple species of the β 1 adrenergic receptor. This includes bucindolol and carazolol. The FDA-approved carvedilol and propranolol demonstrated inverse agonism, while bisoprolol and metoprolol were inconsistent in outcome based on the assay used. It is, however, unknown whether these specific pharmacological actions contribute to the effect in humans.
Biased Agonism: Carvedilol has been reported to act as a β-arrestin biased agonist, as has nebivolol. These drugs would inhibit G protein activation, to which elevated heart rate is typically attributed. They would also activate β-arrestin signaling or at least not inhibit it. The importance of these effects clinically is not clear, especially in light of the pharmacological actions of carvedilol.

Metoprolol — beta blocker, beta-1 selective — blocks response to beta-adrenergic stimulation and is cardio selective for beta-1 receptors at low doses with little or no effect on beta-2 receptors. Indications are for management of narrow complex tachycardias. Contraindications include hypersensitivity; when administered for hypertension or angina: sinus bradycardia, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, cardiogenic shock, sick sinus syndrome (unless permanent pacemaker in place), severe peripheral vascular disease, and pheochromocytoma; when administered for myocardial infarction: severe sinus bradycardia with heart rate less than 45 beats/minute, systolic BP less than 100 mmHg, significant first-degree heart block (PR interval at least 0.24 seconds), and moderate-to-severe cardiac failure; and there is a warning that it may cause 1st, 2nd, or 3rd degree AV block.

### Metoprolol compared to carvedilol deteriorates insulin-stimulated endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes-a randomized study [^ba706ce5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2010). Low credibility.

Fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin and glycosylated hemoglobin remained unchanged at the end of the treatment with any of the two beta-blockers (Table 2 and 3).

Systolic blood pressure did not change with metoprolol while carvedilol treatment tended to lower systolic blood pressure although this change was non-significant (142.4 ± 5.09 mmHg before treatment versus 136.9 ± 5.80 mmHg after treatment) (-3.7% change) (p = 0.38). Diastolic blood pressure decreased after treatment with a beta-blocker to a similar level in both treatment groups; from 71.4 ± 2.59 mmHg to 61.3 ± 3.13 mmHg (-14.1% change) in the carvedilol group (p < 0.05) and 70.5 ± 4.67 mmHg to 64.0 ± 3.84 mmHg (-9.2% change) in the metoprolol group (p < 0.05), while resting heart rate decreased only significantly in the carvedilol group from 67.1 ± 2.16 to 60.7 ± 1.74 (-9.5% change) (p < 0.05).

Endothelial function

The patients with type 2 diabetes had a significant lower response to serotonin than the healthy control group (Fig. 1). Relative flow (± SEM) at baseline at the three dose levels of serotonin infusion were 1.17 ± 0.08; 1.26 ± 0.11; 1.62 ± 0.16 and 1.84 ± 0.20 in the group of patients with type 2 diabetes compared to 1.12 ± 0.12; 1.15 ± 0.11; 1.71 ± 0.15 and 2.69 ± 0.23 in the healthy control group (p = 0.002). Also, the insulin-stimulated serotonin response was significantly lower in patients with type 2 diabetes (Fig. 2): The percentage increase in blood-flow after co-infusion of insulin compared to serotonin alone was 45.96 ± 11.56%; 67.40 ± 18.11% and 84.57 ± 25.73% in the healthy control group and 26.48 ± 7.74%; 26.40 ± 11.52% and 19.75 ± 13.87% (p = 0.02) in the group of patients with type 2 diabetes.

### The rationale and design of the glycemic effects in diabetes mellitus carvedilol-metoprolol comparison in hypertensives (GEMINI) trial [^32b868f8]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2005). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers utilized in the Type 2 diabetic patient result in an even greater decrease in cardiac events than in the nondiabetic patient. Unfortunately, first-and second-generation beta-blockers are associated with the worsening of insulin resistance, deterioration of glycemic control, peripheral vasoconstriction, potentially worsening peripheral vascular disease, and more frequent and severe hypoglycemia. The third-generation beta-blockers have unique properties, including alpha1-blockade, and have been shown to lower insulin resistance, improve glycemic control, and vasodilate resistance arterioles. The Glycemic Effects in Diabetes Mellitus: Carvedilol-Metoprolol Comparison in Hypertensives (GEMINI) trial has been designed to compare a third-generation (carvedilol) with a second-generation beta-blocker (metoprolol) in a cohort of participants with hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. The primary outcome measure of the study is change in the HbA1c. The study is powered to detect a difference in HbA1c of 0.3 units (%) between the groups. Secondary endpoints include changes in insulin resistance, fasting glucose, and the lipid profile. Differences in the side-effect profile (cold extremities, fatigue, impotence, and hypoglycemia) will also be assessed. The GEMINI trial, therefore, is the first large randomized trial to assess whether utilizing a third-generation beta-blocker yields a favorable metabolic profile in the patient with Type 2 diabetes and hypertension.

### Propranolol hydrochloride (inderal XL) [^fb08eb4a]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

INDERAL XL is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including beta-blockers.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mm Hg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

INDERAL XL is a beta adrenergic blocker indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. (1)

Beta‐blockers

Beta‐blockers have a class I indication in patients with HFrEF. 10, 11 The trials that have assessed their effects in HFrEF were mostly conducted in patients already treated with ACEi.

Hypotension was more frequently observed in patients treated with carvedilol 2 than in those receiving placebo (9% vs. 4%); however, discontinuation of treatment was nonetheless exceptional in both groups (0.3% vs. 0.3%). Similar results were reported with metoprolol in MERIT‐HF with a 0.6% discontinuation for hypotension vs. 0.3% for placebo. 3

A dose–response curve reported in the MOCHA trial revealed that carvedilol produced dose‐related improvements in left ventricular function and dose‐related reductions in both mortality and hospitalization rate. 37

Of noted importance, the COPERNICUS trial showed that subjects with the lowest BP were also those who experienced the greatest benefit. 23 In this analysis, the additional moderate (2 mmHg) drop in BP observed in patients randomized to beta‐blockers persisted for approximately 4 months, but was no longer apparent after 8 months suggesting a transient BP‐lowering effect.

Despite carvedilol having multi‐receptor effects potentially causing greater decrease in BP, the proportion of target dose achieved does not appear to differ in patients treated with either bisoprolol or carvedilol. 38

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are recommended (class IA) in symptomatic (NYHA class II to IV) HFrEF on top of ACEi and beta‐blockers. 10

While serum potassium and creatinine are closely monitored when taking MRAs, BP changes is not emphasized as a restriction of MRA use. In the RALES trial assessing spironolactone vs. placebo, 39 no difference in BP was reported in the two groups. However, the proportion of beta‐blocker prescriptions was low (11%) in comparison with current standards, which may have decreased the incidence of hypotension.

In the EPHESUS 40 and EMPHASIS‐HF 41 trials, most patients (> 75%) were on beta‐blockers. Patients treated with MRAs experienced marginally and non‐significant lower BP. The treatment effect of MRAs was reported not to be affected by baseline BP in a joint analysis of RALES and EMPHASIS‐HF, and hypotension was infrequent and not more common with MRA therapy than with placebo overall (4.6% vs. 3.9%) regardless of baseline BP. 42

### Influence of phenotype and pharmacokinetics on β-blocker drug target pharmacogenetics [^59370889]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Two common polymorphisms in the beta1-adrenergic receptor gene, Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly, are associated with variable antihypertensive response to metoprolol. We sought to determine whether similar pharmacogenetic associations were present with the negative chronotropic response phenotype to metoprolol. Metoprolol was titrated in 54 untreated hypertensive patients to achieve blood pressure control. We found no association between either resting or exercise heart rate at baseline (untreated) or in response to metoprolol by codon 389 genotype. In contrast, when compared by codon 49 genotype, Ser49 homozygotes had significantly higher resting heart rates at baseline (untreated) than Gly49 carriers (82 ± 10 versus 74 ± 11 bpm, respectively, P = 0.016). When corrected for plasma concentration, we found no difference in reduction in exercise heart rate in response to metoprolol between Ser49 homozygotes and Gly49 carriers (0.75 ± 0.11 versus 0.57 ± 0.17%/ng/ml, respectively, P = 0.37). However, if one fails to account for plasma concentration, trends toward a significant difference in heart rate reduction are seen between Ser49 homozygotes and Gly49 carriers (31% reduction versus 25% reduction, P = 0.05). Our data suggest that neither the beta1-adrenergic receptor Arg389Gly, nor the Ser49Gly polymorphisms are associated with variable negative chronotropic response to metoprolol. In addition, our data highlight the importance of measuring metoprolol concentration in order to account for variable pharmacokinetics and avoid misinterpretation of the data.

### Cardioselective β-blocker treatment of hypertension in patients with asthma: when do benefits outweigh risks? [^78298612]. The Journal of Asthma (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Benefits outweigh risks of cardioselective beta-blocker therapy in patients with nonsevere asthma and a history of heart failure or myocardial infarction (MI). This review summarizes the risks versus benefits of using cardioselective beta-blockers in the treatment of hypertension in patients with asthma.

Methods

We searched the English literature from 1976 to 2011 via PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS using the following search terms: "beta-blocker treatment of hypertension" AND "asthma"; "cardioselective beta-blockers" AND "asthma". When pertinent articles were found, we assessed relevant articles cited in those papers. All studies related to cardioselective beta-blocker use in patients with asthma and hypertension were included.

Results

Seven studies with patient populations ranging from 10 to 17 patients evaluated cardioselective beta-blockers in patients with asthma and hypertension. Atenolol and/or immediate-release metoprolol were evaluated in these studies. The duration of beta-blocker therapy in four studies was 1–8 weeks; two studies were single dose and one investigation lasted 8 months. Metoprolol and atenolol were generally well tolerated except at higher doses such as metoprolol > 100 mg daily.

Conclusion

In the absence of concomitant cardiovascular disease, routine use of beta-blockers for the treatment of hypertension in patients with asthma should be avoided.

Pediatric blood pressure (BP) risk reduction — dietary, behavioral, and pharmacologic factors are summarized as follows: From the evidence review, both breastfeeding and supplementation of formula with polyunsaturated fatty acids in infancy are associated with lower BP at follow-up; a DASH-style diet is associated with lower BP in adults and the Cardiovascular Health Integrated Lifestyle Diet (CHILD 1) combined with DASH is an appropriate diet for children that meets 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans nutrient goals; lower dietary sodium intake is associated with lower BP levels in infants, children, and adolescents; antihypertensive options that can reduce BP in children from ages 6 to 17 years include losartan, amlodipine, felodipine, fosinopril, lisinopril, metoprolol, and valsartan, though for African American children, greater doses of fosinopril may be needed and trial durations were short with long-term safety in question; in small-for-gestational-age babies, a nutrient-enriched diet promoting rapid weight gain was associated with higher BP on follow-up in late childhood and this potential risk should be considered; in one study, transcendental meditation effectively lowered BP in nonhypertensive adolescents.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^4842ed4d]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Pediatric blood pressure (BP) risk modification — evidence overview: Both breastfeeding and supplementation of formula with PUFA in infancy are associated with lower BP at follow-up; a DASH-style diet in combination with the Cardiovascular Health Integrated Lifestyle Diet (CHILD 1) is described as appropriate for children and meets 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2010 DGA) nutrient goals; and lower dietary sodium intake is associated with lower BP levels in infants, children, and adolescents. Antihypertensive agents including losartan, amlodipine, felodipine, fosinopril, lisinopril, metoprolol, and valsartan can be added to medications tolerated over short periods and can reduce BP in children from ages 6 to 17 years but are not yet approved for pediatric use, with greater doses of fosinopril possibly needed in African American children; trial durations were short and long-term safety is still in question. Additional findings include that in small-for-gestational-age babies, a nutrient-enriched diet that promoted rapid weight gain was associated with higher BP on follow-up, and one study found transcendental meditation effectively lowered BP in nonhypertensive adolescents.

### Differential effects of β-blockers on albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes [^26fdb877]. Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Increases in the cardiovascular risk marker microalbuminuria are attenuated by blood pressure reduction using blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. Such changes in microalbuminuria have not been observed when beta-blockers are used. A prespecified secondary end point of the Glycemic Effects in Diabetes Mellitus Carvedilol-Metoprolol Comparison in Hypertensives (GEMINI) trial was to examine the effects of different beta-blockers on changes in albuminuria in the presence of renin-angiotensin system blockade. Participants with hypertension and type 2 diabetes were randomized to either metoprolol tartrate (n = 737) or carvedilol (n = 498) in blinded fashion after a washout period of all antihypertensive agents except for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Blinded medication was titrated to achieve target blood pressure, with a-5 month follow-up period. The current analysis examined microalbuminuria, using spot urine albumin:creatinine, in participants who had values at screening and trial end. A greater reduction in microalbuminuria was observed for those randomized to carvedilol (-16.2%Delta; 95% confidence interval, -25.3, -5.9; P = 0.003). Of those with normoalbuminuria at baseline, fewer progressed to microalbuminuria on carvedilol versus metoprolol (20 of 302 [6.6%] versus 48 of 431 [11.1%], respectively; P = 0.03). Microalbuminuria development was not related to differences in blood pressure or achievement of blood pressure goal (68% carvedilol versus 67%, metoprolol). Presence of metabolic syndrome at baseline was the only independent predictor of worsening albuminuria throughout the study (P = 0.004). Beta-blockers have differential effects on microalbuminuria in the presence of renin-angiotensin system blockade. These differences cannot be explained by effects on blood pressure or alpha1-antagonism but may relate to antioxidant properties of carvedilol.

### Beta-blockers for hypertension [^ee1e06c1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

ELSA 2002. The trial was designed to compare the effects of a beta‐blocker (atenolol) and a CCB (lacidipine) on the change in mean maximum intima‐media thickness and plaque number in men and women with hypertension. The investigators also reported data on fatal and non‐fatal cardiovascular events and total mortality. If satisfactory blood pressure control was not achieved, trial medication could be increased, and when necessary open‐label hydrochlorothiazide was added. At the end of the trial, 85% of participants in the beta‐blocker group and 78% in the CCB group were known to be on assigned treatment. The participants on monotherapy at the end of the trial were 43% in the beta‐blocker group and 42% in the CCB group. The trial followed up 2334 participants aged 45 to 75 years for a mean duration of 3.75 years.

HAPPHY 1987. The trial was designed to compare the effects of beta‐blockers (mainly atenolol, 1599 participants or metoprolol, 1631 participants) and thiazide diuretics (bendroflumethiazide or hydrochlorothiazide) on the incidence of non‐fatal myocardial infarction, CHD mortality, and total mortality in men with mild to moderate hypertension. Other drugs were added to reduce blood pressure as necessary. At the end of the trial, 86% of participants in the beta‐blocker group and 83% in the diuretic group were on assigned treatment. More participants in the beta‐blocker group (68%) than in the diuretic group (62%) were on monotherapy. The trial followed up 6569 participants aged 40 to 64 years for a mean duration of 45.1 months.
