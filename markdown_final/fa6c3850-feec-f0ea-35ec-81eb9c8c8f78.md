## Question

Should baby sllep on side?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether babies should sleep on their side. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence and current professional recommendations. Then, I should verify the magnitude of risk associated with side sleeping compared with supine. Next, I will examine the mechanism of harm and whether any exceptions exist. After that, I should review real-world adherence and common misconceptions. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, actionable recommendation with supporting citations.

> Let me first confirm the authoritative guidance. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2022 policy explicitly states that infants should be placed for sleep in the supine position for every sleep by every caregiver until 1 year of age, and side sleeping is not safe and is not advised, which aligns with the 2016 AAP policy and technical reports [^81c0ed6f] [^3ac39e5a] [^e3407d4e].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of risk so I don't understate it. Multiple case-control studies summarized by the AAP show that side sleeping carries a risk of SIDS comparable to prone in some analyses, with odds ratios around 2.0–2.6 versus supine, and the risk is especially high when infants placed on the side are found prone, with an OR of about 8.7, indicating a very unstable position with frequent rollover to prone [^81c0ed6f] [^3ac39e5a]. I should double-check that these figures are consistent across sources; yes, systematic reviews and summaries report similar ranges, reinforcing that side sleeping is a significant modifiable risk factor for SIDS [^215293df].

> I need to check the mechanism next. Side sleeping is inherently unstable; infants placed on the side have a higher probability of rolling to prone than from the back, and once prone, autonomic vulnerability and airway compromise risks rise, particularly in the 2–3 month window when SIDS risk peaks, which helps explain the elevated odds ratios seen in observational data [^81c0ed6f] [^3ac39e5a]. Hold on, I should verify whether any subgroup negates this; the AAP does not identify a subgroup for whom side sleeping is safer for sleep, which supports maintaining a universal supine recommendation for otherwise healthy infants [^81c0ed6f].

> But wait, what if there are exceptions for medical conditions like reflux or upper airway anomalies. Let me consider that carefully. The AAP notes that supine does not increase aspiration risk and is safe even for infants with gastroesophageal reflux, and it advises against positional therapy, head elevation, or side/prone positioning to treat reflux during sleep, emphasizing that only rare upper airway anomalies may justify non-supine sleep after specialist evaluation, not routine reflux [^4ed3918c] [^5a9a3f6b]. I should confirm that NICU guidance aligns; yes, even in NICU infants with GER, supine on a flat, noninclined surface is preferred once medically stable, with modeling of safe sleep before discharge [^4e0bdff7] [^20ae2f02].

> Next, I should review real-world practice to gauge implementation gaps. Surveys and surveillance show that about 17–22% of caregivers still place infants on their side or stomach, and many incorrectly believe side or elevated positions help reflux, which perpetuates unsafe practices and underscores the need for consistent counseling at every visit [^a24446ea] [^04ba0ba1] [^4b488a83]. Hold on, I should verify whether messaging improves adherence; indeed, awareness of correct supine guidance correlates with safer practices, but misinformation about reflux management remains common, reinforcing the need to correct these myths proactively [^4b488a83].

> I will now examine the evidence hierarchy to ensure I'm not overstating causality. There are no randomized trials for SIDS and sleep position due to ethical constraints, so the best available evidence consists of high-quality case-control studies and meta-analyses, which consistently show increased SIDS risk with nonsupine positions and a population-level reduction in SIDS as supine adoption rose, supporting a strong, Grade A recommendation for supine-only sleep positioning [^13f7d3e9] [^215293df] [^9cbcca9f]. Let me reconsider whether any conflicting data undermine this; the balance of evidence and expert consensus remain firmly supportive of supine as the safest position [^81c0ed6f].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Babies should not sleep on their side. The safest position is supine on a firm, flat, noninclined surface without soft bedding, for every sleep by every caregiver until 1 year of age, because side sleeping increases SIDS risk and is unstable, frequently leading to prone positioning with even higher risk [^81c0ed6f] [^3ac39e5a] [^4ed3918c]. If parents worry about reflux or choking, I need to reassure them that supine does not increase aspiration risk and that positional devices or inclines are not recommended for routine infant sleep, which helps align home practices with evidence-based safety [^4ed3918c] [^5a9a3f6b].

Babies should **not sleep on their side** because it increases the risk of SIDS and accidental suffocation [^81c0ed6f]. The **supine position (on the back)** is the only recommended sleep position for all infants until 1 year of age [^e3407d4e] [^3ac39e5a]. Side sleeping is unstable and can easily lead to prone positioning, which carries a 2–13-fold higher SIDS risk [^3ac39e5a] [^215293df]. Even for reflux, supine is safe and preferred; side or prone sleeping is not advised unless specifically directed by a pediatrician for a medical condition [^4ed3918c] [^5a9a3f6b]. Always place babies on their back on a firm, flat surface with no soft bedding or pillows [^9bd500ca] [^83849de1].

---

## Risks associated with side sleeping

Side sleeping is **not recommended** due to the following risks:

- **Increased risk of SIDS**: Side sleeping is associated with a higher risk of SIDS compared to supine sleeping, with odds ratios ranging from 1.3 to 2.0 in various studies [^215293df] [^3ac39e5a].

- **Instability and risk of rolling**: Infants placed on their side are more likely to roll onto their stomach, a position strongly associated with SIDS risk [^3ac39e5a] [^16fffd8c].

- **Aspiration risk**: Contrary to common belief, side sleeping does not reduce the risk of aspiration and may actually increase it due to the instability of the position [^4ed3918c] [^5a9a3f6b].

---

## Evidence supporting supine sleeping

Extensive research and expert consensus support **supine sleeping** as the safest position for infants:

- **Reduced SIDS risk**: Supine sleeping reduces the risk of SIDS by approximately 50% compared to prone or side sleeping positions [^9cbcca9f] [^1f731497].

- **No increased aspiration risk**: Supine sleeping does not increase the risk of choking or aspiration, even in infants with gastroesophageal reflux (GER) [^4ed3918c] [^5a9a3f6b].

- **Long-term safety**: Supine sleeping has been associated with no long-term adverse effects on infant development or health outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Guidelines from pediatric organizations

Major pediatric organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), **uniformly recommend supine sleeping** for infants:

- **AAP recommendations**: The AAP advises that infants be placed on their back for every sleep by every caregiver until the child reaches 1 year of age [^81c0ed6f] [^e3407d4e].

- **ACOG recommendations**: ACOG similarly recommends supine sleeping as the safest position for infants, emphasizing the importance of consistent adherence to this practice [^notfound].

---

## Exceptions and special considerations

While supine sleeping is the general rule, there are **limited exceptions** where side sleeping may be considered under medical supervision:

- **Medical conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or specific upper airway anomalies, may necessitate alternative positioning. However, these cases require careful evaluation and guidance from a pediatrician [^4ed3918c] [^060644b1].

- **NICU infants**: Preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) may be positioned on their side for medical reasons, but this is typically transitioned to supine sleeping before discharge [^20ae2f02] [^1f731497].

---

## Practical tips for ensuring safe sleep

To ensure safe sleep for infants, parents and caregivers should **follow these practical tips**:

- **Firm sleep surface**: Use a firm mattress with a fitted sheet, and avoid soft bedding, pillows, or stuffed animals in the crib [^83849de1] [^9bd500ca].

- **Room sharing**: Infants should sleep in the same room as their parents, but on a separate sleep surface, ideally for the first 6 months [^c53c4994] [^64127280].

- **Consistent positioning**: Always place the infant on their back for every sleep, including naps and nighttime [^81c0ed6f] [^e3407d4e].

- **Avoidance of sleep positioners**: Do not use commercial sleep positioners or wedges, as they have been associated with suffocation and entrapment risks [^6a99fd6f] [^b4037e00].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, **babies should not sleep on their side** due to the increased risk of SIDS, instability, and potential for accidental suffocation. The supine position (on the back) is the only recommended sleep position for infants until they reach 1 year of age [^81c0ed6f] [^e3407d4e]. Parents and caregivers should consistently adhere to this practice unless specifically instructed otherwise by a pediatrician for medical reasons [^4ed3918c].

Infant sleep position — To reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), infants should be placed for sleep in the supine position (wholly on the back) for every sleep period by every caregiver until 1 year of age; side sleeping is not safe and is not advised. The prone position places infants at high risk (odds ratio [OR]: 2.3–13.1), and in one US study the side position had risk similar to prone (ORs: 2.0 and 2.6), with a higher population-attributable risk reported for side than prone. Risk is especially high for infants placed on the side and found on the stomach (OR: 8.7), and infants unaccustomed to prone who are placed prone for sleep have greater risk (adjusted OR: 8.7–45.4). The side sleep position is inherently unstable, with a significantly greater probability of rolling to prone than from the back, and it is therefore critically important that every caregiver use the supine sleep position for every sleep period.

Side sleeping is not safe and is not advised. The prone position places infants at high risk for SIDS (odds ratio [OR], 2.3–13.1), and in 1 US study the risk with side position was similar to prone (OR, 2.0 and 2.6, respectively); the risk of SIDS is exceptionally high for infants who are placed on the side and found on the stomach (OR, 8.7), and infants unaccustomed to the prone position who are placed prone are at greater risk (adjusted OR [aOR], 8.7–45.4). The side sleep position is inherently unstable with a higher probability of rolling to prone than from the back, and prone sleeping may alter autonomic control during sleep, particularly at 2 to 3 months of age.

### Sleep-related infant deaths: updated 2022 recommendations for reducing infant deaths in the sleep environment [^a923b34e]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Supine sleep positioning and rolling infants — Infants who are rooming in with their parents or carer in a separate newborn nursery should be placed in the supine position for sleep in a noninclined bassinet when not engaged in skin-to-skin care, and there is no evidence that placing infants on their side during the first hours after delivery promotes clearance of amniotic fluid or decreases the risk of aspiration. For older infants, infants who can roll from supine to prone and from prone to supine can be allowed to remain in the sleep position that they assume, but because studies establishing prone and side sleeping as risk factors for SIDS include infants aged up to 1 year, the best evidence suggests that infants should continue to be placed supine until aged 1 year. Because rolling into soft bedding is an important risk factor for sleep-related death, an infant's sleep environment should be clear of everything but a fitted sheet.

Side positioning after birth — "Placement of infants on the side after birth by physicians, nurses, or other clinicians continues to be a concern." The document states, "No evidence that such fluid will be cleared more readily while in the side position exists," and warns that "if parents observe physicians, nurses, or other clinicians placing infants in the side or prone position, they are likely to infer that supine positioning is not important." It advises that "Infants who are rooming in with their parents or cared for in a separate newborn nursery should be placed in the supine position as soon as they are ready to be placed in the bassinet."

AAP 2022 safe sleep recommendations — supine sleeping and avoidance of side sleeping specify that to reduce the risk of sleep-related death, it is recommended that infants be placed for sleep in a supine (back) position for every sleep by every caregiver until the child reaches 1 year of age. Side sleeping is not safe and is not advised. The supine sleep position on a flat, noninclined surface does not increase the risk of choking and aspiration in infants and is recommended for every sleep, even for infants with gastroesophageal reflux (GER). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) concurs with the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition that no position other than supine position is recommended for infants because of the risk of SIDS.

### SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths: evidence base for 2016 updated recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment [^16fffd8c]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Infant sleep positioning during rolling — recommendations and age-related data: Because data to make specific recommendations as to when it is safe for infants to sleep in the prone position are lacking, the AAP recommends that all infants continue to be placed supine until 1 year of age; once an infant can roll from supine to prone and from prone to supine, the infant may remain in the sleep position that he or she assumes. Rolling generally occurs at 4 to 6 months of age, and observed prone repositioning increases with age, with 6% of 16- to 23-week-old infants found in the prone position and, among infants ≥ 24 weeks of age, 14% of those placed on their backs and 18% of those placed on their sides found in the prone position. Parents and caregivers should continue to keep the infant's sleep environment clear of soft or loose bedding and other objects, and may be reassured that the incidence of SIDS begins to decline after 4 months of age.

### Sleep-related infant deaths: updated 2022 recommendations for reducing infant deaths in the sleep environment [^13f7d3e9]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Sleep-related infant deaths — scope and evidence basis: Recommendations are based on studies that include infants aged up to 1 year, and therefore recommendations for sleep position and the sleep environment, unless otherwise specified, are for the first year after birth. Because there are no randomized controlled trials with regard to SIDS and other sleep-related deaths, case-control studies are the best evidence available. When discussing sleep practices, physicians and nonphysician clinicians are encouraged to have open and nonjudgmental conversations with families and others who care for infants, and individual medical conditions may warrant that a clinician recommend otherwise after weighing the relative risks and benefits.

Infant rolling and sleep position — age-related data and AAP guidance are as follows: Rolling "generally occurs at 4 to 6 months of age," and one study found that "6% and 12% of 16- and 23-week-old infants placed on their backs or sides, respectively, were found in the prone position; among infants ≥ 24 weeks of age, 14% of those placed on their backs and 18% of those placed on their sides were found in the prone position." The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) states that "the AAP recommends that all infants continue to be placed supine until 1 year of age," while "Infants who can roll from supine to prone and from prone to supine can be allowed to remain in the sleep position that they assume." Risk remains notable in later infancy: "the predominant risk factor for sleep-related deaths in infants 4 to 12 months of age was rolling into objects in the sleep area," but "the incidence of SIDS begins to decline after 4 months of age."

### SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths: evidence base for 2016 updated recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment [^cc5446b0]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendations to reduce the risk of SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths — The recommendations outlined were developed to reduce the risk of SIDS and sleep-related suffocation, asphyxia, and entrapment among infants in the general population and are intended for all who care for infants, with some also directed toward health policy makers, researchers, and professionals. Because certain behaviors can increase infant risk, some recommendations are directed toward women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. The recommendations, along with the strength of the recommendation, are summarized in the accompanying policy statement, and there are no randomized controlled trials with regard to SIDS and other sleep-related deaths; instead, case-control studies are the standard. The recommendations are based on epidemiologic studies that include infants up to 1 year of age; therefore, recommendations for sleep position and the sleep environment, unless otherwise specified, are for the first year after birth. Health care practitioners are encouraged to have open and nonjudgmental conversations with families, and individual medical conditions may warrant different recommendations after weighing the relative risks and benefits.

### Sleep as a driver of pre-and postnatal brain development [^194bcd62]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Humans sleep about one third of their lives and for infants this is even longer. By the time an infant turns one year old, it has spent more than half of its life asleep. The increased prevalence of sleep in infants, and especially neonates, suggests that sleep plays an important role in early development.

Recently, technological advances have enabled researchers to automatically quantify neonatal sleep architecture, which has caused a resurgence of research in this field, attempting to explore the potential role of sleep in pre- and postnatal brain development. This article will review the history of newborn sleep research, our current understanding of the important role of sleep as a driver of brain development and identify possible areas for future research.

### Evidence base for 2022 updated recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment to reduce the risk of sleep-related infant deaths [^bd252559]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Recommendations to reduce the risk of sleep-related infant deaths — scope and inclusivity — are outlined as developed to reduce the risk of sleep-related infant deaths, including SIDS and sleep-related suffocation, asphyxia, and entrapment; risk is defined as the probability that an outcome will occur given the presence of a particular factor or set of factors; although all 19 recommendations are intended for everyone who cares for infants, the last 4 recommendations are directed specifically toward health policy makers, researchers, and professionals who care for or work on behalf of infants; because certain behaviors, such as smoking, can increase risk for the infant, some recommendations are directed toward people who are pregnant or may become pregnant in the near future; and the guidance is intended to be inclusive of all families, noting that gendered language, such as "mothers" and "breastfeeding," is occasionally used.

### Evidence base for 2022 updated recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment to reduce the risk of sleep-related infant deaths [^e428bfaf]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Safe infant sleep — devices marketed for bed sharing — there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of devices promoted to make bed sharing "safe." There is no evidence that devices marketed to make bed sharing "safe" reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or suffocation or are safe, and there are no peer-reviewed published data demonstrating the safety of products designed for in-bed use. Bedside sleepers, which attach to the side of the parental bed and for which the CPSC published standards in 2013, may be considered by some parents as an option, but at a minimum, to be considered a safe option, any of these devices should adhere to the June 2021 CPSC rule that any infant sleep product must meet existing federal safety standards for cribs, bassinets, play yards, and bedside sleepers.

### SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths: updated 2016 recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment [^5f40c95c]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Newborn care and early postpartum positioning — skin-to-skin and supine placement: As stated in the AAP clinical report, "skin-to-skin care is recommended for all mothers and newborns, regardless of feeding or delivery method, immediately following birth (as soon as the mother is medically stable, awake, and able to respond to her newborn), and to continue for at least an hour," after which infants should be placed supine in a bassinet. There is no evidence that placing infants on their side during the first few hours after delivery improves clearance of amniotic fluid and decreases aspiration risk, and infants in the newborn nursery and those rooming in with parents should be placed in the supine position as soon as they are ready for the bassinet. Because studies establishing prone and side sleeping as SIDS risk factors include infants up to 1 year of age, infants should continue to be placed supine until 1 year of age; once they can roll from supine to prone and from prone to supine, they can be allowed to remain in the sleep position they assume. Because rolling into soft bedding is an important risk factor for SUID after 3 months of age, parents and caregivers should keep the sleep environment clear of soft or loose bedding.

### Infant care practices and parent uptake of safe sleep messages: a cross-sectional survey in queensland, Australia [^a24446ea]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Evidence-based risk reduction strategies known to reduce infant mortality underpin 'Safe Sleeping' recommendations, with key messages targeting modifiable factors which families can influence the most. This study is the first investigation of infant care practices and the uptake of public health 'Safe Sleeping' messages in Australia for 15 years; a period which has seen two national public health campaigns launched. Findings demonstrate inconsistencies between current recommendations and the infant sleeping practices many Queensland families employ when caring for their young infant. In this study, only 13% of families reported they routinely practised all six of the current Safe Sleep recommendations when caring for their baby.

More first-time parents responded to this survey. Decisions families make in caring for their first child will often provide the foundations for future infant care practices and sleeping behaviours employed with subsequent children. Therefore, where practices differ from current guidelines, this may indicate an underestimate of practices utilised by families in the broader population.

A significantly increased risk of sudden infant death is reported for babies who are placed prone for sleep (OR: 2.3–13.1) and for babies who are placed on their side and found prone (OR: 8.7). Despite over two decades of 'back to sleep' advice both nationally and internationally, non-supine sleep positioning persists with 17% of caregivers placing their infant to sleep in a prone or side sleeping position as their usual practice. However, this is less than that reported in other international studies where 26–33% reported non-supine positioning as usual infant sleep position choice. The dramatic reduction in SUDI incidence in the early 1990s has been directly associated with the widespread 'Back to Sleep' campaigns adopted at this time by many countries. More than one-third of infants had been placed in a non-supine sleep position at some time since birth. These findings are similar to reports from other international studies (range 32–35%).

### Sudden infant death syndrome [^9a8dea50]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden unexpected death of a child younger than one year during sleep that cannot be explained after a postmortem evaluation including autopsy, a thorough history, and scene evaluation. The incidence of SIDS has decreased more than 50% in the past 20 years, largely as a result of the Back to Sleep campaign. The most important risk factors relate to the sleep environment. Prone and side sleeping positions are significantly more dangerous than the supine position. Bed sharing with a parent is strongly correlated with an increased risk of SIDS, especially in infants younger than 12 weeks. Apparent life-threatening events are not a risk factor for SIDS. Parents should place infants on their backs to sleep, should not share a bed, and should avoid exposing the infant to tobacco smoke. Other risk-reducing measures include using a firm crib mattress, breastfeeding, keeping vaccinations up to date, avoiding overheating due to overbundling, avoiding soft bedding, and considering the use of a pacifier during sleep once breastfeeding is established. One consequence of the Back to Sleep campaign is a significant increase in the incidence of occipital flattening. Infants who develop a flat spot should be placed with the head facing alternating directions each time he or she is put to bed. Supervised prone positioning while the infant is awake, avoiding excessive use of carriers, and upright positioning while awake are also recommended.

SIDS safe sleep — swaddling guidance — "There is no evidence to recommend swaddling as a strategy to reduce the risk of SIDS." If swaddling is used, the policy states "If infants are swaddled, they should always be placed on the back," "When an infant exhibits signs of attempting to roll, swaddling should no longer be used," and "Swaddling should be snug around the chest but allow for ample room at the hips and knees to avoid exacerbation of hip dysplasia," noting "There is a high risk of death if a swaddled infant is placed in or rolls to the prone position," that "There is no evidence with regard to SIDS risk related to the arms swaddled in or out," and that "These decisions about swaddling should be made on an individual basis, depending on the physiologic needs of the infant."

### Vital signs: trends and disparities in infant safe sleep practices-United States, 2009–2015 [^90ad7581]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Despite recommendations from AAP regarding safe sleep practices for infants, this report demonstrates that placement of infants in a nonsupine sleep position, bed sharing with infants, and use of soft bedding are commonly reported by mothers. Evidence-based interventions that encourage infant safe sleep practices by caregivers, particularly within populations where unsafe infant sleep practices are higher, could help reduce sleep-related infant mortality.

Key Points

- Infant safe sleep practices recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), including placing infants to sleep on their backs, room sharing but not bed sharing, and keeping soft objects and loose bedding out of the infant's sleep environment, can help reduce sleep-related infant deaths; however, implementation of these recommendations remains suboptimal.

- Approximately one in five mothers reported placing their infant to sleep on their side or stomach. More than one half reported bed sharing with their infant, and more than one third reported using soft bedding in the infant's sleep environment. Unsafe sleep practices varied by state, race/ethnicity, age, education, and participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children.

- Health care providers and state-based and community-based programs can identify barriers to safe sleep practices and provide culturally appropriate counseling and messaging to improve infant safe sleep practices.

### Co-sleeping, an ancient practice: issues of the past and present, and possibilities for the future [^6cbaaf8f]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Co-sleeping-infants sharing the mother's sleep space-has prevailed throughout human evolution, and continued over the centuries of western civilization despite controversy and blame of co-sleeping mothers for the deaths of their infants. By the past century, "crib death" was recognized, later identified as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and generally found to occur more frequently during bed sharing. Pediatricians warned parents of the dangers of SIDS and other risks of bed sharing, and the frequency of bed sharing decreased markedly over the years. However, during recent decades, bed sharing began to increase, though major issues were raised, including: whether bed sharing actually exacerbates or is protective against the occurrence of SIDS, whether the practice facilitates breast feeding, whether bed sharing is beneficial for an infant's development, and other concerns. Dissention may soon be diminished by use of a crib which opens at the mother's bed-side and is becoming a popular approach to mother-and-infant closeness through the night.

### Back to sleep: good advice for parents but not for hospitals? [^a74052df]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

In October 1998, when we surveyed nurses working in Iowa obstetric units about infant sleeping position in the hospital and recommendations for infant sleeping position at home, we learned that the side position was used frequently in the hospital and also was considered to be an acceptable alternative for sleeping position at home.

Objective

The purpose of our present study was to determine why nurses continued to use and endorse the side sleeping position rather than the supine position.

Design

We surveyed all Iowa hospitals that had an obstetric service as of July 1999 to learn why the side position was used.

Results

All 94 hospitals with obstetric services responded to the survey and revealed that 2 major factors were considered when an infant was put to sleep on his/her side. The most frequent response was fear of aspiration (57 responses or 51.4%) and the second was adherence to a federal brochure that lists side sleeping as a reasonable alternative (38 responses or 34.2%).

Conclusion

We conclude that the reasons reported for use of the side position in Iowa maternity hospitals do not justify its continuing use. We believe that information about the importance of placing an infant on his/her back to sleep and its superiority over placing an infant on his/her side to sleep is sufficient to warrant its availability in every maternity hospital. We speculate that if the infant sleeping position used in the hospital is not different from that taught to parents, there will be less parental confusion and greater adherence to infant positioning shown to reduce sudden infant death syndrome.

### Infant care practices and parent uptake of safe sleep messages: a cross-sectional survey in queensland, Australia [^1743c563]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

One in four infants usually slept in a room alone for night-time sleep with nearly one in two sleeping in a room alone during the day. Studies suggest babies who sleep in a separate room to their caregiver, for both day-time and night sleeps, are at a greater risk of sudden infant death. Sharing the same room as a caregiver permits close monitoring of the sleeping infant and allows for exchange of caregiver-infant sensory signals and cues providing protective and heightened infant arousal. SUDI occurs more frequently in unobserved sleep periods where babies are more likely to be found with bedding covering their head or found prone when they were placed on their side to sleep, compared to babies who did not die and who slept in the same room as their caregiver. Room sharing with an adult caregiver is reported to reduce SUDI risk by up to 50%.

### Randomised trial of infant sleep location on the postnatal ward [^9bd687e7]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether postnatal mother-infant sleep proximity affects breastfeeding initiation and infant safety.

Design

Randomised non-blinded trial analysed by intention to treat.

Setting

Postnatal wards of the Royal Victoria Hospital (RVI), Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.

Participants

64 newly delivered mother-infant dyads with a prenatal intention to breastfeed (vaginal deliveries, no intramuscular or intravenous opiate analgesics taken in the preceding 24 h).

Intervention

Infants were randomly allocated to one of three sleep conditions: baby in mother's bed with cot-side; baby in side-car crib attached to mother's bed; and baby in stand-alone cot adjacent to mother's bed.

Main Outcome Measures

Breastfeeding frequency and infant safety observed via night-time video recordings.

Results

During standardised 4-h observation periods, bed and side-car crib infants breastfed more frequently than stand-alone cot infants (mean difference (95% confidence interval (CI)): bed v stand-alone cot = 2.56 (0.72 to 4.41); side-car crib v stand-alone cot = 2.52 (0.87 to 4.17); bed v side-car crib = 0.04 (-2.10 to 2.18)). No infant experienced adverse events; however, bed infants were more frequently considered to be in potentially adverse situations (mean difference (95% CI): bed v stand-alone cot = 0.13 (0.03 to 0.23); side-car crib v stand-alone cot = 0.04 (-0.03 to 0.12); bed v side-car crib = 0.09 (-0.03–0.21)). No differences were observed in duration of maternal or infant sleep, frequency or duration of assistance provided by staff, or maternal rating of postnatal satisfaction.

Conclusion

Suckling frequency in the early postpartum period is a well-known predictor of successful breastfeeding initiation. Newborn babies sleeping in close proximity to their mothers (bedding-in) facilitates frequent feeding in comparison with rooming-in. None of the three sleep conditions was associated with adverse events, although infrequent, potential risks may have occurred in the bed group. Side-car cribs are effective in enhancing breastfeeding initiation and preserving infant safety in the postnatal ward.

### SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths: updated 2016 recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment [^060644b1]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

SIDS safe sleep — supine position and airway/GERD considerations: To reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), infants should be placed for sleep in a supine position (wholly on the back) for every sleep by every caregiver until the child reaches 1 year of age, and side sleeping is not safe and is not advised. The supine sleep position does not increase the risk of choking and aspiration in infants, even those with gastroesophageal reflux. Therefore, prone positioning is acceptable if the infant is observed and awake, particularly in the postprandial period, but prone positioning during sleep can only be considered in infants with certain upper airway disorders in which the risk of death from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may outweigh the risk of SIDS, including anatomic abnormalities such as type 3 or 4 laryngeal clefts without prior antireflux surgery. There is no evidence to suggest that infants receiving nasogastric or orogastric feeds are at an increased risk of aspiration if placed in the supine position, and elevating the head of the infant's crib is ineffective in reducing gastroesophageal reflux and is not recommended because it may lead to positions that compromise respiration.

Sleep Questionnaires

Twenty-nine (17 side-lying, 12 supine) parents completed the sleep questionnaire at 1 month of age. Although only 3 (10%) parents reported that their baby did not have good quality sleep, 8 (28%) went on to describe their baby's sleep as poor/restless or sometimes restless (3 every day; 2 > 3 d/wk; 3 ≤ 3 d/wk). In addition, 38% (47% side-lying, 25% supine) reported that their child had difficulty breathing while asleep at some time (1 every day; 3 > 3 d/wk; 3 ≤ 3 d/wk; 2 every 1–2 weeks; and 2 only when they had a cold). Ten percent (3 parents) reported that their child had stopped breathing for periods or had pauses in their breathing during their sleep at times (1 everyday; 1 > 3 d/wk; 1 ≤ 3 d/wk; 1 side-lying, 2 supine).

Three-quarters (76%) of parents described their baby as snoring or noisy when sleeping (12 every day; 4 > 3 d/wk; 3 ≤ 3 d/wk; 2 every 1–2 weeks; and 1 only when they had a cold; 94% of side-lying, 50% of supine). In addition, a third of parents also described their baby snoring or making snoring noises when awake (2 every day; 5 > 3 d/wk; 1 ≤ 3 d/wk; 2 every 1–2 weeks).

Four parents, whose babies slept on their side, reported having to reposition their babies on to their side to improve their sleep quality, perhaps implying that they did not always stay in the original position they had been placed, although this was not specifically stated by parents.

### Why babies should never sleep alone: a review of the co-sleeping controversy in relation to SIDS, bedsharing and breast feeding [^a19cc317]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

There has been much controversy over whether infants should co-sleep or bedshare with an adult caregiver and over whether such practises increase the risk of SIDS or fatal accident. However, despite opposition from medical authorities or the police, many western parents are increasingly adopting night-time infant caregiving patterns that include some co-sleeping, especially by those mothers who choose to breast feed. This review will show that the relationships between infant sleep patterns, infant sleeping arrangements and development both in the short and long term, whether having positive or negative outcomes, is anything but simple and the traditional habit of labelling one sleeping arrangement as being superior to another without an awareness of family, social and ethnic context is not only wrong but possibly harmful. We will show that there are many good reasons to insist that the definitions of different types of co-sleeping and bedsharing be recognised and distinguished. We will examine the conceptual issues related to the biological functions of mother-infant co-sleeping, bedsharing and what relationship each has to SIDS. At very least, we hope that the studies and data described in this paper, which show that co-sleeping at least in the form of roomsharing especially with an actively breast feeding mother saves lives, is a powerful reason why the simplistic, scientifically inaccurate and misleading statement 'never sleep with your baby' needs to be rescinded, wherever and whenever it is published.

### Evidence base for 2022 updated recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment to reduce the risk of sleep-related infant deaths [^ae735312]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Inclined sleep products — safety determination and risk threshold are specified: "A flat, noninclined surface is safest for infants." The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) expert "conducted infant testing to evaluate inclined sleep products and demonstrated that none of these tested products were safe for infant sleep," noting mechanism of harm: "Infants on an inclined surface can more easily flex their trunk and lift their head, facilitating rolling onto the side or prone, at which point they are at higher risk for muscle fatigue and potential suffocation." The report concluded that "products with inclines of more than 10 degrees are unsafe for infant sleep."

### Does sleep position influence sleep-disordered breathing in infants with cleft palate: a feasibility study? [^17e78504]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

At 3 months, 22 parents (11 side-lying, 11 supine) completed the sleep questionnaires. Nine parents still reported their infant had difficulty breathing when asleep, but 5 of these were only when they had a cold. In addition, 4 parents reported that their child had stopped breathing for periods or had pauses in their breathing during their sleep at times (1 everyday; 1 ≤ 3 d/wk; 2 every 1–2 weeks; 3 side-lying, 1 supine). Noisy or snoring breathing, both during the day (41% of parents reported this) and at night time (86% of parents) remained very common.

At 3 months, 3 parents regularly repositioned their baby during sleep; all reported they moved them onto their side as they slept easier that way (including 1 supine-lying baby).

### The changing concept of sudden infant death syndrome: diagnostic coding shifts, controversies regarding the sleeping environment, and new variables to consider in reducing risk [^cb97e82b]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

There has been a major decrease in the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) since the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released its recommendation in 1992 that infants be placed down for sleep in a nonprone position. Although the SIDS rate continues to fall, some of the recent decrease of the last several years may be a result of coding shifts to other causes of unexpected infant deaths. Since the AAP published its last statement on SIDS in 2000, several issues have become relevant, including the significant risk of side sleeping position; the AAP no longer recognizes side sleeping as a reasonable alternative to fully supine sleeping. The AAP also stresses the need to avoid redundant soft bedding and soft objects in the infant's sleeping environment, the hazards of adults sleeping with an infant in the same bed, the SIDS risk reduction associated with having infants sleep in the same room as adults and with using pacifiers at the time of sleep, the importance of educating secondary caregivers and neonatology practitioners on the importance of "back to sleep", and strategies to reduce the incidence of positional plagiocephaly associated with supine positioning. This statement reviews the evidence associated with these and other SIDS-related issues and proposes new recommendations for further reducing SIDS risk.

### Swaddling: will it get babies onto their backs for sleep? [^49f2365a]. Clinical Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The supine sleep position is recommended to reduce sudden infant death syndrome risk. Swaddling may improve adherence with supine placement.

Aim

To assess knowledge, attitudes, and practice regarding swaddling among adult caregivers of 0- to 3-month-old infants.

Methods

Cross-sectional descriptive survey.

Results

All 103 adults interviewed had swaddled their infant. Common reasons for swaddling included infant comfort and warmth. Almost 80% of those who swaddled their infant found it effective, 80% believed it to be comfortable, and ~90% believed swaddling to be safe. Parents who routinely used swaddling were more likely to find it effective and to place their infant supine when swaddled (P < .01).

Conclusions

Parents often use swaddling to comfort the infant, and most find it effective. Parents who routinely use swaddling are more likely to place their infant supine if swaddled. Swaddling may be a strategy for parents of infants who have difficulty sleeping in the supine position.

### Evidence base for 2022 updated recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment to reduce the risk of sleep-related infant deaths [^f8227843]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Infant sleep surfaces — boxes and cradleboards — have limited usage data and safety concerns; of 1429 mothers receiving a box, 47.9% (685) responded, 51% reported using the box as a sleeping space and 12% as the primary infant sleeping space, and bed-sharing rates at 1 week among recipients were significantly lower for exclusively breastfed infants (rate ratio: 2.0 [1.01–3.15]). Cardboard boxes that do not meet the federal safety standard are described as likely not safe for infant sleep and should not be used; there are no data regarding the safety of cradleboards for sleep, although a Healthy Native Babies Project suggests cradleboards as a culturally appropriate infant sleep surface and advises care to avoid overheating. Parents and caregivers should adhere to manufacturer maximum-weight guidelines for alternative products, and regardless of sleep surface, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends supine positioning, use of a firm, noninclined sleep surface without padded sides, and avoidance of soft objects and loose bedding.

### Obstructive sleep apnea is position dependent in young infants [^bd2f0c9a]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Role of sleep positioning in infants

Currently, the supine sleep position is recommended for all infants as part of SIDS-reduction campaigns. No exceptions attract attention, despite infants such as those with PRS seeming to benefit from the side-sleep positioning. One estimated odds ratio (OR) for SIDS between the supine and prone sleeping position is 4.46, and is 1.36 between supine and side sleeping positions. How real is the risk of SIDS being related to side-sleep positioning if side or prone positioning were applied as a part of OSA treatment? Prior to SIDS sleeping campaigns in the 1970's and 1980's, SIDS rates in Finland ranged from 0.5 to 0.6 per 1000 live births. In order to establish the safety of any type of OSA treatment, the study group should exceed 7 600 infants when comparing treatment safety to sleep position treatment with prone sleep positioning, and over 76,000 for comparing the treatment to side-sleep positioning. This simple power calculation demonstrates the low risk level related to side sleep positioning. It may not be valid to apply the standard sleep position recommendation to a specific infant population from whom side-sleep positioning may be otherwise beneficial.

### Infant sleep position: back to sleep… [^c71acc27]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Sleep position is an important safety issue for infants younger than 1 year. This is because sudden infant death syndrome is associated with infants sleeping on their tummies. Sudden infant death syndrome is the leading cause of death for infants younger than 1 year. It most commonly occurs in babies between the ages of 2 and 4 months. Despite more than 15 years of the "back to sleep" educational campaign, some parents still are not provided with appropriate education about the safest sleep position for babies. Can't i put my baby to sleep on his or her tummy once in a while. About 1 in 5 deaths from SIDS happen when an infant is being cared for by someone other than a parent. Many of these deaths occur when babies who are used to sleeping on their backs are then placed to sleep on their tummies by another caregiver. This is called unaccustomed tummy sleeping.

This is dangerous because babies who are used to sleeping on their backs and are put to sleep on their tummies are almost 20 times more likely to die of SIDS. While it is not safe to place babies on their tummies to sleep, health care providers recommend that babies spend some time while awake on their tummies. This "tummy time" should be when babies are awake and supervised. Tummy time helps babies to develop strong neck and shoulder muscles. What if my baby likes to sleep on his or her side. Babies who sleep on their sides are more likely to accidentally roll onto their tummies. Sleeping on their backs is the safest position for babies. What else can i do to provide a safe sleep environment for my child. SAFE CRIB Your child's crib should have a firm mattress and a well-fitting sheet. Do not place babies to sleep on any other type of bed. What should i do when someone else is looking after my baby.

Before leaving your baby with another caretaker, be sure to discuss safe sleep positions with that person. You can use this article during that discussion if needed to emphasize that sleeping on their backs is the safest sleep position for babies. Before leaving your baby with anyone, be sure the caretaker agrees that the safe sleep practices discussed in this article will be followed each time your baby goes to sleep.

### SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths: evidence base for 2016 updated recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment [^83849de1]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Sleep surfaces — firm surface and product standards: Infants should be placed on a firm sleep surface (eg, a mattress in a safety-approved crib) covered by a fitted sheet with no other bedding or soft objects to reduce the risk of SIDS and suffocation, and a crib, bassinet, portable crib, or play yard that conforms to the safety standards of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is recommended. Cribs should meet safety standards of the CPSC, including those for slat spacing, snugly fitting and firm mattresses, and no drop sides; the AAP recommends the use of new cribs and, if an older crib is used, care must be taken to check for recalls, intact hardware, and available assembly instructions. Soft mattresses, including memory foam, could create a pocket and increase the chance of rebreathing or suffocation if the infant is placed in or rolls over to the prone position. Mattresses should be firm, maintain shape with the designated fitted sheet so there are no gaps with surrounding walls, and only mattresses designed for the specific product should be used; pillows or cushions should not be used as substitutes or in addition to a mattress, and soft materials or objects should not be placed under a sleeping infant.

### Sudden infant death syndrome prevention [^215293df]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Supine position for sleeping

Recommendations

"Avoid prone sleeping position in infants less than 6 months old. Sleeping in supine decubitus position is the safest and clearly preferable to lateral decubitus. Only in a specific medical indication (severe gastroesophageal reflux, active respiratory illness in preterm infants and certain upper way malformations) can prone decubitus be recommended." (Grade A recommendation).

"To reduce the risk of SIDS, infants should be placed for sleep in the supine position (wholly on the back) for every sleep period by every caregiver until 1 year of age. Side sleeping is not safe and is not advised." (Grade A recommendation).

Evidence

This is the main modifiable risk factor identified for SIDS. Consistent findings across the world and decreasing trend on the incidence of SIDS in countries that have implemented the 'Back to Sleep' recommendations support the hypothesis that the supine position for sleep protects against SIDS. Indeed, case-control studies, conducted in Europe and the United States indicate that the prone position during sleep increases the risk of SIDS as compared to supine position with adjusted odds ratio (AOR) ranging from 2.3 and 13.1. Similarly, the lateral side has been associated with increased risk of SIDS when compared to supine position, with AOR ranging from 1.31 to 2. These five case-control studies were conducted in the US, the UK and in 20 regions of Europe from 1992 and 2000, including 1432 SIDS cases and 3905 matched controls. In addition, countries with preventive campaigns for avoiding prone position in infants during sleep that have been successful for reducing the prevalence of infants sleeping in such position have estimated a 30 to 50% decrease in the mortality associated to SIDS.

Supine position does not increase the risk of choking and aspiration. Only infants with certain upper airway disorders such as type 3 or 4 laryngeal clefts in which the risk of death from gastroesophageal reflux disease may outweigh the risk of SIDS can be considered to be placed in prone position during sleep.

### Infant care practices and parent uptake of safe sleep messages: a cross-sectional survey in queensland, Australia [^5633cf6f]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Sleep baby on back

For 17% of babies a non-supine sleep position was usual practice in the last 2 weeks prior to survey completion; with similar proportions of babies being placed prone (8.8%) or on their side (8.3%). One in four infants had been placed prone for sleep at some time (see Table 2).

Keep head and face uncovered

The location of where baby was positioned relative to the end of the cot (reflecting uptake of the 'Feet to bottom of cot' guideline; a component of the 'Keep head and face uncovered' message) was explored for times when baby was placed in a cot during the last 2 weeks (whether or not this was usual practice). There were 2381 (72.3%) caregivers who reported that when baby was placed in a cot for sleep, the usual placement was with baby's feet to the foot of the cot; 116 (3.5%) babies were placed in the cot with baby's head towards the top of the cot. There were 173 (5.3%) babies who did not sleep in a cot at any time during the last 2 weeks.

Most parents reported the use of a baby sleep bag or commercially designed sleep swaddle (2448, 75%). Of those who had ever used a sleep bag or commercially designed sleep swaddle, 323 (14%) did not have fitted neck and arm holes.

### Sleep-related infant deaths: updated 2022 recommendations for reducing infant deaths in the sleep environment [^784df6af]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

AAP 2022 safe sleep recommendations — swaddling: There is no evidence to recommend swaddling as a strategy to reduce the risk of SIDS. There is a high risk for death if a swaddled infant is placed in or rolls to the prone position; if infants are swaddled, always place them on the back. Swaddling should be snug around the chest but allow for ample room at the hips and knees, and weighted swaddle clothing or weighted objects within swaddles are not safe and therefore not recommended. When an infant exhibits signs of attempting to roll (which usually occurs at age 3 to 4 months but may occur earlier), swaddling is no longer appropriate. There is no evidence with regard to risk of SIDS related to the arms being swaddled in or out, and parents can decide on an individual basis whether to swaddle and whether the arms are swaddled in or out, depending on the behavioral and developmental needs of the infant.

### Suffocation deaths associated with use of infant sleep positioners – United States, 1997–2011 [^b4037e00]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2012). Low credibility.

Unintentional suffocation is the leading cause of injury death among children aged < 1 year in the United States, accounting for nearly 1,000 infant deaths annually. Since 1984, an estimated fourfold increase has been observed in accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed, with many of these deaths linked to unsafe sleep environments. Infant sleep positioners (ISPs) are devices intended to keep an infant in a specific position while sleeping, yet ISPs have been reported to have been present in the sleep environment in some cases of unintentional infant suffocation. Some specific ISPs have been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of gastroesophageal reflux or plagiocephaly (asymmetry of the skull). However, many unapproved ISPs have been marketed to the general public with claims of preventing sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), improving health, and enhancing sleep comfort. To characterize infant deaths associated with ISPs, FDA, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), and CDC examined information reported to CPSC about 13 infant deaths in the past 13 years associated with the use of ISPs. In this case series, all infants but one were aged ≤ 3 months, and most were placed on their sides to sleep. Many were found prone (i.e., lying on their abdomens). Accompanying medical issues included prematurity and intercurrent respiratory illnesses. When providing guidance for parents of newborns, health-care providers need to emphasize the importance of placing infants to sleep on their backs in a safe sleep environment. This includes reminders about the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations against side sleep position, ISPs and pillows, comforters, and other soft bedding.

### Vital signs: trends and disparities in infant safe sleep practices-United States, 2009–2015 [^09055f8b]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 3,500 sleep-related deaths among infants are reported each year in the United States, including those from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed, and unknown causes. Significant sociodemographic and geographic disparities in sleep-related infant deaths exist. To reduce risk factors for sleep-related infant mortality, recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) for safe sleep include 1) placing the infant in the supine sleep position (placing the infant on his or her back) on a firm sleep surface such as a mattress in a safety-approved crib or bassinet, 2) having infant and caregivers share a room, but not the same sleeping surface, and 3) avoiding the use of soft bedding (e.g. blankets, pillows, and soft objects) in the infant sleep environment. Additional recommendations to reduce the risk for sleep-related infant deaths include breastfeeding, providing routinely recommended immunizations, and avoiding prenatal and postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke, alcohol, and illicit drugs.

Although the individual effect of each recommendation on sleep-related infant mortality is unclear, sharp declines in SIDS and other sleep-related mortality in the 1990s have been attributed to an increase in safe sleep practices such as supine sleep. However, since the late 1990s declines in infant sleep-related deaths and nonsupine sleep positioning (on side or stomach) have been less pronounced. The rate of infant sleep-related deaths declined from 154.6 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 93.9 per 100,000 live births in 1999; in 2015, the rate of infant sleep-related deaths was 92.6 deaths per 100,000 live births. Previous research indicates implementation of safe sleep recommendations by infant caregivers remains suboptimal. In the Study of Attitudes and Factors Effecting Infant Care, which interviewed mothers 2–6 months postpartum during 2011–2014, 22% said they had placed their infant in a nonsupine sleep position, and 21% shared a bed with their infant at least once during the 2 weeks before being interviewed. In addition, in the National Infant Sleep Position Study, a household telephone survey that sampled nighttime caregivers during 2007–2010, more than half (54%) placed their infant to sleep with soft bedding during the 2 weeks before the interview.

### Sleep-related infant deaths: updated 2022 recommendations for reducing infant deaths in the sleep environment [^9bd500ca]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Infant sleep environment — positioning, surfaces, and device use: The AAP recommends supine positioning; use of a firm, noninclined sleep surface without padded sides; and avoidance of soft objects and loose bedding. Some American Indian/Alaska Native communities have promoted cradleboards; there are no data regarding the safety of cradleboards for sleep, the Healthy Native Babies Project suggests cradleboards as a culturally appropriate infant sleep surface, and care should be taken so that infants do not overheat (because of overbundling) in the cradleboard. There is no evidence that special crib mattresses and sleep surfaces claiming to reduce the chance of rebreathing carbon dioxide when the infant is in the prone position reduce the risk of a sleep-related death, although there is no disadvantage to using these mattresses if they meet safety standards. Infants should not be placed for sleep on adult-sized beds or mattresses, and portable bed rails should not be used with infants. The infant sleep area should be kept free of hazards, such as dangling cords, electric wires, and window covering cords, because these may present a strangulation risk. Sitting devices, such as car seats, strollers, swings, infant carriers, and infant slings, are not recommended for routine sleep in the hospital or at home, particularly for infants aged < 4 months; when infants fall asleep in a sitting device, remove them from the product and move them to a crib or other appropriate flat surface as soon as is safe and practical; car seats and similar products are not stable on a crib mattress or other elevated surfaces; do not leave infants unattended in car seats and similar products, and do not place or leave infants in car seats and similar products with the straps unbuckled or partially buckled. When infant slings and cloth carriers are used for carrying, ensure the infant's head is up and above the fabric, the face is visible, and the nose and mouth are clear of obstructions; if the infant's head is covered to facilitate nursing, the infant should be repositioned after feeding so that the head is up, is clear of fabric, and is not against the adult's body or the sling. In short-term emergency situations with displacement and lack of access to an approved safe sleep device/surface, an alternative device with a firm, flat, noninclined surface (eg, box, basket, or dresser drawer) with thin, firm padding may be used temporarily, but this alternative device should be replaced as soon as a CPSC-approved surface is available; the device should contain no pillows or loose or soft objects; government-regulated shelters should have an adequate number of CPSC-approved sleep surfaces, and social service agencies and emergency assistance organizations should provide resources for free or low-cost CPSC-approved surfaces.

### Safe sleep and skin-to-skin care in the neonatal period for healthy term newborns [^a546d8d8]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Implementation suggestions for safe skin-to-skin care (SSC) and rooming-in — part 2: "The following suggestions support safe implementation of these practices:" "Conduct frequent assessments and monitoring of the mother-infant dyad during postpartum rooming-in settings, with particular attention to high-risk situations such as nighttime and early morning hours." "Assess the level of maternal fatigue periodically. If the mother is tired or sleepy, move the infant to a separate sleep surface (eg, side-car or bassinet) next to the mother's bed." "Avoid bed-sharing in the immediate postpartum period by assisting mothers to use a separate sleep surface for the infant." "Promote supine sleep for all infants. SSC may involve the prone or side position of the newborn, especially if the dyad is recumbent; therefore, it is imperative that the mother/ caregiver who is providing SSC be awake and alert." and "Train all health care personnel in standardized methods of providing immediate SSC after delivery, transitioning the mother-infant dyad, and monitoring the dyad during SSC and rooming-in throughout the delivery hospital period."

### Association of supine going-to-sleep position in late pregnancy with reduced birth weight: a secondary analysis of an individual participant data meta-analysis [^0fb9f0be]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

This study found that supine maternal going-to-sleep position is associated with reduced birth size in late pregnancy. Women who reported going to sleep on their back had a clinically relevant and independent reduction in mean birth weight of 144 g, or an adjusted mean reduction of 10% in birth weight centile (customized or INTERGROWTH-21st). Public health campaigns to encourage women to go to sleep lying on their side have potential to increase birth size.

### SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths: updated 2016 recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment [^247784fb]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Safe infant sleep environment — summary of recommendations with strength. A-level recommendations are as follows: Back to sleep for every sleep; use a firm sleep surface; breastfeeding is recommended; room-sharing with the infant on a separate sleep surface is recommended; keep soft objects and loose bedding away from the infant's sleep area; consider offering a pacifier at naptime and bedtime; avoid smoke exposure during pregnancy and after birth; avoid alcohol and illicit drug use during pregnancy and after birth; avoid overheating; pregnant women should seek and obtain regular prenatal care; infants should be immunized in accordance with AAP and CDC recommendations; do not use home cardiorespiratory monitors as a strategy to reduce the risk of SIDS; health care providers, staff in newborn nurseries and NICUs, and child care providers should endorse and model the SIDS risk-reduction recommendations from birth; media and manufacturers should follow safe sleep guidelines in their messaging and advertising; and continue the "Safe to Sleep" campaign, with pediatricians and other primary care providers actively participating. B-level recommendations are to avoid use of commercial devices that are inconsistent with safe sleep recommendations, and that supervised, awake tummy time is recommended to facilitate development and to minimize development of positional plagiocephaly. C-level recommendations are to continue research and surveillance on SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths, and that there is no evidence to recommend swaddling as a strategy to reduce the risk of SIDS. Grading definitions state that Level A is good-quality patient-oriented evidence, Level B is inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence, and Level C is based on consensus, disease-oriented evidence, usual practice, expert opinion, or case series.

### SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths: updated 2016 recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment [^26dcc2dc]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Infant sleep environment and equipment — safe surfaces, devices, and hazards: A crib, bassinet, portable crib, or play yard that meets Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) standards, including slat spacing less than 2–3/8 inches with snugly fitting and firm mattresses and no drop sides, is recommended. Mattresses should be firm and maintain their shape with the fitted sheet so there are no gaps between the mattress and the crib walls. Pillows or cushions should not be used as substitutes for mattresses, and mattress toppers should not be used for infants younger than 1 year. Soft materials or objects should not be placed under a sleeping infant. Infants should not be placed for sleep on beds, and portable bed rails should not be used with infants. The infant should sleep in an area free of hazards, such as dangling cords, electric wires, and window-covering cords. Sitting devices (car seats, strollers, swings, infant carriers, infant slings) are not recommended for routine sleep; infants who are younger than 4 months are particularly at risk. When slings or cloth carriers are used for carrying, ensure the head is up and above the fabric, the face is visible, and the nose and mouth are clear of obstructions. If an infant falls asleep in a sitting device, he or she should be removed and moved to a crib or other appropriate flat surface as soon as is safe and practical; car seats and similar products are not stable on a crib mattress or other elevated surfaces, and infants should not be left unattended or with straps unbuckled or partially buckled.

### SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths: evidence base for 2016 updated recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment [^539fd90f]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Bedside and in-bed sleepers — standards and recommendations: Bedside sleepers are attached to the side of the parental bed, and the CPSC has published safety standards for bedside sleepers and they may be considered by some parents as an option; there are no CPSC safety standards for in-bed sleepers. The task force cannot make a recommendation for or against the use of either bedside sleepers or in-bed sleepers because there have been no studies examining the association between these products and SIDS or unintentional injury and death, including suffocation; studies of in-bed sleepers are underway but results are not yet available. Parents and caregivers should adhere to the manufacturer's guidelines regarding maximum weight of infants who use these products, and with any of these products, other AAP guidelines for safe sleep, including supine positioning and avoidance of soft objects and loose bedding, should be followed; alternate sleep surfaces that meet CPSC standards, such as portable cribs, play yards, and bassinets, can be used and may be more acceptable for some families because they are smaller and more portable.

### Sleep-related infant deaths: updated 2022 recommendations for reducing infant deaths in the sleep environment [^5a9a3f6b]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Positional therapy, head elevation, and choking risk in sleeping infants — The guideline advises "not to use positional therapy (ie, head elevation, lateral and prone positioning) to treat symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in sleeping infants." It states "There is no evidence to suggest that infants receiving nasogastric or orogastric feeds are at increased risk for aspiration if placed in the supine position." It further notes "Elevating the head of the infant's crib is ineffective in reducing GER and is not recommended." Hazards of inclines are described: "Infants cannot be placed at a 30-degree incline without sliding down, which raises concern that the infant could slide into a position that may compromise respiration," and "Infants sleeping at lesser inclines can more easily flex their trunk and lift their head, facilitating rolling onto the side or prone, at which point they are at higher risk for muscle fatigue and potential suffocation." Additionally, Figure 1 emphasizes that "Back sleeping does not increase the risk of choking."

### Infant care practices and parent uptake of safe sleep messages: a cross-sectional survey in queensland, Australia [^b456b507]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

The development of Australia's SUDI prevention public health programs and dissemination of the evidence-based Safe Sleeping messages is primarily supported by Red Nose (formally SIDS and Kids), a nationally recognised non-governmental organisation. The key recommendations promulgated are based on the modifiable factors parents and health professionals can influence the most. The current public health Safe Sleeping program contains six key messages: 1) Sleep baby on back; 2) Keep head and face uncovered; 3) Keep baby smoke free before and after birth; 4) Safe sleeping environment night and day; 5) Sleep baby in safe cot in parents' room; 6) Breastfeed baby.

Despite Australia's national evidence-based health promotion program, inconsistencies exist amid the many forms of advice families receive, with each state and territory's Health Department developing their own slightly modified policies and guidelines. This is especially so for those messages which have an emerging or developing evidence-base, such as shared sleeping, infant wrapping, and dummy use. Differences in interpretation of this evidence and/or policy/advice have led to a lack of consensus among researchers and policy makers as to exactly what the message should be. For instance, sharing a sleep surface remains a controversial topic with conflicting views on the associated benefits and risks with debate continuing in literature as to whether messages should convey a risk elimination (never share a sleep surface) or risk minimisation (reduce risk in all environments a baby may sleep whether intentional or not) approach. Many discussions challenge whether sharing a sleep surface itself poses a risk or if the risk is associated with the circumstances in which shared sleeping occurs. Due to challenges such as this, inconsistencies in resources exist both nationally and internationally, creating mixed messages within the community leading to confusion and potentially undermining key national public health messages.

### SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths: updated 2016 recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment [^d9b70ca6]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

SIDS safe sleep — health care and child care modeling and education — "Health care professionals, staff in newborn nurseries and NICUs, and child care providers should endorse and model the SIDS risk-reduction recommendations from birth." Implementation points include "Staff in NICUs should model and implement all SIDS risk-reduction recommendations as soon as the infant is medically stable and well before anticipated discharge" and "Staff in newborn nurseries should model and implement these recommendations beginning at birth and well before anticipated discharge." Education and counseling directives state "All physicians, nurses, and other health care providers should receive education on safe infant sleep. Health care providers should screen for and recommend safe sleep practices at each visit for infants up to 1 year old," and "Families who do not have a safe sleep space for their infant should be provided with information about low-cost or free cribs or play yards." System-level guidance includes "Hospitals should ensure that hospital policies are consistent with updated safe sleep recommendations and that infant sleep spaces (bassinets, cribs) meet safe sleep standards" and "All state regulatory agencies should require that child care providers receive education on safe infant sleep and implement safe sleep practices. It is preferable that they have written policies."

ABM Clinical Protocol #37 — daytime strategies to support breastfeeding, sleep, and well-being — advises: Wear your baby in a baby-wrap or baby-carrier. Wearing your baby keeps baby calm. Make sure your baby's back is supported and your baby is held firmly to your body. Your baby's face should be free. Daytime activity may help your baby sleep better at night. Expose your baby to normal daytime light and noises. Include some supervised tummy-time. Nap when your baby naps, if you can. Focus on your baby's behavior cues. Tracking apps are not needed. Ask for help. Other caregivers can change, bathe, and dress your baby. They can help with cooking, cleaning, and older children.

### An individual participant data meta-analysis of maternal going-to-sleep position, interactions with fetal vulnerability, and the risk of late stillbirth [^24481f8c]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study eligibility was assessed independently by two reviewers (RC and TS). All potential study investigators were contacted to verify eligibility and invited to participate. If there was no response, co-authors and journal editors were approached. The included studies had a risk of bias assessment using the instrument tool "Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies — of Exposures (ROBINS — E)". Participant level exclusion criteria (multiple pregnancy, major congenital abnormality, gestation < 28 weeks' when going-to-sleep position data during pregnancy was collected, termination of pregnancy at ≥ 28 weeks', and receiving a study intervention that may have affected going-to-sleep position) were applied during the analysis. A detailed data management plan was agreed by CRIBSS investigators prior to the analysis. For the primary analysis, the going-to-sleep position utilised was the last available going-to-sleep position recorded during pregnancy (within two weeks of when the women estimated their baby had died in cases). The position was categorised as left side, right side, variable sides, supine, prone, and propped. Left side was used as the reference group for the analysis. Going-to-sleep position was merged to supine versus non-supine groups in the analysis of interaction.

2.2 Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was late stillbirth, using the WHO international comparison definition of stillbirth: "a baby born with no signs of life at or after 28 weeks' gestation". Intrapartum stillbirth is included in the analysis with the rationale that supine going-to-sleep position may result in a vulnerable baby that is unable to tolerate labour. In addition, it is not always possible to be certain that the death occurred intrapartum. As the outcome (late stillbirth) is rare, odds ratio estimates rather than relative risk were used.

2.3 Risk of Bias

Two reviewers (RC and AG) independently rated the risk of bias for non-randomised studies using the ROBINS-E tooland this was adjudicated by a third reviewer (ML) when required.

Preterm infants — supine sleep and discharge modeling — are addressed with directive language: "Preterm infants should be placed supine as soon as possible," because "Infants born preterm have an increased risk of SIDS" and the prone–SIDS association in preterm/low birth weight infants is "equal to, or perhaps even stronger than" in term infants; accordingly, "preterm infants should be placed supine for sleep as soon as clinical status has stabilized," "preterm infants should be placed supine for sleeping, just as term infants should," and "Hospitalized preterm infants should be kept predominantly in the supine position, at least from the postmenstrual age of 32 weeks onward"; teams "should model the recommendations as soon as the infant is medically stable and significantly before the infant's anticipated discharge," and "NICUs are encouraged to develop and implement policies" to ensure modeling for parents.

### Survey of maternal sleep practices in late pregnancy in a multi-ethnic sample in south auckland, New Zealand [^c3ade395]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

We asked women if they could change their going-to-sleep position to their left side if there were health benefits for the baby. Of the 70% who did not currently settle to sleep on their left side, 86% said they could change to left. The large majority (94%) of these women reported that changing would not be difficult for them.

Consistent with findings from another study, over half (60%) of participants in our survey reported that they used pillows to support their back, knees and abdomen in their usual going-to-sleep position. Pillows were also the favoured (60%) response when women were asked what might assist those who usually went to sleep in the non-left position to change to their left side, if that was recommended.

Women were asked to identify what side of the bed they usually went to sleep on in the last week. The left-hand side and right-hand side were similar (42 and 39% respectively), followed by middle (10%) and unsure (10%). These figures differed somewhat from an Australian study of 30 women where a greater (57%) proportion reported sleeping on the right-hand side of the bed, less (37%) on the left-hand side, and 7% slept in a single bed.

We undertook multivariable analysis to identify risk factors associated with non-left side going-to-sleep position. The non-modifiable risk factor of ethnicity was identified, which may enable targeting of a future public health intervention on sleep position. BMI was also identified as a risk factor, with heavier women being more likely to sleep on the left side, a finding we are not currently able to explain. A novel and modifiable factor that could become incorporated into a late pregnancy sleep routine, was that sleeping on the left-hand side of bed is associated with a left side going-to-sleep position. Encouragingly, the large majority of participants (84%) who did not currently sleep on the left-hand side of the bed reported that they could change the side of bed they slept on, to help to modify their usual going-to-sleep position from non-left to left, if this was better for the baby.

ABM Clinical Protocol #37 — physiologic infant care at night-time — states: Breastfeeding at night stimulates milk production. Night breastfeeding helps your baby grow. Sleep near your baby. Breastfeed at night rather than pump or use bottles, if you can. Your night-time milk contains melatonin. Giving solids or formula before 6 months may decrease milk production. Do not sleep train in the first 6 months. It is not recommended in the first year. Bedsharing safety is very important. Everyone should make their bed safe for baby. Keep the lights off at night. Avoid getting up at night.

### Evidence base for 2022 updated recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment to reduce the risk of sleep-related infant deaths [^64127280]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Room sharing versus separate room and bed/surface sharing risk — The safest place for a baby to sleep is on a separate sleep surface designed for infants close to the parents' bed. Infants sleeping in a separate room are 2.75 to 11.5 times more likely to die suddenly and unexpectedly than infants who are room sharing without bed sharing. When all bed-sharing or surface-sharing circumstances are included in meta-analyses, the risk of dying suddenly and unexpectedly is almost 3 times higher than room sharing without bed sharing.

### SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths: updated 2016 recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment [^e0e7938e]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Preterm infants — supine positioning and counseling: Preterm infants should be placed supine as soon as possible because they are at an increased risk of SIDS, and the association between prone sleep and SIDS among low birth weight and preterm infants is equal to or stronger than among term infants. The task force concurs that "preterm infants should be placed supine for sleeping, just as term infants should," and parents should be counseled about the importance of supine sleeping in preventing SIDS. Hospitalized preterm infants should be kept predominantly supine from at least the postmenstrual age of 32 weeks onward to acclimate before discharge, and NICU personnel should endorse safe sleep guidelines with parents from admission.

### Sleeping patterns of Swedish women experiencing a stillbirth between 2000-2014-an observational study [^650d3fa1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

External (to the fetus) stressors may act together with maternal factors as well as fetal and placental factors to increase the risk of stillbirth. Data published in 2011 indicate non-left side sleeping positions, particularly the supine one, is such a stressor; we do not know, however, if this new knowledge has influenced the choice of sleeping position among pregnant women.

Methods

Using a web-based questionnaire made available at the home page of the Swedish national infant foundation we collected information on sleeping positions among women who gave birth to a stillborn baby between 2000 and 2014.

Results

The questionnaire was completed by 583 women. About one third of the women reporting their sleeping position stated that they lay down on their the left side when going to bed, and another third reported lying down as often on the left as on the right side. Figures for typically going to bed on the left side the 4 weeks preceding the stillbirth was as follows: 72 (30%) of 242 between 2011 and 2014 and 86 (27%) of 313 between 2000 and 2010. Among the 240 women who remembered their position when waking up on the day the stillbirth was diagnosed, 63 (26%) reported a supine position.

Conclusion

Our data indicate that one third of the women went to bed on the left side the month before the stillbirth. The data are consistent with the notion that efforts in Sweden to advise women to lie on their left side when going to bed may decrease the rate of stillbirth.

### Who should have a sleep study for sleep related breathing disorders? [^c86929d8]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2004). Low credibility.

By the time children are 5 years old more of their life will have been spent asleep than awake. Sleep medicine is therefore especially relevant in paediatrics. However, one recent survey showed that paediatricians' knowledge of sleep medicine is poor and that few paediatricians enquire about sleep as part of their general consultation.1

### SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths: evidence base for 2016 updated recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment [^d581b8d8]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Swaddling and SIDS risk — there is no evidence to recommend swaddling as a strategy to reduce the risk of SIDS, and infants who are swaddled have an increased risk of death if they are placed in or roll to the prone position. If swaddling is used, infants should always be placed on the back, and when an infant exhibits signs of attempting to roll, swaddling should no longer be used. Evidence is mixed, with one study suggesting a decrease in SIDS rate with swaddling if the infant was supine, but an increased risk if placed prone, another study finding a 31-fold increase in SIDS risk with swaddling, and a 12-fold increased risk of SIDS if placed on or rolling to prone when swaddled. If swaddling is used, the infant should be placed wholly supine and swaddling discontinued as soon as rolling attempts begin; commercially available swaddle sacks are an acceptable alternative, and there is no evidence with regard to SIDS risk related to the arms swaddled in or out.

### Evidence base for 2022 updated recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment to reduce the risk of sleep-related infant deaths [^c201b4ff]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Guidance for parents who fall asleep while feeding the infant notes that bed sharing can occur unintentionally if parents fall asleep while feeding their infant or at times when parents are particularly tired, or infants are fussy, and that evidence suggests that it is relatively less hazardous (but still not recommended) to fall asleep with the infant in the adult bed than on a sofa or armchair, should the parent fall asleep. It is advised that no pillows, sheets, blankets, pets, or any soft or loose items that could obstruct infant breathing or cause overheating be in the bed, and because there is evidence that the risk of bed sharing is higher with longer duration, if the parent falls asleep while feeding the infant in bed, the parent is advised to return the infant to a separate sleep surface as soon as the parent awakens.

### Does sleep position influence sleep-disordered breathing in infants with cleft palate: a feasibility study? [^7ba1d36a]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Sleep Monitoring

One hundred and twenty infants were assessed for eligibility; 48 were eligible and 30 consented (17 side-lying, 13 supine; Figure 1). Baseline demographic data is provided in Table 1.

Figure 1.
Consort diagram of flow through study (as per CONSORT 2010 statement;).

Table 1.
Baseline Characteristics of Infants Side- and Back-Lying.

At 1 month of age, 13 side-lying babies provided oxygen saturation monitoring data over 24 separate sleep sessions (13 sessions > 90 minutes in length) and 11 supine-lying babies provided data over 26 sleep sessions (21 sessions > 90 minutes in length). At 3 months of age, 10 side-lying babies provided oxygen saturation monitoring data over 24 sleep sessions (12 sessions > 90 minutes in length) and 9 supine-lying babies provided data over 26 sleep sessions (15 sessions > 90 minutes in length). The median length of recordings used in the analysis at 1 month was 2 hours 36 minutes and 3 hours 18 minutes and at 3 months was 4 hours 19 minutes and 3 hours 38 minutes (for side-lying and back-lying, respectively). Summary statistics for sleep sessions > 90 minutes are provided in Table 2. Mean SpO 2, mean nadir > 4% /3% /2%, and median ODI-4 and ODI-3 were similar between side- and supine-lying babies at both time points. Mean ODI-4 and ODI-3 was lower for side-lying infants at 1 and 3 months. On reviewing the individual data, there appeared to be considerably more variability in the oxygen saturation measurements of the supine-lying infants.

Table 2.
Data From Saturation Recordings > 90 Minutes Long at 1 and 3 Months in Side- and Supine-Lying Babies.

The majority of parents were unable to carry out the ETCO 2 monitoring as they found it disturbed their babies and results on only 12 infants at visit 1 and 6 at visit 2 were received, only 1 of which was > 90 minutes.

### SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths: evidence base for 2016 updated recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment [^bb83cf81]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Swaddling and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) risk — Swaddling is recognized as one of many child care practices that can be used to calm infants, promote sleep, and encourage the use of the supine position; however, there is no evidence to recommend routine swaddling as a strategy to reduce the risk of SIDS. The risk of death is high if a swaddled infant is placed in or rolls to the prone position; if infants are swaddled, they should always be placed on the back, and when an infant exhibits signs of attempting to roll, swaddling should no longer be used. Swaddling must be correctly applied to avoid hazards such as hip dysplasia, head covering, and strangulation, and swaddling does not reduce the necessity to follow recommended safe sleep practices. Accumulating evidence suggests that routine swaddling has only minimal effects on arousal, there have been no studies of arousal to hypoxia or hypercapnia, and there is no evidence with regard to SIDS risk related to the arms swaddled in or out.

### Background… [^a849828f]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance Expecting or caring for a baby. Take these steps to help baby sleep safely and reduce the risk of sleep-related infant deaths, including sudden infant death syndrome and accidental suffocation. How to create a safe sleep area Place your baby on his or her back for all sleep times — naps and at night. If a baby spits up during sleep, babies' anatomy and gag reflex help prevent them from choking. This is true even while baby is sleeping on their back. Babies who sleep on their backs are much less likely to die of SIDS than babies who sleep on their sides or stomachs. Use a firm, flat sleep surface, such as a mattress in a safety-approved crib covered only by a fitted sheet. Parents and caretakers might feel they should place their baby on a soft surface to help with sleep. Many even feel that the baby will be more comfortable. However, soft surfaces can increase the risk of sleep-related death.

A firm sleep surface helps reduce the risk of SIDS and suffocation. Keep your baby's sleep area in the same room where you sleep, ideally until your baby is at least 6 months old. Accidental suffocation or strangulation can happen when a baby is sleeping in an adult bed or other unsafe sleep surfaces. Sharing a room with your baby may decrease the risk of SIDS by as much as 50% and is safer than bed sharing. A report found that not room sharing increased the chance of sleep-related suffocation by more than 18 times compared to room sharing with a parent or caregiver. Placing the crib close to your bed so that the baby is within view can make it easier to monitor your baby. Having them in reach can also help make it easier to feed and comfort them. Keep soft bedding such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, and soft toys out of your baby's sleep area. Additionally, do not cover your baby's head or allow your baby to get too hot.

Parents may feel they should add sheets or blankets to their baby's crib to keep their baby warm and comfortable. However, a report found that babies who slept on soft bedding like sheets, comforters, and blankets increased the chance of sleep-related suffocation by 16 times compared with babies who did not sleep on soft bedding.

### Population trends in sudden infant death syndrome [^9cbcca9f]. Seminars in Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

This review documents and assesses recent trends in sudden infant death syndrome. We review medical literature, Internet resources, and national governmental data. A striking reduction in SIDS incidence of more than 50% has been observed in various countries after interventions, particularly during the early 1990s, to reduce the prevalence of prone infant sleeping. A reduction in postneonatal mortality has accompanied these lower rates. Evaluation studies from several countries indicate that the SIDS rate drop is largely attributable to a decline in the proportion of babies sleeping prone. Within countries, the SIDS rate decline has not occurred to the same extent for different ethnic and socio-economic groups. Future public health activities must aim to address this issue. In the post-intervention era, the relative importance of the risk factors of side compared to supine sleeping and soft bedding near the infant's airway have become more evident. Recent death scene data indicate that a substantial proportion of the remaining SIDS deaths could be avoided by supine sleeping and by providing a safe sleeping environment for all infants.

### Transition to a safe home sleep environment for the NICU patient [^1f731497]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Sleep position and SIDS risk — since 1992, back sleeping has been recommended for the reduction of sleep-related deaths, and in conjunction with the Back to Sleep campaign in 1994, SIDS rates in the United States decreased by 53% by 1999. Prone and side sleep positions are associated with an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and neither are recommended; the risk of SIDS for preterm and low birth weight infants in the prone position is potentially greater than that of healthy term infants. Although nonsupine positioning may be applied in the NICU for potential therapeutic benefit, it can be used as a teachable moment with families regarding eventual readiness for safe infant sleep positioning and environment.

### Speaking out on safe sleep: evidence-based infant sleep recommendations [^321ae5a6]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued recommendations in 2005 and 2011 to reduce sleep-related infant death, which advise against all bedsharing for sleep. These recommendations overemphasize the risks of bedsharing, and this overemphasis has serious unintended consequences. It may result in increased deaths on sofas as tired parents try to avoid feeding their infants in bed. Current evidence shows that other risks are far more potent, such as smoking, shared sleep on sofas, sleeping next to impaired caregivers, and formula feeding. The emphasis on separate sleep is diverting resources away from addressing these critical risk factors. Recommendations to avoid bedsharing may also interfere with breastfeeding. We examine both the evidence behind the AAP recommendations and the evidence omitted from those recommendations. We conclude that the only evidence-based universal advice to date is that sofas are hazardous places for adults to sleep with infants; that exposure to smoke, both prenatal and postnatal, increases the risk of death; and that sleeping next to an impaired caregiver increases the risk of death. No sleep environment is completely safe. Public health efforts must address the reality that tired parents must feed their infants at night somewhere and that sofas are highly risky places for parents to fall asleep with their infants, especially if parents are smokers or under the influence of alcohol or drugs. All messaging must be crafted and reevaluated to avoid unintended negative consequences, including impact on breastfeeding rates, or falling asleep in more dangerous situations than parental beds. We must realign our resources to focus on the greater risk factors, and that may include greater investment in smoking cessation and doing away with aggressive formula marketing. This includes eliminating conflicts of interest between formula marketing companies and organizations dedicated to the health of children.

### The development of sleep during the first months of life [^b631515d]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

The development of sleep during the first months of life is intriguing from a scientific point of view but is interesting to the clinician as well. This review aims at providing data on sleep in "low-risk" premature neonates, neonates born at term, and infants up to the age of 6 months. The various milestones in clinical and polygraphic features of sleep allow for week-to-week assessment of brain function in normal and sick children.

### Current SIDS research: time to resolve conflicting research hypotheses and collaborate [^89c3420a]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Reappraisal of the popular mainstream SIDS research hypothesis

The triple risk hypothesisformed the basis for hypotheses centred on the CNS/brainstem control of arousal, respiration, and cardiac function as well as a focus on the prone sleep position and the sleeping environment. The paradigm explains prone sleep position as playing a causal role; this seems disingenuous given that babies die in supine and side positions which should necessarily dictate different mechanisms of demise. Rather, it would be logical to consider a prone sleep position increasing the risk of SIDS through an unknown mechanism. Airway obstruction in prone sleepers would make it implausible to attribute non-prone SIDS deaths to a similar mechanism. An explanation may reside in an increased risk in prone over other positions. As alluded to previously, such increased risk could relate to prone sleep position increasing the likelihood of colonisation by toxigenic bacteria from the sleeping surface and the increased likelihood of induction of bacterial lethal toxins. This is discussed further below.

In a different context, the attribution of sleep position with causality has led to an argument for a causal relationship between supine sleep position and autism spectrum disorder; based on the increase in autism rates following the introduction of the Back-to-Sleep (BTS)/Reducing-the-Risk (RTR) campaign in five different countries. Association does not equal causation.

### Survey of maternal sleep practices in late pregnancy in a multi-ethnic sample in south auckland, New Zealand [^7bf078ce]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

We asked the 263 non-left side sleepers if it would be possible to modify their going-to-sleep position to their left side if this was of benefit to the baby; most (86.3%) responded that they could change with minimal difficulty (Table 2). Only 5.3% reported that the change would be quite or very difficult. Pillows behind the back (35.3%), between the knees (17.8%), and under the abdomen (11.9%) were considered as potentially helpful aids for over half (59.4%) of the 227 women who reported that change was possible. However, 36 women (13.7% of the non-left side sleepers) reported it would not be possible for them to go to sleep on their left side, even if this was better for the baby; the majority (55.5%) of these women were sleeping on their right side and two (5.6%) reported a supine position.

Table 2
Possibility of left side going-to-sleep position if better for baby

a Percentages add up to more than 100% as some selected more than one reason

We also asked about the possibility of changing the side of the bed that women slept on if it would help them change to a left side going-to-sleep position. Of the 217 women who did not usually sleep on the left-hand side of the bed, 83.9% reported that changing to the left-hand side of the bed would be possible.

In the multivariable analysis, four factors were significantly associated with reporting a non-left side going-to-sleep position in late pregnancy (Table 3). These were: Maori (aOR 2.64 95% CI 1.23–5.66) and Pacific (aOR 2.91 95% CI 1.46–5.78) ethnicity compared to Asian and predominantly New Zealand European women; lower BMI (aOR 0.93 95% CI 0.89–0.96); and not sleeping on the left-hand side of the bed (aOR 3.29 95% CI 2.03–5.32). Maternal age, gestational age, living with a partner, and receiving advice on pregnancy sleep position from any source were unrelated to non-left side going-to-sleep position.

### SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths: evidence base for 2016 updated recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment [^6a99fd6f]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Commercial devices — Avoid the use of commercial devices that are inconsistent with safe sleep recommendations. Claims that sleep devices, mattresses, or special sleep surfaces reduce SIDS must therefore be supported by epidemiologic evidence, and at a minimum, any devices used should meet safety standards of the CPSC, the Juvenile Product Manufacturers Association, and ASTM International. The AAP concurs with the US Food and Drug Administration and CPSC that manufacturers should not claim protection against SIDS without scientific evidence. Wedges and positioning devices might increase the risk of suffocation, the CPSC has received reports of deaths attributable to suffocation and entrapment with these devices, and most reported deaths occurred when infants were prone or side positioned or after slipping or rolling. Because of the lack of evidence and potential for suffocation and entrapment risk, the AAP concurs with the CPSC and the US Food and Drug Administration in warning against the use of these products, and if positioning devices are used in the hospital as part of physical therapy, they should be removed from the infant sleep area well before discharge. Although models of air‑permeable mattresses show significantly better aeration and substantially lower temperatures, there is no evidence that rebreathing, per se, causes SIDS and no epidemiologic evidence that these mattresses reduce the risk of SIDS.

### SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths: updated 2016 recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment [^2edb47ac]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths — research, surveillance, messaging, and investigation directives are as follows: Safe sleep messages should be reviewed, revised, and reissued at least every 5 years to address the next generation of new parents and products on the market. Continue research and surveillance on the risk factors, causes, and pathophysiologic mechanisms of SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths, with the ultimate goal of eliminating these deaths altogether. Education campaigns need to be evaluated, and innovative intervention methods need to be encouraged and funded. Continued research and improved surveillance on the etiology and pathophysiologic basis of SIDS should be funded. Standardized protocols for death scene investigations, as per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protocol, should continue to be implemented. Comprehensive autopsies, including full external and internal examination of all major organs and tissues including the brain; complete radiographs; metabolic testing; and toxicology screening should be performed. Training about how to conduct a comprehensive death scene investigation offered to medical examiners, coroners, death scene investigators, first responders, and law enforcement should continue; and resources to maintain training and conduct of these investigations need to be allocated. In addition, child death reviews, with involvement of pediatricians and other primary care providers, should be supported and funded. Improved and widespread surveillance of SIDS and SUID cases should be implemented and funded. Federal and private funding agencies should remain committed to all aspects of the aforementioned research.

### Bed-sharing is a risk for sudden unexpected death in infancy [^f22bd254]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2023). Medium credibility.

Not learning from a past epidemic

Inadvertent promotion of parental behaviour change to infants sleeping pronecaused thousands of sudden infant deaths worldwide in the 1960–1980s. It is estimated that 10 000 unnecessary infant deaths occurred between 1965 (5% prone) and 1990 (55% prone) in the UK because of this change. Many deaths would have been avoided if systematic review and meta-analysis had been undertaken in the early 1970s when sufficient evidence had already accumulated. Meta-analysis has been undertaken for bed-sharingand showed an inherent risk of SUDI for babies under 3 months without additional hazards. As paediatricians we know this makes sense as head control to safeguard the airway develops over the first 3–4 months.

We urge the UK governments' policy to follow the lead of health agencies around the world focusing on safety in order to avoid increasing the risk of death for many babies and not succumbing to pressure to change this advice: "The safest place for your baby to sleep at night, during the first six months, is on their back in a cot in your room."

### A randomised trial of placing preterm infants on their back or left side after birth [^8807778a]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Basic life support guidelines recommend placing spontaneously breathing children and adults on their side. Though the majority of preterm newborns breathe spontaneously, they are routinely placed on their back after birth. We hypothesised that they would breathe more effectively when placed on their side.

Objective

To determine whether preterm newborns placed on their left side at birth, compared with those placed on their back, have higher preductal oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 5min of life.

Design/Methods

We randomised infants < 32weeks to be placed on their back or on their left side immediately after birth. Respiratory support was given with a T-piece and face mask with initial fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.3. The FiO2 was increased if SpO2 was < 70% at 5min.

Results

We enrolled 87 infants, 41 randomised to back and 46 to left side. The groups were well matched for demographic variables. Fourteen (6 back and 8 left side) infants did not receive respiratory support in the first 5min. The mean (SD) SpO2 was not different between the groups (back 72 (23) % versus left side 71 (24) %, p = 0.956). We observed no adverse effects of placing infants on their side and found no differences in secondary outcomes between the groups.

Conclusions

Preterm infants on their left side did not have higher SpO2 at 5min of life. Placing preterm infants on their side at birth is feasible and appears to be a reasonable alternative to placing them on their back.

### Sleep-related infant deaths: updated 2022 recommendations for reducing infant deaths in the sleep environment [^20ae2f02]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Preterm and hospitalized infant safe sleep in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) — Hospitalized preterm infants "should be placed supine as soon as clinical status has stabilized and they have achieved positional stability, that is, when therapeutic or nonsupine positioning is no longer medically indicated," and "This milestone is usually achieved by 32 weeks' gestational age as the infant's flexion tone and strength develop." Supine positioning "for every sleep should be modeled in the NICU when infants are medically stable," and the AAP reiterates that "preterm infants should be placed supine for sleeping, just as term infants should, and the parents of preterm infants should be counseled about the importance of supine sleeping in preventing SIDS." It further states that "Hospitalized preterm infants should be kept predominantly in the supine position, at least from the postmenstrual age of 32 weeks onward, so that they become acclimated to supine sleeping before discharge," and that even among preterm infants with GER, "safe sleep approaches, including supine positioning on a flat and firm surface and avoidance of commercial devices designed to maintain head elevation in the crib, should be paramount as a model for parents of infants approaching discharge (ie, infants > 32 weeks' postmenstrual age) from the hospital." The guideline adds that "NICU personnel should endorse safe sleeping guidelines with parents of infants from the time of admission to the NICU," and during the birth hospitalization to "place healthy, newborn infants supine on a flat, noninclined surface for every sleep" and that "skin-to-skin care is recommended for all mothers and newborns, regardless of feeding or delivery method, immediately after birth (as soon as the mother is medically stable, awake, and able to respond to her newborn), and to continue for at least an hour."

Safe sleep environment — use of a firm sleep surface: Infants should be placed on a firm sleep surface (eg, mattress in a safety-approved crib) covered by a fitted sheet with no other bedding or soft objects to reduce the risk of SIDS and suffocation. A firm surface maintains its shape and will not indent or conform to the shape of the infant's head when the infant is placed on the surface.

### Intermittent hypoxia in supine versus side position in term neonates [^6f24dc8f]. Pediatric Research (2009). Low credibility.

Supine sleeping, recommended to prevent sudden infant death, should be started in the delivery hospital, but meets concern that neonates may exhibit more intermittent hypoxia in this position. We aimed to demonstrate that intermittent hypoxia is equally rare in supine and side position. We enrolled 609 term neonates in a crossover study. Pulse oximeter saturation (Spo2) was recorded throughout; feeding periods were excluded. The rate of desaturation events to < 80%/h was the primary study variable. Four hundred seventy-six recordings fulfilled study criteria. Mean duration of recording was 4.8 h in side and 4.9 h in supine position (SD 0.8 for both). There was a mean of 0.11 desaturation events per hour in supine and 0.05 per hour in side position. Of the 118 infants with desaturation events, more had such events only in supine position (64 vs. 31 infants). For supine compared with side position, the adjusted odds ratio for at least one desaturation event was 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.3–3.1). The lowest Spo2 value reached during these events was 56% in supine and 53% in side position. These neonates had more desaturation events while sleeping supine. We speculate, however, that this positional effect likely is too small to affect outcome.

### Sleep environment risks for younger and older infants [^ecf9aee4]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Sudden infant death syndrome and other sleep-related causes of infant mortality have several known risk factors. Less is known about the association of those risk factors at different times during infancy. Our objective was to determine any associations between risk factors for sleep-related deaths at different ages.

Methods

A cross-sectional study of sleep-related infant deaths from 24 states during 2004–2012 contained in the National Center for the Review and Prevention of Child Deaths Case Reporting System, a database of death reports from state child death review teams. The main exposure was age, divided into younger (0–3 months) and older (4 months to 364 days) infants. The primary outcomes were bed-sharing, objects in the sleep environment, location (eg, adult bed), and position (eg, prone).

Results

A total of 8207 deaths were analyzed. Younger victims were more likely bed-sharing (73.8% vs. 58.9%, P < .001) and sleeping in an adult bed/on a person (51.6% vs. 43.8%, P < .001). A higher percentage of older victims had an object in the sleep environment (39.4% vs. 33.5%, P < .001) and changed position from side/back to prone (18.4% vs. 13.8%, P < .001). Multivariable regression confirmed these associations.

Conclusions

Risk factors for sleep-related infant deaths may be different for different age groups. The predominant risk factor for younger infants is bed-sharing, whereas rolling into objects in the sleep area is the predominant risk factor for older infants. Parents should be warned about the dangers of these specific risk factors appropriate to their infant's age.

### Does sleep position influence sleep-disordered breathing in infants with cleft palate: a feasibility study? [^438bcc92]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

This feasibility study provides the necessary information to enable the design of a future pragmatic study to enable us to develop a better understanding of the importance of sleep position and SDB for infants with CP. Optimizing and standardizing the recommended sleep position for infants with CP has clear potential health advantages, not least in terms of facial development, cognitive functioning, weight gain, and the avoidance of significant cardiorespiratory complications. Clinical nurse specialists support a future study to enable them to provide guidance to parents based on an evidence base. The qualitative findings about parents' perspectives on SDB and sleep provide practitioners with information about the concerns and perspectives of parents, highlighting the need for better patient information to explain SDB and its potential sequelae.

Health care professionals face a clinical dilemma between adhering to standard "back to sleep" guidance and responding to clinical assessment of respiratory effort for infants with CP. In the absence of clear evidence, specialist centers rely on clinical judgment regarding respiratory problems to identify what they believe is the most appropriate sleeping position for infants with CP. Clearly, that advice continues to be different in different centers across the country. Further research is needed to determine the best sleep position for an infant with CP. Based on the findings from this feasibility study, we propose a comprehensive pragmatic cohort study incorporating a parallel group randomized controlled trial of side-lying compared with supine sleep positioning in infants with CP and would represent an important step toward a better understanding of SDB in this patient group.

### Bed-sharing is a risk for sudden unexpected death in infancy [^c3f2d72f]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2023). Medium credibility.

Breast feeding and bed-sharing

We recognise that research indicates that bed-sharing is associated with longer duration of breast feeding and other breastfeeding outcomes. The NICE guidelinesuggests this positive effect. However, a recent 2021 Cochrane Review — Bed sharing vs no bed sharing for healthy term neonates — found no randomised controlled trials that were of sufficient quality to be examined.

We recognise that many parents choose to take baby into bed to feed (breast or bottle) or to comfort. Many deaths occur when adult caregivers unintentionally fall asleep. A smartphone alarm/timer may reduce these events. The American Academy of Pediatrics 2016 guidelines recommends returning infant back into their safe sleep space once parent wakes.

### Does sleep position influence sleep-disordered breathing in infants with cleft palate: a feasibility study? [^302e513b]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

It is recognized that infant sleep position can affect SDB. Guidance on sleep positioning in the United Kingdom recommends back positioning (supine-lying) in infancy to reduce the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS;). However, it is not understood whether this standard sleep positioning advice should be followed by parents of infants with CP. Our survey of practitioners across the United Kingdom demonstrated variability in recommendations given by cleft lip and palate centers (some recommending supine and some side-lying sleep position) and an acknowledgment that further research is needed in this area to determine best practice. Those cleft centers advising side-lying did so based on clinical experience and perception of improved sleep quality in this position. As a result, there is a gap in evidence about the effectiveness of different sleep positions on SDB in infants with CP. Our feasibility study was undertaken to determine the design of a pragmatic study to investigate the effect of the 2 routinely advised sleep positions in infants with CP on oxygen saturations. This feasibility study included (1) Pilot home sleep monitoring — to assess the feasibility of home sleep monitoring (oxygen saturation and ETCO 2) and to enable sample size calculation for a full trial; (2) Sleep Questionnaire — to establish parents perspective of infant's sleep quality/breathing; and (3) Qualitative interviews with parents of infants with CP — to explore parents' observation of their infant's sleep, including their awareness of SDB, their experience in taking part in the feasibility study, and their feedback on future trial design (Davies et al. 2018).

### The midland and north of england stillbirth study (MiNESS) [^5206a8e3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The United Kingdom has one of the highest rates of stillbirth in Europe, resulting in approximately 4,000 stillbirths every year. Potentially modifiable risk factors for late stillbirths are maternal age, obesity and smoking, but the population attributable risk associated with these risk factors is small. Recently the Auckland Stillbirth Study reported that maternal sleep position was associated with late stillbirth. Women who did not sleep on their left side on the night before the death of the baby had double the risk compared with sleeping on other positions. The population attributable risk was 37%. This novel observation needs to be replicated or refuted.

Methods/Design

Case control study of late singleton stillbirths without congenital abnormality. Controls are women with an ongoing singleton pregnancy, who are randomly selected from participating maternity units booking list of pregnant women, they are allocated a gestation for interview based on the distribution of gestations of stillbirths from the previous 4 years for the unit. The number of controls selected is proportional to the number of stillbirths that occurred at the hospital over the previous 4 years.

Data Collection

Interviewer administered questionnaire and data extracted from medical records.

Sample Size

415 cases and 830 controls. This takes into account a 30% non-participation rate, and will detect an OR of 1.5 with a significance level of 0.05 and power of 80% for variables with a prevalence of 57%, such as non-left sleeping position.

Statistical Analysis

Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios and unconditional logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders.

Discussion

The hypotheses to be tested here are important, biologically plausible and amenable to a public health intervention. Although this case-control study cannot prove causation, there is a striking parallel with research relating to sudden infant death syndrome, where case-control studies identified prone sleeping position as a major modifiable risk factor. Subsequently mothers were advised to sleep babies prone ("Back to Sleep" campaign), which resulted in a dramatic drop in SIDS. This study will provide robust evidence to help determine whether such a public health intervention should be considered.

### Sleeping patterns of Swedish women experiencing a stillbirth between 2000-2014-an observational study [^173dc4c6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Settings and participants

The inclusion criteria were that the women must have given birth to a stillborn baby after gestational week 28 between 2000 and 2014 and had to be able to understand Swedish.

Data collection

The web-based questionnaire was developed from a previous web-based survey, an interview study and clinical experience. The questions about sleeping position were inspired by Stacey and co-workers. The questionnaire was validated face-to-face with a method similar to the "think aloud" method in a group of women who had experienced stillbirth. In the final version the questionnaire included a total of 87 questions with multiple-choice or open-ended response alternatives.

This study employed the women's responses to the questions: "What position did you usually take when you went to bed during the last 4 weeks of your pregnancy?", "What position did you usually take when you went to bed during the final week of your pregnancy?", "What position did you take when you went to bed the day before you learned that your baby had died?", "What position were you usually lying in when you woke up during the last 4 weeks of your pregnancy? "What position were you usually lying in when you woke up during the final week of your pregnancy?" and "In what position were you lying when you woke up on the morning of the day you found out that your baby had died?". Response alternatives were:" Usually on my left side","Usually on my right side", "About as often on one side as the other", "Usually on my back", "Usually on my stomach", "About as often on my stomach as on my back", "Was sitting up" and "I do not remember". The reply alternatives for the final night did not contain alternatives"About as often on one side as the other" and "About as often on both sides as on my stomach or back".

The web-based questionnaire was placed on the homepage of the Swedish National Infant Foundation and answers filed between 1 September 2011 and 31 December 2014, was used in the analysis. The foundation supports parents after perinatal loss and is a member organization of the International Stillbirth Alliance (ISA). The participants were self-recruited after being informed about the study through newspapers, Facebook, and newsletters within the organisation.

### Transition to a safe home sleep environment for the NICU patient [^4e0bdff7]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) — safe sleep and feeding management in NICU infants emphasizes supine sleep and avoidance of inclined sleeping. Therefore, supine positioning is the preferred safe sleep position for infants with GER or GERD, and GER is extremely common in infants in the NICU. Because of the increased risk of SUID, infants should not have the head of the bed elevated, nor should they be laid down on their side or prone. Term infants can be treated with small, frequent feeds; holding the infant upright after feeding; thickened feeds; elemental formula; and removal of the nasogastric or orogastric tube, when appropriate, and if the mother is providing human milk, elimination of all cow milk protein from her diet may be beneficial. Preterm infants can be treated as above, but care should be taken to avoid commercial thickeners because of the association with necrotizing enterocolitis. Safe sleep is paramount during maturation of the lower esophageal sphincter, and for inclined sleep products proposed changes include limiting the seat back angle for sleep to 10 degrees or less, with study data noting infants could more easily roll from supine to prone in an inclined sleeper, would fatigue faster once prone, and that prone positioning on an inclined sleeper places the infant at higher risk of airway obstruction or suffocation.

### Awareness of infant safe sleep messages and associated care practices: findings from an Australian cohort of families with young infants [^4b488a83]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Relationship between message awareness and practice implementation

When a correct response was recalled (unprompted), it was associated with the caregiver being significantly more likely to usually employ that practice (table 3). Similarly, families in the prompted question who correctly selected the six key messages were significantly more likely to use practices consistent with the key messages (table 4).

Table 3
Unprompted message awareness and practice implementation

Table 4
Prompted message awareness and practice implementation

Placing baby on their back on a firm, flat surface was correctly identified as the safest sleep position for a healthy baby by most caregivers (2823/3288, 86%), however, only 13% (414/3286) identified that supine sleep on a flat surface was safest for a baby with reflux, while a quarter (821/3286, 25%) were unsure or did not know. A considerable proportion incorrectly selected elevating baby's head (1955/3286, 60%) and/or placing baby prone or side lying (360/3286, 11%) as the recommended sleep position for a baby with reflux. Caregivers who incorrectly identified supine with head elevation as the recommended sleep position for healthy babies (279/3325, 8.4%) were significantly more likely to use pillows (p < 0.0001), rolled towels/blankets (p = 0.004) or positioning devices (eg, wedges) (p = 0.001), when compared with caregivers who selected supine on a firm, flat surface as the recommended sleep position.

### Evidence base for 2022 updated recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment to reduce the risk of sleep-related infant deaths [^90d6dc55]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) safe infant sleep — room sharing versus bed sharing: The AAP continues to recommend room sharing until at least 6 months of age. Bed sharing itself is associated with an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS); a meta-analysis of 11 studies showed a summary OR of 2.88 (95% CI, 1.99 to 4.18). Bed sharing in an adult bed not designed for infant safety exposes infants to additional risks for unintentional injury and death including suffocation, asphyxia, entrapment, falls, and strangulation, and infants younger than 4 months and those born preterm and/or with low birth weight are at highest risk. The presence of separate risk factors can lead to a marked increased risk beyond the baseline risk of bed sharing, and given the high rates of bed sharing these risk factors should be thoughtfully discussed with all parents of neonates and infants, not just those who indicate during health care visits that they are bed sharing.

### Sleep-related infant deaths: updated 2022 recommendations for reducing infant deaths in the sleep environment [^6472f5c0]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Bed sharing devices, couches/armchairs, and separate sleep surface guidance — There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of devices promoted to make bed sharing "safe," and at a minimum, to be considered a safe option, any of these devices should adhere to the June 2021 CPSC rule that any infant sleep product must meet existing federal safety standards for cribs, bassinets, play yards, and bedside sleepers; Return infants who are brought into the adult bed for feeding or comforting to their own crib or bassinet when the parent is ready to return to sleep; Couches and armchairs are extremely dangerous places for infants and should never be used for infant sleep, with sleeping on couches and armchairs placing infants at extraordinarily high risk (with 22- to 67-fold increased risk) for infant death; The safest place for a baby to sleep is on a separate sleep surface designed for infants close to the parents' bed, and infants sleeping in a separate room are 2.75 to 11.5 times more likely to die suddenly and unexpectedly than infants who are room sharing without bed sharing, with meta-analyses indicating the risk is almost 3 times higher when all bed-sharing or surface-sharing circumstances are included.

### Does sleep position influence sleep-disordered breathing in infants with cleft palate: a feasibility study? [^e2f459dd]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective:

Cleft palate (CP) can affect breathing, leading to sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Sleep position can affect SDB, but the optimum sleep position for infants with CP is unknown. We aimed to determine the design of a pragmatic study to investigate the effect of the 2 routinely advised sleep positions in infants with CP on oxygen saturations.

Design:

A multicentered observational cohort.

Setting:

Four UK-based cleft centers, 2 advising supine- and 2 side-lying sleep positions for infants with CP.

Participants:

Infants with isolated CP born July 1, 2015, and December 31, 2016. Of 48 eligible infants, 30 consented (17 side-lying; 13 supine).

Interventions:

Oxygen saturation (SpO 2) and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2) home monitoring at age 1 and 3 months. Qualitative interviews of parents.

Outcome Measures:

Willingness to participate, recruitment, retention, and acceptability/success (> 90 minutes recording) of SpO 2 and ETCO 2 monitoring.

Results:

SpO 2 recordings were obtained during 50 sleep sessions on 24 babies (13 side-lying) at 1 month (34 sessions > 90 minutes) and 50 sessions on 19 babies (10 side-lying) at 3 months (27 sessions > 90 minutes). The ETCO 2 monitoring was only achieved in 12 sessions at 1 month and 6 at 3 months; only 1 was > 90 minutes long. The ETCO 2 monitoring was reported by the majority as unacceptable. Parents consistently reported the topic of sleep position in CP to be of importance.

Conclusions:

This study has demonstrated that it is feasible to perform domiciliary oxygen saturation studies in a research setting and has suggested that there may be a difference in the effects of sleep position that requires further investigation. We propose a study with randomization is indicated, comparing side-lying with supine-lying sleep position, representing an important step toward better understanding of SDB in infants with CP.
