## Question

Magnesium citrate for constipation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about magnesium citrate for constipation, including its mechanism, dosing, efficacy, safety, special populations, and how it compares with alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanism and onset. Then, I should verify labeled dosing and formulations. Next, I will appraise the evidence base for efficacy in occasional versus chronic constipation. After that, I need to assess safety, contraindications, and monitoring. Finally, I will integrate guideline positions and provide a practical, patient-centered recommendation with caveats and alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism and onset. Magnesium citrate is a saline osmotic laxative that draws water into the intestinal lumen, softens stool, and accelerates transit; onset is typically 30 minutes to 6 hours, which aligns with its use for occasional constipation rather than chronic maintenance therapy [^0aa8acb8] [^a28be6a0] [^1ddb9164].

> Wait, let me verify the labeled dosing and formulations. The oral solution is the common OTC product, with adult dosing of 6.5 to 10 fluid ounces (about 195–300 mL) as a single dose or divided, not to exceed 10 fl oz in 24 hours; each fluid ounce contains approximately 290 mg elemental magnesium, so a 10 fl oz dose delivers about 2.9 g elemental magnesium, which is above the 350 mg/day supplemental upper limit and explains the brisk laxative effect [^0aa8acb8] [^a28be6a0] [^4ee705b8]. I initially thought there was a 1.745 g tablet dose, but hold on, I should double-check that; the 1.745 g figure appears in some FDA materials and likely reflects a different solid-dose product or historical labeling, so I should not conflate it with the standard oral solution dosing without corroboration, and I will prioritize the liquid solution labeling for practical guidance [^d2d601e7] [^3f104dff].

> Next, I should review the evidence for occasional constipation. High-quality RCTs specific to magnesium citrate for occasional constipation are sparse; much of the robust data exist for magnesium oxide in chronic idiopathic constipation, which is a different formulation and indication, so I need to be cautious about extrapolation. Still, magnesium salts are mechanistically coherent osmotics with rapid onset, and their use for short-term relief is consistent with guideline frameworks for occasional constipation that include magnesium-containing agents after first-line options [^1ddb9164] [^cee358b1].

> I will now examine the chronic constipation evidence, recognizing it is primarily for magnesium oxide rather than citrate. Two small Japanese RCTs of magnesium oxide 1.5 g/day for 4 weeks showed large, clinically meaningful improvements in complete spontaneous bowel movements, treatment response, stool consistency, and quality of life versus placebo, with low rates of diarrhea and no reported hypermagnesemia; however, the certainty of evidence is very low and the trials were short-term, so I should not overgeneralize to magnesium citrate or to long-term safety without reservation [^51548cf9] [^57436238]. A head-to-head RCT versus senna showed similar efficacy between magnesium oxide and senna, again supporting magnesium salts as effective options in CIC, albeit with modest-quality evidence [^58203747].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety. I need to check contraindications and monitoring. Magnesium is renally cleared, so magnesium-containing laxatives should be avoided or used with extreme caution in chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, or suspected renal insufficiency due to hypermagnesemia risk; they are also contraindicated in hypermagnesemia and should be used cautiously in heart failure or other conditions sensitive to electrolyte shifts [^55737963] [^a3caaa64] [^d3d246ed]. I should confirm that symptoms like persistent nausea, vomiting, or altered mental status warrant prompt evaluation for magnesium toxicity, especially in older adults or those with reduced GFR [^55737963] [^a3caaa64].

> Let me consider special populations. In pregnancy, occasional use of magnesium hydroxide is considered acceptable if benefits outweigh risks and renal function is normal; while data are strongest for magnesium hydroxide, the class principle for magnesium salts applies, so short-term, occasional magnesium citrate use may be reasonable with caution, but fiber and docusate are generally preferred first-line in pregnancy and chronic magnesium laxative use should be avoided [^cdd3ea9c]. In pediatrics, magnesium hydroxide is a recognized option for functional constipation, but magnesium citrate is not standard maintenance therapy; if used acutely, weight-based dosing and hydration are essential, and chronic use should be avoided [^a1ff43bc]. In older adults, I should double-check that prolonged magnesium-based laxative use increases hypermagnesemia risk and should be minimized when possible [^b8dfc8b2].

> Next, I should review how guidelines position magnesium-containing agents. For occasional constipation, expert consensus suggests magnesium-containing compounds as reasonable options when first-line therapies like polyethylene glycol or stimulants fail or are not preferred, acknowledging limited direct magnesium citrate data and emphasizing short-term use [^cee358b1]. For chronic idiopathic constipation, AGA-ACG issues a conditional recommendation for magnesium oxide based on very low certainty evidence, with practice often using 500 mg to 1 g/day and explicit caution to avoid use in renal insufficiency; this supports the class but does not validate magnesium citrate specifically for CIC maintenance [^b036a21e] [^68de1add]. ASCRS recommends osmotic laxatives as first-line for chronic constipation, including magnesium salts, again reflecting class support rather than formulation-specific endorsement [^59ff4881].

> I need to ensure I weigh alternatives and comparative effectiveness. Polyethylene glycol has the most robust evidence base for chronic constipation and is generally preferred over lactulose; it is nonabsorbed, safe across populations including older adults, and effective long term, which is why it is often first-line when maintenance therapy is needed [^a0b434b6] [^86a0f995]. For occasional constipation, PEG can be used in smaller, as-needed doses and is less likely to cause cramping than stimulants, though magnesium citrate's rapid onset can be advantageous when a quick effect is desired and renal function is intact [^a0b434b6] [^0aa8acb8].

> But wait, what if the patient is using GLP-1 therapy or has opioid-induced constipation. I should confirm that magnesium-based laxatives are acceptable adjuncts in both scenarios. Joint guidance for GLP-1–associated constipation includes magnesium citrate among options when dietary measures are insufficient, and opioid-induced constipation guidance lists magnesium citrate as an osmotic option alongside PEG and others, with the caveat to monitor for electrolyte disturbances in vulnerable patients [^4aea576a] [^7539a569].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. For occasional constipation in adults with normal renal function, magnesium citrate solution 6.5–10 fl oz as a single dose with adequate fluids is reasonable when a rapid effect is desired, with a maximum of 10 fl oz in 24 hours and avoidance of repeated dosing without medical supervision. I should counsel on expected onset within 30 minutes to 6 hours and advise stopping if there is no bowel movement or if red flags occur [^0aa8acb8] [^a28be6a0]. For chronic constipation, I should avoid magnesium citrate for maintenance and instead consider magnesium oxide 500 mg to 1.5 g/day if chosen, with close attention to renal function, dose titration, and periodic reassessment; PEG remains the preferred first-line osmotic for most patients [^b036a21e] [^68de1add] [^a0b434b6].

> I should double-check key safety counseling points. Patients with kidney disease, heart failure, or on magnesium-restricted diets should avoid magnesium citrate. Concurrent medications should be separated by at least 2 hours to avoid altered absorption. And persistent constipation beyond 1 week or the presence of red flags warrants medical evaluation rather than repeated laxative use [^0aa8acb8] [^a28be6a0] [^ded41e4b].

> In summary, magnesium citrate is a fast-acting osmotic saline laxative suitable for short-term relief of occasional constipation in adults with normal renal function, with typical dosing of 6.5–10 fl oz orally, onset within 30 minutes to 6 hours, and a favorable safety profile when used intermittently. It is not the preferred agent for chronic constipation management, where PEG or magnesium oxide have stronger evidence, and it should be avoided in renal impairment or when hypermagnesemia is a concern [^0aa8acb8] [^a0b434b6] [^b036a21e] [^55737963].

Magnesium citrate is an **osmotic laxative** [^1ddb9164] that draws water into the colon, softens stool, and increases stool frequency, with onset typically within 30 minutes to 6 hours [^0aa8acb8]. It is **effective for occasional constipation** [^1ddb9164] and is available over the counter in liquid form, with adult dosing of 6.5–10 fl oz (195–300 mL) as a single dose or divided doses, not exceeding 10 fl oz in 24 hours [^0aa8acb8] [^a28be6a0]. Common side effects include diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and bloating; use is contraindicated in renal impairment, heart failure, or magnesium-restricted diets due to hypermagnesemia risk [^55737963] [^a3caaa64]. It is not recommended for chronic constipation or in older adults because of electrolyte risks; PEG is preferred for long-term management [^b8dfc8b2] [^a0b434b6].

---

## Mechanism of action

Magnesium citrate acts as an **osmotic laxative** [^1ddb9164] by drawing water into the intestinal lumen, increasing intraluminal volume, and stimulating peristalsis, which results in softer stools and more frequent bowel movements [^a0b434b6].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting efficacy

Evidence for magnesium citrate is **limited** compared with other osmotic agents such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) [^a0b434b6]. However, it is widely used and considered effective for occasional constipation due to its rapid onset and predictable effect [^0aa8acb8]. A systematic review of over-the-counter therapies for chronic constipation found magnesium-based agents, including magnesium citrate, to be effective for short-term relief, although the evidence quality is moderate and largely extrapolated from studies of magnesium oxide and other magnesium salts [^1ddb9164].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

Magnesium citrate is available as an **oral solution** [^0aa8acb8]. The recommended adult dose for constipation is 6.5–10 fluid ounces (195–300 mL) as a single dose or in divided doses, not to exceed 10 fluid ounces in 24 hours [^0aa8acb8] [^a28be6a0]. It should be taken with a full glass of water to enhance efficacy and reduce the risk of dehydration [^0aa8acb8].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Magnesium citrate is **generally safe** when used as directed for occasional constipation. Common adverse effects include:

- Diarrhea
- Abdominal cramping
- Bloating
- Nausea

These effects are typically mild and self-limited, resolving with discontinuation or dose reduction [^1ddb9164].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Magnesium citrate is **contraindicated or requires caution** in the following conditions:

- **Renal impairment**: Magnesium is renally excreted; impaired renal function increases the risk of hypermagnesemia [^55737963] [^a3caaa64].
- **Heart failure**: Magnesium-containing laxatives can exacerbate electrolyte disturbances in patients with heart failure [^d3d246ed].
- **Magnesium-restricted diets**: Patients with conditions requiring magnesium restriction should avoid magnesium citrate [^0aa8acb8].
- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Use only under medical supervision due to limited safety data [^0aa8acb8].

## Comparison with other laxatives

| **Laxative type** | **Examples** | **Efficacy** | **Safety considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Osmotic laxatives | - Magnesium citrate <br/> - Magnesium oxide <br/> - Polyethylene glycol (PEG) | - Effective for occasional constipation <br/> - Rapid onset (30 minutes–6 hours) | - Risk of hypermagnesemia in renal impairment <br/> - Diarrhea and cramping common [^1ddb9164] |
| Stimulant laxatives | - Senna <br/> - Bisacodyl | - Effective for short-term use <br/> - Rapid onset (6–12 hours) | - Cramping <br/> - Electrolyte disturbances <br/> - Dependence with chronic use [^1498db12] |
| Bulk-forming laxatives | - Psyllium <br/> - Methylcellulose | - Effective for mild constipation <br/> - Slow onset (12–72 hours) | - Bloating <br/> - Gas <br/> - Rarely obstruction if not taken with adequate fluids [^notfound] |

---

PEG is **preferred for chronic constipation** due to its favorable safety profile and sustained efficacy, whereas magnesium citrate is better suited for occasional use [^a0b434b6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the following regarding magnesium citrate:

- **Occasional constipation**: Magnesium citrate is an acceptable short-term option for occasional constipation [^cee358b1].
- **Chronic constipation**: Not recommended for chronic constipation due to potential electrolyte disturbances and lack of long-term safety data [^b8dfc8b2].
- **Renal impairment**: Contraindicated in patients with renal impairment or heart failure due to hypermagnesemia risk [^55737963] [^a3caaa64].

---

## Patient counseling points

Patients using magnesium citrate should be counseled on the following:

- **Hydration**: Drink a full glass of water with each dose to prevent dehydration [^0aa8acb8].
- **Onset**: Expect bowel movement within 30 minutes to 6 hours [^0aa8acb8].
- **Adverse effects**: Diarrhea, cramping, and bloating are common but usually mild [^1ddb9164].
- **Contraindications**: Avoid use in renal impairment, heart failure, or magnesium-restricted diets [^55737963] [^a3caaa64].
- **Duration**: Do not use for more than one week without medical supervision [^0aa8acb8].

---

Magnesium citrate is a **fast-acting osmotic laxative** effective for occasional constipation, with onset in 30 minutes to 6 hours [^0aa8acb8]. It is not recommended for chronic constipation or in patients with renal impairment or heart failure due to hypermagnesemia risk [^b8dfc8b2] [^55737963]. PEG is preferred for chronic constipation management because of its superior safety and efficacy profile [^a0b434b6].

Magnesium-containing agents

Magnesium-based compounds are laxatives that act by retaining water in the intestinal lumen, resulting in bulking and softening of stool. Magnesium salts have historically been classified as osmotic, saline, or mixed osmotic-saline laxatives with categorization dependent on the magnesium compound used. Although magnesium citrate is a stronger formulation with more characteristically osmotic properties, other agents including magnesium hydroxide, magnesium gluconate, and magnesium oxide or magnesium enriched water act as more gentle saline laxatives. Given the breadth of new studies evaluating different magnesium-based formulations, these results have been categorized and addressed separately from the other osmotic agents. This review identified 4 new relevant studies using magnesium-based regimens, 3 evaluating magnesium-rich water vs placebo (Table 4) with methodological scores of 5 (n = 2) and 4 (n = 1) and one evaluating magnesium oxide versus placebo or senna. The amount of elemental magnesium consumed in the 3 magnesium water studies varied from 105 mg/d (1,000 mL/d of water containing 105 mg/L Mg), 60 or 119 mg/d (500 or 1,000 mL/d of water containing 119 mg/L Mg) to 500 mg/d (500 mL/d of water containing 1,000 mg/L of Mg). None of the trials demonstrated a statistically significant difference versus placebo for their primary endpoints (based on stool frequency per week or ROME II–based response), although various secondary endpoints, including stool frequency at alternative time points and stool consistency, were significantly improved. Magnesium-containing mineral water preparations were well tolerated with low rates of adverse events (diarrhea and abdominal distention). In the magnesium oxide study, subjects were administered a total of 1.5 g in 3 divided doses and reported significant overall improvements in constipation, SBMs, CSBMs, and QoL when compared with placebo but no differences compared with senna. Although not explicitly stated, abdominal pain and diarrhea were adverse events, necessitating a dose reduction in 53.3% of subjects. None of the studies reported hypermagnesemia as a potential adverse event.

### Constipation in adults [^d398e7ef]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although there are defined criteria for the diagnosis of constipation, in practice, diagnostic criteria are less rigid, and in part depend on the perception of normal bowel habit. Constipation is highly prevalent, with approximately 12 million general practitioner prescriptions for laxatives in England in 2001.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of non-drug interventions, and of other interventions, in adults with idiopathic chronic constipation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2006 (BMJ Clinical evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 42 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: arachis oil, biofeedback, bisacodyl, cascara, docusate, exercise, glycerine suppositories, glycerol, high-fibre diet, increasing fluids, ispaghula husk, lactitol, lactulose, macrogols (polyethylene glycols), magnesium salts, methylcellulose, paraffin, phosphate enemas, seed oils, senna, sodium citrate enemas, sterculia.

### American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: pharmacological management of chronic idiopathic constipation [^b036a21e]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults — osmotic laxatives (polyethylene glycol and magnesium oxide): Recommendation 2 states that in adults with CIC, the panel recommends the use of PEG compared with management without PEG. Implementation considerations include that a trial of fiber supplement can be considered for mild constipation before PEG use or in combination with PEG, response to PEG has been shown to be durable over 6 mo, and side effects include abdominal distension, loose stool, flatulence, and nausea. Recommendation 3 states that in adults with CIC, the panel suggests the use of magnesium oxide over management without magnesium oxide; the trials were conducted for 4 wk, although longer term use is probably appropriate; the panel suggests starting at a lower dose, which may be increased if necessary; and clinicians should avoid use in patients with renal insufficiency due to risk of hypermagnesemia.

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: a joint advisory from the American college of lifestyle medicine, the American society for nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the obesity society [^4aea576a]. Obesity Pillars (2025). High credibility.

GLP-1 therapy gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects management: Nausea is the most common GI side effect at onset and with dose escalation, and individuals can be counseled toward small frequent meals, with adjuncts such as ginger or peppermint tea, acupressure bands, and anti-nausea medications providing relief while adjusting to higher doses, while alcohol use may worsen nausea and gastroesophageal reflux with GLP-1 therapy and should be minimized; constipation should be managed proactively with fluids and fiber, and if dietary strategies are insufficient, daily magnesium supplementation, magnesium citrate, fiber supplements or capsules, Polyethylene Glycol 3350, and stool softeners are described as options to support regular bowel movements; diarrhea is less common than nausea or constipation and more likely with tirzepatide, for which avoidance of large or high-fat meals and the use of fiber capsules or powders can be helpful.

### Constipation in people prescribed opioids [^7414f2bf]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Constipation is reported in 52% of people with advanced malignancy. This figure rises to 87% in people who are terminally ill and taking opioids. Constipation may be the most common adverse effect of opioids. There is no reason to believe that people with chronic non-malignant disease who take opioids will be any less troubled by this adverse effect.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of: oral laxatives, rectally applied medications, and opioid antagonists for constipation in people prescribed opioids? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 23 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: arachis oil enemas, bisacodyl, co-danthrusate/co-danthramer, docusate, glycerol suppositories, ispaghula husk, lactulose, liquid paraffin, macrogols plus electrolyte solutions, magnesium salts, methylcellulose, opioid antagonists, phosphate enemas, senna, sodium citrate micro-enema, and sodium picosulfate.

### Perceptions, definitions, and therapeutic interventions for occasional constipation: a Rome working group consensus document [^cee358b1]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Functional constipation is the most common of the disorders of gut-brain interaction, affecting approximately 12% of the world population. Although classically considered a chronic condition, many individuals experience shorter yet repetitive bouts of constipation representing a different clinical entity. There has been increased interest in this latter disorder, which has recently been classified as occasional constipation. This Rome Foundation working group document reflects the consensus of an international team of specialists who summarized currently available research to provide a working definition of and treatment algorithm for occasional constipation. The recommendations herein are based on current evidence, accounting for gaps in the literature as well as international variance in definitions and health seeking behaviors for constipation.

Methods

The committee members reviewed the scientific literature, focusing specifically on occasional constipation, with the understanding that as a new entity, a paucity of data would be available. We used Rome IV research and clinical definitions to establish the framework for our definition of occasional constipation. Where possible, treatment recommendations were determined on the basis of the earliest extractable data from functional constipation studies, focusing on positive results within the first 2 weeks of treatment. We used the Delphi method to create consensus with 100% agreement between the authors.

Results

An evidence-based review of the literature resulted in the definition of occasional constipation as follows: "individuals who experience the presence of at least 1 functional constipation symptom, in the absence of alarm signs or symptoms, occurring at irregular and infrequent intervals, which is bothersome enough to induce a patient to seek medical management". Medical management whether seeking medical care or self-treatment was left to the individual's discretion, and we did not include time anchors because these thresholds require further investigation. Polyethylene glycol and stimulant laxatives are recommended as first-line interventions, whereas magnesium-containing compounds are suggested in individuals failing to respond to these therapies. There are insufficient data to make recommendations for using fiber or stool softeners. Prescription laxatives should be reserved for individuals with chronic constipation.

Conclusions

Occasional constipation is a unique clinical entity characterized by infrequent but recurrent symptoms. Data are limited because consensus definitions have been lacking. Establishing a standardized definition and therapeutic recommendations provides a framework for future studies focusing on epidemiologic and symptoms-based outcomes. Further studies are needed to confirm and refine these recommendations.

4 Food Supplements

Recommendation statements were generated for magnesium oxide supplements, senna supplements, and kiwifruit supplements. No statements were generated for any vitamin supplements due to a lack of evidence.

4.1 Magnesium Oxide Supplements

Statements on magnesium oxide supplements were derived from the evidence generated in a systematic review and meta‐analysis of two RCTs that included 94 people with chronic constipation and investigated the effect of 1.5 g/day of magnesium oxide supplements for 4 weeks.

Two RCTs, including 94 people with chronic constipation, investigated the effect of magnesium oxide supplements in symptomatic response to treatment measured as a binary outcome. Overall, magnesium oxide supplements increased the likelihood of a beneficial response to treatment by 232% compared to control (RR 3.32, 95% CI 1.59, 6.92).

Two RCTs, including 93 people with chronic constipation, investigated the effect of magnesium oxide supplements on stool frequency and consistency compared to control. Overall, magnesium oxide supplements significantly increased stool frequency by 3.7 complete spontaneous bowel movements/week compared to control (95% CI 1.41, 6.03). Magnesium oxide supplements also significantly softened stool consistency as evidenced by a 1.14 point (95% CI 0.42, 1.79) increase in the Bristol Stool Form Scale. The magnitude of these effect sizes is large and clinically meaningful.

Two RCTs, including 93 people with chronic constipation, investigated the effect of magnesium oxide supplements on global symptoms of constipation using the Constipation Scoring System questionnaire, which provides scores ranging from 0 to 30 (higher score, worse symptoms). Overall, magnesium oxide supplements significantly reduced global symptoms of constipation by −3.2 points, compared to control (95% CI 1.8, 4.7 points).

Two RCTs, including 93 people with chronic constipation, investigated the effect of magnesium oxide supplements on the severity of straining and a sense of incomplete evacuation using a 5‐point scale (higher score, worse symptoms). Overall, magnesium oxide supplements significantly reduced the severity of both straining (MD −1.1, 95% CI −1.6, −0.5) and a sense of incomplete evacuation (MD −0.9, 95% CI −1.2, −0.6), compared to the control.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the medical management of opioid-induced constipation [^7539a569]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) — agent classes and mechanisms of action are outlined as follows: osmotic laxatives (PEG, lactulose, magnesium citrate, magnesium hydroxide) draw water into intestine to hydrate and soften stool; stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, senna) irritate sensory nerve endings to stimulate colonic motility and reduce colonic water absorption; detergent/surfactant stool softeners (docusate) allow water and lipids to penetrate the stool to hydrate and soften fecal material; lubricants (mineral oil) lubricate the lining of the gut to facilitate defecation; peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs; naldemedine, naloxegol, methylnaltrexone) block μ-opioid receptors in the gut, thereby effectively restoring the function of the enteric nervous system; intestinal secretagogues (lubiprostone) act on chloride channels or guanylate cyclase receptors in enterocytes to stimulate fluid secretion into the intestinal lumen; and selective 5-HT agonists (prucalopride) activate 5-HT4 receptor, leading to increased colonic motility and accelerated transit.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and management of chronic constipation [^59ff4881]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Chronic constipation — osmotic and stimulant laxatives: Osmotic laxatives are an appropriate firstline medical therapy to manage chronic constipation. Stimulant laxatives, such as bisacodyl, can be considered for rescue therapy or as a second-line therapy, if needed. Strength of recommendation: strong based on moderate-quality evidence. Osmotic agents used in the treatment of constipation include polyethylene glycol (PEG)–based solutions and magnesium salt–based products, and osmotic laxatives are generally preferred over stimulants, such as senna or bisacodyl, given the short-term and long-term efficacy and safety with PEG-based treatment. Evidence includes a meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing superiority of PEG versus lactulose for improving stool frequency and consistency, relieving abdominal pain, and reducing use of other laxatives; magnesium salt laxatives such as magnesium sulfate have been shown to improve stool frequency and consistency compared with placebo with safety profiles comparable to PEG solutions. For stimulants, a meta-analysis demonstrated superior efficacy for sodium picosulfate and bisacodyl at 4 weeks compared to prescription motility agents and secretagogues, with abdominal pain as the most frequent side effect, and there is a lack of RCTs documenting the safety and efficacy of anthraquinone stimulant laxatives, including senna, cascara, and aloe, in treating chronic constipation.

7 Discussion

These are the first evidence‐based guidelines for the dietary management of chronic constipation. Overall, 59 evidence‐based recommendation statements were produced and graded for their level of evidence and strength of recommendation. A clinician‐friendly guide was also developed based on the recommendation statements to provide a practical tool that facilitates the adoption of the guidelines in clinical practice. In addition to the evidence‐based recommendation statements, 12 research recommendations were proposed to address unmet needs and gaps in the literature.

While previous medical guidelines for the management of constipation have included dietary recommendations, they almost exclusively focus on fiber quantity and/or type, omitting a variety of other effective dietary interventions that have been previously studied. For the first time, the current guidelines offer recommendations for various dietary interventions that have not been previously included in medical guidelines. For example, recommendations have been made for magnesium oxide supplements, kiwifruits, and high mineral‐content water, highlighting that these may improve cardinal symptoms of constipation.

To ensure these were strictly evidence‐based guidelines, recommendation statements were only produced for dietary strategies for which evidence from research studies exists, and recommendations for interventions for which evidence is lacking were not included. Previous medical guidelines have recommended patients to follow a high‐fiber diet. However, surprisingly, only one RCT was identified in our systematic review and meta‐analysis that assessed the effect of a high‐fiber diet (where fiber comes from a range of different foods/drinks across multiple food groups) in chronic constipation, and thus, no recommendations could be made for a high‐fiber diet. However, recommendation statements for several specific high‐fiber supplements and foods, for which evidence exists from multiple RCTs, have been made (e.g. psyllium supplements, kiwifruits, rye bread). Similarly, while senna supplements are widely recommended, they were found to be ineffective in constipation. While the individual RCTs separately showed a significant improvement in certain constipation outcomes, when they were meta‐analyzed together, there was no longer a significant impact, and a significant heterogeneity was detected between the trials, potentially contributing to the loss of the initially observed effect. As a result, the recommendation statements highlight that senna supplements have no impact on the assessed constipation outcomes.

### Laxatives for the management of constipation in people receiving palliative care [^82d5d784]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This article describes the second update of a Cochrane review on the effectiveness of laxatives for the management of constipation in people receiving palliative care. Previous versions were published in 2006 and 2010 where we also evaluated trials of methylnaltrexone; these trials have been removed as they are included in another review in press. In these earlier versions, we drew no conclusions on individual effectiveness of different laxatives because of the limited number of evaluations. This is despite constipation being common in palliative care, generating considerable suffering due to the unpleasant physical symptoms and the availability of a wide range of laxatives with known differences in effect in other populations.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and differential efficacy of laxatives used to manage constipation in people receiving palliative care.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science (SCI & CPCI-S) for trials to September 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating laxatives for constipation in people receiving palliative care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data. The appropriateness of combining data from the studies depended upon clinical and outcome measure homogeneity.

Main Results

We identified five studies involving the laxatives lactulose, senna, co-danthramer, misrakasneham, docusate and magnesium hydroxide with liquid paraffin. Overall, the study findings were at an unclear risk of bias. As all five studies compared different laxatives or combinations of laxatives, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis. There was no evidence on whether individual laxatives were more effective than others or caused fewer adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

This second update found that laxatives were of similar effectiveness but the evidence remains limited due to insufficient data from a few small RCTs. None of the studies evaluated polyethylene glycol or any intervention given rectally. There is a need for more trials to evaluate the effectiveness of laxatives in palliative care populations. Extrapolating findings on the effectiveness of laxatives evaluated in other populations should proceed with caution. This is because of the differences inherent in people receiving palliative care that may impact, in a likely negative way, on the effect of a laxative.

Clinicians should also consider individual co‐morbidities or dietary restrictions, as some interventions, such as high mineral‐content water or magnesium supplements, may be unsuitable for people with dietary restrictions (e.g. low magnesium or sodium diet). In addition, high mineral content water may contain high concentrations of sodium, and in those who already have high intake of sodium, it may contribute to intakes that exceed national recommendations for salt intake, with its associated impact on health.

The systematic reviews of the literature on the effect of diet on constipation revealed a major unmet needs and areas in which future research is warranted. As a result, the Guideline Steering Committee developed 12 research recommendations on supplements, foods, drinks, and whole diets for which high‐quality research is needed to improve the evidence base in constipation and, consequently, clinical care. It is noteworthy that most RCTs identified in the process of developing the guidelines studied supplements, a smaller number studied foods and drinks, and even fewer studied whole diets. A number of studies were industry‐funded, and it is possible that this may have driven research directions and, thus, increased the availability of research on specific dietary interventions. It is important moving forward that research studies use interventions and outcomes that are based on scientific and mechanistic relevance, as well as importance to patients.

Finally, it is worth noting that these guidelines were based on evidence from studies published by July 2023 and, therefore, newer studies published thereafter were not included in the development of these guidelines.

In conclusion, these BDA guidelines are the first‐ever dietary guidelines for the management of chronic constipation, providing recommendations on various dietary interventions and for several constipation‐related outcomes. A practical tool has also been developed to facilitate their adoption in clinical practice. Overall, specific fiber supplements (i.e. psyllium supplements), certain probiotic strains, magnesium oxide supplements, kiwifruits, rye bread, and high mineral water have all been shown to improve specific constipation outcomes. However, most of the findings originate from a low level of evidence, and further research is warranted to strengthen and improve clinical care.

### Laxatives for the management of constipation in palliative care patients [^780ecec6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Constipation is a common problem for palliative care patients which can generate considerable suffering for patients due to both the unpleasant physical symptoms and psychological preoccupations that can arise. There is uncertainty about the 'best' management of constipation in palliative care patients and variation in practice between palliative care settings.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of laxative administration for the management of constipation in palliative care patients, and the differential efficacy of the laxatives used to manage constipation.

Search Strategy

We searched The Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue four, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2005), EMBASE (1980 to January 2005), CANCERLIT, PUBMED, Science Citation Index, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, SIGLE, NTIS, DHSS-DATA, Dissertation Abstracts, Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings and NHS-NRR and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing laxatives for constipation in palliative care patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted patient-reported data measuring changes in stool frequency and ease of passing stools, using objective and validated scales. Tolerance or adverse effects of laxatives used were also sought. The appropriateness of synthesizing data from the controlled trials depended upon the clinical and statistical homogeneity of studies identified. If the controlled trials were homogeneous, a meta-analysis would be attempted.

Main Results

Four trials involving 280 people were included. Between these trials, the laxatives lactulose; senna; danthron combined with poloxamer (Co-danthramer); Misrakasneham; magnesium hydroxide combined with liquid paraffin (Milpar) were evaluated. All four trials included number and frequency of bowel movements and relative ease of defecation as part of the assessment of laxative efficacy. All of the laxatives demonstrated a limited level of efficacy, although a significant number of participants required rescue laxatives in each of the studies. The only significantly different treatments were in the trial where lactulose plus senna were more effective than danthron combined with poloxamer. Patient preference did not favour either treatment option. Other related systematic reviews have similarly identified that there is a lack of evidence to support the use of one laxative, or combination of laxatives, over another.

Authors' Conclusions

The treatment of constipation in palliative care is based on inadequate experimental evidence, such that there are insufficient RCT data. Recommendations for laxative use can be related to costs as much as to efficacy. There have been few comparative studies, equally there have been few direct comparisons between different classes of laxative and between different combinations of laxatives. There persists an uncertainty about the 'best' management of constipation in this group of patients.

### Management of constipation in older adults [^b8dfc8b2]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic constipation is common in adults older than 60 years, and symptoms occur in up to 50% of nursing home residents. Primary constipation is also referred to as functional constipation. Secondary constipation is associated with chronic disease processes, medication use, and psychosocial issues. Fecal impaction should be treated with mineral oil or warm water enemas. Most patients are initially treated with lifestyle modifications, such as scheduled toileting after meals, increased fluid intake, and increased dietary fiber intake. Additional fiber intake in the form of polycarbophil, methylcellulose, or psyllium may improve symptoms. Fiber intake should be slowly increased over several weeks to decrease adverse effects. The next step in the treatment of constipation is the use of an osmotic laxative, such as polyethylene glycol, followed by a stool softener, such as docusate sodium, and then stimulant laxatives. Long-term use of magnesium-based laxatives should be avoided because of potential toxicity. If symptoms do not improve, a trial of linaclotide or lubiprostone may be appropriate, or the patient may be referred for further diagnostic evaluation. Peripherally acting mu-opioid antagonists are effective for opioid-induced constipation but are expensive.

### Therapeutic uses of magnesium [^4e89ebcb]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Magnesium is an essential mineral for optimal metabolic function. Research has shown that the mineral content of magnesium in food sources is declining, and that magnesium depletion has been detected in persons with some chronic diseases. This has led to an increased awareness of proper magnesium intake and its potential therapeutic role in a number of medical conditions. Studies have shown the effectiveness of magnesium in eclampsia and preeclampsia, arrhythmia, severe asthma, and migraine. Other areas that have shown promising results include lowering the risk of metabolic syndrome, improving glucose and insulin metabolism, relieving symptoms of dysmenorrhea, and alleviating leg cramps in women who are pregnant. The use of magnesium for constipation and dyspepsia are accepted as standard care despite limited evidence. Although it is safe in selected patients at appropriate dosages, magnesium may cause adverse effects or death at high dosages. Because magnesium is excreted renally, it should be used with caution in patients with kidney disease. Food sources of magnesium include green leafy vegetables, nuts, legumes, and whole grains.

RESULTS

Studies

A total of 1,297 studies were identified from the Embase/PubMed literature searches. Of these, 110 were identified as randomized clinical trials evaluating treatments for constipation. Studies outside the selection criteria were excluded. In addition, we decided to limit the results to more readily available agents. Thus, some categories that were included in the search strategy (i.e. Chinese herbals, traditional medications, and probiotics) were not included in the results. Overall, a total of 40 studies were included in the analysis (Figure 1). In addition, a late-breaking study published after our literature search was added, bringing the total number of qualifying studies to 41.

ABSTRACT

Background

Current clinical guidelines for chronic constipation offer limited dietary recommendations. The aim of this project was to develop the first comprehensive evidence‐based dietary guidelines for the management of chronic constipation in adults.

Methods

Four systematic reviews and meta‐analyses were performed to identify eligible randomized controlled trials. The findings generated from the meta‐analyses were then used to develop guideline statements using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach and a Delphi consensus survey among a multidisciplinary expert Guideline Steering Committee. Recommendation statements were produced for treatment response, stool output, gut symptoms, adverse events, and quality of life, and only based on the findings where ≥ 2contributed to the meta‐analysis. The strength of recommendation was assessed using theapproach. Consensus voting among the Guideline Steering Committee was performed using a modified Delphi survey approach.

Results

The four systematic reviews included a total of 75. Fifty‐nine dietary recommendation statements were generated and accepted through the Delphi survey. For dietary supplements, 15 recommendation statements relate to fiber supplements, 20 relate to probiotics, two to synbiotics, five to magnesium oxide, two to senna, and three to kiwifruit supplements. For foods, three recommendation statements related to kiwifruits, two to prunes, and two to rye bread. For drinks, five recommendation statements related to high mineral‐containing water. No recommendations were made for whole diet approaches due to lack of evidence. Twelve statements had a very low level of evidence, 39 had a low level of evidence, and eight had moderate evidence. Twenty‐seven statements were strong recommendations, and 32 were qualified recommendations.

Conclusions

These are the first comprehensive evidence‐based dietary guidelines for the management of constipation based upon a robust systematic review andprocesses. Recommendations were made for dietary supplements, foods, and drinks that have never been previously included in clinical guidelines, and can now be rapidly implemented into clinical practice, thereby improving clinical care and patient outcomes.

### American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: pharmacological management of chronic idiopathic constipation [^ba202912]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is a common disorder associated with significant impairment in quality of life. This clinical practice guideline, jointly developed by the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology, aims to inform clinicians and patients by providing evidence-based practice recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of CIC in adults.

Methods

The American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that conducted systematic reviews of the following agents: fiber, osmotic laxatives (polyethylene glycol, magnesium oxide, lactulose), stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, senna), secretagogues (lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide), and serotonin type 4 agonist (prucalopride). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to assess the certainty of evidence for each intervention. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop clinical recommendations based on the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations.

Results

The panel agreed on 10 recommendations for the pharmacological management of CIC in adults. Based on available evidence, the panel made strong recommendations for the use of polyethylene glycol, sodium picosulfate, linaclotide, plecanatide, and prucalopride for CIC in adults. Conditional recommendations were made for the use of fiber, lactulose, senna, magnesium oxide, and lubiprostone.

Discussion

This document provides a comprehensive outline of the various over-the-counter and prescription pharmacological agents available for the treatment of CIC. The guidelines are meant to provide a framework for approaching the management of CIC; clinical providers should engage in shared decision making based on patient preferences as well as medication cost and availability. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted to help guide future research opportunities and enhance the care of patients with chronic constipation.

### Calcium citrate versus calcium carbonate in the management of chronic hypoparathyroidism: a randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial [^c7bf0e97]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, we observed a significant reduction of urinary oxalate excretion in Ca‐Cit‐treated patients. The reduction of urinary oxalate might be related to the higher gastric solubility of Ca‐Cit that made available a greater amount of free calcium ions than CaCO 3. These free calcium cations, by forming calcium‐oxalate salts in the gastrointestinal tract, may have reduced oxalate intestinal absorption, thus reducing the concentration of oxalate absorbed and thus presented to the renal tubules. This noteworthy observation is relevant to the fact that urinary oxalate is one of the most important promoters of crystal growth, and the reduction in the excretion of this index might be important in reducing the risk of renal stone formation. Other factors, such as phosphorus, also may promote the nucleation of calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals. Nevertheless, in our study, serum and urinary phosphate levels did not differ between Ca‐Cit‐ and CaCO3‐treated patients.

Ca‐Cit was also associated with less constipation than CaCO 3. It is possible that the residual intestinal citrate forms complexes with magnesium to a greater extent than with CaCO 3. These magnesium complexes can have a laxative osmotic action that may explain our finding of an improvement of constipation in Ca‐Cit‐treated patients. An alternative explanation is that constipation was increased by CaCO 3 administration, whose dissolution, by forming CO 2, may be responsible for side effects such as flatulence, general gastrointestinal disorders, and notably, constipation.

However, this is not enough to improve overall QOL in these patients. SF‐36 and FACIT are validated but are not disease‐specific questionnaires, which may not be sensitive enough for QOL evaluation of HypoPT subjects. It is very likely that the high amount of calcium that is necessary to maintain normocalcemia in these patients completely abolished the possible advantages given by Ca‐Cit in other categories of patients who generally are prescribed lower doses of calcium. It is also possible that this short‐term study was not conducted long enough to see a difference in the QOL parameters.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacological therapies for functional constipation in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f6d2d112]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

There has been a substantial increase in studies on functional constipation in children as new therapies are deployed. We aimed to provide an up-to-date, methodologically robust systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of pharmacological therapies for functional constipation in children.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library from inception to Feb 5, 2025. We included randomised controlled trials that involved children aged 0 years to younger than 18 years with functional constipation treated with pharmacological interventions compared with placebo, no treatment, or other interventions and with at least a 2-week follow-up period. Studies were excluded if there was no definition of functional constipation, children with organic causes for constipation or previous bowel surgery were included, children with faecal incontinence without the presence of constipation were included, or the aim of treatment was faecal disimpaction rather than maintenance therapy. Pairs of authors independently extracted summary data from published reports and critiqued studies. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane tool. Meta-analyses estimated risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences, and 95% CIs. Certainty of evidence was established with GRADE. Our main outcomes were treatment success (as defined by study authors), defecation frequency, and withdrawals due to adverse events. This study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022368719).

Findings

Our search identified 4595 articles, of which 59 randomised controlled trials were included, representing 7045 participants with functional constipation. Interventions included polyethylene glycol (n = 36 studies), lactulose (n = 18), magnesium oxide or magnesium hydroxide (n = 7), picosulfate (n = 1), liquid paraffin (n = 4), prucalopride (n = 1), lubiprostone (n = 2), linaclotide (n = 3), plecanatide (n = 1), enemas (n = 2), and domperidone (n = 1). Meta-analyses for treatment success showed that polyethylene glycol was probably more effective than placebo (RR 1·74 [95% CI 1·25–2·41], moderate certainty of evidence) and may be more effective than lactulose (1·35 [1·11–1·64], low certainty of evidence). There might be no difference in treatment success for linaclotide compared with placebo (1·21 [0·69–2·13], low certainty of evidence), but linaclotide probably leads to higher defecation frequency per week (mean difference 1·10 [95% CI 0·40–1·80], moderate certainty of evidence). There is low to moderate certainty evidence that prucalopride is not more effective than placebo (RR 1·68 [95% CI 0·77 to 3·68]).

Interpretation

Polyethylene glycol is probably more effective than placebo and key comparator therapies and should be considered the standard of first-line care. Future studies should consider polyethylene glycol as an index therapy, and clearly describe methods, patient characteristics, and previous therapeutics.

Funding

None.

Initial treatment approach for constipation — after discontinuing medications that can cause constipation and performing blood and other tests as guided by clinical features, a therapeutic trial (ie, fiber supplementation and/or osmotic or stimulant laxatives) is recommended before anorectal testing (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). NTC and STC can be safely managed with long-term use of laxatives (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Effects of magnesium citrate, magnesium oxide, and magnesium sulfate supplementation on arterial stiffness: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial [^4ee705b8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal adverse events induced by magnesium supplements are frequently reported. Particularly, osmotic diarrhea is often a result of high dosages of magnesium from dietary supplements. Therefore, the European Food Safety Authority has set the upper level for magnesium supplements at 350 mg/d. Magnesium oxide is often used for the treatment of constipation because of its laxative properties. Magnesium sulfate, on the other hand, is often intravenously administered for treating and prevention of eclamptic seizures. As a consequence, trials using oral magnesium sulfate are scarce. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that assessed somatic and gastrointestinal symptom severity of various magnesium formulations. Both scores were derived from the PHQ‐15. In general, gastrointestinal complaints are frequently reported by RCTs that administered magnesium supplements; however, these adverse events are often derived from patients' diaries or nonvalidated questionnaires, without a formal quantification. In the current study, administering 450 mg/d of magnesium citrate yielded slightly more gastrointestinal complaints at 12 weeks compared with a placebo. However, this effect was not observed at the end of the trial. Furthermore, participants in the magnesium oxide group reported significantly fewer somatic and gastrointestinal complaints at 12 weeks and 24 weeks compared with participants in the magnesium citrate group. Our findings may indicate that magnesium oxide supplements are better tolerated than magnesium citrate supplements and are likely better tolerated than magnesium sulfate supplements. This is further substantiated by the fact that none of the participants from the magnesium oxide group discontinued the study treatment because of gastrointestinal complaints, whereas 2 (4.3%) participants from the magnesium citrate group and 2 (4.3%) participants from the magnesium sulfate group reported gastrointestinal complaints as the main reason for discontinuation.

### The use of senna with docusate for postoperative constipation after pelvic reconstructive surgery: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^dee328a1]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to compare time to first bowel movement (BM) after surgery in subjects randomized to placebo or senna with docusate.

Study Design

Ninety-six subjects completed a baseline 7-day bowel diary before and after surgery. After pelvic reconstructive surgery, the subjects were randomized to either placebo (n = 45) or senna (8.6 mg) with docusate (50 mg) (n = 48). Time to first BM and postoperative use of magnesium citrate were compared.

Results

There was a significant difference in the time to first BM in those receiving senna with docusate vs placebo (3.00 ± 1.50 vs 4.05 ± 1.50 days; P < .002). More subjects in the placebo group needed to use magnesium citrate to initiate a bowel movement (43.6% vs 7.0%; P < .001).

Conclusion

The use of senna with docusate decreases time to first BM in those undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery compared with placebo. Subjects using senna with docusate are also significantly less likely to use magnesium citrate.

### Laxatives or methylnaltrexone for the management of constipation in palliative care patients [^f37e5831]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Constipation is common in palliative care; it can generate considerable suffering due to the unpleasant physical symptoms. In the first Cochrane Review on effectiveness of laxatives for the management of constipation in palliative care patients, published in 2006, no conclusions could be drawn because of the limited number of evaluations. This article describes the first update of this review.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of laxatives or methylnaltrexone for the management of constipation in palliative care patients.

Search Strategy

We searched databases including MEDLINE and CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library) in 2005 and in the update to August 2010.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating laxatives for constipation in palliative care patients. In the update we also included RCTs on subcutaneous methylnaltrexone; an opioid-receptor antagonist that is now licensed for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in palliative care when response to usual laxative therapy is insufficient.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data. The appropriateness of combining data from the studies depended upon clinical and outcome measure homogeneity.

Main Results

We included seven studies involving 616 participants; all under-reported methodological features. In four studies the laxatives lactulose, senna, co-danthramer, misrakasneham, and magnesium hydroxide with liquid paraffin were evaluated. In three methylnaltrexone. In studies comparing the different laxatives evidence was inconclusive. Evidence on subcutaneous methylnaltrexone was clearer; in combined analysis (287 participants) methylnaltrexone, in comparison with a placebo, significantly induced laxation at 4 hours (odds ratio 6.95; 95% confidence interval 3.83 to 12.61). In combined analyses there was no difference in the proportion experiencing side effects, although participants on methylnaltrexone suffered more flatulence and dizziness. No evidence of opioid withdrawal was found. In one study severe adverse events, commonly abdominal pain, were reported that were possibly related to methylnaltrexone. A serious adverse event considered to be related to the methylnaltrexone also occurred; this involved a participant having severe diarrhoea, subsequent dehydration and cardiovascular collapse.

Authors' Conclusions

The 2010 update found evidence on laxatives for management of constipation remains limited due to insufficient RCTs. However, the conclusions of this update have changed since the original review publication in that it now includes evidence on methylnaltrexone. Here it found that subcutaneous methylnaltrexone is effective in inducing laxation in palliative care patients with opioid-induced constipation and where conventional laxatives have failed. However, the safety of this product is not fully evaluated. Large, rigorous, independent trials are needed.

### Bowel preparation before colonoscopy [^b727fff3]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Adjunctive measures — laxatives such as bisacodyl and/or magnesium citrate are administered in some regimens to reduce the volume of lavage solution required and hence volume-related symptoms, and when used as an adjunct to PEG-ELS, bisacodyl did allow for less volume of PEG-ELS required for adequate colonic cleansing; bisacodyl can cause abdominal cramping and has been associated with ischemic colitis, and when used as an adjunctive agent for bowel preparations, 5- and 10-mg doses are recommended, with the only FDA-approved regimen of low-volume 2-L PEG-ELS combined with bisacodyl discontinued by the manufacturer in 2013. Magnesium citrate as an adjunct to PEG-ELS allowed less PEG-ELS solution (2 L) to be used to achieve adequate cleansing, but because of the renal excretion of magnesium, magnesium citrate should be avoided in patients with renal insufficiency or renal failure; studies of full-volume (4 L) PEG-ELS compared with low-volume (2 L) SF-PEG-ELS combined with magnesium citrate or bisacodyl demonstrate equal efficacy of colonic cleansing, with improved overall patient tolerance.

### Effects of lubiprostone, an intestinal secretagogue, on electrolyte homeostasis in chronic idiopathic and opioid-induced constipation [^f5787ee7]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic constipation has a worldwide prevalence of ~14% and is the most common gastrointestinal adverse event (AE) reported by opioid users. Common treatments include dietary changes, fiber, and conventional laxatives. Laxatives improve gastrointestinal transit by inducing an influx of water to the intestinal lumen. However, the promotion of intestinal fluid secretion by osmotic saline laxatives such as magnesium hydroxide, sodium phosphates, and magnesium citrate may alter electrolyte homeostasis and induce serum electrolyte imbalance in patients with renal insufficiency or cardiac dysfunction.

Management of chronic constipation has advanced in recent years because of the emergence of multiple novel agents, such as guanylate cyclase C receptor activators, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 (5-HT4) receptor agonists, and chloride channel activators. Lubiprostone is a type-2 chloride channel (ClC-2) activator approved in the United States for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults, opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adults with chronic noncancer pain, and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) in women aged 18 years old and above. In contrast to osmotic laxatives, lubiprostone increases intestinal fluid in a physiological manner by first inducing chloride secretion from intestinal epithelial cells, followed by passive paracellular sodium secretion leading ultimately to water influx to the intestinal lumen. Although individual clinical trials of lubiprostone showed no effects on serum electrolytes, it is possible that important but subtle shifts in electrolytes may not have been identified in these studies. Therefore, we designed this large post hoc, pooled analysis to evaluate the potential effect of this intestinal secretagogue on electrolyte homeostasis.

The objective of this pooled analysis was to assess the short-term and long-term effects, including any possible safety concerns, of lubiprostone 24 mcg twice daily (BID) on electrolyte homeostasis by examining the serum electrolyte levels, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine in patients participating in multiple dose-ranging controlled phase 3 and open-label trials in patients with CIC and OIC.

### Randomized controlled trial comparing efficacy and acceptability of split-and standard-dose sodium picosulfate plus magnesium citrate for bowel cleansing prior to colonoscopy [^6fdeca43]. Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aim

Sodium picosulfate plus magnesium citrate (PMC) is a very effective, safe, and tolerated low-volume preparation for colon cleansing. This study evaluates whether split dosing is associated with a further increase in efficacy and acceptability compared with the standard dosing regimen.

Patients and Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, single-blind study. Adult outpatients undergoing colonoscopy received PMC either in the standard dosing (two sachets taken the day before endoscopy) or in split dosing (the second sachet taken on the morning of colonoscopy). Bowel cleansing was assessed using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) and was rated as adequate when BBPS was ≥ 2 in each segment. Patient acceptance, satisfaction, and related symptoms were recorded.

Results

A total of 862 patients were included in the study (577 in the standard group and 285 in the split-dose group). Preparation was adequate in only 69.8% of patients in the standard group compared with 85.8% of those in the split-dose group (P = 0.0001). Mean BBPS scores for the whole colon and the right colon were also statistically significantly higher in the split-dose group (P = 0.0001). Both regimens were well tolerated, and only 8.0% of patients reported discomfort. Compliance was better with the split regimen (0.7% vs. 7.1% unable to take 75% of the preparation; P < 0.0001), and willingness to repeat the preparation was similar. Performing colonoscopy within 6 hours after preparation was associated with better colon cleansing. Other predictors of poor cleansing at multivariate analysis were constipation, obesity, and discomfort during preparation.

Conclusions

The split-dose regimen of PMC was superior to the standard regimen in terms of effective colon cleansing and compliance. ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT01909219).

### Efficacy and safety of over-the-counter therapies for chronic constipation: an updated systematic review [^a0b434b6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Osmotic agents

Osmotic agents draw fluid into the intestine, soften stool, and increase luminal water retention, and the ensuing luminal distention secondarily increases colonic peristalsis and causes laxation. PEG is an osmotic agent that is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for the treatment of occasional constipation. It is poorly absorbed (< 0.28%), and nearly 100% of PEG is excreted in the feces. No other osmotic agents meeting current inclusion criteria were identified (magnesium-based laxatives are discussed separately).

Nine PEG studies satisfied the selection criteria in this updated analysis (Table 2), with methodological scores of 5 (n = 3), 4 (n = 1), 3 (n = 3), and 2 (n = 2). Three were placebo controlled, one compared PEG with PEG plus electrolytes, and 6 compared PEG with another active product. Two studies compared PEG with lactulose, whereas single studies compared PEG with tegaserod, prucalopride, and naloxegol. The 3 placebo-controlled trials were well designed, included large numbers of patients, and had appropriate clinically relevant endpoints. In these studies, PEG formulations demonstrated significantly greater responses versus placebo on primary (mainly ROME-based response criteria) and secondary endpoints following both short- (4 weeks) and long-term administration (6 months). PEG preparations also demonstrated significantly greater efficacy across various endpoints compared with tegaserod, prucalopride, and lactulose in patients with ROME-defined constipation. In patients with opioid-induced constipation, patient preferences for PEG were equivalent to naloxegol. In a comparative trial, iso-osmotic and hypo-osmotic formulations of PEG demonstrated similar efficacy and safety, indicating that the addition of electrolytes to PEG formulations may not yield significant clinical advantages in the context of constipation.

Consistent with their lack of significant systemic absorption and low rates of metabolism, PEG formulations were well tolerated with low incidences of adverse events. Most events were GI and mild to moderate in intensity and included abdominal distension, diarrhea, loose stools, flatulence, and nausea.

Overall, the data support PEG as an effective treatment with minimal side effects. Response rates were superior to psyllium and prescription agents and similar to naloxegol for the treatment of chronic and opioid-induced constipation, respectively. These data confirm and support PEG as a first-line agent for the treatment of chronic constipation.

### Magnesium hydroxide [^cdd3ea9c]. FDA. Low credibility.

Regarding the use of magnesium hydroxide PO in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. When used occasionally at recommended doses, magnesium hydroxide laxatives and antacids appear to be safe and effective to use during pregnancy, provided the pregnant individual does not have concerns with renal dysfunction. The safest first-line occasional constipation treatments to use during pregnancy are those that are not absorbed systemically (e.g., fiber, bulk-forming laxatives, stool softeners). Osmotic laxatives like magnesium hydroxide may also be used for occasional constipation when needed.

### Comparison of the efficacy and tolerability of elobixibat plus sodium picosulfate with magnesium citrate and split-dose 2-L polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid for bowel preparation before outpatient colonoscopy: a study protocol for the multicentre, randomised, controlled E-PLUS trial [^29a05870]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

The standard formulation of PEG requires a large dose of solution with a distinctive, unpleasant flavour; therefore, many individuals are resistant to its use. In contrast, SP/MC requires a small internal dose and ensures fluid intake because it is administered in another beverage. Clinical trials have shown that SP/MC is superior to PEG in terms of acceptability. Therefore, if the cleaning speed and effectiveness of SP/MC are improved, and if physicians and patients feel that it is comparable to PEG, then it could become part of the mainstream bowel preparation method. This study aims to develop a new bowel preparation method including SP/MC and a combination of drugs that are expected to enhance the cleansing effect.

Recently, several drugs with completely different pharmacological actions have been developed to treat chronic constipation. Among them, elobixibat, which has pharmacological actions such as increasing the water content and transport capacity in the intestinal tract, is expected to enhance the cleansing effect when used in combination with existing bowel-cleansing agents.

### Senna versus magnesium oxide for the treatment of chronic constipation: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^58203747]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This is the first prospective, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a stimulant laxative compared with an osmotic agent for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation.

Methods

Patients were randomly administered stimulant laxative (senna, 1.0 g), osmotic agent (magnesium oxide [MgO], 1.5 g), or placebo for 28 consecutive days. The primary endpoint was overall symptom improvement. Secondary endpoints were spontaneous bowel movement (SBM), complete SBM, and patient assessment of constipation quality of life (QOL).

Results

Ninety patients (mean age, 42 years; 93% women; mean duration of symptoms, 9.9 years) were enrolled; all completed the study. The response rate for overall improvement was 11.7% in the placebo group, 69.2% in the senna group, and 68.3% in the MgO group (P < 0.0001). Change in SBM was significantly greater in the senna and MgO groups than that in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Similarly, change in complete SBM was significantly greater in the senna and MgO groups than that in the placebo group (P < 0.01). On the patient assessment of constipation QOL, significant improvements were seen in the senna and MgO groups compared with those in the placebo group (senna, P < 0.05; MgO, P < 0.001). The frequency of severe treatment-related adverse events was 0%.

Discussion

Senna and MgO significantly improved the frequency of bowel movements and QOL score and seem to be effective in the treatment of constipation.

### Efficacy and safety of a magnesium sulfate-rich natural mineral water for patients with functional constipation [^fed357e2]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Little is known about the effects of natural mineral water on constipation in adults. We assessed the effect of a magnesium sulfate-rich natural mineral water (Hépar; Nestlé Waters, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France) on gastrointestinal transit in constipated women.

Methods

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Hépar in outpatients with functional constipation (based on the Rome III criteria). The study included 244 female patients, age 18 to 60 years, identified by 62 general practitioners throughout France. After a washout period, subjects drank 1.5 L natural low-mineral water daily (control, n = 77), 0.5 L Hépar and 1 L natural low-mineral water daily (Hépar 0.5 group, n = 85), or 1 L Hépar and 0.5 L natural low-mineral water daily (Hépar 1 group, n = 82) for 4 weeks. We collected information on the number and types of stools, abdominal pain, rescue medications, adverse events, and volume of water consumed.

Results

We observed no significant effect at week 1. At week 2, constipation was reduced in 21.1% of patients in the control group, in 30.9% in the Hépar 0.5 group (P = 0.099 vs controls), and in 37.5% in the Hépar 1 group (P = 0.013 vs controls). The Hépar 1 group also had a decreased number of hard or lumpy stools (Bristol scale, P = 0.030 vs baseline) and a substantial decrease in the use of rescue medication (P = 0.034 vs controls). Patient responses correlated with magnesium sulfate concentrations. Safety was very good; there were no serious adverse events among patients who drank Hépar.

Conclusions

In a controlled trial, daily consumption of 1 L Hépar reduced constipation and hard or lumpy stools in a greater percentage of women with functional constipation than natural low-mineral water, as early as the second week of treatment.

### Association of laxatives use with incident dementia and modifying effect of genetic susceptibility: a population-based cohort study with propensity score matching [^070264f8]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Constipation is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders, and it is estimated that up to one third of people over 65 years are affected by constipation during their lifetime. Laxatives are the mainstay of constipation management and are commonly used by old people for both treatment and prevention of constipation. Laxatives may cause electrolyte and serum potassium imbalance that negatively affect the renal and cardiovascular systems and can be life threatening. Currently, laxatives being freely available without prescription in many countries, while evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of laxatives in older populations is lacking.

Constipation and dementia have similar epidemiological characteristics and are often comorbidities. Longitudinal or multicenter studies have shown that constipation was associated with incidence of dementia and cognitive decline. Laxatives may be used for both treatment and prevention of constipation. However, the evidence of whether laxatives use could reduce the risk of dementia through treating constipation was limited. Up to now, only one retrospective cohort study in Taiwan found that patients who used magnesium oxide, a saline laxative, had a decreased risk of developing dementia. Therefore, we hypothesis that the use of laxatives may reduce the risk of dementia through treating constipation. While there are a wide range of laxative types, such as bulk forming laxatives, softeners and emollients, stimulant laxatives, osmotic laxatives, prokinetic laxatives, and secretory laxatives. In fact, different types of laxatives may distinct in mechanisms and efficacy profiles. Effective laxatives are available to manage constipation and its subsequent comorbidities. Thus, choice of laxative for management of constipation to decrease the subsequent unhealth conditions in older people should be personalized. However, the association between the different types of laxatives and the risk of dementia through treating constipation remains unclear. Therefore, we hypotheses that different types of laxatives may play distinct role on the incidence of dementia risk through treating constipation.

### Optimizing adequacy of bowel cleansing for colonoscopy: recommendations from the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^b9709e05]. Gastroenterology (2014). Medium credibility.

Magnesium citrate — magnesium citrate was evaluated in 4 randomized clinical trials, including 2 trials combined with either PEG-ELS or NaP solution. Magnesium citrate (300 mL×3) was superior to NaP solution (45 mL×2), producing good or excellent quality cleansing in 94% and 97% of patients in the right and left colon, respectively (P < .001). A regimen of NaP followed by magnesium citrate was superior to a split-dose PEG-ELS preparation, resulting in a higher overall percentage of good or excellent cleansing (P = 0.017). In patients with chronic kidney disease, the use of magnesium-based preparations should be avoided because of possible magnesium toxicity, and a PEG-ELS–based regimen is preferred in such cases.

Qualitative assessment of study methodology

Next, each study was independently scored by both authors for quality of evidence using the US Preventive Services Task Force criteria. Any discrepancies between authors were reconciled by mutual discussion and a second review of all relevant articles. Final scores were adjudicated by consensus. Individual study quality was determined using a 0- to 5-point scale summating individual scores for randomization, blinding, and completeness of follow-up:
Randomization was scored as 1 (simply described as randomized) or 2 (appropriate randomization technique and concealed allocation explicitly described)
Blinding was scored as 0 (not blind), 1 (described as double blind but no details provided), or 2 (both subjects and investigators were explicitly said to be blinded, and an identical placebo was used)
Withdrawals were scored as 0 (no statement) or 1 (number of withdrawals and reason was stated)

Levels of evidence classification of products and grading of recommendations

Current US Preventive Services Task Force criteria were used to score the strength of evidence and grade recommendations. Once again, each investigator provided independent recommendations, and any differences were resolved by consensus. The level of evidence was graded as good (level I), fair (level II), or poor (level III). The recommendation was graded as A (good evidence in support), B (moderate evidence in support), C (poor evidence in support), D (moderate evidence against), or I (insufficient evidence). These criteria represent a slight modification of the grading criteria used in the previous systematic review. Detailed descriptions of the grading criteria and differences in the grading criteria between the previous review and the current review are summarized in Supplemental Table 1 (see Supplementary Digital Content 1).

After applying the selection criteria, we identified 41 studies that are included in this analysis. OTC products were grouped into the following 8 categories: osmotic laxatives, fiber laxatives, stimulant laxatives, magnesium-based laxatives, fruit-based laxative, foods with prebiotics, surfactants, and miscellaneous agents.

### The effect of food, vitamin, or mineral supplements on chronic constipation in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^7c16b3d7]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Over-the-counter supplements are commonly used to manage chronic constipation; however, their efficacy remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the effect of food, vitamin or mineral supplements on stool output, gut transit time, symptoms, and quality of life in adults with chronic constipation via a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

Studies were identified using electronic databases, backward citation, and hand-searching abstracts. RCTs reporting administration of food supplements (e.g., fruit extract supplements), vitamin or mineral supplements in adults with chronic constipation were included. Studies administering whole foods (e.g., fruits) were excluded. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed with Cochrane RoB 2.0. Relative risks (RR), mean differences (MD), or standardized mean differences (95% confidence intervals [CI]) were calculated using a random-effects model.

Key Results

Eight RCTs (787 participants) were included, investigating kiwifruit (n = 3 RCTs), senna (n = 2), magnesium oxide (n = 2), Ziziphus jujuba (n = 1), and Malva Sylvestris (n = 1) supplements. Kiwifruit supplements did not impact stool frequency (MD 0.24 bowel movements/week [-0.32, 0.80]; p = 0.40) or consistency (MD -0.11 Bristol points [-0.31, 0.09], p = 0.29). Overall, 61% responded to senna and 28% to control; however, this did not reach statistical significance (RR 2.78, [0.93, 8.27]; p = 0.07). Overall, 68% responded to magnesium oxide and 19% to control (RR 3.32 [1.59, 6.92]; p = 0.001). Magnesium oxide improved stool frequency (MD 3.72 bowel movements/week [1.41, 6.03]; p = 0.002) and consistency (MD 1.14 Bristol points [0.48, 1.79]; p = 0.0007).

Conclusions and Inferences

Magnesium oxide supplements are effective at improving cardinal symptoms of chronic constipation. Senna and kiwifruit supplements did not impact symptoms; however, findings were based on a small number of studies. Further research is required to investigate the effect of food supplements (e.g., kiwifruit supplements), as well as their whole food equivalents (e.g., whole kiwifruits) in chronic constipation.

### Effects of lubiprostone, an intestinal secretagogue, on electrolyte homeostasis in chronic idiopathic and opioid-induced constipation [^86e2f75f]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Chronic constipation is a life-long problem, and for many patients it requires long-term use of medication. Consequently, medications that are used to treat this disorder should demonstrate not only efficacy but also long-term safety. Efficacy and safety are particularly important for drugs such as osmotic laxatives or intestinal secretagogues that may affect or alter electrolyte homeostasis. Several studies have shown that dehydration and disturbances in salt and electrolytes are a concern when using osmotic saline laxatives such as magnesium hydroxide, sodium phosphates, and magnesium citrate in patients with CIC or OIC, especially those with cardiac dysfunction or renal insufficiency. In contrast to saline laxatives, lubiprostone specifically targets the intestinal chloride channel ClC-2 to induce ion flux across intestinal epithelium and subsequent water movement into the intestinal lumen. Electrolyte imbalance may also affect smooth muscle and nerve function, compromise bowel function and cause constipation.

Our pooled analysis of a large cohort of patients with CIC or OIC across 10 trials showed no evidence that administration of lubiprostone 24 mcg BID for up to 48 weeks caused electrolyte imbalance or altered markers of renal function compared with baseline or placebo. Also, to our knowledge, this is one of the largest pooled analyses of safety data for a drug that could potentially affect intestinal secretion of fluids and thereby alter electrolyte homeostasis.

The serum concentrations of sodium, chloride, and potassium did not change outside of normal laboratory values in both the short-term and long-term studies and in CIC and OIC patients. Mean changes from baseline in the levels of sodium, chloride, and potassium were no > 1.5, 0.6, and 0.11 mEq/L, respectively, in any of the studies. Similarly, changes in the markers of renal function were within the normal laboratory values. BUN and creatinine levels did not change from baseline by > 0.5 and 0.02 mg/dL, respectively, in any of the studies. These small shifts in electrolyte concentrations are well within the normal range and unlikely to have any meaningful clinical effects. Also, the data from long-term monitoring provide confidence that lubiprostone is safe and unlikely to cause clinically relevant electrolyte imbalances in patients.

METHODS

Literature search

PubMed and Embase were searched from 2004 through July 2020 using the following search terms: (constipation OR opioid-induced constipation) AND (laxatives, stimulant OR laxatives, osmotic OR laxatives, irritant OR laxatives, bulk OR fecal softeners OR stool softener OR sorbitol OR magnesium OR milk of magnesia OR magnesium sulfate OR magnesium sulphate OR bisacodyl OR calcium polycarbophil OR polyethylene glycol OR PEG OR senna OR ispaghula OR bran OR celandin OR docusate OR aloevera OR aloe vera OR poloxalkol OR mineral oil OR glycerin OR glycerine OR psyllium OR methylcellulose OR herbal remedies OR traditional medicine OR Chinese herbal OR plantain OR doxinate OR prune OR kiwi OR fiber OR iberogast OR STW 5 OR sodium picosulfate OR macrogol OR sennosides OR inulin). Limits on the search were English language, randomized clinical trial, adults, and human.

Selection criteria

Abstracts of articles were screened, potentially relevant studies published in full were reviewed, and the following selection criteria were applied for inclusion: (i) randomized controlled trial (placebo or active comparator), (ii) parallel or cross over design, (iii) established definition of constipation (preferably ROME criteria), (iv) minimum duration of 4 weeks of active treatment, and (v) well-defined clinical endpoints. Studies evaluating colonic cleansing before colonoscopy or surgery, acute constipation indications (typically 1–2 days or weeks in duration), and patients with irritable bowel syndrome and/or evacuation disorders were excluded. Certain studies in patients with chronic comorbidities (i.e. chronic kidney disease [CKD]) were included.

Data extraction and analysis

Articles that met inclusion criteria were independently reviewed by both authors, and relevant data were extracted. This included therapeutic and control agent(s), study design, number of patients, mean age or age range, sex, study duration, outcome measures, efficacy, and safety outcomes.

### Comparison of the efficacy and tolerability of elobixibat plus sodium picosulfate with magnesium citrate and split-dose 2-L polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid for bowel preparation before outpatient colonoscopy: a study protocol for the multicentre, randomised, controlled E-PLUS trial [^94ae7c76]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

In Japan, SP/MC has been administered as split doses for several years. However, the post-dose defaecation response of SP/MC is slower than that of PEG, and it is perceived as having a lesser cleansing effect; therefore, it is not currently used for major bowel cancer screening preparation. We believe that the good acceptability of SP/MC compared to that of PEG is worth noting. Therefore, a new regimen including elobixibat hydrate, which does not influence acceptability and safety, has been proposed. According to the current Western guidelines, the use of adjunctive agents for bowel cleansing is not recommended because of the lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness. Lubiprostone and elobixibat hydrate have been used as adjunctive agents for bowel preparation during randomised trials. However, those trials did not demonstrate robust effectiveness. Elobixibat is currently indicated by insurance as a treatment for chronic constipation, but not as a colonoscopy preparation agent. The results of a domestic clinical trial of chronic constipation showed that elobixibat produced spontaneous defaecation among 85.5% of patients; this rate was significantly higher than that of the placebo (41.3%). During the same study, the median time to onset of the first spontaneous bowel movement was 5.2 h, which was significantly shorter than that for placebo (25.5 h). These results suggest that elobixibat could be expected to have an immediate effect, and that it could be an effective pre-treatment adjunctive agent for those scheduled to undergo colonoscopy.

### Chronic constipation in the United States: results from a population-based survey assessing healthcare seeking and use of pharmacotherapy [^53f45851]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Regarding constipation treatments, nearly half of the respondents are currently taking a medicine to treat their symptoms, which falls within the range previously reported (14%–72%) (,–). However, because 93% of our overall cohort reported constipation symptoms in the past week, this suggests that there are numerous individuals who are symptomatic but not on treatment. There are many potential reasons for this finding. For example, some individuals, particularly those with intermittent constipation symptoms, may consider constipation a "nuisance" that does not require pharmacotherapy. In fact, 19% of our cohort reported that their constipation was not at all a severe health problem. In addition, some individuals may not be aware of all the effective OTC and prescription therapies available for managing constipation. The low use of medications could also be related to our finding that participants most often reported food and decreased water intake as the etiologies for their symptoms; many individuals may choose to engage solely in lifestyle changes rather than use pharmacotherapy. Further studies systematically assessing how and the degree to which individuals engage in lifestyle modifications for managing their constipation are needed.

Of those on pharmacotherapy, the majority are only taking OTC medicines (94%). Fiber supplements are the most commonly used product by a large margin, followed by magnesium and docusate. Previous studies have also shown that fiber is the most frequently used therapy, whereas others have differed. For example, Müller-Lissner et al. conducted a survey in 10 European countries and found that bisacodyl is the most commonly used therapy, followed by polyethylene glycol and senna. As for prescription therapies, very few respondents are taking these medicines (6%), with lactulose being the most common (3.3%), followed by linaclotide (1.2%), lubiprostone (1.2%), and plecanatide (0.8%). This is lower than the rates found in the BURDEN-CIC study by Harris et al. who reported that 16% of those with CIC are on prescription treatments. However, they included polyethylene glycol 3350 and senna in the prescription category along with lubiprostone and linaclotide (note: plecanatide was not available at the time of the study) and they did not comment on the prevalence for each medicine. To our knowledge, our study is the first in the United States to determine the use of each individual pharmacotherapy option for CIC and the first to include plecanatide.

Questionnaire for patients

Patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire that includes the following:

Presence and severity of the following subjective symptoms (assessed using a 5-point scale) before the colonoscopy: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and general fatigue.

The acceptability of the bowel preparation regimen will be determined using a 5-point scale:
Was the bowel preparation medication easy to use?
Were all bowel preparation medicines administered internally?
What is your general impression of the bowel preparation?
How did the bowel preparation medicine taste?
Did you have a bowel movement promptly after using the bowel preparation medication?
Did your stools become clear after using the bowel preparation medication?
Did you wake during the night to defecate?
Were you able to sleep the day before the examination?
Did you have to stop to use a toilet on the way to the examination facility?
Do you want to use the same bowel preparation medication for your next colonoscopy?

Presence and severity of subjective symptoms during colonoscopy (assessed using a 5-point scale): insertion pain, abdominal distension, nausea, and vomiting.

Presence and degree of subjective symptoms after colonoscopy (assessed using 5-point scale): abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting, constipation, diarrhoea, bloody stools, fever, and general malaise.

Sodium picosulfate + magnesium citrate — mechanism, comparative performance, contraindications, and safety: This regimen combines an osmotic laxative and stimulant; a meta-analysis of randomized trials found a trend toward superior bowel preparation quality with PEG-ELS versus sodium picosulfate + magnesium citrate (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.86–1.01; P = 0.07) with no difference in adenoma or polyp detection, while tolerability was higher for sodium picosulfate + magnesium citrate, and vomiting was observed more often with PEG-ELS with dizziness reported with a risk ratio of 0.62 (95% CI 0.38, 1.00). It is contraindicated in patients with congestive heart failure, hypermagnesemia, and severe renal impairment; in patients 65 years or older it was associated with higher hospitalization for hyponatremia (absolute risk increase: 0.05%, 95% CI: 0.04%–0.06%; RR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.5–3.9) but not with increased urgent head CT (RR: 1.1, 95% CI: 0.7–1.4) or death (RR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.7–1.3).

5.3 High Mineral‐Content Water

Statements on high mineral‐content water were derived from the evidence generated in a systematic review and meta‐analysis of four RCTs that included 755 people with chronic constipation and investigated the effect of high mineral‐content water, compared to low mineral‐content water.

Three RCTs (one of which had two test arms), including 539 people with chronic constipation, assessed the effect of high mineral‐content water on symptomatic response to treatment compared to low mineral water. Overall, high mineral‐content water increased the likelihood of a beneficial response to treatment by 47% compared to low mineral‐content water (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.20, 1.81). The doses provided daily were 0.5, 1, and 1.5 L per day for 2–6 weeks.

Four RCTs (one of which had two test arms), including 638 people with chronic constipation, assessed the effect of high mineral‐content water on stool frequency compared to low mineral‐content water. Overall, high mineral‐content water had no impact on stool frequency, compared to low mineral‐content water (MD +0.41 bowel movements/week, 95% CI −0.05, 0.88 bowel movements/week).

Two RCTs, including 302 people with chronic constipation, assessed the effect of high mineral water on global symptom scores compared to low mineral water. Overall, high mineral‐content water had no impact on global symptoms of constipation compared to low mineral‐content water (SMD −0.04, 95% CI −0.27, 0.18).

Three RCTs (one of which had two test arms), including 546 people with chronic constipation, assessed the effect of high mineral‐content water on the severity of abdominal pain compared to low mineral water. Overall, high mineral‐content water had no impact on severity of abdominal pain compared to low mineral water (SMD −0.17, 95% CI −0.42, 0.08).

Two RCTs (one of which had two test arms), including 320 people with chronic constipation, assessed the effect of high mineral‐content water on global quality of life compared to low mineral‐content water. Overall, high mineral‐content water had no impact on global quality of life compared to low mineral‐content water (SMD 0.13, 95% CI −0.10, 0.36).

### Comparison of the efficacy and tolerability of elobixibat plus sodium picosulfate with magnesium citrate and split-dose 2-L polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid for bowel preparation before outpatient colonoscopy: a study protocol for the multicentre, randomised, controlled E-PLUS trial [^f39b7ae7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

In Japan, a previous multicentre, randomised, controlled trial of elobixibat as a pre-treatment for colonoscopy demonstrated noninferior bowel cleanliness with the test method (PEG plus ascorbic acid plus elobixibat group: group A) and the standard method (PEG plus ascorbic acid plus picosulfate group: group B). Adequate bowel preparation rate as a primary endpoint was 95.0% vs 99.0% in group A and B, and noninferiority was proved. Furthermore, sleep disturbance was 10.2% and 22.7% (P = 0.02) in group A and B. Moreover, cost of two tablets of elobixibat is very low at 178.4 JPY (0.96 GBP). Therefore, 10 mg of elobixibat before breakfast on the day before the colonoscopy has been selected as the concomitant drug for the test regimen.

The main target population of this study will comprise those with the following indications for outpatient colonoscopy: 40–69 years of age; positive faecal occult blood test results; colorectal lesions requiring close examination; surveillance required after polypectomy; and bloody stools or abnormal bowel movements experienced by symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The exclusion criterion will be the distinct risk of inappropriate bowel preparation. To be eligible for study inclusion, the entire colon must be preserved so that the results will be widely transferable to clinical practice. Those who have undergone colorectal resection will be excluded. Abdominal and pelvic surgeries other than colorectal resection may have various effects on adhesions and intestinal peristalsis, and their impact on the assessment of the primary endpoint is unpredictable; therefore, patients who have undergone such surgeries will be excluded. Patients with conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic constipation will be excluded because of their impact on pre-treatment outcomes. Therefore, patients scheduled for a wait-list outpatient examination who can be adequately informed in advance, except those who fulfil the aforementioned exclusion criteria, will be included. Eligible patients will be aged at least 40 years, and they will remain the same age during the study period. Patients will not be older than 69 years because older individuals are generally at increased risk for adverse events attributable to bowel cleansing.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) in children and adolescents — supplement use to prevent episodes is conditionally suggested with specific agents and caveats. The guideline panel suggests using certain supplements (e.g., coenzyme Q10, riboflavin, magnesium) to prevent CVS episodes in children and adolescents (conditional recommendation, based on very low to moderate certainty in the evidence of effects). For coenzyme Q10, the panel suggests use with a time-limited trial and assessment of response and notes this is a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty; for riboflavin, the panel suggests use with moderate certainty; and for magnesium, the panel suggests use with low certainty. Vitamin D is suggested as an adjunct therapy in combination with treatments with very low certainty, while there is insufficient evidence to recommend L-carnitine. Remarks emphasize shared decision-making and cost-effectiveness for coenzyme Q10 with a time-limited trial (e.g., 3–6 months), suggest higher, twice daily dosing for riboflavin based on pediatric migraine studies, caution that certain forms of magnesium (e.g. Magnesium oxide, Magnesium citrate) are more likely to cause loose bowel movements compared to Magnesium glycinate, and note lack of efficacy for L-carnitine outside combination with coenzyme Q10 and concerns for atherosclerosis in animals.

### A randomised, double-blind study of polyethylene glycol 4000 and lactulose in the treatment of constipation in children [^671a4f7d]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

The choice of inclusion criteria in this study merits some comment. At the time the study protocol was being drawn up, the Rome III criteria for infants had not been published. We used a modification of the Rome II criteria for functional constipation in infants and preschool children (scybalous, pebble-like, hard stools for a majority of stools or firm stools two or less times/week, and no evidence of structural, endocrine, or metabolic disease present for at least two weeks). We modified the duration criterion to three months since we did not feel that treatment of very young children for one month with an experimental treatment could be justified if the constipation could be transient or self-resolving. A faecal incontinency criterion was added since this is frequently associated with functional constipation in children. However, in the event, no children were included on the basis of faecal incontinence alone. A longer minimum duration of symptoms and inclusion of a faecal incontinence criterion are present in the current Rome III criterion.

The superiority of PEG preparations over lactulose or other osmotic laxatives demonstrated in this and other studies and the limited tolerability of stimulant laxatives in children confer a favourable benefit-risk relationship on such preparations. This underlines the recommendations of current practice guidelines in which PEG preparations are identified as first-line treatment options. The NASPGHAN guidelines recommend use of mineral oil (a lubricant) or magnesium hydroxide, lactulose, sorbitol or PEG (osmotic laxatives), or a combination of lubricant and laxative, and state that PEG appears to be superior to other osmotic agents in palatability and acceptance by children. The guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) identify PEG/electrolyte solutions as the recommended first-line treatment. Effective treatment of children with constipation is important both to relieve discomfort and distress and to improve quality of life for patients and their parents. In addition, effective early management of constipation reduces the risk of persistence into adolescence and adulthood, thus reducing the overall burden and cost of disease from a public health perspective. For this reasons, the availability of effective and well-tolerated osmotic laxatives such as PEG 4000 have an important place in the management of chronic constipation in young children. A recent Cochrane review concluded that PEG preparations may be superior to placebo, lactulose and magnesium hydroxide for the management of childhood constipation, and was associated with a lower incidence of adverse events.

### Bidirectional endoscopic and pharmacological approach for the treatment of severe right-sided colonic stool impaction [^9e824002]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

This consisted of endoscopic instillation of magnesium citrate, an osmotic laxative, into the jejunum, and thereby bypassing the stomach, as patient had significant gastroparesis and was unable to keep fluids down. Magnesium citrate has clear evidence as osmotic laxative and we used enteroscopy as a delivery method in addition to the diagnostic modalities for laxation. To stimulate colonic peristalsis, we administered a cholinesterase inhibitor, neostigmine, during monitored anaesthesia saving hospitalisation; neostigmine administration requires intensive care monitoring for risk of bradycardia and bronchospasm. Additionally, we infused a hyperosmolar solution, gastrografin, into the proximal right colon to break up hard, inspissated stool. This three-pronged approach was successful in disimpacting stool. Due to a lack of prior studies of this approach, no complications have been reported in the literature, however, general endoscopy-related complications such as perforation, infection and bleeding can be considered.

### Constipation – modern laxative therapy [^59401936]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

It is estimated that one third of the population in Western industrial countries suffers from constipation at least from time to time. Constipation may have somatopathic or functional causes. Furthermore, a great number of substances are known to cause medication-induced constipation, i.e. opioid-induced constipation is caused by linkage of the opioid to opioid receptors in the bowel and the central nerve system. Whenever possible, causal therapy should be undertaken. Patients in palliative care mostly suffer from chronic functional constipation. The treatment consists of basic measures and the application of laxatives. According to their mode of action, they are divided into bulk-forming laxatives, osmotic laxatives, stimulant laxatives, lubricating agents and others. Bulk-forming laxatives are not recommended for use in palliative care patients, for such patients are normally not able to take in the required amount of fluids. Osmotic laxatives are divided into (magnesium) salts, saccharine, alcohols and macrogols. Lactulose is the most popular saccharine laxative. Because of its side effects (flatulence, bloating and abdominal cramping), lactulose is not a laxative of our choice; instead, we prefer to give macrogol. Orally administered, macrogol is not metabolised and pH value and bowel flora remain unchanged. Macrogol hydrates hardened stools, increases stool volume, decreases the duration of colon passage and dilates the bowel wall that then triggers the defecation reflex. Even when given for some time, the effectiveness of macrogol will not decrease. Because of its high effectiveness and commonly good tolerance, macrogol has become the laxative of first choice in palliative care patients with all kinds of chronic constipation, if these patients are able to take in the necessary amount of fluids. From the general medical point of view, lubricating agents have become obsolete. In palliative care patients, however, they are still important laxatives for prophylactic treatment or therapy of constipation. Due to clinical experience, in palliative care a laxative ladder has proven successful.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of polyethylene glycol with and without electrolytes in constipation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^a99b090f]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This network meta-analysis has confirmed that polyethylene glycol with and without electrolytes are effective and safe treatments for constipation in adults. There was no difference in the number of bowel movements per week and there appears to be no differences with respect to safety or tolerability between the two preparations. The addition of electrolytes in this clinical setting does not appear to offer any clinical benefits over polyethylene glycol alone.
