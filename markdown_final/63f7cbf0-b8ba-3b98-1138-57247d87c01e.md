## Question

What level is considered lead toxicity

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what level is considered lead toxicity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between a population-based reference value and a health-based toxicity threshold. Then, I should verify the current CDC blood lead reference value for children and how it is derived. Next, I will review adult occupational reference levels and their limitations. After that, I need to check the evidence that there is no safe blood lead level and what that means clinically. Finally, I will synthesize practical thresholds for action in children and adults, and clarify when chelation is indicated, making sure I anchor each point to authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the conceptual framework, because I need to ensure I'm not conflating a screening benchmark with a biological threshold. The CDC blood lead reference value is a population-based statistic, not a health-based toxicity threshold; it identifies the top 2.5% of children aged 1–5 years and triggers public health and clinical follow-up, but it does not imply that levels below it are "safe" or without harm [^115w7ByV] [^112fh32B].

> I will now examine the current pediatric reference value. The CDC updated the blood lead reference value to 3.5 μg/dL in 2021, based on the 97.5th percentile of NHANES 2015–2018 data for children 1–5 years; this replaces the prior 5 μg/dL reference value and is intended to prompt earlier intervention, not to define a toxicity threshold [^115w7ByV] [^112fh32B] [^114eyPSe].

> Wait, let me verify the adult occupational context, because it differs from pediatrics. For adults, CDC's Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance program uses 10 μg/dL as an elevated level for surveillance and case management, while OSHA's return-to-work and medical removal thresholds are considerably higher, reflecting outdated standards that many experts argue are not protective given evidence of harm at lower levels; some occupational health guidance recommends medical removal at 20–30 μg/dL, underscoring that 10 μg/dL is not a "safe" level for workers either [^115ATQJb] [^115ATQJb] [^114F3Enq] [^117V1GsU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "safe" levels. I should confirm the core toxicology principle. Multiple authoritative bodies conclude there is no identified safe blood lead level in children, and adverse neurodevelopmental effects have been documented at levels below 5 μg/dL and even below 3.5 μg/dL; this is why primary prevention and early intervention are emphasized even at low levels [^111xnxjL] [^115D7JUM] [^111WSDhy].

> Next, I should review when medical treatment is indicated, because that is where "toxicity" translates into action. Chelation therapy is generally indicated for children with blood lead levels ≥ 45 μg/dL, and for adults, many occupational programs consider medical removal at 20–30 μg/dL, even though OSHA's return-to-work threshold remains 40 μg/dL; these treatment thresholds reflect severe toxicity and the need for urgent intervention, not the absence of harm below them [^116j3wtj] [^114F3Enq] [^117V1GsU].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly, and I should double-check that I'm aligning with current guidance. For children, the operational benchmark for public health action is the CDC blood lead reference value of 3.5 μg/dL, but clinically, there is no safe level and neurocognitive harm can occur below this value; for adults, CDC surveillance uses ≥ 10 μg/dL as elevated, yet adverse cardiovascular and renal effects are reported at levels below 10 μg/dL, and many occupational health programs recommend removal from exposure at 20–30 μg/dL; chelation is indicated at ≥ 45 μg/dL in children and is generally considered in adults at similarly high levels with symptoms or high exposure risk [^115w7ByV] [^112fh32B] [^111xnxjL] [^115ATQJb] [^114F3Enq] [^116j3wtj].

> But wait, what if someone asks how to interpret a result just below 3.5 μg/dL? I should confirm that even low-level exposure warrants prevention: evidence shows decrements in IQ and academic achievement associated with increases within the 1–3.5 μg/dL range, reinforcing that the absence of a threshold means prevention and source identification remain priorities even at seemingly "low" levels [^111WSDhy] [^112ipuHS].

There is **no safe blood lead level**; even low levels can cause harm, especially in children [^112fh32B] [^111xnxjL]. The CDC's current blood lead reference value for children is **3.5 µg/dL**, which triggers public health action [^115w7ByV] [^112fh32B]. For adults, levels ≥ 10 µg/dL are considered elevated and warrant intervention [^114sF8hV] [^115ATQJb]. Severe toxicity (encephalopathy, organ failure) is typically seen at ≥ 45–70 µg/dL and requires urgent chelation and hospitalization [^115ovrEr] [^116j3wtj]. Because there is no threshold below which adverse effects do not occur, the focus is on **primary prevention** and early intervention [^111xnxjL] [^115D7JUM].

## Current definitions and reference levels

### Children

- **CDC blood lead reference value (BLRV)**: 3.5 µg/dL (updated in 2021) — the 97.5th percentile of BLLs in children aged 1–5 years; levels at or above this value trigger public health and clinical interventions [^115w7ByV] [^112fh32B].

- **Historical reference levels**: Previously, 10 µg/dL (1991) and 5 µg/dL (2012) were used; these were lowered as evidence showed harm at lower levels [^115pQX5e] [^114Y66K6].

- **Clinical implications**: Even BLLs below 3.5 µg/dL are associated with neurodevelopmental impairment, including reduced IQ and behavioral problems [^111WSDhy] [^112ipuHS].

---

### Adults

For adults, **CDC reference level** is ≥ 10 µg/dL, considered elevated and warranting intervention [^114sF8hV] [^115ATQJb]. Occupational safety thresholds vary: OSHA permits return to work after two consecutive BLLs < 40 µg/dL, but many authorities recommend medical removal at 20–30 µg/dL due to health risks [^114F3Enq] [^117V1GsU].

## Clinical severity and health effects by blood lead level

| **Blood lead level (bll)** | **Population** | **Health effects and clinical actions** |
|-|-|-|
| < 3.5 µg/dL | Children | - Subclinical neurodevelopmental effects <br/> - No safe threshold identified [^112fh32B] [^111xnxjL] |
| 3.5–9 µg/dL | Children | - Increased risk of cognitive impairment <br/> - Behavioral issues <br/> - Public health intervention recommended [^115w7ByV] [^112fh32B] |
| 10–19 µg/dL | Adults | - Elevated blood pressure <br/> - Renal dysfunction <br/> - Neurobehavioral effects <br/> - Occupational intervention recommended [^114sF8hV] [^115ATQJb] |
| 20–29 µg/dL | Adults | - Medical removal from exposure recommended by many authorities [^114F3Enq] |
| 30–44 µg/dL | Adults | - Significant toxicity <br/> - Medical removal required in some jurisdictions [^114F3Enq] |
| ≥ 45 µg/dL | Children and adults | - Severe toxicity <br/> - Encephalopathy <br/> - Organ failure <br/> - Chelation therapy and hospitalization required [^112itfw9] [^115RfNnd] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Lead exposure during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, preterm birth, and neurodevelopmental harm to the fetus; no safe BLL has been identified for pregnant women [^113NTeKa].

- **Retained bullet fragments**: Can cause chronic lead poisoning with fluctuating BLLs, requiring ongoing monitoring and potential surgical removal [^1129W38j].

- **Global context**: Many children worldwide have BLLs ≥ 5 µg/dL, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, highlighting the need for primary prevention [^111epRyX] [^1128FMfv].

---

## Clinical management and prevention strategies

- **Primary prevention**: Eliminating lead sources (paint, water, soil, consumer products) is the most effective strategy [^111xnxjL] [^115D7JUM].

- **Screening**: Routine screening of high-risk children (e.g. Medicaid-eligible, living in older housing) is recommended [^113s4G4d] [^115fK2hp].

- **Chelation therapy**: Indicated for severe poisoning (typically BLL ≥ 45 µg/dL) but does not reverse neurodevelopmental damage from chronic low-level exposure [^116j3wtj] [^112WCGoD].

- **Public health interventions**: Environmental remediation, nutritional counseling (calcium, iron), and developmental follow-up are key components of care [^1171mtW2] [^116j3wtj].

---

## Conclusion

There is **no safe blood lead level**; even low levels can cause significant harm, especially in children. The CDC's current reference value of 3.5 µg/dL for children reflects the latest evidence and guides public health action, while adults are considered at risk at ≥ 10 µg/dL. Severe toxicity occurs at ≥ 45–70 µg/dL and requires urgent treatment. Prevention, early detection, and intervention are essential to reduce the burden of lead toxicity.

### Public and occupational health risks related to lead exposure updated according to present-day blood lead levels [^113qurJy]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Lead is an environmental hazard that should be addressed worldwide. Over time, human lead exposure in the western world has decreased drastically to levels comparable to those among humans living in the preindustrial era, who were mainly exposed to natural sources of lead. To re-evaluate the potential health risks associated with present-day lead exposure, a two-pronged approach was applied. First, recently published population metrics describing the adverse health effects associated with lead exposure at the population level were critically assessed. Next, the key results of the Study for Promotion of Health in Recycling Lead (SPHERL; NCT02243904) were summarized and put in perspective with those of the published population metrics. To our knowledge, SPHERL is the first prospective study that accounted for interindividual variability between people with respect to their vulnerability to the toxic effects of lead exposure by assessing the participants' health status before and after occupational lead exposure. The overall conclusion of this comprehensive review is that mainstream ideas about the public and occupational health risks related to lead exposure urgently need to be updated because a large portion of the available literature became obsolete given the sharp decrease in exposure levels over the past 40 years.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^115pQX5e]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Lead is a common environmental contaminant, and exposure to lead is a preventable risk that exists in all areas of the United States. Lead is associated with negative outcomes in children, including impaired cognitive, motor, behavioral, and physical abilities. In 1991, CDC defined the blood lead level (BLL) that should prompt public health actions as 10 microg/dL. Concurrently, CDC also recognized that a BLL of 10 microg/dL did not define a threshold for the harmful effects of lead. Research conducted since 1991 has strengthened the evidence that children's physical and mental development can be affected at BLLs ≤ 10 microg/dL. This report summarizes the findings of a review of clinical interpretation and management of BLLs ≤ 10 microg/dL conducted by CDC's Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention. This report provides information to help clinicians understand BLLs ≤ 10 microg/dL, identifies gaps in knowledge concerning lead levels in this range, and outlines strategies to reduce childhood exposures to lead. In addition, this report summarizes scientific data relevant to counseling, blood lead screening, and lead exposure risk assessment. To aid in the interpretation of BLLs, clinicians should understand the laboratory error range for blood lead values and, if possible, select a laboratory that achieves routine performance within ± 2 microg/dL. Clinicians should obtain an environmental history on all children they examine, provide families with lead prevention counseling, and follow blood lead screening recommendations established for their areas. As local and patient circumstances permit, clinicians should consider early referral to developmental programs for children at high risk for exposure to lead and consider more frequent rescreening of children with BLLs approaching 10 microg/dL, depending on the potential for exposure to lead, child age, and season of testing. In addition, clinicians should direct parents to agencies and sources of information that will help them establish a lead-safe environment for their children. For these preventive strategies to succeed, partnerships between health-care providers, families, and local public health and housing programs should be strengthened.

### Cumulative population blood lead levels [^1128FMfv]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

SUMMARY BOX

A new tool, the cumulative population blood lead level (alternately 'Lead Burden Index'), combines average lead blood levels with population size. It can act as an indicator of gross intellectual impairment or cardiovascular disease.
This metric can be used to estimate the burden of lead in differing countries or regions and from differing sources of lead exposure.
The tool is instructive for donors, governments and United Nations agencies when comparing a range of interventions for viability or cost-effectiveness.

Low-level lead poisoning in low- and middle-income countries has recently become a global priority, endorsed by the World Bank, UN agencies and others. Blood lead level (BLL) is a critical measure of individual lead exposure directly linked to adverse health outcomes. National BLL averages can be useful to target interventions but do not account for population size. We introduce the concept of the 'cumulative population BLL' (cpBLL), a metric combining average BLL with population size to estimate the overall lead burden in a country. Initial cpBLL estimates reveal that over 60% of the global lead burden is concentrated in just 12 countries, which highlights the need for targeted interventions in specific regions. The cpBLL tool, alternately called the 'Lead Burden Index', offers a way to help governments, donors and international organisations prioritise where the action is needed and can be used to measure the effectiveness of associated interventions.

Lead poisoning in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has recently become a global priority. The Partnership for a Lead-Free Future (PLF) was unveiled at the 79th UN General Assembly by US Agency for International Development (USAID) and UNICEF, representing the first global public–private initiative focused on combating lead exposure in LMICs. The PLF launched with 26 member countries, 38 partner organisations and $150 million in funding, aiming to eliminate childhood lead poisoning in developing countries by 2040. The event featured leaders of the World Bank, UNICEF, United Nations Environment Programme, World Health Organisation, USAID, several heads of stateand global philanthropists and publicly highlighted the global lead poisoning crisis as an issue in ascension within the international health agenda.

Childhood blood lead levels (BLLs) < 10 μg/dL — CDC's Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention (ACCLPP) notes that in 1991 CDC defined the BLL that should prompt public health actions as 10 μg/dL, recognized that a BLL of 10 μg/dL did not define a threshold for harmful effects, and that children's development can be affected at BLLs < 10 μg/dL.

### Lead toxicity in children: an unremitting public health problem [^112CTPfD]. Pediatric Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lead is a pervasive environmental contaminant. Lead accumulates in the body, impairing a molecular level various cellular processes. Lead exposure during childhood causes adverse and permanent neurodevelopmental consequences, sometimes even with "low" blood lead levels. Symptoms are frequently silent, making lead exposure an often unrecognized and underestimated threat for pervasive neurocognitive disorders.

Methods

We identified articles focusing on childhood exposure to lead and neurodevelopment via a search of the electronic database PubMed (National Library of Medicine), including journal articles published from 2007 to 2019. These articles were used to evaluate the effect of environmental lead exposure and analyze whether control efforts over the past decades have altered the prevalence of exposed children.

Conclusions

Children are still being exposed to lead despite evidence of the adverse impact of exposure, even for children with blood lead levels below the currently recognized threshold for intervention. Legislative and educational efforts have reduced lead exposure but are not being followed universally. Primary prevention and identification of high-risk populations are the best cost-benefit interventions to fight this public health problem.

### Prevention of childhood lead toxicity [^111xnxjL]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Blood lead concentrations have decreased dramatically in US children over the past 4 decades, but too many children still live in housing with deteriorated lead-based paint and are at risk for lead exposure with resulting lead-associated cognitive impairment and behavioral problems. Evidence continues to accrue that commonly encountered blood lead concentrations, even those below 5 µg/dL (50 ppb), impair cognition; there is no identified threshold or safe level of lead in blood. From 2007 to 2010, approximately 2.6% of preschool children in the United States had a blood lead concentration ≥ 5 µg/dL (≥ 50 ppb), which represents about 535000 US children 1 to 5 years of age. Evidence-based guidance is available for managing increased lead exposure in children, and reducing sources of lead in the environment, including lead in housing, soil, water, and consumer products, has been shown to be cost-beneficial. Primary prevention should be the focus of policy on childhood lead toxicity.

### What are possible health effects from lead exposure? [^112itfw9]. archive.cdc.gov (2023). Medium credibility.

What Are Possible Health Effects from Lead Exposure. This page refers to a blood lead level of 5 micrograms per deciliter as the CDC's blood lead reference value. As of October 28, 2021, CDC uses a blood lead reference value of 3. 5 micrograms per deciliter to identify children with blood lead levels that are higher than most children's levels. This new level is based on the U. S. population of children ages 1–5 years who represent the top 2. 5% of children with the highest blood lead levels. For more information, refer to Blood Lead Reference Value.
- Subclinical neurological effects may occur at lower BLLs – at or below the regulatory standard of 10 µg/dL, in some cases – and it may not be possible to detect them on clinical examination at the time of the exposure or peak BLLs. Children often show no signs of lead toxicity until they are in school, even as late as middle school, when expectations for academic achievement increase.
- Ataxia,
- Coma,
- Convulsions,
- Death,
- Hyperirritability, and
- Stupor. The BLLs associated with encephalopathy in children vary from study to study, but BLLs of 70–80 µg/dL or greater appear to indicate a serious risk. Even without encephalopathy symptoms, these levels are associated with increased incidences of lasting neurological and behavioral damage. Less severe neurological and behavioral effects have been documented in lead-exposed workers with BLLs ranging from 40 to 120 µg/dL. These effects include. EPA estimated the threshold BLL for a decrease in hemoglobin to be 50 µg/dL for occupationally exposed adults and approximately 40 µg/dL for children, although other studies have indicated a lower threshold for children. Lead induced anemia in adults is not a common occurrence.
- Adverse health effects may occur in children and adults at BLLs < 5 μg/dL.
- In children, health effects generally occur at lower BLLs than in adults.
- There is no identified threshold or safe level of lead in blood.
- The nervous system is the most sensitive organ system for lead exposure in children.

### Early-life low lead levels and academic achievement in childhood and adolescence [^113LYiEk]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The CDC has historically issued guidelines for blood lead levels. As stated by the CDC, these are not meant as health or toxicity standards but represent the population-based levels for the 2.5% of children in NHANES with the highest blood lead values. These thresholds are referred to as blood lead reference values. In 2021, the CDC lowered the threshold from 5 μg/dL or higher, which was in effect from 2012 to 2021, to 3.5 μg/dL or higher; these thresholds represent the 97.5th percentiles in 2015 through 2018 and 2007 through 2010 samples, respectively. Before 2012, the CDC had 10 μg/dL or higher as a level of concern.

The CDC and other authoritative public health agencies acknowledge that low blood lead levels can still be harmful for child development. However, current thresholds (and those before them) are also meant to guide government and public health (federal, state, and local) processes and resources for further interventions. For lead levels greater than or equal to 3.5 μg/dL, recommendations include additional management and intervention steps for reporting the test, assessing and investigating environmental exposure history, diet checks and assessments especially for calcium or iron deficiency, evaluating development, considering referral to additional services and specialists, and above certain thresholds (> 45 μg/dL) gastrointestinal tract decontamination.

### Public and occupational health risks related to lead exposure updated according to present-day blood lead levels [^111BDeNU]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Perspectives

Lead exposure represents an environmental risk that should be addressed worldwide. To re-evaluate the health risks possibly associated with present-day lead exposure, a two-pronged approach was applied, first assessing recently published population metrics and then summarizing the SPHERL results. Considering health preservation at the population level, health metrics might gain credibility by addressing the following issues: (i) ensuring the use of health data (e.g. blood pressure) in relation to present-day lead exposure levels; (ii) retesting the presumed pathogenic pathway leading from hypertension to both fatal and nonfatal adverse health outcomes; (iii) narrowing the range of cardiovascular complications potentially associated with lead exposure; (iv) developing risk models accounting for multimodal exposure to risk factors and pollutants, thereby reducing residual confounding; and (v) setting no-risk thresholds at blood lead levels that are not lower than what is achievable given the naturally occurring background sources of lead exposure. SPHERL was an ethically performed real-world experiment. The major strength of this cohort study was that it accounted for interindividual variability in the responses to a threefold blood lead increase with full documentation of the baseline values in the biomarkers of effect and exposure. Additionally, although residual confounding by unmeasured risk factors can never be excluded in observational studies, SPHERL did address a wide array of potential confounders. Nevertheless, SPHERL has limitations to be addressed in future research. First, the attrition rate among the workers who participated in the baseline examination but defaulted from follow-up amounted to over 40%, mainly because they left employment. According to the published SPHERL protocol, the anticipated attrition rate was 50%. To meet the sample size required to address hypertension and renal dysfunction as the primary endpoint, 500 workers had to be enrolled. Second, the small sample size and the limited 2-year follow-up of the current SPHERL cohort warrant a cautious interpretation of the findings. Third, the healthy worker effect might partially account for the nonsignificant results in relation to lead exposure in this occupational cohort with a mean age of 29.7 years. The current observations should not be unthoughtfully generalized and might therefore not be applicable to older individuals or patients with comorbidities, such as diabetes, which increases the vulnerability of renal function. Most studies summarized in this review were conducted in high-income countries. In middle- and low-income countries, environmental regulations are less stringent or are only loosely applied. For instance, in Pakistan, blood lead was significantly higher in fume-exposed workers (median 61.2 µg/dl, range 21.2–171.1 µg/dl) than in controls (median 23.8 µg/dl, range 10.2–44.1 µg/dl). A recent cross-sectional population survey in Haiti (n = 2504) reported a geometric mean blood lead level of 4.73 µg/dl; of these participants, 42.3% had a blood lead level of 5 µg/dl or higher. Finally, coexposure to other metals, such as cadmium, is common in lead recycling plants. This metal accumulates in the kidneys with a half-life exceeding 30 years. Cadmium is an established renal toxicant that adversely affects renal tubular and glomerular function.

### Cumulative population blood lead levels [^1119iwke]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Blood Lead Level (BLL) is a well-established measure of the individual body burden of lead and is correlated directly with health outcomes. While in many parts of the world, BLL data are limited, some estimates are available, and these are useful to explore where interventions can be most effectively targeted. National averages can be useful to determine where investments can be most needed.

Some countries have large populations. Others have high average BLLs. We suggest a metric to combine these two characteristics, the 'cumulative population BLL' (cpBLL). The cpBLL is calculated as the average BLL across a population (typically a country) multiplied by the number of people in that population. The unit is in effect concentration at a country level. It could be converted into an estimate of the total weight of lead in the population, using basic assumptions about the amount of blood per person.

Using UN population estimates and average BLLs from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), cpBLLs have been calculated for all countries in online supplemental materials and listed on.

This metric can help prioritise where interventions are most needed and which interventions may be the most cost-effective. One can compare expected cpBLL reduction for a variety of interventions at different cost levels and rank them. One reason why this is reasonable is that the relationship between IQ loss and cardiovascular impact (the two most important impacts of lead exposures) is reasonably linear for BLLs < 10 µg/dL. Where populations have the majority of BLLs within this range (which is most countries globally), cpBLL can model total impact and potential benefit. Thus, an alternate name of the Lead Burden Index is appropriate.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^111X38WF]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Medium credibility.

Future research needs — priorities for children with low blood lead: Further study is needed to assess the effects of BLLs < 10 μg/dL on children. Additional research also is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies to lower exposures to lead. Blood lead screening strategies should be evaluated to determine the most appropriate ages for screening and the utility of screening strategies applied at the community level. Evaluations of lead surveillance strategies should test ways to identify changing patterns of environmental risks and subpopulations exposed to established and emerging sources of lead.

### Prevention of childhood lead toxicity [^116j3wtj]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

AAP recommendations on management of childhood lead exposure and poisoning — actions by blood lead level: For < 5 μg/dL (< 50 ppb), review results with families and note that among US children 1–5 y old the geometric mean is < 2 μg/dL (< 20 ppb) and 2.5% have ≥ 5 μg/dL (≥ 50 ppb); repeat the blood lead concentration in 6–12 mo if the child is at high risk, and for those initially screened before 12 mo of age, consider retesting in 3–6 mo. For 5–14 μg/dL (50–140 ppb), retest venous blood lead concentration within 1–3 mo and, if stable or decreasing, retest in 3 mo; take a careful environmental history, screen for iron sufficiency with complete blood cell count, ferritin, and C-reactive protein, provide nutritional counseling related to calcium and iron, and perform structured developmental screening evaluations at child health maintenance visits. For 15–44 μg/dL (150–440 ppb), confirm with repeat venous sample within 1–4 wk, consider abdominal radiography with gut decontamination if lead foreign bodies are visualized, and ensure any treatment in this range is provided in consultation with an expert. For > 44 μg/dL (> 440 ppb), confirm with repeat venous lead level within 48 h and consider hospitalization or chelation therapy managed with an experienced provider.

### Prevention of childhood lead toxicity [^114Y66K6]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Childhood lead exposure — low blood lead concentrations and reference thresholds are delineated as follows: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) previously adopted a blood lead concentration > 10 µg/dL (> 100 ppb) as the "level of concern", but evidence indicates cognitive and behavioral harms at blood lead concentrations below 5 µg/dL (50 ppb). In 2012, the US National Toxicology Program reported that blood lead concentrations < 5 µg/dL (< 50 ppb) are strongly associated with intellectual and academic deficits and behavior problems, and the Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention concluded there is no safe level and adopted a reference value of ≥ 5 µg/dL (≥ 50 ppb), based on the 97.5th percentile from NHANES, to be used as a trigger for clinical and public health interventions. Low-level elevations below 5 µg/dL (50 ppb) are associated with decrements in cognitive functions. Modeled IQ losses show the decrement from < 1 µg/dL (< 10 ppb) to 30 µg/dL (300 ppb) was 9.2 IQ points, and from < 1 µg/dL (< 10 ppb) to 10 µg/dL (100 ppb) was 6.2 IQ points; overall, lead toxicity accounts for an estimated total loss of 23 million IQ points among a 6-year cohort of contemporary US children. Focusing efforts only on children with concentrations ≥ 5 µg/dL (≥ 50 ppb) is efficient but will fail to preserve the majority of lost IQ points, reflecting the prevention paradox.

### Lead toxicity [^112BFKaG]. Occupational Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Since the last In-Depth Review of lead toxicity in 2004 there have been further developments with regard to safe exposure levels for lead workers.

Aims

To advise occupational health professionals of the latest research on the multi-system toxic effects of lead and the implications of this research for setting new safe and appropriate occupational suspension limits.

Methods

An extensive review of the current literature and an investigation of the database used by lead users to produce their submission under the REACH Regulations.

Results

Much of the published research on lead toxicity is on the effects of lead on the general population where blood lead levels are considerably lower than those seen in lead-exposed workers. It is always difficult to compare such studies with those undertaken on exposed workers as they may not be directly comparable and may not have taken into account all confounding variables and the well-acknowledged 'healthy worker' concept. However, it is clear that there is substantial evidence that potential health effects on lead workers may be seen at levels which were previously accepted as 'safe'.

Conclusions

There is undoubtedly a narrow margin of safety between current occupational blood lead suspension limits and subclinical effect. As a result, the lead users have produced a voluntary Code of Practice with suspension limits significantly below those seen in some national legislation, particularly the Control of Lead at Work Act 2002.

### Lead toxicity [^112zSByi]. Occupational Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Lead is one of the oldest known and most widely studied occupational and environmental toxins. Despite intensive study, there is still vigorous debate about the toxic effects of lead, both from low-level exposure in the general population owing to environmental pollution and historic use of lead in paint and plumbing and from exposure in the occupational setting. The majority of industries historically associated with high lead exposure have made dramatic advances in their control of occupational exposure. However, cases of unacceptably high exposure and even of frank lead poisoning are still seen, predominantly in the demolition and tank cleaning industries. Nevertheless, in most industries blood lead levels have declined below levels at which signs or symptoms are seen and the current focus of attention is on the subclinical effects of exposure. The significance of some of these effects for the overt health of the workers is often the subject of debate. Inevitably there is pressure to reduce lead exposure in the general population and in working environments, but any legislation must be based on a genuine scientific evaluation of the available evidence.

Policy Update

The BLRV is a population-based measurement which indicates that 2.5% of U.S. children aged 1–5 years have BLLs ≥ 3.5 μ g/dL. It is not a health-based standard or a toxicity threshold. The BLRV should be used as a guide to 1) help determine whether medical or environmental follow-up actions should be initiated for an individual child and 2) prioritize communities with the most need for primary prevention of exposure and evaluate the effectiveness of prevention efforts. Whether a BLL measurement at or above the BLRV triggers medical or environmental follow-up will depend on existing jurisdictional laws, regulations, and resource availability. Follow-up lead testing to confirm BLLs is recommended. CDC strongly advises that providers follow CDC's Recommended Actions Based on Blood Lead Level.

### Early-life low lead levels and academic achievement in childhood and adolescence [^1166Cb3L]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Children's exposure to lead has long been recognized as harmful to their health and neurodevelopment. Lead biologically disrupts and damages brain and neurological development. Lead exposure has been associated with long-term adverse cognitive, mental, physical, and social outcomes. Globally, nearly 5.5 million cardiovascular-related deaths among adults and 765 million lost IQ points among children below 5 years of age in 2019 were associated with lead exposure.

National and international public health authoritative bodies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization, acknowledge that there are no safe levels of lead. Such organizations provide guidelines based on thresholds for blood lead levels that are considered high enough to warrant retesting, assessment of lead exposure sources, parent education about lead exposure, and in cases of high lead levels, treatment of children for these levels. During the past few decades, these thresholds have become lower as the mean lead blood level and the proportion of children with high blood levels steadily declined, owing to a range of health and housing policies aimed at eliminating or reducing lead exposure from homes, canned food, water, gasoline, and other sources. Because of these policies and reduced exposure to lead, the mean lead blood level among children aged 1 to 5 years in the US declined from 15.2 to 0.83 μg/dL between 1976 through 1989 and 2011 through 2016 based on samples from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Nonetheless, lead continues to affect many children and adults worldwide. In 2015, over half of the US population was estimated to have been exposed to high lead levels in early childhood.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^114e556t]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Medium credibility.

Summary of recommendations — For clinicians, provide anticipatory guidance to parents of all young children regarding sources of lead and help them identify sources of lead in their child's environment. Evaluate laboratory performance by reviewing the laboratory's quality control chart or statistical quality control summary, and review office procedures and policies to ensure that lead exposure risk assessment or blood lead screening is performed on all children as required by state or local health officials or as recommended by CDC. Consider the child's age, season of testing, and exposure history when deciding when to obtain follow-up blood lead tests; for a child whose blood lead level (BLL) is approaching 10 µg/dL, more frequent blood lead screening (i.e., more than annually) might be appropriate, particularly if the child is aged < 2 years old, was tested at the start of warm weather when BLLs tend to increase, or is at high risk for lead exposures. Perform a diagnostic blood lead test on all children suspected of having lead exposure or an elevated BLL and institute the recommended management guidelines if a child's BLL increases to ≥ 10 µg/dL. Help parents to understand the uncertainty of a blood lead value and potential reasons for its fluctuation, including error introduced by the sampling methods and laboratory-, age-, and season-related exposures. Whenever possible, utilize laboratories that can achieve routine performance of ± 2 µg/dL for blood lead analysis.

### Very high blood lead levels among adults-United States, 2002–2011 [^114sF8hV]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Editorial Note

Reducing lead exposures at work and in the community is essential to avoid adverse health effects in humans. Reducing by 10% the rate of persons who have elevated BLLs (i.e. BLLs ≥ 10 μ g/dL) from work exposures is a Healthy People 2020 objective (OHS-7). The 2010 baseline rate for BLLs ≥ 10 μ g/dL is 26.4 adults per 100,000 employed adults. Reducing adverse health effects resulting from lead exposures requires 1) adherence to engineering controls and safe work practices; 2) BLL testing and management of elevated BLLs according to the most current medical guidelines and recommendations; and 3) education in the workplace and community. OSHA lead standards give the examining physician broad flexibility to tailor special protective procedures to the needs of individual employees. Therefore, the most current guidelines for management of lead-exposed adults should be implemented by the medical community at the current CDC reference BLL of 10 μ g/dL, including consideration of removal from lead exposure at lower levels than the current OSHA lead standards require. Increasing the number and timeliness of referrals to OSHA of workplaces identified by state ABLES programs fosters prompt intervention and mitigation of lead exposure hazards.

What is already known on this topic?

The vast majority of elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) in the United States are workplace-related. Most lead exposures at work occur in the manufacturing, construction, services, and mining industries. Current research has found that even BLLs < 10 μ g/dL can cause harm in adults. CDC considers BLLs ≥ 10 μ g/dL to be elevated. In contrast to the CDC reference level, prevailing Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) lead standards allow workers removed from lead exposure to return to lead work when their BLL falls below 40 μ g/dL.

What is added by this report?

Data collected by the Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance program during 2002–2011 identified 11,536 adults with very high BLLs (≥ 40 μ g/dL), of whom 19% had elevated BLLs recorded during ≥ 2 years. Among those with known exposure source, occupational exposures accounted for 91% of adults with very high BLLs.

### Very high blood lead levels among adults-United States, 2002–2011 [^115ATQJb]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Over the past several decades there has been a remarkable reduction in environmental sources of lead, improved protection from occupational lead exposure, and an overall decreasing trend in the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) in U.S. adults. As a result, the U.S. national BLL geometric mean among adults was 1.2 μ g/dL during 2009–2010. Nonetheless, lead exposures continue to occur at unacceptable levels. Current research continues to find that BLLs previously considered harmless can have harmful effects in adults, such as decreased renal function and increased risk for hypertension and essential tremor at BLLs < 10 μ g/dL. CDC has designated 10 μ g/dL as the reference BLL for adults; levels ≥ 10 μ g/dL are considered elevated. CDC's Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) program tracks elevated BLLs among adults in the United States. In contrast to the CDC reference level, prevailing Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) lead standards allow workers removed from lead exposure to return to lead work when their BLL falls below 40 μ g/dL. During 2002–2011, ABLES identified 11,536 adults with very high BLLs (≥ 40 μ g/dL). Persistent very high BLLs (≥ 40 μ g/dL in ≥ 2 years) were found among 2,210 (19%) of these adults. Occupational exposures accounted for 7,076 adults with very high BLLs (91% of adults with known exposure source) and 1,496 adults with persistent very high BLLs. Adverse health effects associated with very high BLLs underscore the need for increased efforts to prevent lead exposure at workplaces and in communities.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels of less than 10 microg / dL in children and reducing childhood exposure to lead: recommendations of the centers for disease control and prevention advisory committee on childhood lead poisoning prevention [^114Xq3Z9]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Lead is a common environmental contaminant. Lead exposure is a preventable risk that exists in all areas of the United States. In children, lead is associated with impaired cognitive, motor, behavioral, and physical abilities. In 1991, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defined the blood lead level that should prompt public health actions as 10 microg/dL. Concurrently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recognized that a blood lead level of 10 microg/dL did not define a threshold for the harmful effects of lead. Research conducted since 1991 has strengthened the evidence that children's physical and mental development can be affected at blood lead levels of < 10 microg/dL. In this report we provide information to help clinicians understand blood lead levels < 10 microg/dL, identify gaps in knowledge concerning lead levels in this range, and outline strategies to reduce childhood exposures to lead. We also summarize scientific data relevant to counseling, blood lead screening, and lead-exposure risk assessment. To aid in the interpretation of blood lead levels, clinicians should understand the laboratory error range for blood lead values and, if possible, select a laboratory that achieves routine performance within ± 2 microg/dL. Clinicians should obtain an environmental history on all children they examine, provide families with lead-prevention counseling, and follow blood lead screening recommendations established for their areas. As circumstances permit, clinicians should consider referral to developmental programs for children at high risk for exposure to lead and more frequent rescreening of children with blood lead levels approaching 10 microg/dL. In addition, clinicians should direct parents to agencies and sources of information that will help them establish a lead-safe environment for their children. For these preventive strategies to succeed, partnerships between health care providers, families, and local public health and housing programs should be strengthened.

### Prevention of childhood lead toxicity [^115D7JUM]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Prevention of childhood lead toxicity — evidence and policy emphasize that commonly encountered blood lead concentrations, even those below 5 μg/dL (50 ppb), impair cognition and there is no identified threshold or safe level of lead in blood. From 2007 to 2010, approximately 2.6% of preschool children in the United States had a blood lead concentration ≥ 5 μg/dL (≥ 50 ppb), which represents about 535 000 US children 1 to 5 years of age. Very high blood lead concentrations (eg, > 100 μg/dL) can cause significant overt symptoms, such as protracted vomiting and encephalopathy, and even death. Low-level lead exposure, even at blood lead concentrations below 5 μg/dL (50 ppb), is a causal risk factor for diminished intellectual and academic abilities, higher rates of neurobehavioral disorders such as hyperactivity and attention deficits, and lower birth weight in children. No effective treatments ameliorate the permanent developmental effects of lead toxicity, so primary prevention, reducing or eliminating the myriad sources of lead in the environment of children before exposure occurs, is the most reliable and cost-effective measure to protect children. Reducing sources of lead in the environment, including lead in housing, soil, water, and consumer products, has been shown to be cost-beneficial, and lead poisoning prevention education directed at hand-washing or dust control fails to reduce children's blood lead concentrations. Primary prevention should be the focus of policy on childhood lead toxicity.

### Public and occupational health risks related to lead exposure updated according to present-day blood lead levels [^115jndwb]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

This 2018 NHANES report (Table 1), based on historical blood lead (1988–1994), has little relevance for public health policies in the third decade of the twenty-first century for the following reasons. First, the blood lead levels recorded in NHANES III are not representative of current lead exposure. To a large extent, these levels reflected the recirculation of lead from earlier bone stores, which in many participants accrued from the first decades of the twentieth century onward, when lead was still highly prevalent in the environment in the United States. In our analyses of 12,725 NHANES IV participants examined from 2003 to 2010, the geometric mean blood concentration in all participants was 1.41 µg/dl, with lower levels in women than men (1.25 vs. 1.80 µg/dl) and in Whites than in Blacks and Hispanics (1.46 vs. 1.57 µg/dl). All blood lead levels were below 30 µg/dl. Second, PAF was calculated as the proportional decline in mortality that would occur if the blood lead concentrations of all participants were reduced to a reference level of 1.0 µg/dl or less, which is an unfeasible target, given lead exposure from natural sources and food. This very low null-effect blood lead concentration substantially inflated the hazard ratios and PAFs associated with blood lead. Third, hypertension as the causal pathway linking mortality to environmental or occupational lead exposure is a deeply rooted paradigm, based on research dating back more than half a century ago. The NHANES III report itself argued against this mechanistic pathway, given that models accounting for hypertension and hypertension treatment or adjusted for systolic and diastolic blood pressure as continuously distributed variables barely affected the hazard ratios (Table 1). Along similar lines, in a meta-analysis of summary statistics extracted from 31 studies involving 58,518 participants, all published before February 2001, doubling of blood lead was only associated with a marginally higher blood pressure. The pooled estimates averaged 1.0 mmHg (CI, 0.5–1.4 mmHg) systolic and 0.6 mmHg (CI, 0.4–0.8 mmHg) diastolic. Furthermore, in a prospective population study of 728 individuals (50.7% women; age range, 20–82 years), blood pressure was measured conventionally at baseline (1985–1989) and at follow-up (1991–1995) and by 24-h ambulatory monitoring at follow-up. Over a median follow-up of 5.2 years (range, 3.5–8.4 years), the geometric mean blood lead concentration dropped by 32% from the baseline level of 8.7 µg/dl (range, 1.7–72.5 µg/dl). The small changes in the systolic/diastolic blood pressure on conventional measurement (−1.5/+1.7 mmHg) were unrelated to the blood lead concentration at baseline or to the changes in this exposure biomarker over follow-up. Similarly, the 24-h ambulatory blood pressure was not associated with blood lead at baseline or follow-up. A recent NHANES report with data from 1999–2016 included 30,467 participants aged 20–79 years. Non-Hispanic Black men (n = 3006) had the highest mean blood lead level (2.20 μg/dl), compared with 3814 Hispanic men (2.18 μg/dl) and 6989 non-Hispanic White men (1.89 μg/dl). A similar ethnic gradient in blood lead was observed among women: 1.49 μg/dl in 3256 non-Hispanic Black women, 1.30 μg/dl in 4130 Hispanic women, and 1.30 μg/dl in 7078 non-Hispanic White women. In multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models, hypertension was not associated with blood lead (odds ratio, 1.002; CI, 0.983–1.021).

### Public and occupational health risks related to lead exposure updated according to present-day blood lead levels [^115z25YL]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Our studies in the field of environmental medicine span four decades but did not provide convincing evidence supporting environmental lead exposure as being causally related to hypertension, renal dysfunction or cardiovascular disease. Given this research track, the aims of the present review were to identify sources of bias in recent publications examining the association between adverse health outcomes and lead exposure and to summarize the key results of the Study for Promotion of Health in Recycling Lead (SPHERL; NCT02243904). To our knowledge, SPHERL is the first prospective study that accounted for interindividual variability between people in their vulnerability to the toxic effects of human lead exposure by assessing participants' health status before and after lead exposure, an issue identified as a research priority in a meta-analysis published in 2002. As an introduction to the field, the toxicokinetics of lead in humans are first summarized.

Blood lead measurements at low levels — blood lead measurements entail inherent uncertainties due to imprecise analytic techniques and preanalytic variables, and the ratio of imprecision to measurement value, particularly at BLLs < 10 µg/dL, is relatively high; the degree of inherent error in blood lead analysis varies by analytic methodology used.

### Measurement challenges at low blood lead levels [^115Ckspv]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) adopted its Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention recommendation to use a population-based reference value to identify children and environments associated with lead hazards. The current reference value of 5 μg/dL is calculated as the 97.5th percentile of the distribution of blood lead levels (BLLs) in children 1 to 5 years old from 2007 to 2010 NHANES data. We calculated and updated selected percentiles, including the 97.5th percentile, by using NHANES 2011 to 2014 blood lead data and examined demographic characteristics of children whose blood lead was ≥ 90th percentile value. The 97.5th percentile BLL of 3.48 µg/dL highlighted analytical laboratory and clinical interpretation challenges of blood lead measurements ≤ 5 μg/dL. Review of 5 years of results for target blood lead values < 11 µg/dL for US clinical laboratories participating in the CDC's voluntary Lead and Multi-Element Proficiency quality assurance program showed 40% unable to quantify and reported a nondetectable result at a target blood lead value of 1.48 µg/dL, compared with 5.5% at a target BLL of 4.60 µg/dL. We describe actions taken at the CDC's Environmental Health Laboratory in the National Center for Environmental Health, which measures blood lead for NHANES, to improve analytical accuracy and precision and to reduce external lead contamination during blood collection and analysis.

### Continual decrease in blood lead level in Americans: United States national health nutrition and examination survey 1999–2014 [^115ogGXj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Lead is toxic and affects neurodevelopment in children even at low levels. There has been a long-term effort in the United States to reduce exposure to lead in the environment. We studied the latest US population blood lead levels and analyzed its trend.

Method

Blood lead levels in 63,890 participants of the National Health Nutrition and Examination Survey 1999–2014 were analyzed using SPSS Complex Samples v22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY).

Results

Mean blood lead levels and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 1.65 μg/dL (1.62–1.68), 1.44 μg/dL (1.42–1.47), 1.43 μg/dL (1.40–1.45), 1.29 μg/dL (1.27–1.32), 1.27 μg/dL (1.25–1.29), 1.12 μg/dL (1.10–1.14), 0.97 μg/dL (0.95–0.99), and 0.84 μg/dL (0.82–0.86) in 1999–2000, 2001–2002, 2003–2004, 2005–2006, 2007–2008, 2009–2010, 2011–2012, and 2013–2014, respectively. Blood lead levels decreased significantly (P < .001), and the trend remained significant when stratified by age, gender, ethnicity, and pregnancy status (P < .05). Estimated percentages of children with blood lead level ≥ 5 μg/dL were 9.9% (95% CI, 7.5–12.9), 7.4% (95% CI, 5.9–9.4), 5.3% (95% CI, 4.1–6.9), 2.9% (95% CI, 2.1–3.9), 3.1% (95% CI, 2.0–4.8), 2.1% (95% CI, 1.5–3.1), 2.0% (95% CI, 1.0–3.6), and 0.5% (95% CI, 0.3–1.0) in 1999–2000, 2001–2002, 2003–2004, 2005–2006, 2007–2008, 2009–2010, 2011–2012, and 2013–2014, respectively. The decreasing trend was significant (P < .05). In children aged 1 to 5 years in the National Health Nutrition and Examination Survey 2011–2014, the estimated 97.5 percentile of blood lead level was 3.48 μg/dL.

Conclusions

Blood lead levels have been decreasing in the US population. The reference level also should decrease. It is still important to monitor blood lead levels in the population, especially among pregnant women and children aged 1 to 5 years.

### Lead poisoning in children [^111FE8RD]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic lead poisoning has become more common in children. Blood lead levels of less than 5 µg per dL are associated with impairments in neurocognitive and behavioral development that are irreversible. Risk factors for lead poisoning include age younger than five years, low socioeconomic status, living in housing built before 1978, and use of imported food, medicines, and pottery. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released a recommendation in 2019 citing insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of universal screening for elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children and pregnant women. Local risk factors can be substantial, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that states and cities formulate their own targeted screening guidelines. In the absence of local guidance, the CDC recommends screening all Medicaid-eligible children at 12 months and again at 24 months, or at least once between 36 and 72 months if not previously screened. The CDC also recommends universal screening in areas where more than 27% of the housing was built before 1950, or where at least 12% of children 12 to 36 months of age have blood lead levels greater than 10 µg per dL. Life-threatening lead levels are treated with chelation therapy, and lower levels should prompt case management and environmental investigations to identify and remove the source of exposure. Primary prevention strategies are essential to eliminate the harmful effects of lead on child development.

### Contaminant metals as cardiovascular risk factors: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113VsYkh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Individual Biomonitoring

The blood lead reference value established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is the only biomonitoring guideline for public health and clinical action of any of the metals reviewed in this statement. Set to identify children with high levels of lead exposure, it was lowered from 5 to 3.5 μg/dL in 2022. The goal is to allow parents, doctors, public health officials, and communities to act earlier to reduce lead exposures. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have established 5 μg/dL as the reference level of lead exposure for adults. Although pediatricians routinely monitor blood lead levels in children in many states, no equivalent monitoring for lead or any other metal is established for adult patients. Potentially, it might be more relevant to measure bone lead, which is a better marker of cumulative lead exposure and more strongly associated with CVD in studies with those measures available. Although measuring bone lead is challenging and results in radiation exposure, surrogate blood‐based epigenetic markers of bone lead provide some promise.

A common question is whether measuring metals in blood, urine, or bone can help identify and protect people at risk of developing CVD. Lead, cadmium, and arsenic biomarkers are well established in research (Table 2), and some are used by public health (blood lead) and occupational agencies (blood lead, blood and urine cadmium, urine arsenic) for surveillance purposes. Whether this is an effective strategy to identify and protect people at risk of CVD is unknown at present but may become a recognized strategy in the future.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^113s4G4d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Medium credibility.

Blood lead screening and targeted risk assessment — CDC recommendations specify ages and high-risk follow-up: CDC recommends that locally developed targeted risk assessment and blood lead screening strategies be applied at ages 1 and 2 years, and children aged 36–72 months who have been identified as being at high risk and who have not been screened previously also should receive a blood lead test. For clinicians in areas that lack a state or local screening plan, CDC recommends that a blood lead test be performed on all children at ages 1 and 2 years and on children aged 36–72 months who have not been screened previously. Because exposures may change, two routine screenings are recommended (at approximately ages 1 and 2 years). Among children in Chicago at high risk with blood lead levels (BLLs) < 10 μg/dL at age 1 year, 21% had a BLL of ≥ 10 μg/dL when tested again at age ≥ 2 years. Certain local health departments recommend BLL testing starting at ages 6–9 months in high risk areas, testing every 6 months for children aged < 2 years, and additional education and more rapid follow-up testing for children aged < 12 months with BLLs 6–9 μg/dL.

### Update of the blood lead reference value-United States, 2021 [^112fh32B]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

The negative impact of lead exposure on young children and those who become pregnant is well documented but is not well known by those at highest risk from this hazard. Scientific evidence suggests that there is no known safe blood lead level (BLL), because even small amounts of lead can be harmful to a child's developing brain. In 2012, CDC introduced the population-based blood lead reference value (BLRV) to identify children exposed to more lead than most other children in the United States. The BLRV should be used as a guide to 1) help determine whether medical or environmental follow-up actions should be initiated for an individual child and 2) prioritize communities with the most need for primary prevention of exposure and evaluate the effectiveness of prevention efforts. The BLRV is based on the 97.5th percentile of the blood lead distribution in U.S. children aged 1–5 years from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. NHANES is a complex, multistage survey designed to provide a nationally representative assessment of health and nutritional status of the noninstitutionalized civilian adult and child populations in the United States. The initial BLRV of 5 μ g/dL, established in 2012, was based on data from the 2007–2008 and 2009–2010 NHANES cycles. Consistent with recommendations from a former advisory committee, this report updates CDC's BLRV in children to 3.5 μ g/dL using NHANES data derived from the 2015–2016 and 2017–2018 cycles and provides helpful information to support adoption by state and local health departments, health care providers (HCPs), clinical laboratories, and others and serves as an opportunity to advance health equity and environmental justice related to preventable lead exposure. CDC recommends that public health and clinical professionals focus screening efforts on populations at high risk based on age of housing and sociodemographic risk factors. Public health and clinical professionals should collaborate to develop screening plans responsive to local conditions using local data. In the absence of such plans, universal BLL testing is recommended. In addition, jurisdictions should follow the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services requirement that all Medicaid-enrolled children be tested at ages 12 and 24 months or at age 24–72 months if they have not previously been screened.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^112Jow2D]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Medium credibility.

Historic trends in children's blood lead levels (BLLs) — in U.S. children aged 1–5 years, BLLs have decreased substantially, with National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data showing the percentage with BLL ≥ 10 µg/dL declining from 88.2 in 1976–1980 to 4.4 in 1991–1994 and 1.6 in 1999–2002, while geometric mean BLL (µg/dL) fell from 15.0 to 2.7 and 1.9; however, many U.S. children continue to be exposed to lead, and because no safe BLL has been defined, small reductions in population-level exposure can be expected to reduce the number affected by adverse health outcomes.

Blood lead levels (BLLs) less than 1.21 µmol/L (< 25 µg/dL) among adults are considered acceptable by current national standards. Lead toxicity can lead to gouty arthritis (gout), but whether the low lead exposure in the contemporary general population confers risk for gout is not known.

Objective

To determine whether BLLs within the range currently considered acceptable are associated with gout.

Design

Population-based cross-sectional study.

Setting

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for 2005 through 2008.

Patients

6153 civilians aged 40 years or older with an estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 10 mL/min per 1.73 m2.

Measurements

Outcome variables were self-reported physician diagnosis of gout and serum urate level. Blood lead level was the principal exposure variable. Additional data collected were anthropometric measures, blood pressure, dietary purine intake, medication use, medical history, and serum creatinine concentration.

Results

The prevalence of gout was 6.05% (95% CI, 4.49% to 7.62%) among patients in the highest BLL quartile (mean, 0.19 µmol/L [3.95 µg/dL]) compared with 1.76% (CI, 1.10% to 2.42%) among those in the lowest quartile (mean, 0.04 µmol/L [0.89 µg/dL]). Each doubling of BLL was associated with an unadjusted odds ratio of 1.74 (CI, 1.47 to 2.05) for gout and 1.25 (CI, 1.12 to 1.40) for hyperuricemia. After adjustment for renal function, diabetes, diuretic use, hypertension, race, body mass index, income, and education level, the highest BLL quartile was associated with a 3.6-fold higher risk for gout and a 1.9-fold higher risk for hyperuricemia compared with the lowest quartile.

Limitation

Blood lead level does not necessarily reflect the total body lead burden.

Conclusion

Blood lead levels in the range currently considered acceptable are associated with increased prevalence of gout and hyperuricemia.

### Update of the blood lead reference value-United States, 2021 [^114eyPSe]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods, Rationale, and Evidence

CDC has been involved in defining the criteria for interpreting BLLs in children since 1971 (Table 1). The criteria for interpreting BLLs in children was revised over time based on new clinical and scientific evidence and improved laboratory technologies.

TABLE 1
Definitions for interpreting children's blood lead levels — United States, 1960–2021

Abbreviation: NA = not available.

*

In 2012, CDC's former Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention (ACCLPP) recommended the establishment of the BLRV and proposed it be set at 5 μ g/dL. This recommendation was based on the weight of evidence indicating that the adverse health effects of BLLs < 10 μ g/dL in children included neurologic, cardiovascular, immunologic, and endocrine effects. ACCLPP further recommended that the BLRV be updated every 4 years based on the 97.5th percentile of BLLs for children aged 1–5 years across the two most recent combined NHANES cycles for which data are available.

The Lead Exposure and Prevention Advisory Committee (LEPAC) was established under the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016. * The LEPAC is charged with providing advice and guidance to the Secretary of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Director of CDC, and Administrator of Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry on matters related to lead poisoning prevention and surveillance. In 2020, LEPAC charged a BLRV workgroup with providing advice and guidance regarding new scientific knowledge and technological developments to guide the BLRV. During a May 2021 meeting of the LEPAC, the workgroup recommended that the BLRV be updated from 5 μ g/dL to 3.5 μ g/dL using data derived from the two most recent NHANES cycles (2015–2016 and 2017–2018), and the LEPAC voted unanimously to accept this recommendation. Subsequently, the committee submitted a formal recommendation to the HHS Secretary to update the BLRV from 5 μ g/dL to 3.5 μ g/dL. LEPAC's BLRV workgroup also advised that CDC address barriers and capacity issues for federal agencies and other partners to facilitate adopting the revised BLRV. This will include providing training and outreach to public health professionals. The HHS Secretary and CDC concur with the recommendation and have developed communication and implementation plans to announce and promote the BLRV update, including to those at greatest risk.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^112cQhxh]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Medium credibility.

Summary of recommendations — For government agencies, increase efforts to resolve lead-based paint hazards safely before children are exposed, and expand services that promote lead poisoning primary prevention and develop systems that enable clinicians and parents to learn about such services. Develop and implement strategies to encourage the safe elimination of lead hazards in properties using trained workers and lead-safe work practices, in compliance with federal, state, and local regulations, and establish jurisdictional policies that mandate ensuring lead safety in housing and enforce these mandates. Develop and apply systematic approaches to prevent exposures to even small amounts of lead in food or consumer products, particularly when safer alternatives are available. Promote implementation of state and local primary prevention plans that target areas, populations, and activities of highest risk; foster political will; expand resources for housing remediation; identify and correct lead hazards; and establish a regulatory infrastructure.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^113zrj39]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Medium credibility.

Children's blood lead level (BLL) patterns — Lead is distributed unevenly in the human body; in children, approximately 70% is stored in the bone compartment, and the residence time of lead in bone can be decades; measurements of lead in bone using X-ray fluorescence instruments are available for research purposes only. A newborn infant's BLL closely reflects that of the mother, and during 1999–2002 the geometric mean BLL for U.S. women aged 20–59 years was 1.2 µg/dL, with 0.3% having a BLL ≥ 10 µg/dL. Longitudinal studies of lead-exposed children confirm an increase in BLLs beginning in late infancy with a peak at age 18–36 months, but no studies have examined blood lead patterns specifically for children with peak levels < 10 µg/dL. In a cohort of children born during 1994–1995 in which > 50% had peak BLLs < 10 µg/dL, mean BLLs were 3.4 µg/dL at age 6 months, 7.9 µg/dL at age 24 months, and 5.8 µg/dL at age 61 months; in a Boston 1979–1981 cohort, mean BLLs were 7.2 µg/dL at birth, 6.2 µg/dL at age 6 months, 6.8 µg/dL at age 24 months, and 6.4 µg/dL at age 57 months. In both studies, higher levels of lead in home environmental samples were associated directly with higher BLLs in children, and one case-control study demonstrated an association between the occurrence of home renovation and increased BLLs; blood lead patterns for individual children with BLLs < 10 µg/dL vary depending on environmental exposures, and laboratory uncertainty might interfere with a clinician's ability to detect patterns for individual children.

Childhood lead poisoning is still an enormous public health issue in the United States, affecting thousands of children and their families. New evidence suggests that even very low blood lead levels, less than 10 microg/dL, can be associated with neurologic injury. This article discusses characteristics of children at high risk for lead poisoning, unusual sources of lead contamination, and new aspects of lead's pathophysiology. It includes current thinking on the clinical management and prevention of childhood lead poisoning.

### Update of the blood lead reference value-United States, 2021 [^114yiFqy]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The geometric mean BLL in U.S. children aged 1–5 years has declined over time from 15.2 μ g/dL in 1976–1980 to 0.83 μ g/dL in 2011–2016 (Table 2). During the same period among U.S. children aged 6–11 years, the geometric mean BLL declined from 12.7 μ g/dL to 0.6 μ g/dL. Despite this overall declining trend in geometric mean BLLs in U.S. children aged 1–5 years, certain children remain at substantial risk for exposure to lead and disproportionately experience negative health consequences. Their ongoing lead exposure reflects persistent structural inequities in the built environment and access to health care. In addition, the pernicious and irreversible effects of lead exposures perpetuate ongoing structural inequities and injustices. Thus, lead exposure can be considered both a result and cause of health inequity and environmental injustice.

Sources and variability of lead exposure — age-related kinetics and absorption modifiers show early-life vulnerability. "Blood lead concentrations of children who live in lead-contaminated environments typically increase rapidly between 6 and 12 months of age, peak between 18 and 36 months of age, and then gradually decrease". "Younger children also absorb lead more efficiently than older children and adults". "Iron deficiency can also increase the absorption of lead".

### Screening for elevated lead levels in childhood and pregnancy: an updated summary of evidence for the US preventive services task force [^115SV9Bn]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In 1996, the US Preventive Services Task Force provided recommendations for routine screening of asymptomatic children and pregnant women for elevated blood lead levels. This review updates the evidence for the benefits and harms of screening and intervention for elevated blood lead in asymptomatic children and pregnant women.

Methods

We searched Medline, reference lists of review articles, and tables of contents of leading pediatric journals for studies published in 1995 or later that contained new information about the prevalence, diagnosis, natural course, or treatment of elevated lead levels in asymptomatic children aged 1 to 5 years and pregnant women.

Results

The prevalence of elevated blood lead levels among children and women in the United States, like that in the general population, continues to decline sharply, primarily because of marked reductions in environmental exposure, but still varies substantially among different communities and populations. Similar to the findings in 1996, our searches did not identify direct evidence from controlled studies that screening children for elevated blood lead levels results in improved health outcomes, and there was no direct evidence identified from controlled studies that screening improves pregnancy or perinatal outcomes. No new relevant information regarding the accuracy of screening for lead toxicity was identified during the update, and we did not identify evidence that demonstrates that universal screening for blood lead results in better clinical outcomes than targeted screening. Substantial new relevant information regarding the adverse effects of screening and interventions was not identified.

Conclusions

There is no persuasive evidence that screening for elevated lead levels in asymptomatic children will improve clinical outcomes. For those children who are screened and found to have elevated levels, there is conflicting evidence demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of early detection and intervention.

### Public and occupational health risks related to lead exposure updated according to present-day blood lead levels [^112bB6DX]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The GBD investigators listed among the possible limitations of their results (i) residual confounding; (ii) uncertainty as to the extent to which effect sizes were generalizable; and (iii) the impossibility of accounting for temporal changes in the exposure to risk factors. Thus, the GBD statistics fell short in accounting for the steady global decline in environmental lead exposure. This might explain why globally, despite declining environmental exposure, environmental lead exposure increased from risk factor rank 30 in 1990 to rank 25 in 2010. Furthermore, the issue of residual confounding requires calculating PAF for clusters of risk factors, rather than for a single risk indicator. Indeed, cardiovascular risk factors and exposures to various environmental pollutants cluster within individuals, such as poverty, unhealthy lifestyle habits, poor housing conditions, and lead exposure in the NHANES surveys. The GBD estimates did not account for coexposures to risk factors and environmental pollutants. According to WHO demographic data, in 2010, the population of the United States (309 million) represented approximately 4.5% of the world's population (6.9 billion). Interestingly, if the statistics of the GBD 2012 report are truly generalizable (PAF, 0.67 deaths worldwide), preventable deaths related to environmental lead exposure in the United States would amount to approximately 30,150 per year, an estimate more than 10-fold smaller than that proposed in the NHANES III report.

### Blood lead level guidance… [^114F3Enq]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

10 µg/dL
- Below 10µg/dL, the NTP concluded lead increases blood pressure, the risk of hypertension, and the incidence of essential tremor.
- ACOEM and CDPH recommend repeat BLL tests every two months if a person's BLL results are between 10 to 19 µg/dL. 20 µg/dL
- ACOEM and CDPH recommend medical removal if a worker has two consecutive BLLs between 20–29 µg/dL.
- The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists guideline states that the typical worker can experience a BLL of 20 µg/dL without adverse health effect. This guideline is intended for use in the practice of industrial hygiene, but others may wish to use these guidelines as supplements to occupational safety and health programs. 25 µg/dL
- ACOEM and CDPH recommend medical removal if a worker has two consecutive BLLs between 20–29 µg/dL.
- The Occupational Safety and Health Administration considers a BLL of 25 µg/dL as serious and must be handled by inspection.

This determination was based on OSHA's National Emphasis Program for Lead, which was released to protect the health and safety of workers in industries determined to pose a higher risk to people and the environment. 30 µg/dL
- MIOSHA requires medical removal at 30 µg/dL.
- The Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics, ACOEM, and CDPH recommend that workers be medically removed from work with lead exposure if one BLL exceeds 30 µg/dL.
- ACOEM, CDPH, and MIOSHA have issued more stringent and health protective limits than other federal and state-based regulatory groups. 40 µg/dL
- If an employee has been medically removed from work based on a previously high BLL, OSHA permits the employee to return to work once 2 consecutive BLLs are measured below 40 µg/dL. 50–60 µg/dL.
- At a BLL of 50–60 µg/dL, OSHA requires medical removal.
- The employer must remove any employees exposed to lead in the workplace if their BLL is 50 µg/dL or more for workers in construction, or 60 µg/dL or more for workers in general industry.

### Very high blood lead levels among adults-United States, 2002–2011 [^114njyzZ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Very high BLLs continue to be documented in adults in the United States. Actions that might decrease the number of adults with harmful BLLs include 1) increased employer efforts to reduce work-related lead exposure and to comply with current guidance for testing and managing lead-exposed workers; 2) adherence by lead-exposed workers to safe work practices, such as properly using personal protective equipment, washing before eating, and showering and changing clothes before going home; 3) education of the medical community to use current guidelines and recommendations for management of lead-exposed adults with BLLs ≥ 10 μ g/dL; and 4) increased involvement of the public health community to prevent nonoccupational lead exposures.

### Interpretation of population health metrics: environmental lead exposure as exemplary case [^113YcTWJ]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The Population-Attributable Risk Fraction

To address the anticipated criticism that NHANES III blood lead levels by far exceeded those associated with contemporary environmental lead exposure, the primary analysis of the 10-year follow-up (Table 1)excluded participants with blood leads of 10 µg/dL or higher and a sensitivity analysis of the 20-year follow-up (Table 2)only included individuals with a blood lead concentration of < 5 µg/dL.

Table 1.
Mortality in 13 946 NHANES III Participants Followed Up Until December 31, 2000

Table 2.
Mortality in 14 289 NHANES III Participants Followed Up Until December 31, 2011

PAF was calculated as the proportional decline in mortality that would occur if the blood lead concentrations of all participants would be reduced to a reference level of 1.0 µg/dL. The lower the desired null-effect blood lead concentration, the higher the relative risks and PAF must be. Obtaining a blood lead level < 1.0 µg/dL in all Americans is an illusionary goal. Thus, the reported PAF of 18%is irrelevant for public health policies.

### Adult blood lead epidemiology and surveillance – United States, 2008–2009 [^113dhuAV]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

Lead exposure can result in acute or chronic adverse effects in multiple organ systems, ranging from subclinical changes in function to symptomatic, life-threatening toxicity. Despite improvements in public health policies and substantial reductions in blood lead levels (BLLs) in adults, lead exposure remains an important health problem worldwide. Approximately 95% of all elevated BLLs reported among adults in the United States are work-related, and recent research has raised concerns regarding the toxicity of BLLs as low as 5 μg/dL. CDC's state-based Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) program tracks laboratory-reported elevated BLLs. To update rate trends and identify industry subsectors and nonoccupational activities with high lead exposures, CDC collected and analyzed 2008–2009 data from 40 state ABLES programs. The results of that analysis indicated that a decline in the prevalence of elevated BLLs (≥ 25 μg/dL) was extended, from 14.0 per 100,000 employed adults in 1994 to 6.3 in 2009. Industry subsectors with the highest numbers of lead-exposed workers were battery manufacturing, secondary smelting and refining of nonferrous metals, and painting and paper hanging. The most common nonoccupational exposures to lead were shooting firearms; remodeling, renovating, or painting; retained bullets (gunshot wounds); and lead casting. The findings underscore the need for government agencies, employers, public health professionals, health-care providers, and worker-affiliated organizations to increase interventions to prevent workplace lead exposure, and the importance of conducting lead exposure surveillance to assess the effectiveness of these interventions.

### Effects of blood lead levels [^113uVcsC]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Lead exposures among school-age children are a major public health issue. Although the harmful effects of lead exposure during the first years of life are well known, there is not as much understanding of the effects of low levels of lead exposure during later childhood.

Objectives

To review the effects of blood lead levels (BLLs) < 10 µg/dL in school-age children and adolescents.

Data Sources

We searched Medline, Embase, Global health, CINAHL, Scopus, and Environmental Science Collection databases between January 1, 2000, and May 11, 2023.

Study Selection

We included peer-reviewed English-language articles that presented data on the effects of BLLs < 10 µg/dL in individuals ages 5 through 18 years.

Data Extraction

Data on country, population, analytic design, sample size, age, BLLs, outcomes, covariates, and results were extracted.

Results

Overall, 115 of 3180 screened articles met the inclusion criteria. The reported mean or median BLL was < 5 µg/dL in 98 articles (85%). Of the included articles, 89 (77%) presented some evidence of an association between BLLs < 10 µg/dL during school age and detrimental outcomes in a wide range of categories. The strongest evidence of an association was for the outcomes of intelligence quotient and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnoses or behaviors.

Limitations

Few articles controlled for BLLs at age < 5 years, limiting conclusions about the relation between later BLLs and outcomes.

Conclusions

BLLs < 10 µg/dL in school-age children and adolescents may be associated with negative outcomes. This review highlights areas that could benefit from additional investigation.

### Prevention of childhood lead toxicity [^111EQWrj]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

United States prevalence and risk context — preventing childhood lead toxicity — states it remains a major public health priority, with NHANES 2007–2010 estimating approximately 2.6% of preschool children had a blood lead concentration ≥ 5 μg/dL (≥ 50 ppb), representing about 535 000 US children 1 to 5 years of age, and many children living in older, poorly maintained or renovated housing are at high risk for lead exposure.

### Interpretation of population health metrics: environmental lead exposure as exemplary case [^114jN4Ws]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Outdated Level of Environmental Lead Exposure

In calculating PAF, Lanphear et altook into account the hazard ratio estimates over the whole distribution of blood lead, ranging from the imputed level of 0.7 μg/dL in 1150 participants (8.0%) up to 56.0 μg/dL. The blood lead concentration was 5 µg/dL or higher in 3632 participants (25.4%; misreported as 20.0%). In analyses of 12 725 NHANES IV participants examined from 2003 until 2010, the geometric mean blood concentration in all participants was 1.41 µg/dL with lower levels in women than in men (1.25 versus 1.80 µg/dL) and in whites compared with blacks and Hispanics (1.46 versus 1.57 µg/dL). All blood lead levels were below 30 µg/dL. Thus, the associations of mortality with blood lead in NHANES III are no longer representative for current exposure of the adult population in the United States. The same applies to reports associating death with blood lead in earlier NHANES surveys.

Lead is a cumulative toxicant, which is for 90% to 95% stored in bone, from where it is recirculated with a half-life of 20 to 25 years. Blood lead, for 99% carried by red blood cells, reflects recent exposure over the past 1 to 2 months and the amount of lead released and recirculated from bone. Both bone, and blood, lead increase with advancing age. Bone lead correlates with blood lead, and explains around 20% of the variance in blood lead, depending on seasonalityand hormonal and other endogenous and environmental stimuli influencing the balance between bone formation and resorption. Recirculation of lead from bone explains why there is a lag time when environmentalor occupationallead exposure drops. These lead toxicokinetics are relevant to the mortality results of the HNANES III cohort studies. – Indeed, the blood lead concentrations measured at the baseline examination – did not so much reflect environmental lead exposure from 1988 until 1994, but with older baseline age of NHANES III participants, they were increasingly representative for the preexisting body burden originating from the historical environmental lead contamination. In the United States, lead-containing paint was effectively banned in 1976, and leaded gasoline was completely phased out only in 1995.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^115BvQVX]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Medium credibility.

Blood lead level (BLL) testing accuracy and specimen collection — Federal regulations allow laboratories that perform blood lead testing to operate with a total allowable error of ± 4 µg/dL or ± 10%, whichever is greater, so at BLLs ≤ 10 µg/dL a laboratory might operate within an error range of 8 µg/dL and still meet federal proficiency standards; for example, an actual value of 7 µg/dL could be reported as 3 µg/dL to 11 µg/dL and remain within the allowable error limit. Duplicate testing of identical samples with a mean blood lead value < 10 µg/dL at eight laboratories reported all results as < 10 µg/dL and within 3 µg/dL of the overall mean, and a 2006 study indicated the majority of laboratories can achieve routine performance of ± 2 µg/dL at concentrations of ≤ 10 µg/dL without difficulty. Collection of capillary blood from a fingerstick into a lead-free collection device is an accepted method for obtaining a screening test, but because capillary and venous values can differ in the same person, elevated capillary results should be confirmed with blood drawn by venipuncture; multiple studies have reported uncertainty at thresholds of 10 µg/dL or 15 µg/dL, and none has examined the sensitivity or specificity of capillary methods at thresholds < 10 µg/dL.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^1114a4W9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Medium credibility.

Association of blood lead level (BLL) patterns with developmental outcomes — across measurement approaches — indicates that although BLLs peak in early childhood, negative effects are associated with lead exposure at any age, that statistically significant associations have been identified between average BLLs over a specific period (e.g., 0–5 years) and adverse outcomes, and that concurrent BLLs might demonstrate stronger associations with neurodevelopmental abilities than other measures; in a chelation trial analysis, BLLs measured concurrently with developmental testing were associated more closely with cognitive abilities than a peak level at approximately age 2 years, with stronger associations when children were tested at age 7 years than at age 5 years; and a child's blood lead measurement is estimated to account for 2%–4% of variance in neurodevelopment measures (approximately 4%–8% of the explained variance), while the child's family and personal psychosocial experiences account for a greater proportion than BLLs < 10 μg/dL.

### Screening for elevated blood lead levels in childhood and pregnancy: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^112WCGoD]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Elevated blood lead level is associated with serious, often irreversible, health consequences.

Objective

To synthesize evidence on the effects of screening, testing, and treatment for elevated blood lead level in pregnant women and children aged 5 years and younger in the primary care setting to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

Cochrane CENTRAL and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through June 2018) and Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to June 2018); surveillance through December 5, 2018.

Study Selection

English-language trials and observational studies of screening for and treating elevated lead levels in asymptomatic children and pregnant women.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction by 2 reviewers using predefined criteria.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Elevated blood lead level, morbidity, mortality, clinical prediction tools, test accuracy, adverse events.

Results

A total of 24 studies (N = 11 433) were included in this review. No studies evaluated the benefits or harms of screening vs no screening in children. More than 1 positive answer on the 5-item 1991 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) screening questionnaire was associated with a pooled sensitivity of 48% (95% CI, 31.4% to 65.6%) and specificity of 58% (95% CI, 39.9% to 74.0%) for identifying children with a venous blood lead level greater than 10 μg/dL (5 studies [n = 2265]). Adapted versions of the CDC questionnaire did not demonstrate improved accuracy. Capillary blood lead testing demonstrated sensitivity of 87% to 91% and specificity greater than 90%, compared with venous measurement (4 studies [n = 1431]). Counseling and nutritional interventions or residential lead hazard control techniques did not reduce blood lead concentrations in asymptomatic children, but studies were few and had methodological limitations (7 studies [n = 1419]). One trial (n = 780) of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) chelation therapy found reduced blood lead levels in children at 1 week to 1 year but not at 4.5 to 6 years, while another trial (n = 39) found no effect at 1 and 6 months. Seven-year follow-up assessments showed no effect on neuropsychological development, a small deficit in linear growth (height difference, 1.17 cm [95% CI, 0.41 to 1.93]), and poorer cognitive outcomes reported as the Attention and Executive Functions subscore of the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment (unadjusted difference, -1.8 [95% CI, -4.5 to 1.0]; adjusted P = 0.045) in children treated with DMSA chelation. Evidence was too limited to determine the accuracy of screening questionnaires or benefits and harms of treatment in pregnant women.

Conclusions and Relevance

Screening questionnaires were not accurate for identifying children with elevated blood lead levels. Chelating agents in children were not significantly associated with sustained effects on blood level levels but were associated with harms.

Case management reference value — threshold and reassessment cycle: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is adopting the current reference value of ≥ 5 μg/dL (≥ 50 ppb) for case management. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that the 97.5th percentile of blood lead concentrations from the 2 most recent NHANES cycles be used to identify children with unacceptably high exposure and to set public health goals, and the CDC will reconsider the reference value every 4 years.

### Blood lead levels in children aged 1–5 years-United States, 1999–2010 [^1161RTFB]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

The adverse health effects of lead exposure in children are well described and include intellectual and behavioral deficits, making lead exposure an important public health problem. No safe blood lead level (BLL) in children has been identified. To estimate the number of children aged 1–5 years in the United States at risk for adverse health effects from lead exposure and to assess the impact of prevention efforts, CDC analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from the periods 1999–2002 to 2007–2010. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that the percentage of children aged 1–5 years with BLLs at or above the upper reference interval value of 5 µg/dL calculated using the 2007–2010 NHANES cycle was 2.6%. Thus, an estimated 535,000 U.S. children aged 1–5 years had BLLs ≥ 5 µg/dL based on the U.S. Census Bureau 2010 count of the number of children in this age group. Despite progress in reducing BLLs among children in this age group overall, differences between the mean BLLs of different racial/ethnic and income groups persist, and work remains to be done to reach the Healthy People 2020 objective of reducing mean BLLs for all children in the United States (EH-8.2).

### Lead toxicity and genetics in flint, MI [^111cYAxj]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

It has been well established that lead poisoning, as defined by the CDC as blood lead levels (BLLs) at or above 5 μg/dl, can lead to long-term neurotoxic effects in children and requires immediate treatment. As such, the CDC has long recommended clinicians' assess to all patients for lead exposure and test BLLs for all at-risk patients. Furthermore, it is increasingly recognised that there is no safe level of lead for children due to the irreversible lifelong detrimental effects of lead exposure. Since the disaster of lead contaminated drinking water in Flint, MI has been uncovered, action has been taken to test children for lead poisoning. However, when children are tested and results show that lead levels are below the 5 μg/dl criteria no further follow-up is conducted with these children, as they are deemed 'healthy'. This practice is problematic, given that other studies have shown that blood lead levels, even at rates lower than the poison range can be detrimental to a child's health. The estimated population of Flint is ~99,002, with about 27% of the residents categorised as children under the age of 18 years. Therefore, more than ~26,730 children, of whom 60% are African Americans (N = 16,038), have been exposed to environmental lead in the drinking water.

### Does information on blood heavy metals improve cardiovascular mortality prediction? [^112iX6C8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The use of multiple predictors of exposure to blood lead, cadmium, and mercury improves risk prediction performance for death from cardiovascular causes over the established risk factors. Our results require confirmations in other longitudinal cohort studies with incident events, but have important public health implications, given the high burden of CVD morbidity and mortality. These findings highlight a potential utility of blood markers of toxic metals for CVD risk assessment, prevention, and precision health.

CDC would like to reiterate the key message from the 2004 article that because no threshold for adverse health effects in young children has been demonstrated, all sources of lead exposure for children should be controlled or eliminated.

Lead concentrations in drinking water should be below the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's action level of 15 parts per billion. Read more about lead in drinking water.

Blood lead levels (BLL) in children — Lead has been associated with numerous adverse health effects in humans, and in children, even BLLs < 10 μg/dL can result in decreased cognitive function, developmental delays, and behavior problems; these adverse effects reinforce the importance of screening and continued measures to eliminate or control lead sources in children's environments.

### Prevention of childhood lead toxicity [^112nY6tC]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Prevention of childhood lead toxicity — housing age correlates with elevated blood lead prevalence and supports a primary prevention strategy. Among US children, "15% of US children who lived in housing units built before 1950 had a blood lead concentration ≥ 5 μg/dL (≥ 50 ppb), whereas 4.2% of children who lived in housing built between 1950 and 1978 had a blood lead concentration ≥ 5 μg/dL (≥ 50 ppb), compared with 2.1% of children who lived in housing units built after 1978". "No treatments have been shown to be effective in ameliorating the permanent developmental effects of lead toxicity". The economic burden is high: "it has been estimated that the annual cost of childhood lead exposure in the United States is $50 billion" and "For every $1 invested to reduce lead hazards in housing units, society would benefit by an estimated $17 to $221". Consistent with this, "The key to preventing lead toxicity in children is identification and elimination of the major sources of lead exposure" and "Primary prevention of lead exposure is now widely recognized as the optimal strategy because of the irreversible effects of low-level lead toxicity".

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^117By65d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Medium credibility.

Personal lead risk assessment questionnaires — diagnostic performance and limitations: The effectiveness of personal risk assessment questionnaires in identifying children with elevated BLLs has been documented, but no studies have evaluated the performance of these questionnaires at cut-off levels < 10 μg/dL or their effectiveness in directing counseling or in identifying lead hazards in the home. In clinical settings, the sensitivity of such questionnaires to identify children with BLLs ≥ 10 μg/dL varies considerably by population, and in certain studies the sensitivity improved if higher cut-off levels were used or if the questions were developed specifically for the population tested. In general, to identify approximately 80% of children with BLLs ≥ 10 μg/dL, a blood test had to be performed for more than half of those children whose risk factors for lead exposure were assessed using a questionnaire. Multiple studies in populations with low or high prevalence for elevated BLLs concluded that risk assessment questionnaires were not effective tools in their clinical assessment.

### Prevention of childhood lead toxicity [^1141U8Kb]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Testing asymptomatic children — screening tools and targeted criteria: Screening questionnaires frequently used in primary care fail to identify children with elevated blood lead concentrations, but they may be useful to identify lead hazards in children who have a blood lead concentration ≥ 5 μg/dL (≥ 50 ppb). In 1991, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended universal blood lead testing for all children; in 2005 the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended that states and cities formulate their own screening recommendations on the basis of local data. The AAP, consistent with the CDC, recommended universal screening if communities had more than 27% of housing built before 1950 or a prevalence of blood lead concentrations ≥ 10 μg/dL in children 12 to 36 months old of 12% or greater. Screening is not efficient after 36 months of age unless specific high-risk factors are identified, and the likelihood of a child having a blood lead concentration > 10 μg/dL after 36 months of age is low. A detailed evaluation and follow-up of children who have blood lead concentrations < 10 μg/dL (< 100 ppb) is now indicated.

### Update of the blood lead reference value-United States, 2021 [^112ctxpd]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

As population BLLs decrease, along with overt clinical signs of lead exposure, laboratory testing has become paramount in detection and subsequent management of lead exposures. Thus, laboratories play an essential role in the overall public health response to lead exposure. A BLRV of 3.5 μ g/dL creates challenges as well as opportunities for state, local, and private laboratories that perform BLL testing. Some laboratories might need to reduce their reporting limit policies, adopt new repeat testing practices, improve limits of detection of laboratory developed tests, acquire new instrumentation, and validate updated or new laboratory-developed tests. Measures are also needed to eliminate lead contamination in laboratory consumables and processes and might increase workloads because of additional repeat and confirmatory testing. For example, skin prick tests can often be contaminated with environmental sources of lead, so collecting blood from the vein is less likely to have this contamination. Reducing the BLRV might strengthen considerations to tighten the federal proficiency testing criteria for acceptable blood lead testing performance from ± 4 μ g/dL or ± 10%, whichever is greater, to something tighter. Optimizing laboratory practices to meet the more stringent proficiency testing criteria might also be needed. Laboratory methods are sufficiently precise to measure BLLs at 3.5 μ g/dL.

### Screening for elevated blood lead levels in children and pregnant women: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117X5UnQ]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Elevated blood lead levels in children are associated with neurologic effects such as behavioral and learning problems, lower IQ, hyperactivity, hearing problems, and impaired growth. In pregnant women, lead exposure can impair organ systems such as the hematopoietic, hepatic, renal, and nervous systems, and increase the risk of preeclampsia and adverse perinatal outcomes. Many of the adverse health effects of lead exposure are irreversible.

Objective

To update the 2006 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for elevated blood lead levels in children and pregnant women.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of elevated blood lead levels. In this update, an elevated blood lead level was defined according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reference level of 5 μg/dL.

Findings

The USPSTF found adequate evidence that questionnaires and other clinical prediction tools to identify asymptomatic children with elevated blood lead levels are inaccurate. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that capillary blood testing accurately identifies children with elevated blood lead levels. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of treatment of elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children 5 years and younger and in pregnant women. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence regarding the accuracy of questionnaires and other clinical prediction tools to identify asymptomatic pregnant women with elevated blood lead levels. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening for or treatment of elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children and pregnant women. The USPSTF concluded that the current evidence is insufficient, and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children 5 years and younger and in pregnant women cannot be determined.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic pregnant persons.

Mortality in relation to blood lead in NHANES III

The cross-sectional NHANES III survey (1988–1994) involved the collection of clinical variables, questionnaire data and biochemical measurements, including blood lead, among a representative sample of the adult population of the United States. Blood lead was measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The detection limit was 1.0 µg/dl. For participants (8%) with blood lead levels below the detection limit, a level of 0.7 µg/dl was imputed. These NHANES III baseline data were linked with the National Death Index, and probabilistic matching was used based on 12 identifiers for each participant to ascertain vital status and the cause of death. The follow-up period was the time between the baseline examination date and the date of death or the participant's 90th birthday, whichever came first. In the most recent NHANES III report, which will be discussed in detail, the censoring date was 31 December 2011.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^116NWrs2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Medium credibility.

Decline of elevated blood lead level (BLL) and seasonal variability — Once a high BLL has been established in a child, the time required for the BLL to decline to < 10 µg/dL can range from months to years; for a group of children starting at a BLL of 10–14 µg/dL and receiving case management services, the mean time required for 50% to achieve a BLL < 10 µg/dL was 9 months, while how much time is needed for BLLs < 10 µg/dL to decline in response to interventions is unknown. Multiple studies have confirmed that blood lead measurements vary seasonally, with a Boston study reporting BLLs highest in late June and lowest in March and a Milwaukee study indicating BLLs were higher in the summer than in the winter; some of the variability (higher blood lead in summer) might result from increased exposure to lead in dust and soil in summer.

### Interpretation of population health metrics: environmental lead exposure as exemplary case [^1164W1vP]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Our objective was to gain insight in the calculation and interpretation of population health metrics that inform disease prevention. Using as model environmental exposure to lead (ELE), a global pollutant, we assessed population health metrics derived from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988 to 1994), the GBD (Global Burden of Disease Study 2010), and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the hazard ratio relating mortality over 19.3 years of follow-up to a blood lead increase at baseline from 1.0 to 6.7 µg/dL (10th-90th percentile interval) was 1.37 (95% CI, 1.17–1.60). The population-attributable fraction of blood lead was 18.0% (10.9%-26.1%). The number of preventable ELE-related deaths in the United States would be 412 000 per year (250 000–598 000). In GBD 2010, deaths and disability-adjusted life-years globally lost due to ELE were 0.67 million (0.58–0.78 million) and 0.56% (0.47%-0.66%), respectively. According to the 2017 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development statistics, ELE-related welfare costs were $1 676 224 million worldwide. Extrapolations from the foregoing metrics assumed causality and reversibility of the association between mortality and blood lead, which at present-day ELE levels in developed nations is not established. Other issues limiting the interpretation of ELE-related population health metrics are the inflation of relative risk based on outdated blood lead levels, not differentiating relative from absolute risk, clustering of risk factors and exposures within individuals, residual confounding, and disregarding noncardiovascular disease and immigration in national ELE-associated welfare estimates. In conclusion, this review highlights the importance of critical thinking in translating population health metrics into cost-effective preventive strategies.

### Blood lead levels in children aged 1–5 years-United States, 1999–2010 [^116LM2He]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Editorial Note

Substantial progress has been made over the past four decades in reducing the number of children with elevated BLLs. Data from the 1976–1980 cycle of NHANES indicated that an estimated 88% of children aged 1–5 years had BLLs ≥ 10 μ g/dL. Since then, the percentage has fallen sharply, to 4.4% during 1991–1994 (NHANES III), to 1.6% during 1999–2002, and to 0.8% during 2007–2010. National estimates of the GM BLL for children aged 1–5 years declined significantly over time, from a 1976–1980 estimated GM BLL of 15 μ g/dL (CI = 14.2–15.8) to a 1988–1991 estimated GM BLL 3.6 μ g/dL (CI = 3.3–4.0), and this trend continues. During 1999–2002, the GM BLL was 1.9 μ g/dL (CI = 1.8–2.1), compared with the 2007–2010 estimated GM BLL of 1.3 μ g/dL (CI = 1.3–1.4). *

What is already known on this topic?

Elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) in children cause learning and behavioral deficits. No threshold for these effects has been identified. In January 2012, CDC's Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning recommended that BLLs in children be kept below 5 μ g/dL.

What is added by this report?

The percentage of children aged 1–5 years with BLLs ≥ 5 μ g/dL from the 2007–2010 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey cycle was 2.6%, indicating an estimated 535,000 U.S. children aged 1–5 years with BLLs ≥ 5 μ g/dL. Despite progress in reducing BLLs among children in this age group overall, long-standing disparities persist. The geometric mean BLLs (GM BLLs) among younger children, those belonging to poor families, and those enrolled in Medicaid were significantly higher compared with their older, more affluent counterparts, while the GM BLL for non-Hispanic black children was significantly higher compared with either non-Hispanic white or Mexican American children.

### Lead [^114aJAEr]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Children differ from adults in the relative importance of lead sources and pathways, lead metabolism, and the toxicities expressed. The central nervous system effects of lead on children seem not to be reversible. Periods of enhanced vulnerability within childhood have not consistently been identified. The period of greatest vulnerability might be endpoint specific, perhaps accounting for the failure to identify a coherent "behavioral signature" for lead toxicity. The bases for the substantial individual variability in vulnerability to lead are uncertain, although they might include genetic polymorphisms and contextual factors. The current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention screening guideline of 10 micro g/dL is a risk management tool and should not be interpreted as a threshold for toxicity. No threshold has been identified, and some data are consistent with effects well below 10. Historically, most studies have concentrated on neurocognitive effects of lead, but higher exposures have recently been associated with morbidities such as antisocial behavior and delinquency. Studies of lead toxicity in experimental animal models are critical to the interpretation of nonexperimental human studies, particularly in addressing the likelihood that associations observed in the latter studies can be attributed to residual confounding. Animal models are also helpful in investigating the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms of the functional deficits observed in lead-exposed humans. Studies of adults who have been exposed to lead are of limited use in understanding childhood lead toxicity because developmental and acquired lead exposure differ in terms of the maturity of the organs affected, the presumed mechanisms of toxicity, and the forms in which toxicities are expressed.

### Blood lead levels in children aged 1–5 years-United States, 1999–2010 [^111SjVej]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

What are the implications for public health practice?

The greatest reductions in the proportion of children with elevated BLLs have been made over the past four decades in those racial/ethnic and income groups that had the highest BLLs. Persistent differences between the mean BLLs of different racial/ethnic and income groups can be traced to differences in housing quality, environmental conditions, nutrition, and other factors. Resources should be targeted to areas and communities where children are most at risk to achieve the Healthy People 2020 objective of reducing mean BLLs for all children in the United States (EH 8.2).

The greatest reductions have occurred among children in racial/ethnic and income groups that historically were most likely to have BLLs ≥ 10 μ g/dL. These reductions reflect the impact of strategies coordinated and implemented at national, state, and local levels. They include elimination of lead in vehicle emissions, elimination of lead paint hazards in housing, reduction in lead concentrations in air, water, and consumer products marketed to children, and identification and increased screening of populations at high risk. However, the small numbers of NHANES participants with BLLs ≥ 10 μ g/dL means that national estimates of the prevalence of BLLs this high are unstable, and year-to-year changes in prevalence are difficult to interpret. In the 2007–2008 and 2009–2010 NHANES cycles, nine and six survey participants, respectively, aged 1–5 years had BLLs ≥ 10 μ g/dL.

Childhood exposure to lead can have lifelong consequences. The significant differences between the GM BLLs by race/ethnicity and income indicate a persistent disparity. In January 2012, ACCLPP observed that these disparities can be traced to differences in housing quality, environmental conditions, nutrition, and other factors designed to control or eliminate lead exposure.

CDC concurred with ACCLPP that primary prevention (i.e. ensuring that all homes are lead-safe and do not contribute to childhood lead exposure) is the only practical approach to preventing elevated BLLs in children. Prevention requires reducing environmental exposures from soil, dust, paint, and water, before children are exposed to these hazards. Efforts to increase awareness of lead hazards and nutritional interventions to increase iron and calcium, which can reduce lead absorption, are other key components of a successful prevention policy. Given the continued disparity in BLLs, resources should be targeted to those areas where children are most at risk. NHANES provides useful data for measuring progress towards eliminating high BLLs and ensuring that resources are targeted toward the most vulnerable children.

### Prevention of childhood lead toxicity [^111AYo8o]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Prevention of childhood lead toxicity — government recommendations emphasize resource expansion and regulatory revisions, stating that the federal government should expand the resources currently offered by the HUD and should provide both financial and nonfinancial resources and technical guidance through the CDC, the EPA, and the HUD. The US EPA and HUD should revise downward allowable levels of lead in house dust, soil, paint, and water to conform with the recognition that there are no safe levels of lead. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services should expeditiously revise allowable laboratory error in blood lead proficiency testing programs from ± 4 μg/dL (± 40 ppb) to ± 2 μg/dL (± 20 ppb) for blood lead concentrations ≤ 20 μg/dL (≤ 200 ppb), with future reduction, when feasible, to ± 1 μg/dL (± 10 ppb) for blood lead concentrations ≤ 20 μg/dL (≤ 200 ppb). State and local governments should collect, analyze, and publish blood lead test results and should regularly publish reports of age of housing and other risk factors for children having blood lead concentrations ≥ 5 μg/dL (≥ 50 ppb); federal, state, and local governments should provide resources for environmental evaluations and case management of children who have blood lead concentrations ≥ 5 μg/dL (≥ 50 ppb); and state and local governments should take steps to ensure that water fountains in schools do not exceed water lead concentrations of 1 ppb.

### Environmental toxicants and autism spectrum disorders: a systematic review [^113G2Veo]. Translational Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Lead-related biomarkers

Lead was examined in 25 case–control studies of ASD and TD children (Table 1), with 11 studies (44%) reporting at least one elevation. Of these 11 latter studies, 2 (18%) were performed in the United States. Concerning the 14 studies reporting similar or lower lead levels in the ASD group, 10 (71%) were performed in the United States.

Blood

Seven case reports/series described lead toxicity in individuals with ASD as measured by an elevated blood lead level;, one study used whole-blood sampleswhile the remaining studies presumably measured whole-blood lead but did not specifically note this. In addition, a retrospective, uncontrolled case series from 1980 reported that 15 out of 77 children with ASD (19%) had a blood lead concentration (not noted whether the sample was whole blood, plasma, serum or RBC) above 35 μg dL −1 and that the blood lead concentration was inversely correlated with intellectual functioning. Finally, a case series from Canada found that none of 48 ASD children selected from a convenience sample had a lead level (not noted whether the sample was whole blood, plasma, serum or RBC) above 0.48 μmol l −1 (the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) threshold for intervention); however, nine children (19%) with a level above 0.1 μmol l −1 exhibited significantly more pica or oral-related behaviors. These studies are limited by small sample sizes (some are case reports), the retrospective nature and the lack of a control group.

### Lead exposure in children: prevention, detection, and management [^115yCKfw]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Fatal lead encephalopathy has disappeared and blood lead concentrations have decreased in US children, but approximately 25% still live in housing with deteriorated lead-based paint and are at risk of lead exposure with resulting cognitive impairment and other sequelae. Evidence continues to accrue that commonly encountered blood lead concentrations, even those less than 10 microg/dL, may impair cognition, and there is no threshold yet identified for this effect. Most US children are at sufficient risk that they should have their blood lead concentration measured at least once. There is now evidence-based guidance available for managing children with increased lead exposure. Housing stabilization and repair can interrupt exposure in most cases. The focus in childhood lead-poisoning policy, however, should shift from case identification and management to primary prevention, with a goal of safe housing for all children.

### Early-life low lead levels and academic achievement in childhood and adolescence [^111WSDhy]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study assessing early life low blood lead level and children's and adolescents' academic achievement, a 1-unit increase in lead levels in the range currently considered low for interventions (< 3.5 μg/dL) was associated with worse academic performance, close to the achievement decline per 1-unit increase in the range recommended for intervention (≥ 3.5 μg/dL). The achievement decline was observed across grades in elementary, middle, and high school. Reconsidering and potentially lowering current blood lead reference values for intervention may be needed to better address the associations of low-level lead exposures with cognitive and academic outcomes.

### Factors associated with blood lead levels in children in shenyang, China: a cross-sectional study [^116Weje1]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Lead is considered one of the most toxic substances by the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. The Chinese government began to focus on lead poisoning among children in the 1990s and blood lead levels (BLLs) in children have declined significantly since the introduction of unleaded gasoline. BLLs are declining globally with the implementation of policies to reduce the risk of lead poisoning, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recently revised the BLLs reference value from 50 to 35 μg/L based on the latest National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. As lead exposure levels have declined, research into lead sources has tapered off. However, low-concentration lead exposure can also exert adverse effects on children, such as lower intelligence quotient and symptoms associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and increase the risk of respiratory infections in early life. Overall, there is still a need to elucidate the factors affecting BLLs and reduce exposure levels. Food is currently considered a major source of lead, as environmental sources have gradually declined. To our knowledge, few reports have investigated the factors that influence BLLs in children, especially dietary factors. In the present study, we assessed sociodemographic and dietary factors that may influence BLLs in children in Shenyang, China.

### Blood lead levels in children aged 1–5 years-United States, 1999–2010 [^112uRY3o]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

In 1991, CDC defined BLLs ≥ 10 μ g/dL as the "level of concern" for children aged 1–5 years. However, in May 2012, CDC accepted the recommendations of its Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention (ACCLPP) that the term "level of concern" be replaced with an upper reference interval value defined as the 97.5th percentile of BLLs in U.S. children aged 1–5 years from two consecutive cycles of NHANES. CDC conducts NHANES, a continuous, cross-sectional, representative survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population, using a complex, multistage probability design. Since the mid-1970s, when NHANES first began measuring blood lead levels, the survey has become the basis for monitoring changes in BLLs in the United States. Beginning in 1999, NHANES became a continuous survey, with roughly 10,000 NHANES participants interviewed and examined during each 2-year cycle. Approximately 1,240 children aged 1–5 years are examined every cycle, and a blood specimen is drawn from approximately 850 (69%) of them. In NHANES, BLL is measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in the elemental analysis laboratory at CDC. The current upper reference interval value of the 97.5th percentile of the distribution of the combined 2007–2008 and 2009–2010 cycles of NHANES was calculated as 5 μ g/dL.

Despite these efforts, approximately 310,000 U.S. children younger than five years have elevated blood lead levels. Health care professionals should perform targeted screening for lead poisoning in children who are Medicaid-enrolled or -eligible, foreign born, or identified as high risk by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) location-specific recommendations or by a personal risk questionnaire. Venous sampling is the preferred method for measuring blood lead levels, but a carefully collected finger-stick sample is an acceptable alternative. Capillary samples of elevated levels should be confirmed by a venous sample. The CDC recommends that the threshold for follow-up and intervention of lead poisoning be a blood lead level of 10 microg per dL or higher. Recommendations for treatment of elevated blood levels include a thorough environmental investigation, laboratory testing when appropriate, iron supplementation for iron-deficient children, and chelation therapy for blood lead levels of 45 microg per dL or more. Prevention consists of education and avoidance of lead-contaminated products.

### Elevated blood lead levels associated with retained bullet fragments-United States, 2003–2012 [^1129W38j]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Symptoms resulting from elevated BLLs can vary widely and are often nonspecific, including fatigue, abdominal pain, and memory loss. As of 2004, fewer than 100 cases of lead toxicity caused by RBFs had been reported in the medical literature. During 2003–2012, elevated BLLs associated with RBFs constituted 0.3% of all elevated BLLs and 4.9% of BLLs ≥ 80 μ g/dL. Elevated BLLs associated with RBFs occurred predominantly among males aged 16–24 years in nonoccupational settings. The population identified in this study differs from the population exposed to lead in occupational settings, where cases are identified through a mechanism of routine lead exposure screening. However, adult males without an occupational exposure, including those with RBFs, would likely only be screened if they seek care for symptoms related to elevated BLLs, or as part of routine care for other purposes, if suspicion is raised by a medical provider. In addition, a low index of suspicion of lead toxicity by medical providers might result in a delay in diagnosis, and patients might receive multiple incorrect diagnoses before receiving correct assessment and treatment. Furthermore, BLLs can fluctuate in persons with RBFs. A person with a low BLL at the time of testing can have an increase in BLL and become symptomatic when RBFs migrate, such as into a joint space.

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, not all states report to ABLES, and persons with RBFs are often not tested; therefore, these data should be considered minimum estimates of the magnitude of the problem. Second, the reporting requirement varies by state and ranges from requiring reporting of all BLLs to only those ≥ 40 μ g/dL. Third, before 2007, work-related RBFs were not systematically identified through ABLES; identification of adults at risk for lead exposure is limited primarily to certain groups at high risk and universal blood lead screening is not standard practice. Finally, only some states provided 10–24 μ g/dL BLL data. The possibility exists that some reporting states might not have investigated patients with BLLs 10–24 μ g/dL or determined the location where lead exposure occurred, thereby resulting in omission or misclassification of RBF cases.

Persons with elevated BLLs with an unknown exposure source can be queried about RBFs. Patients with RBFs might benefit from counseling on lead and its health effects, and the importance of baseline and periodic BLL monitoring.

### Early-life low lead levels and academic achievement in childhood and adolescence [^112ipuHS]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there an association of a 1-unit increase in early childhood blood lead levels below 3.5 μg/dL with academic achievement compared with 3.5 μg/dL or higher?

Findings

In this cohort study of up to 305 256 children and 1 782 873 child-grade observations, a 1-unit increase in blood lead levels below 3.5 μg/dL was associated with worse math and reading scores in grades 2 through 11, comparable to those associated with blood lead levels of 3.5 μg/dL or higher.

Meaning

These findings suggest that it is important to reconsider and potentially lower the current blood lead reference values (≥ 3.5 μg/dL) for recommending further interventions.

### Using health data to highlight milestones: a cookbook for non-profit program managers [^115hgxMv]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Childhood lead poisoning — diagnosis through blood lead testing states that overt clinical symptoms are rare at blood lead levels of less than 70 μg/dL, so blood lead testing is necessary to identify asymptomatic children with elevated blood lead levels. Blood lead testing/screening can be conducted through a capillary test (finger stick) or a venous test, and elevated blood lead levels identified through a capillary test are usually confirmed through a venous test. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently defines child blood lead levels of greater than or equal to 5 μg/dL as elevated.

### Cumulative population blood lead levels [^11333pqt]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

There are assumptions and subtleties to consider. Very few countries have done representative studies (outside of high-income countries). Average BLLs in most LMICs are extrapolations reported by IHME, based on studies that have been done in that country for lead exposure that have a reliable counterfactual group. Those datasets, in conjunction with methodologies based on automobile usage, are used by IHME to estimate national averages. However, many countries do not have any, or sufficient studies, and IHME extrapolates to estimate national averages. Modelling based on automobile usage is likely outdated based on new knowledge related to lead in spices, aluminium and ceramic cookware and the like.

We stress the importance of conducting national assessments that are representative to understand national averages. With current costs for lead testing in blood tests high, we encourage efforts to find lower-cost technologies. This will also be important as countries turn to surveillance testing for lead (as is done in the USA, but not Europe).

There are other limitations in using this tool on its own. Because the size of the population is a significant component, the cpBLL metric alone may disadvantage smaller communities from donor funding. Care must be taken to avoid neglecting countries with great needs.

Early estimates of cpBLL figures find that over 60% of lead problems are found in just the top dozen countries (table 1). Almost 25% of global cpBLLs are in India.

The construct of cpBLL values provides a solid basis for identifying the most urgent countries (or, in large countries, sub-national regions) requiring interventions to protect public health. It will eventually allow different regulatory and physical options to be compared and the best combinations to be selected.

### Update of the blood lead reference value-United States, 2021 [^1171mtW2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

HCPs play a vital role in addressing pediatric lead exposure by initiating recommended follow-up actions based on the child's BLL. The updated BLRV empowers HCPs to take earlier action to mitigate exposures for children aged 1–5 years with BLLs between 3.5 and 5 μ g/dL, who, before this update, would not have been recommended to receive these services for a BLL < 5 μ g/dL. Earlier recognition of lead exposure enables providers and families to intervene by stopping exposure that might otherwise result in higher BLLs, thus likely limiting or preventing potential adverse health effects.

Although there are practical challenges, HCPs who identify children with BLLs between 3.5 and 5 μ g/dL should strive to ascertain possible sources of exposure by taking an environmental history and providing nutritional counseling which can help decrease lead absorption. Before this update, these actions were not recommended to occur for BLLs < 5 μ g/dL. In addition, HCPs can provide guidance on exposure reduction, regardless of whether sources are identified, and link children to health departments for appropriate services. Follow-up testing using venous samples should be conducted after any remediation activities have taken place to ensure that exposure reduction was effective in addition to assessing developmental progress at regular intervals and providing referrals to supportive services as needed.

CDC identifies no safe BLL in children and considers a blood lead reference value (BLRV) of 5.0 μ g/dL* sufficient to prompt clinical and public health intervention. Among children aged < 6 years, very high BLL (> 70 μ g/dL) can cause neurologic problems (e.g. seizures or coma), organ failure, and death. Lower, but still elevated, BLL can affect the nervous system, causing permanent neurologic damage, behavioral disorders, and cognitive impairment. In the United States, the most common childhood lead exposures are from lead-based paint that was used in pre-1978 housing, † lead-contaminated soil or lead-containing pollutants from industrial sources, and water from old lead pipes and fixtures. Very young children might ingest lead dust or paint because of their tendency to put fingers or objects (toys or paint chips) in their mouths, and they more readily absorb lead because their bodies are rapidly developing. Primary prevention focuses on reducing lead exposures in homes, schools, and communities. Secondary prevention consists of BLL screening as part of routine well-child examinations. Early identification of children with lead exposure can help identify and eliminate lead sources (and future exposures for other children); reduce their BLL over time; and link children with high BLLs to medical, nutritional, and educational services. Medicaid-enrolled children are required to be screened at ages 12 and 24 months; many states have additional screening requirements.

In 1995, elevated BLLs became a nationally reportable condition. CDC funds 53 state and local childhood lead poisoning prevention programs to conduct ongoing surveillance of BLL testing among children. § During May and June 2020, CDC received anecdotal reports of declines in BLL testing. To understand BLL testing trends during the COVID-19 pandemic, including after a national emergency was declared in March 2020, CDC requested that state and local health departments report the total number of children aged < 6 years with BLL tests by month during January–May 2019 and January–May 2020. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. Health departments could also submit qualitative information. Based on the 2007–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data and subsequent trends, an estimated 2.0% of children who did not have a BLL test were conservatively assumed to have levels exceeding the BLRV.
