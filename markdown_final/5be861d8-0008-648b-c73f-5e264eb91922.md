## Question

dosing of lovenox to a dialysis patient who is transitioning from heparin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about dosing enoxaparin (Lovenox) in a dialysis patient who is transitioning from unfractionated heparin, including when to start, how to dose, how to monitor, and how to manage special scenarios like heparin resistance or HIT. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic differences between UFH and enoxaparin and why dose adjustment matters in ESRD. Then, I should verify the indication for switching and whether UFH should be stopped immediately or overlapped. Next, I will determine the appropriate enoxaparin dose for prophylaxis versus treatment, consider timing around dialysis, and outline anti-Xa monitoring. After that, I should review safety, bleeding risk, and reversal strategies. Finally, I will address special populations and summarize a practical algorithm with caveats and alternatives if enoxaparin is not suitable.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic foundation, because if I get this wrong, everything downstream will be off. Enoxaparin is cleared renally and accumulates in severe renal impairment, with FDA pharmacokinetics showing approximately a 65% increase in anti-Xa exposure when CrCl is less than 30 mL/min, and dialysis patients can have a two-fold higher AUC after IV dosing, which explains the heightened bleeding risk and the need for dose reduction and monitoring in this population [^160cd772] [^c2edbb86] [^ae843049].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about simply stopping UFH and starting enoxaparin. I need to check the indication for switching and the transition strategy. If the patient is on therapeutic UFH for VTE or ACS, abrupt cessation risks rebound thrombosis, so I should confirm whether a brief overlap is indicated based on the clinical scenario and bleeding risk, and if overlapping, I should coordinate the last UFH dose with the first enoxaparin dose to avoid excessive anticoagulation, keeping in mind that UFH's half-life is short and reversible with protamine if needed [^70a3272c] [^f51c5531].

> Next, I should review prophylactic dosing in dialysis, and I need to ensure I cite the most defensible approach. Standard prophylaxis in severe renal impairment is 30 mg subcutaneously once daily, and although some centers use 20 mg daily, the best-supported evidence base supports 30 mg daily with careful bleeding surveillance, with observational data in dialysis showing no excess bleeding versus UFH when using prophylactic enoxaparin, which reassures me that 30 mg daily is reasonable if clinically indicated [^effa651e] [^b0731daa].

> For therapeutic dosing, I should double-check the magnitude of dose reduction. The FDA provides a 50% reduction for severe renal impairment, so 1 mg/kg once daily instead of 1 mg/kg every 12 hours is appropriate, and I should confirm that this applies across ACS and VTE indications. Importantly, I must pair this with anti-Xa monitoring because pharmacokinetic variability is high in ESRD and anti-Xa poorly predicts clinical effect in some studies, so I should not rely on clinical appearance alone [^effa651e] [^01ab431e].

> Wait, let me verify timing around dialysis, because accumulation and intra-dialytic anticoagulation can complicate bleeding risk. Some protocols administer enoxaparin after dialysis to mitigate intra-dialytic bleeding, and a case-based approach using post-dialysis dosing with anti-Xa targets has been described, though this is off-label and should be reserved for select cases with close monitoring. If used, measuring anti-Xa about 4 hours post-dose with a therapeutic target of roughly 0.5–1.0 IU/mL is a pragmatic approach, acknowledging limited evidence [^4e87106b].

> I will now examine monitoring, because under- or over-anticoagulation is a major pitfall here. For prophylaxis, routine anti-Xa monitoring is not mandated, but given ESRD variability, periodic checks can be reasonable. For therapeutic dosing, I should obtain anti-Xa levels 4 hours post-dose after the third dose and then periodically, targeting 0.5–1.0 IU/mL, recognizing that some centers accept 0.4–1.0 IU/mL and that troughs should generally be above 0.5 IU/mL for efficacy while avoiding excessive accumulation. I should also monitor CBC and platelets for thrombocytopenia and bleeding at least every few days initially [^edfb0302] [^4fc2f5d1].

> But wait, what if the patient is heparin-resistant or has suspected HIT. I need to ensure I do not inadvertently re-expose to heparins in HIT, where enoxaparin is contraindicated if HIT occurred within 100 days or antibodies persist, so I should switch to a non-heparin anticoagulant such as argatroban or fondaparinux depending on renal function and indication, and for heparin resistance without HIT, case literature supports higher enoxaparin dosing with anti-Xa-guided titration, but this is off-label and high risk, so I should reserve it for specialists and monitor closely [^755b9206] [^4e87106b] [^1d3bf77d].

> I should confirm bleeding risk mitigation and reversal plans. Enoxaparin has no specific antidote, though protamine provides partial neutralization of anti-IIa activity and is reasonable for life-threatening bleeding, and I should also remember that dialysis does not reliably remove LMWH, so supportive care and local hemostasis are key. Given the elevated bleeding risk in severe renal impairment with therapeutic LMWH, I should reassess the indication frequently and consider UFH as an alternative when rapid reversibility is paramount [^f51c5531] [^6b4e18a1].

> Let me consider special populations and edge cases so I do not miss anything. In obesity, anti-Xa exposure may be modestly higher, so weight-based dosing remains appropriate but vigilance for accumulation is prudent. In low body weight, fixed prophylactic doses can lead to higher exposure, reinforcing the value of weight-based strategies. In older adults, bleeding risk rises with therapeutic enoxaparin, so I should individualize and monitor more frequently. And in pregnancy with mechanical valves, LMWH has been associated with valve thrombosis, so if used, it requires expert oversight and frequent anti-Xa monitoring [^160cd772] [^89753a3b] [^ac254c18].

> Hold on, I should verify alternatives if enoxaparin is not suitable. UFH remains a mainstay in dialysis for therapeutic anticoagulation when rapid on/off is needed, with aPTT-based monitoring, and for prophylaxis, UFH 5000 units subcutaneously every 8–12 hours is a reasonable alternative when LMWH accumulation is a concern. Dalteparin may accumulate less in renal failure, but evidence is limited, so if considered, it should be with anti-Xa monitoring and caution [^887fe9fe] [^6b4e18a1].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check each step. If the indication is prophylaxis, stop UFH when feasible based on its short half-life and start enoxaparin 30 mg subcutaneously once daily, with consideration of post-dialysis timing in high bleeding risk, and monitor for bleeding without routine anti-Xa checks. If the indication is therapeutic, stop UFH and start enoxaparin 1 mg/kg once daily, obtain anti-Xa 4 hours post-dose after the third dose, adjust to 0.5–1.0 IU/mL, and monitor CBC and platelets regularly. If HIT is present or suspected, avoid enoxaparin and use a non-heparin anticoagulant. Throughout, reassess bleeding risk daily and be prepared to switch to UFH if instability or procedures arise [^effa651e] [^edfb0302] [^755b9206].

> Finally, I should double-check that I have addressed the core question about transitioning. There is no universal overlap requirement when switching from UFH to enoxaparin because UFH clears quickly, so overlap is optional and should be guided by thrombotic risk and bleeding risk. The key is to stop UFH, start the renally adjusted enoxaparin dose, and monitor appropriately, escalating to anti-Xa–guided dosing if therapeutic levels are needed in ESRD [^70a3272c] [^effa651e] [^edfb0302].

Enoxaparin (Lovenox) is **not routinely recommended** for dialysis patients due to renal clearance and bleeding risk [^6b4e18a1]. If used, **reduce dose by 50%** (e.g. 1 mg/kg once daily for treatment; 30 mg once daily for prophylaxis) and monitor anti-Xa levels 4 hours post-dose, targeting 0.5–1.0 IU/mL for treatment or 0.2–0.4 IU/mL for prophylaxis [^effa651e] [^edfb0302]. Unfractionated heparin is preferred for dialysis patients because of its short half-life and reversibility [^887fe9fe]. If transitioning from heparin, stop heparin and start enoxaparin at the reduced dose without overlap, monitoring closely for bleeding and adjusting based on anti-Xa levels [^70a3272c].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of enoxaparin in dialysis patients

Enoxaparin is eliminated renally; in dialysis patients, **clearance is reduced and anti-Xa exposure increased**, raising bleeding risk [^160cd772]. After a single 0.25–0.5 mg/kg IV dose, AUC is about twofold higher than in non-dialysis patients, and anti-Xa activity persists up to 24 hours post-dose [^160cd772] [^067fda7b].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **ACC/AHA guidelines**: For CrCl < 30 mL/min, reduce enoxaparin dose by 50% (e.g. 1 mg/kg once daily for treatment; 30 mg once daily for prophylaxis) and monitor anti-Xa levels [^effa651e] [^c65a0049].
- **CHEST guidelines**: Recommend dose reduction and anti-Xa monitoring in severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) [^12cf39d2].
- **FDA warnings**: Increased bleeding risk in severe renal impairment; monitor anti-Xa and observe for bleeding [^160cd772].

---

## Recommended dosing strategy for dialysis patients

| **Indication** | **Standard dose** | **Adjusted dose for dialysis patients** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Treatment of VTE or ACS | 1 mg/kg SC q12h | 1 mg/kg SC once daily (50% reduction) | Anti-Xa 4 hours post-dose; target 0.5–1.0 IU/mL |
| Prophylaxis of VTE | 40 mg SC once daily | 30 mg SC once daily (25% reduction) | Anti-Xa 4 hours post-dose; target 0.2–0.4 IU/mL |

---

## Transitioning from heparin to enoxaparin

- **Overlap**: Not required; stop heparin and start enoxaparin at the adjusted dose [^70a3272c].
- **Timing**: Start enoxaparin when the next heparin dose is due.
- **Monitoring**: Baseline CBC, platelets, and renal function; monitor anti-Xa 4 hours post-dose after the third dose, then periodically; watch for bleeding and thrombocytopenia [^4fc2f5d1] [^00f96e2a].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety

Limited data suggest enoxaparin can be used safely in dialysis with dose adjustment and monitoring, but **bleeding risk remains higher** than in non-dialysis patients [^f56ff495] [^8b0418b4]. Unfractionated heparin remains the preferred option due to its short half-life and reversibility [^887fe9fe].

---

## Alternative anticoagulation strategies

- **Unfractionated heparin**: Preferred for dialysis patients; short half-life and reversible with protamine [^887fe9fe].
- **Dalteparin**: May be considered; less accumulation in renal impairment, but data are limited [^8a54a913].
- **Fondaparinux**: Contraindicated in severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) [^f276ea12].

---

## Practical recommendations

- **Use enoxaparin cautiously** in dialysis patients, reserving it for compelling indications [^6b4e18a1].
- **Reduce dose by 50%** and monitor anti-Xa levels [^effa651e].
- **Prefer UFH** when feasible due to safety and reversibility [^887fe9fe].
- **Monitor closely** for bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and anti-Xa levels [^4fc2f5d1].

---

Enoxaparin is not first-line in dialysis patients; if used, **reduce the dose by 50%** and monitor anti-Xa levels, with UFH preferred when possible [^6b4e18a1].

14.6	Treatment of Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction

In a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study, patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who were to be hospitalized within 6 hours of onset and were eligible to receive fibrinolytic therapy were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Lovenox or unfractionated heparin.

Study medication was initiated between 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after the initiation of fibrinolytic therapy. Unfractionated heparin was administered beginning with an intravenous bolus of 60 U/kg (maximum 4000 U) and followed with an infusion of 12 U/kg per hour (initial maximum 1000 U per hour) that was adjusted to maintain an aPTT of 1.5 to 2 times the control value. The intravenous infusion was to be given for at least 48 hours. The Lovenox dosing strategy was adjusted according to the patient's age and renal function. For patients younger than 75 years of age, Lovenox was given as a single 30 mg intravenous bolus plus a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous dose followed by a subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg every 12 hours. For patients at least 75 years of age, the intravenous bolus was not given and the subcutaneous dose was reduced to 0.75 mg/kg every 12 hours. For patients with severe renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL per minute), the dose was to be modified to 1 mg/kg every 24 hours. The subcutaneous injections of Lovenox were given until hospital discharge or for a maximum of eight days (whichever came first). The mean treatment duration for Lovenox was 6.6 days. The mean treatment duration of unfractionated heparin was 54 hours.

14.4	Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

In a multicenter, parallel group study, 900 patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or without pulmonary embolism (PE) were randomized to an inpatient (hospital) treatment of either (i) Lovenox 1.5 mg/kg once a day subcutaneously, (ii) Lovenox 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously, or (iii) heparin intravenous bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion (administered to achieve an aPTT of 55 to 85 seconds). A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 60.7 years) with 54.7% men and 45.3% women. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to PT to achieve an International Normalization Ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of Lovenox or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. Lovenox or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved. Both Lovenox regimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (DVT and/or PE). The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 21).

2.4	Recommended Dosage for Geriatric Patients with Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction

For treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in geriatric patients ≥ 75 years of age, do not use an initial intravenous bolus. Initiate dosing with 0.75 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours (maximum 75 mg for the first two doses only, followed by 0.75 mg/kg dosing for the remaining doses) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

No dose adjustment is necessary for other indications in geriatric patients unless kidney function is impaired [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

2.5	Administration

Do not administer Lovenox by intramuscular injection.

Administer Lovenox by intravenous or subcutaneous injection only.

Lovenox is a clear, colorless to pale yellow sterile solution, and as with other parenteral drug products, should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.

Use a tuberculin syringe or equivalent when using Lovenox multiple-dose vials to assure withdrawal of the appropriate volume of drug.

Patients may self-inject by the subcutaneous route of administration only after their physicians determine that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up, as necessary. Provide proper training in subcutaneous injection technique before allowing self-injection (with or without the assistance of an injection device).

Unstable Angina and Non–Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours in conjunction with oral aspirin therapy (100 to 325 mg once daily) in patients with unstable angina or non–Q-wave myocardial infarction. Treat with Lovenox for a minimum of 2 days and continue until clinical stabilization. The usual duration of treatment is 2 to 8 days [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Studies (14.5)].

Treatment of Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction

The recommended dose of Lovenox is a single intravenous bolus of 30 mg plus a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous dose followed by 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours (maximum 100 mg for the first two doses only, followed by 1 mg/kg dosing for the remaining doses) in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Reduce the dosage in patients ≥ 75 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Unless contraindicated, administer aspirin to all patients as soon as they are identified as having STEMI and continue dosing with 75 to 325 mg once daily.

When administered in conjunction with a thrombolytic (fibrin specific or non–fibrin specific), administer Lovenox between 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after the start of fibrinolytic therapy. The usual duration of Lovenox therapy is 8 days or until hospital discharge.

For patients managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), if the last Lovenox subcutaneous administration was given less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is needed. If the last Lovenox subcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation, administer an intravenous bolus of 0.3 mg/kg of Lovenox [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.3	Dose Reduction for Patients with Severe Renal Impairment

The recommended prophylaxis and treatment dosage regimens for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) are described in Table 1 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Although no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min and creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min, observe these patients frequently for signs and symptoms of bleeding.

Intravenous (Bolus) Injection Technique

Use the multiple-dose vial for intravenous injections. Administer Lovenox through an intravenous line. Do not mix or coadminister Lovenox with other medications. Flush the intravenous access device with a sufficient volume of saline or dextrose solution prior to and following the intravenous bolus administration of Lovenox, to prevent mixing of drugs. Lovenox is compatible with normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% dextrose in water.

2.6	Monitoring for Safety

During therapy monitor complete blood counts including platelets and stool occult blood.

Assess for signs and symptoms of bleeding.

In patients with renal impairment anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox.

If during Lovenox therapy abnormal coagulation parameters or bleeding should occur, anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are not adequate for monitoring the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox.

### Use of enoxaparin in end-stage renal disease [^01ab431e]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Enoxaparin has become the treatment of choice for various thromboembolic diseases. In most patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), prophylactic dosage of enoxaparin does not appear to be associated with an increased bleeding risk and can be used without the need for monitoring and adjustment of regimens. Empirical dose adjustment and biological monitoring seem to be necessary along with therapeutic doses. Anti-factor Xa poorly predicts the degree of anticoagulation in ESRD patients given enoxaparin.

### Using and monitoring of therapeutic high-dose enoxaparin in a heparin-resistant dialysis patient with recurrent thromboembolic events [^4e87106b]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

The use of enoxaparin is generally not recommended in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and undergoing haemodialysis. We describe the administration of high-dose enoxaparin in a haemodialysis patient with heparin resistance and recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) outlining a novel dosing regimen along an innovative method for monitoring antifactor Xa activity. As a last resort of his recurrent DVT, a critically ill intensive care unit patient undergoing dialysis was prescribed high-dose enoxaparin, administered exclusively after dialysis, on dialysis days for a period of 2months. Antifactor Xa activity was measured 4hours postadministration with a target range of 0.7–1.2IU/mL. The patient's DVT demonstrated clinical improvement, antifactor Xa levels were maintained within the therapeutic range and haemoglobin levels remained stable with no signs of bleeding. This case reports the implementation of a high-dose enoxaparin dosing and monitoring strategy in a high-risk patient. However, further studies involving larger patient cohorts are required to validate this approach.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of enoxaparin sodium SC (also known as Lovenox):
- **Decreased platelet count**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as thrombocytopenia can occur with the use of enoxaparin.
- **Gasping syndrome**: use caution in infants, as enoxaparin sodium vials contain benzyl alcohol preservative.
- **Hemorrhage**: use caution in patients undergoing PCI. If manual compression is used at the puncture site after PCI, remove the sheath 6 hours after the last enoxaparin dose. Administer the next scheduled dose no sooner than 6–8 hours after sheath removal.
- **Hemorrhage**: use caution in patients with bleeding disorder, uncontrolled hypertension, or a history of recent gastrointestinal ulceration, diabetic retinopathy, renal dysfunction, or hemorrhage.
- **Hemorrhage**: use extreme caution in patients at high risk of hemorrhage, including bacterial endocarditis, congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative or angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, recent brain, spinal, or ophthalmologic surgery, or concomitant use of platelet inhibitors.
- **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as enoxaparin may cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with or without thrombosis.
- **Prosthetic valve thrombosis**: use caution in thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves, as the risk of thromboembolism is higher in this population. Obtain frequent monitoring of peak and trough anti-factor Xa levels and adjust dosage.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Prevention of Deep Vein Thrombosis in Hip, Knee and Abdominal Surgery; Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis, Prevention of Ischemic Complications of Unstable Angina and Non–Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction

Over 2800 patients, 65 years and older, have received Lovenox in clinical trials. The efficacy of Lovenox in the geriatric (≥ 65 years) was similar to that seen in younger patients (< 65 years). The incidence of bleeding complications was similar between geriatric and younger patients when 30 mg every 12 hours or 40 mg once a day doses of Lovenox were employed. The incidence of bleeding complications was higher in geriatric patients as compared to younger patients when Lovenox was administered at doses of 1.5 mg/kg once a day or 1 mg/kg every 12 hours. The risk of Lovenox-associated bleeding increased with age. Serious adverse events increased with age for patients receiving Lovenox. Other clinical experience (including postmarketing surveillance and literature reports) has not revealed additional differences in the safety of Lovenox between geriatric and younger patients. Careful attention to dosing intervals and concomitant medications (especially antiplatelet medications) is advised. Lovenox should be used with care in geriatric patients who may show delayed elimination of enoxaparin. Monitoring of geriatric patients with low body weight (< 45 kg) and those predisposed to decreased renal function should be considered [see Warnings and Precautions (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Treatment of Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction

In the clinical study for treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, there was no evidence of difference in efficacy between patients ≥ 75 years of age (n = 1241) and patients less than 75 years of age (n = 9015). Patients ≥ 75 years of age did not receive a 30 mg intravenous bolus prior to the normal dosage regimen and had their subcutaneous dose adjusted to 0.75 mg/kg every 12 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The incidence of bleeding complications was higher in patients ≥ 65 years of age as compared to younger patients (< 65 years).

2.1	Pretreatment Evaluation

Evaluate all patients for a bleeding disorder before starting Lovenox treatment, unless treatment is urgently needed.

Abdominal Surgery

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 40 mg by subcutaneous injection once a day (with the initial dose given 2 hours prior to surgery) in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are at risk for thromboembolic complications. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 30 mg every 12 hours administered by subcutaneous injection in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery. Administer the initial dose 12 to 24 hours after surgery, provided that hemostasis has been established. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

A dose of Lovenox of 40 mg once a day subcutaneously may be considered for hip replacement surgery for up to 3 weeks. Administer the initial dose 12 (± 3) hours prior to surgery.

Medical Patients during Acute Illness

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 40 mg once a day administered by subcutaneous injection for medical patients at risk for thromboembolic complications due to severely restricted mobility during acute illness. The usual duration of administration is 6 to 11 days [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism, who can be treated at home in an outpatient setting.

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously or 1.5 mg/kg once a day administered subcutaneously at the same time every day for inpatient (hospital) treatment of patients with acute deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism or patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism (who are not candidates for outpatient treatment).

In both outpatient and inpatient (hospital) treatments, initiate warfarin sodium therapy when appropriate (usually within 72 hours of Lovenox). Continue Lovenox for a minimum of 5 days and until a therapeutic oral anticoagulant effect has been achieved (International Normalization Ratio 2 to 3). The average duration of administration is 7 days [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

Special Populations

Gender

Apparent clearance and Amaxderived from anti-Factor Xa values following single subcutaneous dosing (40 mg and 60 mg) were slightly higher in males than in females. The source of the gender difference in these parameters has not been conclusively identified; however, body weight may be a contributing factor.

Geriatric

Apparent clearance and Amaxderived from anti-Factor Xa values following single and multiple subcutaneous dosing in geriatric subjects were close to those observed in young subjects. Following once a day subcutaneous dosing of 40 mg enoxaparin, the Day 10 mean area under anti-Factor Xa activity versus time curve (AUC) was approximately 15% greater than the mean Day 1 AUC value [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Renal impairment

A linear relationship between anti-Factor Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady state has been observed, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function. Anti-Factor Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady state, is marginally increased in patients with creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min and patients with creatinine clearance 30 to < 50 mL/min after repeated subcutaneous 40 mg once-daily doses. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), the AUC at steady state is significantly increased on average by 65% after repeated subcutaneous 40 mg once-daily doses [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Hemodialysis

In a single study, elimination rate appeared similar but AUC was two-fold higher than control population, after a single 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg intravenous dose.

Hepatic impairment

Studies with Lovenox in patients with hepatic impairment have not been conducted and the impact of hepatic impairment on the exposure to enoxaparin is unknown.

Weight

After repeated subcutaneous 1.5 mg/kg once-daily dosing, mean AUC of anti-Factor Xa activity is marginally higher at steady state in obese healthy volunteers (BMI 30–48 kg/m2) compared to non-obese control subjects, while Amaxis not increased.

When non–weight-adjusted dosing was administered, it was found after a single-subcutaneous 40 mg dose, that anti-Factor Xa exposure is 52% higher in low-weight women (< 45 kg) and 27% higher in low-weight men (< 57 kg) when compared to normal weight control subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.8)].

### Subcutaneous enoxaparin for therapeutic anticoagulation in hemodialysis patients [^f56ff495]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Information regarding dosing of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) for therapeutic anticoagulation in hemodialysis (HD) patients is limited. The aim of this study was to retrospectively compare the safety and efficacy of enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin (UFH) for therapeutic anticoagulation in HD patients.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective chart review evaluated HD patients treated with subcutaneous enoxaparin that were matched based on the indication for anticoagulation with patients treated with intravenous UFH to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation. Primary outcome measures included 30-day incidence of thromboembolic events and major bleeding. Secondary outcomes included rehospitalization within 30days, length of stay, and mortality.

Results

One hundred sixty-four patients were evaluated, 82 in each group. The average daily dose of enoxaparin used to target therapeutic levels was 0.7 ± 0.2mg/kg/day (range = 0.4–1). Comparing enoxaparin to UFH, there was no significant difference in major bleeding (6.1% vs 11%, p = 0.4) or thromboembolism (0% vs 2.4%, p = 0.5). Hospital length of stay was shorter in the enoxaparin group (20 ± 53.8 vs 28.9 ± 44.5days, p = 0.02); there was no significant difference between groups in mortality or readmission. Adjusting for risk factors for bleeding there was a slight but statistically non-significant difference between enoxaparin versus UFH (OR = 0.77, 95%CI: 0.2–3.5, p = 0.73).

Conclusions

These findings suggest that therapeutic dosing of enoxaparin, in doses that ranged from 0.4-1mg/kg/day, was as safe as intravenous UFH in providing therapeutic anticoagulation in stable patients requiring chronic hemodialysis.

Table 4 — anticoagulation dosing for venous thromboembolism (VTE) details direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and low–molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) regimens with renal considerations. Apixaban initial treatment is 10 mg orally twice daily for the first 7 days followed by 5 mg orally twice daily, and after ≥ 6 months of initial therapy either 5 mg orally twice daily or 2.5 mg orally twice daily can be considered. Rivaroxaban initial treatment is 15 mg orally twice daily with food for the first 21 days followed by 20 mg orally once daily with food, and after ≥ 6 months either 20 mg orally daily with food or 10 mg orally daily with or without food can be considered; avoid use in patients with a CrCl of < 15 mL/min. Dabigatran is dosed 150 mg orally twice daily when preceded by 5–10 days of parenteral anticoagulation, and patients with severe renal impairment (a CrCl of ≤ 30 mL/min) and those receiving hemodialysis were not enrolled, with no dosing recommendations in that population. Edoxaban is 60 mg orally once daily when preceded by at least 5–10 days of parenteral anticoagulation, with dose reduction to 30 mg once daily for patients with a CrCl 15–50 mL/min or body weight ≤ 60 kg. In cancer-associated VTE, dalteparin is 200 units/kg subcutaneously once daily for 1 month then 150 IU/kg once daily for months 2–6; enoxaparin is 1 mg/kg twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily subcutaneously, with dose reduction to 1 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily for patients with a CrCl of < 30 mL/min.

### Different effects of enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin on some thrombogenesis markers during hemodialysis: a cross-over study [^69db46db]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin constitute fundamental anticoagulants during hemodialysis (HD). We aimed to investigate the effect of UFH and enoxaparin on plasma levels of prothrombin fragment 1+2 (PF 1+2) and thrombin/antithrombin complex (TAT) as markers of intravascular thrombogenesis during HD.

Methods

We enrolled 22 chronic HD patients, who were randomly assigned to either iv enoxaparin (n = 11) or UFH (n = 11) anticoagulation, and followed prospectively for 12 weeks before crossing over to the alternate therapy for further 12 weeks. Plasma levels of PF 1+2 and TAT were measured by immunoassay at the start, at 10 and 180 min of HD session after each period of evaluation.

Results

The baseline PF 1+2 and TAT levels were comparable under enoxaparin and UFH treatment. PF 1+2 significantly decreased during both UFH (chi(2) ANOVA = 9.82, P = 0.007) and enoxaparin (chi(2) ANOVA = 29.40, P < 10(-6)) anticoagulated HD, while over-HD TAT levels changes differed depending on the type of heparin. The switch from enoxaparin to UFH treatment was connected with a significantly higher PF 1+2 after 10 and 180 min as well as higher TAT concentration after 180 min of HD. Only during enoxaparin anticoagulated HD 34% PF 1+2 decrease and TAT levels after 180 min of HD was closely associated with heparin dosage.

Conclusion

Single bolus of enoxaparin ensures efficient and convenient anti-thrombotic protection during HD procedure. Enoxaparin mean dose of 0.67 mg/kg, which is generally lower than manufacturer's instructions, can be recommended for over-dialytic regular use.

### No difference in bleeding risk between subcutaneous enoxaparin and heparin for thromboprophylaxis in end-stage renal disease [^b0731daa]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight form of heparin, is not approved for use in dialysis patients in the United States, because it is eliminated through the kidneys and could therefore accumulate and cause inadvertent bleeding. Accordingly, it is unknown if enoxaparin is as safe to prescribe as subcutaneous heparin for thromboprophylaxis in patients with chronic renal failure. Here we conducted a retrospective comparative effectiveness study in a large population of chronic maintenance dialysis patients initiated with subcutaneous injections of enoxaparin or heparin for thromboprophylaxis. The primary study end point was hospitalization or death related to bleeding, with a secondary end point of venous thromboembolism. Among 7721 dialysis patients started on subcutaneous enoxaparin or heparin at doses for thromboprophylaxis, the crude rate for bleeding requiring hospitalization or resulting in death was 15.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 12.7–18.2) events per 100 patient-years in the enoxaparin group, which did not differ from the heparin group in which the crude rate was 16.2 (95% CI 14.0–18.7) events per 100 patient-years. In risk factor-adjusted Poisson models, enoxaparin was not associated with more bleeding in comparison to heparin (risk ratio, 0.98; 95% CI 0.78–1.23). The risk of venous thromboembolism was not associatively worse with enoxaparin (risk ratio, 0.77; 95% CI 0.49–1.22). Thus, in dialysis patients, daily enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis was not associated with increased serious bleeding or less effective compared to subcutaneous heparin.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^4b651739]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Heparin bridging — management points should be considered when administering heparin bridging, including that bridging is most often done with a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) using a therapeutic-dose regimen (eg, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg bid, dalteparin 100 IU/kg bid); bridging with therapeutic-dose IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) is another treatment option, for example, in patients with severe renal insufficiency or who are dialysis-dependent; and other types of heparin bridging may include intermediate-dose regimens (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg bid). Heparin bridging should be administered in a manner to minimize the risk for bleeding that would require re-operation or another intervention, and avoidance of major bleeding is important because it typically requires a longer period of anticoagulant interruption that, in turn, exposes patients to an increased risk for thromboembolism.

2.8 Converting to Warfarin

To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)].

2.9 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin

For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered.

2.10 Extracorporeal Dialysis

Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available.

8.6	Patients with Mechanical Prosthetic Heart Valves

The use of Lovenox has not been adequately studied for thromboprophylaxis in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves and has not been adequately studied for long-term use in this patient population. Isolated cases of prosthetic heart valve thrombosis have been reported in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves who have received Lovenox for thromboprophylaxis. Some of these cases were pregnant women in whom thrombosis led to maternal and fetal deaths. Insufficient data, the underlying disease and the possibility of inadequate anticoagulation complicate the evaluation of these cases. Pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be at higher risk for thromboembolism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

8.7	Renal Impairment

In patients with renal impairment, there is an increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium. All such patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Because exposure of enoxaparin sodium is significantly increased in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), a dosage adjustment is recommended for therapeutic and prophylactic dosage ranges. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance 30 to < 50 mL/min and creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In patients with renal failure, treatment with Lovenox has been associated with the development of hyperkalemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

8.8	Low-Weight Patients

An increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium with prophylactic dosages (non-weight adjusted) has been observed in low-weight women (< 45 kg) and low-weight men (< 57 kg). Observe low-weight patients frequently for signs and symptoms of bleeding [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.9	Obese Patients

Obese patients are at higher risk for thromboembolism. The safety and efficacy of prophylactic doses of Lovenox in obese patients (BMI > 30 kg/m2) has not been fully determined and there is no consensus for dose adjustment. Observe these patients carefully for signs and symptoms of thromboembolism.

### Anticoagulation in chronic kidney disease: from guidelines to clinical practice [^887fe9fe]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

3.1.2 Heparin treatment

Heparin, no matter of type, is administered according to the classic rules, depending on the associated disorder (acute coronary syndrome/VTE). Dose adjustment is necessary in advanced CKD and is primarily based on guideline recommendations (Table 4). 28, 29, 30

Table 4
Dose adjustment for heparins according to chronic kidney disease stage (adapted from Hughes et al 15, European Society of Cardiology guidelines 28, 29, 30)

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is preferred because it has a short half‐life that allows for the anticoagulant effect to wear off within 1 to 4 hours, even in patients with severe renal dysfunction at high hemorrhagic risk. In addition to this, there is an antidote (protamine) used to rapidly reverse the effects of UFH, although the guidelines recommend UFH in severe CKD without adjustment of impaired renal clearance and interpatient variability of accumulation. Therefore, nephrology practice recommends decreasing the initial standard dose by 33%, and subsequently dose adjustment based on aPTT. 16 In the NSTEMI guideline, indications are primarily based on dose adjustments. 29 The primary argument is the high hemorrhagic risk per se in severe CKD.

Low‐molecular‐weight heparin s (LMWHs) are preferred owing to their pharmacokinetic predictability, ease of administration without the need for monitoring. Renal clearance is indirectly proportional to molecular weight, therefore it requires dose adjustments in CKD stages 4 and 5 (Table 4). For dosage adjustment purposes, it is recommended to monitor the activity of antifactor Xa (anti‐Xa level) in order to avoid underdosage and achieve optimal therapeutic level, respectively. 16 Dosing indications are the result of either small‐scale open‐label studies, or analysis of CKD subgroups in the randomized trials, adopted by guidelines. Enoxaparin is the most commonly used low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH) and the 1‐mg/kg QD regimen recommended in severe CKD the most studied. There is no data for dalteparin and tinzaparin in severe CKD; therefore, it is preferable to avoid administering them. 16 Although preferred in cases of heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia, fondaparinux is not recommended in severe CKD.

Choice of heparin for use in treatment of VTE

For patients with CKD stage 4, 56% of respondents used enoxaparin, 29% used dalteparin and 16% used tinzaparin. This changed slightly for CKD 5 and dialysis as some units switched to using IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) with 9% and 11% of respondents using this respectively. The dosing strategies employed for each heparin across CKD stage are depicted in Fig. 2. For those respondents where LMWH dose reductions were stated the majority used a one third dose reduction in CKD stages 4 to dialysis.

Monitoring of LMWH

There were 79 respondents to the question around anti-Xa level monitoring for CKD patients on LMWH. All haematologists responded that they would perform monitoring for patients with CKD on LMWH. There was variation across other professional groups as to what monitoring would be undertaken, shown in Fig. 3, with some respondents not undertaking any monitoring. Respondents were more likely to undertake monitoring for patients with CKD stages 5 and on dialysis with 67–68% undertaking monitoring compared to only 51% monitoring anti-Xa in patients with CKD stage 4. There was variation in one centre with two nephrology doctors undertaking anti-Xa monitoring in CKD stage 5 and dialysis and two nephrology doctors not undertaking monitoring.

VTE prophylaxis

There were 79 respondents who answered the question relating to VTE thromboprophylaxis. Of respondents stating the dose, 81% in CKD stage 4 up to 88% in dialysis, used reduced doses of LMWH for VTE prophylaxis. Reduced doses included 20 mg enoxaparin, 2500units dalteparin and 2500 or 3500units of tinzaparin, supplementary Fig. 2. A small proportion, 5%, of respondents switched to using subcutaneous UFH for patients on dialysis.

### Different effect of unfractionated heparin and enoxaparin on circulating proangiogenic factors during hemodialysis: a cross-over study [^3881b317]. Cytokine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

We aimed to compare the effect of unfractionated heparin (UFH) and enoxaparin used as anticoagulants during hemodialysis (HD) on circulating levels of heparin-binding, endothelial-derived, proangiogenic factors-vascular endothelial (VEGF(165)) and basic fibroblast (bFGF) growth factor.

Methods

We enrolled 22 chronic HD patients, who were randomly assigned to either enoxaparin (n = 11) or UFH (n = 11) anticoagulation, and followed prospectively for 12 weeks before crossing over to the alternate therapy for further 12 weeks. The cytokines were measured by immunoassay at the start, at 10 and 180min of HD.

Results

The baseline VEGF(165) and bFGF levels were comparable during enoxaparin and UFH treatment. VEGF(165) significantly decreased during both enoxaparin (chi(2) ANOVA = 33.0, P < 10(-6)) and UFH (chi(2) ANOVA = 27.2, P < 10(-6)) anticoagulated HD, while over-HD bFGF remained stable regardless of the type of heparin. The switch from enoxaparin to UFH treatment was connected with 34% VEGF(165) decrease after 180min of HD and had no impact on bFGF. During UFH-anticoagulated HD 75% VEGF(165) decrease after 10min was negatively associated with heparin dosage and was more profound in patients with ischemic heart disease.

Conclusion

The traditional UFH regimen, in contrast to enoxaparin treatment, is connected with dose-depended VEGF(165) decrease during HD procedure. The biological and possible clinical relevance of this observation requires further investigations.

### Different effects of enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin on extrinsic blood coagulation during haemodialysis: a prospective study [^a4c75a76]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Heparin inhibits prothrombotic tissue factor (TF) and releases its inhibitor, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), from the endothelium, but repeated administration of heparin depletes vascular stores of TFPI. We studied the anticoagulant effects of unfractionated heparin (UFH) vs low-molecular-weight enoxaparin-used for thrice-weekly maintenance haemodialysis (HD)-on plasma levels of total TF and TFPI and on those of an activated coagulation marker prothrombin fragment 1+2 (PF 1+2).

Methods

Twenty-five patients dialysed using a single injection of enoxaparin (at a mean dose of 0.68 mg/kg) were randomly assigned to either receive UFH administered as a mean bolus of 42.1 IU/kg and continuous infusion of 57.8 IU/kg (n = 12) or to be maintained on enoxaparin (n = 13), and were followed prospectively for 12 weeks. Plasma immunoreactive TF, TFPI and PF 1+2 were measured at the start and after 10 and 180 min of HD, and compared with values in 15 healthy controls.

Results

Pre-dialysis TF, TFPI and PF 1+2 were higher than normal (all P < 0.0001). TF and PF 1+2 did not change, while TFPI levels, compared with baseline, increased at each interval in enoxaparin-anticoagulated HD patients (all P < 0.0001). TFPI increments correlated inversely with pre-dialysis TFPI (both P < 0.0007). In patients switched to UFH, TF levels remained unchanged compared with pre-randomization values, TFPI increased at each interval of HD sessions (all P < 0.035) and PF 1+2 increased pre-dialysis (P = 0.015). The over-dialysis effects of UFH resembled those of enoxaparin. In contrast, baseline TFPI and its 10-min rise correlated inversely with the UFH loading dose (both P < 0.040). Pre-dialysis PF 1+2 was inversely associated with TFPI increments (both P < 0.034), and directly with pre-dialysis TFPI (P = 0.018) and the UFH loading dose (P = 0.045).

Conclusions

Depletion of heparin-releasable stores of TFPI is an untoward effect of repeated anticoagulation during maintenance HD therapy. The traditional UFH regimen is more prothrombotic than single enoxaparin injections, with high loading doses of UFH being involved in TFPI exhaustion and subsequent hypercoagulability.

### Considerations for systemic anticoagulation in ESRD [^4a925a4d]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

In the setting of end-stage kidney disease, the incidence and risk for thrombotic events are increased and use of anticoagulants is common. The incidence of bleeding, however, is also a frequent issue and creates additional challenges in the management of anticoagulation therapy. Patients with end-stage renal disease are typically excluded from large clinical trials exploring the use of anticoagulants, which limits our knowledge of optimal management approaches. Furthermore, varying degrees of renal failure in addition to conditions that alter the pharmacokinetics of various anticoagulants or pharmacodynamic response may warrant alternative approaches to dosing. This review will explore systemic chronic anticoagulation therapy in the setting of chronic kidney disease where hemodialysis is required. Agents discussed include vitamin K antagonists, low-molecular-weight heparins, fondaparinux, oral factor Xa antagonists, and direct thrombin inhibitors. Clinical challenges, approaches to dosing regimens, and tools for measuring responses and reversal will be explored.

LMWH — Dosing for decreased renal function: For patients receiving therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) who have severe renal insufficiency (calculated creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), we suggest a reduction of the dose rather than using standard doses (Grade 2C). In enoxaparin studies reporting bleeding by calculated creatinine clearance (CalcCrCl), studies where dose was unadjusted for CalcCrCl reported 17/206 (8.3) at CalcCrCl ≤ 30 versus 96/4,081 (2.4) at CalcCrCl > 30 with OR 3.88 (1.78–8.45); studies where dose was adjusted reported 1/106 (0.9) versus 5/265 (1.9) with OR 0.58 (0.09–3.78). LMWH is primarily eliminated through renal excretion, and the evidence base is indirect and of low quality regarding how to reduce LMWH if dose reduction is chosen.

### Pharmacokinetics of the low molecular weight heparin enoxaparin during 48 h after bolus administration as an anticoagulant in haemodialysis [^067fda7b]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The interest of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) regarding bleeding risk is controversial in renal failure patients. In haemodialysis patients, there are very few data on the pharmacokinetics of LMWH after the end of the session. The aim of the study was to evaluate the duration of anticoagulation after bolus administration of the LMWH enoxaparin at the start of haemodialysis.

Methods

The pharmacokinetics of enoxaparin were studied during the 48 h following a single bolus injection at the start of the dialysis session in 30 chronic haemodialysis patients. Pharmacokinetics were determined using a population approach (Non Linear Mixed Effects Modelling).

Results

A single injection of enoxaparin at 60 U IU/kg (4000 ± 455 IU) led to an anti-Xa activity higher than 1.2 IU/ml during the first 2 h of the session, and between 0.4 and 1.2 IU during the third and fourth hours. After the end of the session, anti-Xa activity remained higher than 0.4 IU/ml up to 10 h after injection, and higher than 0.1 IU/ml up to 24 h. The pharmacokinetic model showed that only weight improved the predicted vs observed anti-Xa activity plot. The model was used to simulate single and multiple dosing with decreased enoxaparin doses. Whatever the procedure, anti-Xa activity remained high (> 0.22 ± 0.99 UI/ml) up to 12 h after the start of the dialysis session.

Conclusions

These results suggest that haemodialysis patients receiving the LMWH enoxaparin during dialysis are at risk of bleeding up to 10 h after the injection.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) dialysis anticoagulation — low‑molecular‑weight heparin (LMWH) dosing and monitoring are outlined. "The doses of low-molecular-weight heparin, as provided by the manufacturers, should be adapted to the bleeding risk of the individual patient". "Dose reduction may also be required in patients receiving daily dialysis, which increases the risk of accumulation". Because many AKI patients need deep‑vein thrombosis prophylaxis, timing the prophylactic dose at the start of dialysis "may serve the two purposes". With prolonged use, "Periodic measurement of anti-Factor Xa levels may be useful".

3.2.2 Monitoring the treatment with heparins

Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)‐based dose adjustment is still recommended for UFH to achieve an optimal therapeutic level (aPTT range 1.5‐2.0). 16 For LMWH anti‐Xa level monitoring calibrated specifically for each therapeutic agent is compulsory in CKD stages 4 and 5. The initial monitoring is performed 2 to 4 hours before and postdose. Regular twice a week monitoring could be useful. 16 Underdosage is defined as peak anti‐Xa levels < 0.5 IU/mL. Optimal therapeutic levels are 0.1 to 0.3 IU/mL for prophylactic dosing and 0.4 to 1 IU/mL for therapeutic dosing. 16 In the absence of clear guidelines and clinical trial‐based indications, adapted local protocols could be useful. Heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia is difficult to control in ESRD since fondaparinux is contraindicated. Another essential issue is the need to split the total LMWH dose into two equal doses in patients at high hemorrhage risk. This recommendation is derived from the Cochrane databases, showing that single‐dose regimens are not more effective, rather more convenient for the patient. 33

### Enoxaparin sodium [^9d1b2d95]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Intravenous (Bolus) Injection Technique

Use the multiple-dose vial for intravenous injections. Administer enoxaparin sodium through an intravenous line. Do not mix or coadminister enoxaparin sodium with other medications. Flush the intravenous access device with a sufficient volume of saline or dextrose solution prior to and following the intravenous bolus administration of enoxaparin sodium to prevent mixing of drugs. Enoxaparin sodium is compatible with normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% dextrose in water.

2.6	Monitoring for Safety

During therapy monitor complete blood counts including platelets and stool occult blood.

Assess for signs and symptoms of bleeding.

In patients with renal impairment anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium.

If during enoxaparin sodium therapy abnormal coagulation parameters or bleeding should occur, anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are not adequate for monitoring the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium.

### A comparative study of varying doses of enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis in critically ill patients: a double-blinded, randomised controlled trial [^7b0153af]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our study illustrates the inadequacy of the current standard doses of enoxaparin 40 mg QD (Europe) or 30 mg BID (North America) to yield target therapeutic range anti-Xa in critically ill patients weighing 50 to 90 kg.

It also demonstrates a clear relationship between anti-Xa levels and the dose of enoxaparin, with higher doses yielding better peak anti-Xa levels. Higher doses also allowed the establishment of near steady-state levels from the first day of enoxaparin administration.

The dual risks of VTE and bleeding, coupled with an overwhelming tendency to exclude patients with AKI continues to complicate the establishment of a strategy for thromboprophylaxis in this patient population. A weight-based dose yielded the best anti-Xa levels without an accompanying risk of bioaccumulation, and may thus be more appropriate, convenient and effective. A new study using 1 mg/kg QD enoxaparin has recently been approved by the Danish Ministry of Health. It will be conducted in AKI patients upon commencing continuous veno-venous haemofiltration, and will have clinical endpoints such as the occurrence of VTE and bleeding, length of stay, number of ventilator-free days, and mortality.

VTE maintenance and bridging guidance emphasizes VTE-specific dosing and selective use of parenteral bridging. The VTE maintenance dose of rivaroxaban should be 20 mg daily, not 15 mg daily, as studied in the PIONEER-AF-PCI trial. An unusual scenario described is a patient on a treatment dose of a DOAC for VTE prior to PCI who develops significant renal dysfunction, warranting transition to a VKA. In patients requiring a VKA, bridging with low–molecular-weight heparin is associated with increased bleeding risk and should therefore be reserved for patients judged to be at a very high risk of recurrent VTE, such as those within 3 months of a VTE.

### Safety of low-molecular-weight heparin compared to unfractionated heparin in hemodialysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^dd3affb0]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The potential publication bias detected must be taken into consideration when interpreting the results. Although the use of objective searching methods we could not eliminate this bias. Because of the lack of clear and consistent definition of major and minor bleeding in the retrieved studies, we opted to evaluate the risk of total bleeding. However, it would have been interesting to measure the risk of hemorrhage according to its severity, where major bleeding has a greater impact on the patient but also on the type of care needed. A standardized definition of major and minor bleeding needs to be used in future investigations; such definition is already provided by the subcommittee on control of anticoagulation of the scientific and standardization committee of the international society on thrombosis and haemostasis.

The random effect model cannot compensate for the entire heterogeneity found between studies. High heterogeneity could be caused by multiple factors. The inclusion of different study designs in our review. We believe that the crossover and parallel-design should not be different for the measured outcomes in this context. Because of the small number of trials, it was not possible to analyze LMWH separately. LMWH have different pharmacokinetics and kidney failure does not alter similarly their elimination. For instance, enoxaparin might seem safe when there is clear evidence of its bioaccumulation. Finally, the trials used different doses and had variable follow-up time. The dosage, the use of low or high flux dialysis, types of membranes, hemodiafiltration and hemodialysis procedures, all these factors would contribute to the measured heterogeneity.

2.6 Converting to Warfarin

To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from HEPARIN SODIUM to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

2.7 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than
Warfarin

For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered.

2.8 Extracorporeal Dialysis

Follow equipment manufacturer's operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available.

### Retrospective evaluation of a pharmacokinetic program for adjusting enoxaparin in renal impairment [^91966058]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Although clinical trials have found that enoxaparin clearance is prolonged in renal impairment, only one letter describes experience with adjusting doses. Only pharmacokinetic studies exist to guide dose adjustment in response to anti-Xa levels. Unfractionated heparin has comparable major bleeding in renal impairment compared with unadjusted enoxaparin. This necessitates a pharmacokinetic program to adjust enoxaparin with anti-Xa monitoring.

Methods

A pharmacokinetic program was created in response to adverse events and physician interest in a service. A program was designed providing all patients a loading dose of 1 mg/kg enoxaparin. Subsequent doses were 0.50 mg/kg per dose subcutaneously (SC) every 12 hours (q12h) for patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≤ 30 mL/min (severe group) and 0.75 mg/kg per dose SC q12h for patients with CrCl of 30 to 60 mL/min (moderate group). A 1-year review of 170 hospitalized patients is reported.

Results

The mean ± SD [95% CI] anti-Xa level 4 hours after the third dose was 0.65 ± 0.19 [0.59 to 0.70] IU/mL for the severe group and 0.82 ± 0.18 [0.79 to 0.85] IU/mL for the moderate group (P < .001). Eighty percent of patients with moderate renal failure and 60% of the patients with severe renal failure were in the therapeutic anti-Xa range after the third dose. A dose-adjustment ratio was used to adjust doses in patients whose levels were outside the therapeutic range: New dose = [(Current dose) x (Goal anti-Xa level)]/(Current anti-Xa level). An incidence of bleeding comparable to that found in normal patients was found.

Conclusions

In high-risk patients, it is reasonable to limit the exposure of patients to low molecular weight heparins by using anti-Xa levels as a marker. The enoxaparin protocol for renally impaired patients successfully placed patients in the therapeutic range established by consensus guidelines. The dose-adjustment ratio adds significant understanding to the pharmacokinetics of dose adjustment.

### Updated guidelines to reduce venous thromboembolism in trauma patients: a Western Trauma Association critical decisions algorithm [^1a4bf8f5]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Unfractionated Heparin for Renal Failure

Quantifying the risk and benefit of the type and initial dose of pharmacologic prophylaxis for each patient is a challenge best determined by the trauma team at bedside. As noted, 40 mg of enoxaparin twice daily is the recommended initial pharmacologic prophylaxis for most trauma patients. Detailing every indication where an alternative therapeutic or dose may be indicated is outside the scope of these guidelines; several are described below.

In the presence of end-stage renal disease or a creatinine clearance of < 30 mg/dL, subcutaneous unfractionated heparin at 5000 U every 8 hours may be initiated. Because enoxaparin is excreted by the kidneys, its administration to patients with renal failure may lead to increased bleeding complications and should be avoided. Enoxaparin has not been Food and Drug Administration approved for use in dialysis patients. Providing lower enoxaparin doses in the setting of a creatinine clearance of < 30 mg/dL while closely monitoring anti-Xa levels may be possible in the future, but additional research is necessary before this recommendation can be made. In most other settings, enoxaparin is preferable to unfractionated heparin, as enoxaparin leads to lower VTE rates without increased bleeding complications.

Brain and Spine Trauma

For TBI patients, enoxaparin is associated with less VTE and higher survival than unfractionated heparin with no difference in the progression of brain lesions, regardless if the dose was delivered in less than 24 hours after admission, between 24 to 48 hours, or after 48 hours. Similarly, those patients with spine trauma should preferentially receive early enoxaparin. Patients with brain and spine trauma should be initiated on 30 mg of enoxaparin twice daily and considered for dose adjustment by anti-Xa level.

### Treatment and prevention of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^e3f2b177]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) — prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in patients with a past history: Re-exposure to heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for anticoagulation is unlikely to be limited to < 4 days, and the limited available evidence suggests that the longer the re-exposure to heparin, the higher the likelihood of re-emergence of HIT antibodies; 25% of patients with HIT will present with thrombosis before their platelet count drops, so relying on platelet count monitoring alone may not be safe. For thromboprophylaxis, given available alternatives, re-exposure to heparin/LMWH should be avoidable in most cases. For treatment of acute thrombosis, warfarin will not inhibit active thrombin and should not be used alone to treat acute thrombosis. A recent secondary analysis of two large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found fondaparinux was less likely to exacerbate HIT, with zero out of 10 patients on fondaparinux developing clinical HIT compared with four out of four on heparin or LMWH; this suggests fondaparinux may be safe to use in patients with a previous history of HIT. Recommendation 6.3 states: In patients with a past history of HIT who have acute thrombosis (not related to HIT) and normal renal function, we suggest the use of fondaparinux at full therapeutic doses until transition to vitamin K antagonist (VKA) can be achieved (Grade 2C).

Similarly, in a multicenter, open-label, parallel group study, patients with acute proximal DVT were randomized to enoxaparin sodium or heparin. Patients who could not receive outpatient therapy were excluded from entering the study. Outpatient exclusion criteria included the following: inability to receive outpatient heparin therapy because of associated comorbid conditions or potential for non-compliance and inability to attend follow-up visits as an outpatient because of geographic inaccessibility. Eligible patients could be treated in the hospital, but ONLY enoxaparin sodium patients were permitted to go home on therapy (72%). A total of 501 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 19 to 96 years (mean age 57.8 years) with 60.5% men and 39.5% women. Patients were randomized to either enoxaparin sodium 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously or heparin intravenous bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion administered to achieve an aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds (in-patient treatment). All patients also received warfarin sodium as described in the previous study. Enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days. Enoxaparin sodium was equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism. The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 22).

"Guidelines for Delay, Reduction and/or Discontinuation of Study Medications

Dose modification for an individual subject is not permitted unless the following ensues. Modification of study medication is allowed in Arm 0 (treatment arm with enoxaparin) if the [creatinine clearance] (CrCl) falls < 15ml/min. In that instance conversion to dose adjusted IV UFH [unfractionated heparin] is acceptable during the time that the CrCl remains < 15ml/min. If the patient cannot be placed on UFH IV (difficult to obtain frequent aPTT [activated partial thromboplastin time] draws, etc), an acceptable alternative is the use of UFH SQ using the fixed-dose weight-adjusted FIDO regimen, 333U/kg SQ, followed by 250U/kg Q12 hours, without the need to obtain [activated partial thromboplastin time] aPTT monitoring. The investigator is then encouraged to convert back to treatment dose enoxaparin as per protocol once the CrCl ≥ 15ml/min. Modification is allowed in Arm 1 (prophylactic group) if the CrCl falls < 15ml/min to use [unfractionated heparin] UFH up to 22 500 U daily (i.e. UFH 5000u SQ BID or TID or 7500IU SQ BID or TID). The investigator is then encouraged to convert back to prophylactic/intermediate dose enoxaparin as per protocol once the CrCl ≥ 15ml/min".

### Excessive anticoagulation in patients with mild renal insufficiency receiving long-term therapeutic enoxaparin [^05cf32fb]. American Journal of Hematology (2001). Low credibility.

Low-molecular-weight heparins, such as enoxaparin, are increasingly being used for treatment of venous thromboembolism. We describe two patients who received therapeutic enoxaparin for several months. Although their serum creatinine values were normal, both had mild renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 60–70 ml/min), and both accumulated the drug abnormally and experienced clinical bleeding. These results suggest that patients receiving enoxaparin (or other low-molecular-weight heparins) in therapeutic doses for periods of more than 4 weeks should be considered for laboratory monitoring to avoid bleeding.

### Meta-analysis: low-molecular-weight heparin and bleeding in patients with severe renal insufficiency [^8b0418b4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Dose adjustment or laboratory monitoring of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is commonly recommended for patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min), but the basis for this recommendation is unclear.

Purpose

To compare levels of anti-Xa heparin and risk for major bleeding in LMWH-treated patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less versus those with a creatinine clearance greater than 30 mL/min by using standard weight-adjusted therapeutic doses, empirically adjusted doses, or prophylactic doses of LMWH.

Data Sources

Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library) searched to December 2005 with no language restrictions. The authors also searched reference lists and contacted experts.

Study Selection

Observational or subgroups of randomized studies that included non-dialysis-dependent patients with varying degrees of renal function who were treated with LMWH and reported creatinine clearance and anti-Xa levels or major bleeding.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data on patient characteristics, renal function, LMWH treatment, anti-Xa levels, and major bleeding. The pooled odds ratio of major bleeding in patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less was calculated by using the Peto method.

Data Synthesis

Eighteen studies using 3 preparations of LMWH (15 studies using enoxaparin, 2 using tinzaparin, and 1 using dalteparin) were included. Peak anti-Xa levels measured 4 hours after a subcutaneous injection were statistically significantly higher in patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less compared with those with a creatinine clearance greater than 30 mL/min in studies that used a standard therapeutic dose of enoxaparin (4 studies) but not in studies of empirically dose-adjusted enoxaparin (3 studies). Data were insufficient to assess the relationship between anti-Xa and renal function for prophylactic doses of enoxaparin and therapeutic doses of tinzaparin or dalteparin. In 12 studies involving 4971 patients, LMWH was associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk for major bleeding in patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less compared with those with a creatinine clearance greater than 30 mL/min (5.0% vs. 2.4%; odds ratio, 2.25 [95% CI, 1.19 to 4.27]; P = 0.013). When analyzed according to LMWH preparation, major bleeding was increased when a standard therapeutic dose of enoxaparin was used (8.3% vs. 2.4%; odds ratio, 3.88 [CI, 1.78 to 8.45]) but may not be increased when an empirically adjusted dose of enoxaparin is used (0.9% vs. 1.9%; odds ratio, 0.58 [CI, 0.09 to 3.78]; P = 0.23 for heterogeneity). There were insufficient studies to assess the risk for major bleeding with tinzaparin, dalteparin, and prophylactic doses of enoxaparin.

Limitations

The data for tinzaparin and dalteparin were limited. Data are observational, and the potential for confounding cannot be excluded.

Conclusions

Non-dialysis-dependent patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less who are treated with standard therapeutic doses of enoxaparin have elevated levels of anti-Xa and an increased risk for major bleeding. Empirical dose adjustment of enoxaparin may reduce the risk for bleeding and merits additional evaluation. No conclusions can be made regarding other LMWHs.

### Being precise with anticoagulation to reduce adverse drug reactions: are we there yet? [^8a54a913]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Renal dysfunction

Renal elimination is preferentially more important to LMWHs than UFH, although the extent of its role in LMWH clearance, compared to cellular metabolism, varies between LMWHs. LMWHs of lower molecular weight (e.g. nadroparin, enoxaparin) preferentially rely on renal elimination whereas higher molecular weight LMWHs (e.g. tinzaparin) concomitantly utilise the cellular route of elimination. Interestingly, the affinity of LMWH fragments for antithrombin also influences elimination pathway propensity, with higher affinity fragments being preferentially eliminated by the cellular saturable route.

The major LMWH RCTs generally excluded patients with renal dysfunction. However, clinical studies have reported that enoxaparin anti-Xa exposure in non-haemodialysis patients with CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min is increased at both prophylactic and therapeutic doses. Therapeutic nadroparin accumulates with decreasing renal function, but no accumulation was observed with prophylactic nadroparin in patients with a GFR of 30–50 mL/min. No anti-Xa activity accumulation has been determined at prophylactic or therapeutic doses for dalteparin or tinzaparin in renal dysfunction. Interestingly in patients on haemodialysis, no anti-Xa accumulation with prophylactic enoxaparin or prophylactic dalteparin was observed, suggesting that renal replacement therapy removes enoxaparin/dalteparin.

Although prophylactic enoxaparin is weakly associated with higher anti-Xa levels in patients with renal dysfunction, no excess bleeding has been confirmed, and anti-Xa levels have not differentiated between those with and without serious bleeding events. Importantly, a meta-analysis of 12 studies (n = 4971) found that therapeutic enoxaparin is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding in patients with CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min compared to those with CrCl > 30 mL/min. However, empirical dose reduction of therapeutic enoxaparin in patients with CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min may negate this elevated bleeding risk. Therefore, in patients with renal dysfunction requiring therapeutic LMWH, a reduced enoxaparin dose, dalteparin, tinzaparin or UFH appear reasonable selections.

Study design and procedures. This single-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group phase I study was designed and conducted at MDS Pharma Services.

At the enrollment visit (day 1), the subjects were asked to report to the study unit at least 15 h before the first scheduled dose. After check-in, eligible subjects were randomly assigned to four groups of 12 subjects each to receive twice-daily subcutaneous injections of one of the following drugs: UFH (150 U/kg; Heparin Sodium Injection, USP, 20,000 U/ml; APP Pharmaceuticals, Schaumburg, IL), enoxaparin sodium (1 mg/kg; Lovenox; Sanofi-Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ), dalteparin sodium (120 IU/kg; Fragmin; Pfizer for Eisai, New York, NY), or adomiparin sodium (125 IU/kg; Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA). The doses selected were those appropriate for the indication of ACS. The first dose was given on the morning of day 1, and the final dose was given on the morning of day 5. The subjects were confined to the clinic from at least 15 h before the first scheduled dose to 48 h after the last dose; that is, the subjects entered the clinic by the evening of day −1 and were discharged on the morning of day 7. Subjects returned for a follow-up visit 7 days after the last dose (i.e. on day 12), and for a final safety evaluation to test for the development of heparin-induced antibodies 28 days after the last dose (i.e. day 33; data not shown).

Specific to this manuscript is why or when should a laboratory consider providing services for patients receiving anticoagulation therapy that do not require routine monitoring. For decades, we have monitored unfractionated heparin (UFH) infusions, with dose adjustment based on the reported activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and in some institutions, the anti‐FXa activity. Likewise, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been monitored using the prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR) for nearly 30 years in the United States, and longer elsewhere. Adjustment of daily VKA dose was primarily based on the patient's INR result with dietary intake, and other factors also considered. When low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) became available for clinical use (1993 in the United States), the drug prescribing information (PI) indicated, "There is usually no need for daily monitoring of the effect of Lovenox in patients with normal presurgical coagulation parameters". However, notable in more recent enoxaparin labeling are pharmacokinetic (drug level) data, and subsequent iterations suggesting monitoring of anti‐FXa may be warranted in certain populations including renal insufficiency, abnormal laboratory coagulation results, or bleeding. When LMWH anticoagulation was available for the pediatric population, guidance suggesting the use of anti‐factor Xa (FXa) monitoring and dose adjustment algorithms soon followed.

Today the clinical laboratory is faced with a familiar dilemma with the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) comprising a direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran etexilate and three direct FXa inhibitors, apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. DOACs have predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic properties at fixed doses for approved indications and do not require routine monitoring to the same context as previous oral anticoagulants. However, soon after their approval, it became evident that having some capacity to measure (quantify) or detect (qualify) DOACs could be beneficial to address acute situations such as trauma, emergent surgery, neuraxial anesthesia, acute stroke, and others. Certain patient populations such as the frail elderly, renal impairment, extreme body weight, drug overdose, or interactions may also benefit for such assessment.

### Pharmacokinetic studies of dalteparin (fragmin), enoxaparin (clexane), and danaparoid sodium (orgaran) in stable chronic hemodialysis patients [^8767de08]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) and danaparoid are an alternative to unfractionated heparin (UH) for anticoagulation during hemodialysis. Few data are available concerning their duration of action and whether drug accumulation occurs with continued use. We performed a prospective randomized study of the pharmacokinetics of dalteparin and enoxaparin plus danaparoid in 21 hemodialysis patients.

Methods

Patients were randomly assigned to administration of enoxaparin, 40 mg; dalteparin, 2,500 U; or danaparoid, 34 U/kg, for 4 weeks. Antifactor Xa levels were measured at the end of weeks 1 and 4 immediately before the injection and at prescribed intervals up to 48 hours postinjection.

Results

No bleeding or thrombotic episodes occurred during the study. Mean antifactor Xa activities 4 hours postinjection were 0.2 ± 0.035 (SEM), 0.38 ± 0.028, and 0.54 ± 0.051 U/mL week 1 and 0.26 ± 0.038, 0.40 ± 0.055, and 0.64 ± 0.050 U/mL week 4 for dalteparin, enoxaparin, and danaparoid, respectively. Both weeks 1 and 4, antifactor Xa activity 3 hours postdose was significantly greater for danaparoid sodium compared with enoxaparin and dalteparin. There were no significant differences between antifactor Xa activity week 4 versus week 1 for enoxaparin and dalteparin; however, danaparoid sodium levels during dialysis were significantly greater after 4 weeks of treatment (P = 0.0328, 1 hour; P = 0.003, 2 hours; P = 0.0128, 3 and 4 hours).

Conclusion

Dalteparin and enoxaparin provide adequate anticoagulation for hemodialysis using single bolus injections at relatively low doses. Danaparoid sodium at the current recommended dosage resulted in greater anticoagulation than enoxaparin or dalteparin and may have an

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in renal insufficiency — pharmacokinetics and bleeding risk — are characterized by trial exclusions at creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≤ 30 mL/min, strong correlations of anti-Xa clearance with CrCl including enoxaparin (R = 0.85, P < .001), and accumulation with repeated dosing: a linear correlation between CrCl and anti-Xa levels (P < .0005) with significantly increased levels in CrCl < 30 mL/min, reduced anti-Xa clearance by 39% and 35% higher exposure vs CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min after prophylactic dosing, and correlation for nadroparin but not tinzaparin (R = 0.49, P < .002) even when CrCl was as low as 20 mL/min. In 12 studies involving 4,971 patients, major bleeding with CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min had OR 2.25 (95% CI, 1.19–4.27); with therapeutic-dose enoxaparin bleeding was 8.3% vs 2.4% (OR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.78–8.45), whereas empirical dose reduction showed 0.9% vs 1.9% (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.09–3.78). Additional findings include increased risk with enoxaparin at CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min in ESSENCE/TIMI 11B (RR = 6.1; 95% CI, 2.47–14.88), RR 2.8 (95% CI, 1.0–7.8) for CrCl < 20 mL/min in another study, and retrospective data showing RR 2.3 for any bleeding and RR 5.0 for major hemorrhage. In severe renal insufficiency requiring therapeutic anticoagulation, use of unfractionated heparin (UFH) avoids problems from impaired LMWH clearance, and an estimated CrCl of about 30 mL/min is noted as a reasonable cutoff based on available literature.

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) dosing in renal insufficiency — For treatment dosing of enoxaparin in impaired renal function, dose reduction may be used in patients with CrCl < 30 mL/min, and the recommended treatment dose for patients with a CrCl < 30 mL/min who have acute coronary syndromes or VTE is 50% of the usual dose (ie, 1 mg/kg once daily); no specific recommendations have been made for other LMWH preparations. With prophylactic dosing in renal failure, higher anti-Xa levels have been observed but the mean peak anti-Xa level was only 0.6 units/mL, the trough was < 0.2 units/mL, and no increased bleeding was observed. In critically ill populations, dalteparin bioaccumulation was not observed despite repeated dosing, and subcutaneous dalteparin (5,000 International Units) given daily to ICU patients with estimated creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min showed no evidence of drug accumulation nor was the risk of bleeding increased. For pharmacologic venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis with CrCl < 30 mL/min, the manufacturer of enoxaparin recommends that 30 mg once daily be used; in a small comparative study of enoxaparin (40 mg once daily) or tinzaparin (4,500 units once daily), bioaccumulation of enoxaparin, but not tinzaparin, was seen over 8 days of exposure.

Anticoagulant Transitioning

As with any high‐risk medication such as anticoagulants, clinical situations may arise that require transitioning to or off of DOAC therapy. Two common transition scenarios include (1) switching between anticoagulants and (2) periprocedural management.

Switching Between Anticoagulants

It is not uncommon to require transition from one anticoagulant to another because of either cost, comorbid conditions, patient preference, hospitalization, thrombotic complications, bleeding complications, or procedures. Five scenarios exist that comprise DOAC therapy switching from/to another anticoagulant:
VKA to DOAC
DOAC to VKA
DOAC to DOAC
DOAC to parenteral anticoagulant
Parenteral anticoagulant to DOAC

For all scenarios, assessment of each drug's pharmacokinetic profile (ie, half‐life), pharmacodynamics profile (INR for VKA or activated partial thromboplastin time for unfractionated heparin, etc), as well as patients' renal function, must be taken into account. The ultimate goal is to limit interruption of the therapeutic anticoagulation during the transition to minimize the risk of atherothrombosis. In certain cases, this requires overlap of the 2 anticoagulants. See Table 6. 92

Table 6
Algorithm for Switching Between Anticoagulants

Transitioning between VKA and DOAC and vice versa requires additional explanation that takes into account the INR measurement. When transitioning from a VKA to a DOAC, the half‐life of the VKA compound is imperative to guide therapy. Since warfarin is the principle VKA utilized in the United States, with a half‐life of ≈36 to 48 hours, it is advisable to stop warfarin and check INR at least 3 days later. DOACs can be initiated once the INR is ≤ 2; see Table 7 for management strategies based on INR values. 38 When converting from a DOAC to a VKA, providers should administer DOACs concomitantly with VKAs because of the VKAs' known slow onset of action (≈5–10 days). 38 An INR should be rechecked between days 3 and 5 of warfarin therapy. INRs should be checked just before the dose of the DOAC because of their ability to elevate INR values. The INRs should be monitored frequently for at least the first month until INR stability has been achieved (ie, ≥ 3 consecutive INR readings at goal).

### Enoxaparin sodium [^00f96e2a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4	Risk of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia with or without Thrombosis

Enoxaparin sodium may cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITTS). HITTS may lead to organ infarction, limb ischemia, or death. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely.

Use of enoxaparin sodium in patients with a history of immune-mediated HIT within the past 100 days or in the presence of circulating antibodies is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. Circulating antibodies may persist for several years.

Only use enoxaparin sodium in patients with a history of HIT if more than 100 days have elapsed since the prior HIT episode and no circulating antibodies are present. Because HIT may still occur in these circumstances, the decision to use enoxaparin sodium in such a case must be made only after a careful benefit-risk assessment and after non-heparin alternative treatments are considered.

5.5	Thrombocytopenia

Thrombocytopenia can occur with the administration of enoxaparin sodium.

Moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between 100,000/mm3and 50,000/mm3) occurred at a rate of 1.3% in patients given enoxaparin sodium, 1.2% in patients given heparin, and 0.7% in patients given placebo in clinical trials.

Platelet counts less than 50,000/mm3occurred at a rate of 0.1% in patients given enoxaparin sodium, in 0.2% of patients given heparin, and 0.4% of patients given placebo in the same trials.

Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3, enoxaparin sodium should be discontinued.

5.6	Interchangeability with other Heparins

Enoxaparin sodium cannot be used interchangeably (unit for unit) with heparin or other low molecular weight heparins as they differ in manufacturing process, molecular weight distribution, anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, units, and dosage. Each of these medicines has its own instructions for use.

### Achievement of therapeutic anti-Xa levels in a proven heparin-resistant patient through the use of nontraditional high-dose enoxaparin [^1d3bf77d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the successful use of high-dose enoxaparin therapy (1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously twice daily) to attain a therapeutic anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) level in a cancer patient with heparin resistance.

Case Summary

A proven heparin-resistant patient with venous thromboembolism (VTE) and lung cancer who required approximately 66 000 units of unfractionated heparin daily was successfully transitioned to an off-label high-dose enoxaparin (OLHDE) 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously twice daily. The patient was maintained on this same dose, and therapeutic levels were confirmed via use of the anti-Xa monitoring test. The patient was able to be discharged from the medical floor on this same dose with no further complications of VTE noted. No adverse events from this dosing were observed during the duration of therapy.

Discussion

Options for overcoming heparin resistance are limited to case reports and small studies. The best course of treatment in the cancer patient is unclear. OLHDE allowed for the transition from intravenous to subcutaneous medication and transition off the medical floor. This case supports the use of OLHDE as a therapeutic option in heparin-resistant patients with cancer. Further study is needed to confirm the efficacy of OLHDE in this patient population.

Conclusion

High-dose enoxaparin may be an option to treat cancer patients with confirmed heparin resistance and venous thromboembolism.

 Hemodialysis

In a single study, elimination rate appeared similar but AUC was two-fold higher than control population, after a single 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg intravenous dose.

 Hepatic Impairment

Studies with enoxaparin sodium in patients with hepatic impairment have not been conducted and the impact of hepatic impairment on the exposure to enoxaparin is unknown.

 Weight

After repeated subcutaneous 1.5 mg/kg once-daily dosing, mean AUC of anti-Factor Xa activity is marginally higher at steady state in obese healthy volunteers (BMI 30–48 kg/m2) compared to non-obese control subjects, while Amaxis not increased.

When non-weight adjusted dosing was administered, it was found after a single-subcutaneous 40 mg dose, that anti-Factor Xa exposure is 52% higher in low-weight women (< 45 kg) and 27% higher in low-weight men (< 57 kg) when compared to normal weight control subjects [see Use in Specific Populations ()].

 Pharmacokinetic Interaction

No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between enoxaparin sodium and thrombolytics when administered concomitantly.

Unstable Angina and Non–Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours in conjunction with oral aspirin therapy (100 to 325 mg once daily) in patients with unstable angina or non–Q-wave myocardial infarction. Treat with enoxaparin sodium for a minimum of 2 days and continue until clinical stabilization. The usual duration of treatment is 2 to 8 days [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Studies (14.5)].

Treatment of Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is a single intravenous bolus of 30 mg plus a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous dose followed by 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours (maximum 100 mg for the first two doses only, followed by 1 mg/kg dosing for the remaining doses) in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Reduce the dosage in patients ≥ 75 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Unless contraindicated, administer aspirin to all patients as soon as they are identified as having STEMI and continue dosing with 75 to 325 mg once daily.

When administered in conjunction with a thrombolytic (fibrin specific or non–fibrin specific), administer enoxaparin sodium between 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after the start of fibrinolytic therapy. The usual duration of enoxaparin sodium therapy is 8 days or until hospital discharge.

For patients managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), if the last enoxaparin sodium subcutaneous administration was given less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is needed. If the last enoxaparin sodium subcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation, administer an intravenous bolus of 0.3 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.3	Dose Reduction for Patients with Severe Renal Impairment

The recommended prophylaxis and treatment dosage regimens for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) are described in Table 1 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Although no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min and creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min, observe these patients frequently for signs and symptoms of bleeding.

### Management of venous thromboembolism: recent advances in oral anticoagulation therapy [^b0c7bbc3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Considerations in Incorporating DOACs in the Management of VTE

Recently published antithrombotic guidelines support the use of DOAC agents over VKA therapy (Grade 2B recommendation) in patients with DVT or PE without cancer. Despite the significant advance that DOACs represent, they are not without risk, and thus, clinicians need to consider a number of clinical issues to optimize treatment. Assessment of the following factors may be helpful in selecting one DOAC over another or, alternatively, oral anticoagulation with a VKA.

Pharmacokinetic and Dosing Considerations

The pharmacokinetic characteristics of DOACs have been well described. Because the DOACs have predictable and stable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, unlike VKAs, routine monitoring of anticoagulant activity is not required. However, it is important to note that in clinical scenarios where the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic response may be altered significantly (eg, organ dysfunction or drug-drug interactions), there currently is no readily available coagulation assay approved in the United States that can precisely assess the level of anticoagulation for any of the DOACs. For information on currently available coagulation assays to measure the level of anticoagulation with DOACs, the reader is referred to several recent reviews. Despite this gap, the great majority of patients can be appropriately managed with standard fixed doses for each DOAC, which greatly simplifies many aspects of patient management compared with VKAs. The potential for dosing errors with DOACs is still present, however. The 4 agents have achieved regulatory approval in the United States for the treatment of acute or chronic VTE, each with a different dosing scheme that may differ by indication, adding some complexity for the clinician when selecting the appropriate dose. Table 1 highlights the approved dosing regimens per indication for the DOACs available in the United States.

Depending on the health care setting, clinicians may routinely interact with patients on different DOACs, and care must be taken to ensure appropriateness of the chosen therapy and initial dose. In addition, transition from injectable agent to oral DOAC (dabigatran, edoxaban) or from oral high dose to oral maintenance dose (rivaroxaban at 21 days, apixaban at 7 days) should be implemented at the appropriate juncture. Particularly at times of transitions of care (ie, bridging), the practitioner may be faced with multiple decisions regarding switching agents or alternative anticoagulation. Data to support best practice in switching from VKA to a DOAC or vice versa are, however, limited, although the phase 3 DOAC trials in VTE and atrial fibrillation (AF) as well as best practice reports provide some information.-

It adds, "Switching to an alternate OAC should also be considered after a bleeding event, particularly in cases in which a specific cause is identified", with examples: "in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR, switching to a DOAC should be considered", and "a decrease in renal function may increase DOAC drug levels and prompt switching to a VKA".

Special Populations

Gender

Apparent clearance and Amaxderived from anti-Factor Xa values following single subcutaneous dosing (40 mg and 60 mg) were slightly higher in males than in females. The source of the gender difference in these parameters has not been conclusively identified; however, body weight may be a contributing factor.

Geriatric

Apparent clearance and Amaxderived from anti-Factor Xa values following single and multiple subcutaneous dosing in geriatric subjects were close to those observed in young subjects. Following once a day subcutaneous dosing of 40 mg enoxaparin, the Day 10 mean area under anti-Factor Xa activity versus time curve (AUC) was approximately 15% greater than the mean Day 1 AUC value [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Renal impairment

A linear relationship between anti-Factor Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady state has been observed, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function. Anti-Factor Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady state, is marginally increased in patients with creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min and patients with creatinine clearance 30 to < 50 mL/min after repeated subcutaneous 40 mg once-daily doses. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), the AUC at steady state is significantly increased on average by 65% after repeated subcutaneous 40 mg once-daily doses [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Hemodialysis

In a single study, elimination rate appeared similar but AUC was two-fold higher than control population, after a single 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg intravenous dose.

Hepatic impairment

Studies with enoxaparin in patients with hepatic impairment have not been conducted and the impact of hepatic impairment on the exposure to enoxaparin is unknown.

Weight

After repeated subcutaneous 1.5 mg/kg once-daily dosing, mean AUC of anti-Factor Xa activity is marginally higher at steady state in obese healthy volunteers (BMI 30–48 kg/m2) compared to non-obese control subjects, while Amaxis not increased.

When non–weight-adjusted dosing was administered, it was found after a single-subcutaneous 40 mg dose, that anti-Factor Xa exposure is 52% higher in low-weight women (< 45 kg) and 27% higher in low-weight men (< 57 kg) when compared to normal weight control subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.8)].

Warfarin (Coumadin) has half-life 40 h and drug elimination 200 with effect detected by PT/INR or chromogenic factor X, and reversal with 4F-PCC (Kcentra), plasma; a footnote specifies plasma only if 4F-PCC is unavailable. Low molecular weight heparins enoxaparin (Lovenox) and dalteparin (Fragmin) list half-life 2–6 h and drug elimination 10–30, detected by Anti-Xa assay, with Protamine as reversal. Unfractionated heparin lists half-life 1.5–2 h and drug elimination 7.5–10 with PTT, anti-Xa assay, and Protamine reversal. Dabigatran (Pradaxa) shows half-life 12–17 h and drug elimination 60–85 with TT and ecarin clotting time used for detection and Idarucizumab (Praxbind) for reversal. Among factor Xa inhibitors, apixaban (Eliquis) has half-life 15 h and drug elimination 75 with Anti-Xa assay and an apixaban assay where available, and reversal Andexanet alfa (Andexxa) PCC; rivaroxaban (Xarelto) has half-life 9–13 h and drug elimination 45–65 with Anti-Xa assay and a rivaroxaban assay where available, and reversal Andexanet alfa (Andexxa) PCC. A pharmacokinetic note states that after 5 half-lives the amount of drug remaining is approximately 3%, and time to normal hemostasis may vary with these drugs in patients with renal failure as a result of renal excretion of the medications.

### Anti-Xa monitoring of enoxaparin for acute coronary syndromes in patients with renal disease [^8d64e60d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

There are limited data on dosing of enoxaparin in patients with renal disease due to the routine exclusion of this population in clinical trials. To account for the potentially delayed drug elimination in these patients, we developed guidelines for adjusting enoxaparin dosing based on anti-Xa monitoring.

Objective

To evaluate anti-Xa level monitoring, resulting from the standards of practice as set out by our hospital's guidelines for enoxaparin dosing in renally impaired patients.

Methods

A total of 72 separate acute coronary syndrome patient admissions were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had anti-Xa levels taken and creatinine clearance values < 30 mL/min during enoxaparin therapy.

Results

The average trough anti-Xa level at the once- and twice-daily doses was 0.40 and 0.72 IU/mL, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, only 6% of the trough concentrations were in the target range of 0.2–0.3 IU/mL compared with 36% with once-daily dosing. Of the 22 patients who had a change of dosing frequency from twice to once daily, 5% of trough anti-Xa levels were ≤ 0.5 IU/mL with twice-daily versus 68% with once-daily dosing.

Conclusions

Although the relationship between anti-Xa activity, efficacy, and adverse effects has not been definitively established, anti-Xa levels can assist with dosing of enoxaparin in renally impaired patients. Our hospital guidelines are effective in adjusting dosing to reach target anti-Xa levels.

2.4	Pediatric Use

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients:

2.5	Cardiovascular Surgery

Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes.

2.6	Converting to Warfarin

To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

2.7	Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin

For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered.

2.8	Extracorporeal Dialysis

Follow equipment manufacturer's operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available.

### Alternative methods of anticoagulation for dialysis-dependent patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^35c00f4d]. Seminars in Dialysis (2003). Low credibility.

Dialysis patients who are continually exposed to heparin are at risk for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Heparin-induced antibodies have been reported to occur in 0–12% of hemodialysis (HD) patients. The diagnosis or suspicion of HIT in this patient population requires careful confirmation of the diagnosis and substitution of heparin with an alternate anticoagulant for dialysis. Alternate agents such as the direct thrombin inhibitors (hirudin and argatroban) are available, but careful dosing and monitoring of the anticoagulant effect are required. Despite careful dosing, hemorrhagic complications have occurred with these agents. Unfortunately there are limited options for treatment of hemorrhagic complications and no specific antidotes are available for the direct thrombin inhibitors. In this report the currently available alternatives to heparin for dialysis, including dosing and monitoring recommendations, are reviewed.

4.2 What we do not know

Heparin‐based anticoagulation is challenging in patients undergoing dialysis. Poor anticoagulation can affect the quality of dialysis session. Patients undergoing dialysis frequently receive OACs or platelet antiaggregants. That is why systemic anticoagulation becomes a sensitive matter in long‐term hemodialysis. UFH is used according to a classic protocol, while LMWHs are administered as a bolus dose at the start of dialysis and heparin‐like molecules are administered in particular situations. The attitude towards LMWH use in hemodialysis patients is variable. The FDA has not approved their use in the United States, while other local guidelines either recommend them, or do not provide clear indications. 39 According to several small‐scale studies and a meta‐analysis published in 2004, LMWHs appear to be safe and as effective as UFH. For these reasons, a protocol for the prospective monitoring and use of heparin‐based anticoagulation in hemodialysis patients with VTE was initiated in 2015 and is still ongoing. 39

Oral anticoagulation. Although OACs are necessary in severe CKD and ESRD, evidence is inconsistent, often of unsatisfactory quality, and it draws attention to the potentiation of hemorrhagic risks. There are available data for warfarin, but data for DOACs are entirely inconclusive. In patients with AF, the existing guidelines have a different approach. The American guideline recommends warfarin even in dialysis patients with CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score ≥ 2 and INR between 2 and 3 (class IIa, LOE B) and does not allow the use of dabigatran and rivaroxaban in ESRD and dialysis patients. Equally important is the recommendation to initiate therapy after a strictly individualized evaluation of the risk‐benefit ratio. 19 The ESC guideline recommends the preferential use of DOACs in patients with eGFR 5 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and does not provide information for dialysis. For CKD requiring renal transplantation, there are no randomized trials and thus DOACs should be administered according to eGFR also considering the possible interactions with the immunosuppressant medication. 18 Both guidelines highlight how difficult it is to provide standard recommendations in the absence of randomized controlled trials. 9

### The effect of prophylactic anticoagulation on major bleeding events in hospitalized patients with chronic kidney disease and lower limb fractures: a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [^8735dd13]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Another limitation of our study is that enoxaparin was administered at 40 mg once daily, which reflects local practice but differs from internationally recommended renal-adjusted regimens (e.g. 30 mg daily in the United States and 20 mg daily in certain UK centers). Therefore, our results should be interpreted cautiously, and further multicenter studies using different dosing strategies are needed to confirm the external validity of our findings. Because the routes of administration for enoxaparin and placebo differed, complete blinding of all study personnel was not feasible. Although outcome assessors and investigators were blinded to group allocation, the treating nurses were aware of the intervention. This partial unblinding represents a potential source of performance bias, although its impact on the study's primary outcomes is likely minimal. The strength of our clinical trial is the design. To our knowledge, this is the first study to test this hypothesis, capturing relevant data on systemic bleeding and thrombosis.

The clinical implications of our results may encourage orthopedic surgeons and nephrologists to consider individualizing each patient case before systematically prescribing anticoagulant prophylaxis to patients with advanced CKD and lower limb fractures, considering the risks of bleeding and thrombosis, analyzing each case individually, and discussing it with the patients. In addition, our study may inform a multicenter clinical trial that includes a larger number of patients.

### Transition to an oral anticoagulant in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^3529d032]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Recommendations for transitioning from therapy with heparin or a low-molecular-weight heparin preparation to therapy with an oral anticoagulant in patients with acute venous or arterial thromboembolism have undergone several changes during the last two decades. Physicians are now comfortable with beginning treatment with an oral anticoagulant once the diagnosis is confirmed, and loading doses are no longer considered to be necessary. Exceptions to early transition may be necessary in patients with an extensive iliofemoral or axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism where thrombolytic agents may be indicated, or in individuals who require surgery or other invasive procedures, or if there are concerns about bleeding. The avoidance of early transition to oral anticoagulants in patients with acute heparin-induced thrombocytopenia also has been advised because of the potential for further thrombotic complications, including venous limb gangrene and warfarin-induced skin necrosis.

### Haemodialysis in patients treated with oral anticoagulant: should we heparinize? [^ed408477]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Anticoagulation for the haemodialysis circuit in patients treated with oral anticoagulation poses additional haemorrhagic risk. The few available data suggest that tapering or even stopping heparinization is feasible and the HeprAN membrane with grafted heparin was developed to decrease heparin dose. The objective of our study was to evaluate the need for additional anticoagulation in patients on long-term oral anticoagulation, according to the type of membrane used.

Methods

This is a prospective, randomized, crossover bifactorial trial in haemodialysed patients on oral anticoagulation. Each patient had four haemodialysis sessions with two different membranes [HeprAN or polysulphone (PS)] and with or without enoxaparin. Clinical coagulation was evaluated by the need for premature ending and by a visual score (Janssen scale). Coagulation activation markers were also measured: d-dimers, prothrombin fragments 1 + 2, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, tissue factor pathway inhibitor and platelet factor-4.

Results

Ten patients were included (M/F = 4/6, mean age 63 ± 15 years). None of the 40 sessions ended prematurely. The clotting scores were similar with or without enoxaparin (dialyser: 1.49 ± 0.19 versus 1.53 ± 0.17, P = 0.97; bubble trap: 0.75 ± 0.19 versus 0.78 ± 0.22, P = 0.62) and with the polysulphone or the HeprAN membrane (dialyser: 1.54 ± 0.20 versus 1.47 ± 0.16, P = 0.65; bubble trap: 0.74 ± 0.22 versus 0.79 ± 0.19, P = 0.58). There was no significant difference in coagulation activation markers between dialysis modalities; however, dialysis efficacy was significantly greater with the PS membrane (1.58 ± 0.07 versus 1.43 ± 0.06, P = 0.02).

Conclusions

These results suggest that haemodialysis without additional anticoagulation is possible in patients with oral anticoagulation. The HeprAN membrane did not provide any additional benefit compared with a PS membrane.

Values and preferences — Use of NOACs in chronic kidney disease emphasizes simple dosing and lack of international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring compared with vitamin K antagonists, leading to a substantial reduction in burden for patients and health services; there is also good evidence for improved efficacy with a relatively similar safety profile, and most fully informed people with CKD would be expected to select a NOAC over a vitamin K antagonist.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the prophylactic dose of enoxaparin once daily over 4 days in patients with renal impairment [^d4c97c37]. Thrombosis Research (2002). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of the low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin were evaluated in 12 healthy volunteers and 36 patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment. Enoxaparin was administered once daily by subcutaneous injections at a dose of 40 mg for 4 days and venous blood samples were taken over a 5-day period to determine antifactor Xa and antifactor IIa activity and the activated partial thromboplastin time. Adverse events were also recorded. The results for anti-Xa activity showed that the rate of absorption of enoxaparin was similar across the four groups of study participants. The elimination half-life increased with the degree of renal impairment, and this relationship was more evident after repeated dosing. Anti-Xa exposure was not significantly different between healthy volunteers and patients with mild or moderate renal impairment, but was significantly increased in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 ml/min). Anti-Xa clearance decreased with the degree of renal impairment after repeated dosing, but only the difference between patients with severe renal impairment and healthy volunteers was statistically significant, the clearance on Day 4 being 39% lower in patients with severe renal impairment than in healthy volunteers (P = 0.0001). Anti-IIa activity was low in all study participants, and the activated partial thromboplastin time was not significantly different between the study groups. In conclusion, the clearance of enoxaparin is reduced in patients with severe renal impairment. Dose adjustment of enoxaparin may need to be recommended in these patients, but no recommendation can be made in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.
