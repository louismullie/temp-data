## Question

Does rhabdo cause muscle weakness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether rhabdomyolysis causes muscle weakness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how rhabdomyolysis is clinically defined and whether weakness is part of the core definition. Then, I should verify data on the classic symptom triad and real-world prevalence of weakness in cohorts. Next, I will review pathophysiology to confirm the causal link to weakness. After that, I need to check high-credibility guideline statements and drug safety labeling that use weakness as a sentinel sign. Finally, I will consider exceptions and clinical implications for evaluation and monitoring so I can answer with nuance and practical guidance.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions too quickly. Rhabdomyolysis is consistently described as an acute skeletal muscle injury with myofiber necrosis and release of intracellular contents, presenting with muscle pain, weakness, and swelling as commonly implicated features; the AAST 2022 consensus explicitly lists acute muscle weakness among the typical findings, which aligns with standard neuromuscular reviews that characterize rhabdomyolysis by pain and/or weakness with marked CK elevation [^113Nf4QD] [^116mXx2Z].

> Wait, I should verify the "classic triad" versus what patients actually report, because I don't want to overstate it. The triad of myalgia, weakness, and dark urine is taught classically, but large pediatric ED series show the triad is infrequently complete even though weakness remains common; in one cohort, 73% had muscle weakness and 83.8% had myalgia, whereas dark urine was present in only 5.4%, and similar data are echoed in companion reports from the same setting, reinforcing that weakness is a frequent clinical feature even when the triad is incomplete [^114qZkKj] [^1143VZsR]. Hold on, I almost implied the full triad is the norm; it is not, especially in children, but the high prevalence of weakness still supports the core claim [^114qZkKj] [^1143VZsR].

> I need to check the pathophysiological mechanism to ensure causality makes sense. The breakdown and necrosis of muscle fibers directly impair contractile function, producing objective weakness, while releasing CK and myoglobin; authoritative reviews and electrodiagnostic series explicitly link acute myofiber necrosis to myalgia, edema, and weakness, which mechanistically explains why weakness accompanies clinical rhabdomyolysis rather than being a mere association [^116mXx2Z] [^114nimxa] [^116WceMs].

> Let me consider corroborating signals from high-credibility drug safety sources, but I should be careful to distinguish myopathy from frank rhabdomyolysis. FDA labeling for multiple statins repeatedly instructs clinicians to suspect myopathy/rhabdomyolysis in the presence of muscle pain or weakness and to stop therapy if myopathy is suspected, reflecting the regulatory view that weakness is a sentinel symptom on the spectrum that includes rhabdomyolysis; large meta-analyses and safety reviews similarly separate nonmyopathic muscle symptoms from myopathy/rhabdomyolysis while confirming that reported muscular weakness is a key clinical signal warranting evaluation for rhabdomyolysis risk [^112QxCki] [^11798seB] [^114dTYPJ]. Wait, to be precise, weakness alone doesn't prove rhabdomyolysis, but in the right context it is a red flag within the same pathobiological continuum [^112wy938] [^113UuxQw].

> But wait, what about exceptions and edge cases, so I don't overgeneralize. I should double-check that some rhabdomyolysis cases can be oligosymptomatic or even asymptomatic aside from CK elevation, and that baseline strength may be near-normal outside acute episodes in certain genetic predispositions; indeed, reviews and cohort descriptions note variable symptom expression, and individuals with RYR1-related rhabdomyolysis/myalgia can have near-normal strength at baseline, yet during acute rhabdomyolysis, weakness remains a common and often defining feature across etiologies, with occasional reports of severe weakness or even paralysis in acute viral-associated cases, underscoring the spectrum of severity [^116WceMs] [^11457SYf] [^115wV5fp]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost suggested weakness is universal; it is not universal, but it is expected frequently enough to be included in standard definitions and diagnostic descriptions of rhabdomyolysis [^1123GacT] [^116mXx2Z].

> Next, I should review what this means clinically so I give actionable advice. If rhabdomyolysis is suspected in a patient with new weakness plus compatible risks or symptoms, I need to check CK urgently, screen renal function, and monitor for complications; AAST recommends serial CK to peak and downtrend, prompt correction of hyperkalemia and other electrolytes, and a high index of suspicion in trauma, exertional states, toxin or drug exposures, ischemia–reperfusion, and medical conditions causing high metabolic demand on myocytes beyond ATP supply, all of which place weakness in the correct evaluative context [^111bexD2] [^1138FSbc] [^111Bsg8M] [^115HdJe4] [^111dZZ2c]. Hold on, I should verify that general muscle weakness algorithms also advise medication/toxin review and targeted testing; AAFP guidance does recommend a careful medication review and a stepwise workup when weakness is present, which dovetails with rhabdomyolysis evaluation pathways [^112N2b4P] [^116VvQJy].

> In conclusion, I can now answer confidently but I need to ensure the wording reflects the evidence hierarchy. Yes, rhabdomyolysis causes muscle weakness, and weakness is best understood as a common and often defining clinical feature of the syndrome, supported by consensus guidelines, pathophysiological reasoning, and cohort data, with severity ranging from mild proximal weakness to profound paralysis in severe cases; clinicians should treat new-onset weakness in an at-risk patient as a prompt to evaluate urgently for rhabdomyolysis with CK testing and renal/electrolyte monitoring [^113Nf4QD] [^1123GacT] [^114qZkKj] [^116WceMs].

Rhabdomyolysis causes **muscle weakness** due to acute muscle fiber necrosis and loss of contractile function [^116mXx2Z] [^113Nf4QD]. Weakness is typically proximal, symmetric, and can be severe enough to impair mobility or cause respiratory compromise. It usually improves over days to weeks with treatment, but persistent weakness can occur if there is extensive muscle necrosis, compartment syndrome, or underlying myopathy [^116WceMs] [^114nimxa]. Early **recognition and management** are essential to prevent complications and support recovery.

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of muscle weakness in rhabdomyolysis

Muscle weakness in rhabdomyolysis arises from **interconnected mechanisms**:

- **Muscle fiber necrosis**: Direct injury causes necrosis and loss of contractile function, leading to acute weakness [^117SPTVb].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia impair neuromuscular transmission and exacerbate weakness [^111Bsg8M] [^1135ZYHJ].

- **Metabolic derangements**: ATP depletion and metabolic acidosis further impair muscle function [^117SPTVb].

- **Inflammatory response**: Cytokine-mediated inflammation increases muscle damage and weakness [^116WceMs].

---

## Clinical presentation of muscle weakness in rhabdomyolysis

Muscle weakness in rhabdomyolysis typically **presents acutely** and is often accompanied by characteristic symptoms [^116mXx2Z]:

| **Clinical feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Onset | - Acute <br/> - Developing over hours to days [^112CTP3q] |
| Distribution | - Proximal <br/> - Symmetric <br/> - Affecting large muscle groups (e.g. thighs, shoulders) |
| Severity | - Ranges from mild weakness to severe paralysis <br/> - Potentially causing respiratory compromise [^115wV5fp] [^116WceMs] |
| Associated symptoms | - Myalgia <br/> - Muscle swelling <br/> - Dark urine (myoglobinuria) <br/> - Fatigue <br/> - Malaise [^1123GacT] [^116WceMs] |

---

## Severity and duration of muscle weakness

Severity and duration vary with the **extent of muscle damage** and the **underlying cause** [^116WceMs]. Severity ranges from mild to severe, and some patients experience **complete paralysis** of affected muscle groups [^115wV5fp]. Duration typically improves over days to weeks with appropriate treatment; however, **persistent weakness** may occur with **extensive muscle necrosis**, **compartment syndrome**, or **underlying myopathies** [^116mXx2Z].

---

## Factors influencing the severity of muscle weakness

Several factors **influence severity** in rhabdomyolysis:

- **Extent of muscle damage**: Greater muscle necrosis results in more severe weakness [^116mXx2Z].

- **Underlying medical conditions**: Pre-existing myopathies, metabolic disorders, or genetic predispositions can exacerbate weakness [^1128c9Fw].

- **Electrolyte imbalances**: Severe hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, or metabolic acidosis worsen muscle weakness [^111Bsg8M] [^1135ZYHJ].

- **Delayed treatment**: Late recognition and management increase the risk of severe weakness and complications [^112CTP3q].

---

## Recovery and persistence of muscle weakness

Muscle weakness in rhabdomyolysis generally **improves with appropriate treatment** — aggressive hydration [^116WceMs], electrolyte correction [^1138FSbc], and rest [^113Fu4rq]. Persistent weakness may result from **extensive muscle necrosis** with irreversible damage, **compartment syndrome** with ischemic injury and permanent deficits, or **underlying genetic or metabolic myopathies** that predispose to recurrent rhabdomyolysis and chronic weakness [^116mXx2Z].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **early recognition and management** of muscle weakness in rhabdomyolysis:

- **Early recognition**: Suspect rhabdomyolysis in patients with acute muscle weakness, myalgia, and elevated CK levels [^113Nf4QD] [^111bexD2].

- **Aggressive hydration**: Early intravenous fluid resuscitation to prevent acute kidney injury and support muscle recovery [^116WceMs].

- **Electrolyte correction**: Prompt correction of hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and metabolic acidosis to improve muscle function [^111Bsg8M] [^1138FSbc].

- **Rest and rehabilitation**: Gradual return to activity after clinical resolution and normalization of CK levels [^116jLvFs].

---

## Conclusion

Rhabdomyolysis causes **muscle weakness** through acute muscle fiber necrosis, electrolyte disturbances, and metabolic derangements. Weakness is typically proximal and symmetric with an acute onset, but it can persist if there is extensive muscle necrosis, compartment syndrome, or an underlying myopathy. **Early recognition and management are essential** to prevent complications and support recovery [^116WceMs].

### Exercise-induced abdominal wall muscle injury resulting in rhabdomyolysis and mimicking an acute abdomen [^1134cu5T]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is characterized by muscle necrosis and the release of intracellular constituents, causing muscle pain, weakness, and myoglobinuria. This condition can be attributed to muscle injury following strenuous exercise. If the abdominal wall is involved, the clinical presentation may resemble an acute abdomen.

- **Case**: A 27-year-old woman, gravida 4 para 2, presented with swelling and pain of the mons pubis and abdominal pain after intense powerlifting 2 days prior. A computed tomography scan was performed, revealing abdominal wall inflammation. Although myoglobinuria was absent, there was high suspicion for rhabdomyolysis, which was confirmed by an elevated creatine kinase level. The patient improved after receiving intravenous fluids and abstaining from physical activity.

- **Conclusion**: Abdominal wall muscle injury resulting in rhabdomyolysis can imitate an acute abdomen in a healthy woman presenting with abdominal pain and swelling.

### The utility of electrodiagnostic testing in unprovoked rhabdomyolysis in the era of next-generation sequencing [^114nimxa]. Muscle & Nerve (2024). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is an etiologically heterogeneous, acute necrosis of myofibers characterized by transient marked creatine kinase (CK) elevation associated with myalgia, muscle edema, and/or weakness. The study aimed to determine the role of electrodiagnostic (EDX) testing relative to genetic testing and muscle biopsy in patients with unprovoked rhabdomyolysis in identifying an underlying myopathy.

- **Methods**: The EDX database was reviewed to identify unprovoked rhabdomyolysis patients who underwent EDX testing between January 2012 and January 2022. Each patient's clinical profile, EDX findings, muscle pathology, laboratory, and genetic testing results were analyzed.

- **Results**: Of 66 patients identified, 32 had myopathic electromyography (EMG). Muscle biopsy and genetic testing were performed in 41 and 37 patients, respectively. A definitive diagnosis was achieved in 15 patients (11 myopathic EMG and 4 nonmyopathic EMG; p = .04) based on abnormal muscle biopsy (4/11 patients) or genetic testing (12/12 patients, encompassing 5 patients with normal muscle biopsy and 3 patients with nonmyopathic EMG). These included seven metabolic and eight nonmetabolic myopathies (five muscular dystrophies and three ryanodine receptor 1 [RYR1]-myopathies). Patients were more likely to have baseline weakness (p < 0.01), elevated baseline CK (p < 0.01), and nonmetabolic myopathies (p = .03) when myopathic EMG was identified.

- **Discussion**: Myopathic EMG occurred in approximately half of patients with unprovoked rhabdomyolysis, more likely in patients with weakness and elevated CK at baseline.

### Myobloc [^114tY2so]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Excessive doses of Myobloc may produce neuromuscular weakness with a variety of symptoms. Respiratory support may be required if excessive doses cause paralysis of respiratory muscles. In the event of overdose, the patient should be medically monitored for symptoms of excessive muscle weakness or muscle paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4)]. Symptomatic treatment may be necessary.

Symptoms of overdose are likely not to be present immediately following injection. Should accidental injection or oral ingestion occur, the person should be medically supervised for several weeks for signs and symptoms of excessive muscle weakness or muscle paralysis.

In the event of an overdose, antitoxin raised against botulinum toxin is available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, GA. However, the antitoxin will not reverse any botulinum toxin-induced effects already apparent by the time of antitoxin administration. In the event of suspected or actual cases of botulinum toxin poisoning, please contact your local or state health department to process a request for antitoxin through the CDC. If you do not receive a response within 30 minutes, contact the CDC directly at 770–488–7100. More information can be obtained at http://cdc.gov/ncidod/srp/drugs/drug-service.html.

### Severe proximal muscle weakness with normal CK as a presenting feature of ANCA-associated vasculitis [^113Cis3Q]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

In conclusion, ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) causing muscle weakness is not commonly recognized. Patients with AAV could have extensive vasculitis within the muscle groups despite having a normal creatine kinase (CK). Most of the reported cases had MPO-ANCA positive status. MRI scans have been shown to be very useful for detecting muscle edema and for targeting muscle biopsy, even in patients with normal CK. The use of PET scans in AAV still needs further evaluation.

- **Learning points**:
	- Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) could present with isolated muscle weakness. Therefore, after excluding common causes of muscle weakness, further testing should be conducted to rule out AAV.
	- Patients with AAV could have extensive vasculitis within the muscle groups despite having a normal CK or negative ANCA. This discrepancy in laboratory features with a positive muscle biopsy suggests that a muscle biopsy should be considered to rule out vasculitis if a patient presents with unexplained muscle weakness, irrespective of CK levels or ANCA titer.
	- MRI has a very high sensitivity as a diagnostic test in myositis/vasculitis, even in patients with normal CK. MRI can also be used to target muscle biopsy and possibly follow-up with patients with myositis/vasculitis. The use of positron-emission tomography scans in AAV still needs further evaluation.

### Clinical spectrum of rhabdomyolysis presented to pediatric emergency department [^1143VZsR]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially life-threatening syndrome that can develop from a variety of causes; the classic triad of symptoms includes muscle pain, weakness, and dark urine and may not always be present in children. In 2006, an adult study showed that 45% presented with myalgia, 38% had muscle weakness, and only 3.6% noted dark urine. In our study, we recorded 83.8% presented with myalgia, 73% had muscle weakness, but dark urine was observed in only 5.4%. There was only one patient who presented with the classic triad of symptoms. In our study, we also found the male to female ratio of pediatric rhabdomyolysis was 2.3:1, which was similar to two other studies where the ratios were 2:1 and 4:1, respectively.

- **Etiologies**: The etiologies of rhabdomyolysis can be classified as hereditary and acquired. The acquired causes are further classified as traumatic and non-traumatic. In pediatric patients, the most common causes are viral myositis, trauma, connective tissue disorders, seizure, physical exertion, and drug overdose. In our series, infections accounted for more than half (59.5%) of the causes of rhabdomyolysis, followed by trauma (16.2%) and exercise (16.2%).

- **Age-related findings**: In patients that were 9 years old or younger, infections were the most common cause of rhabdomyolysis, accounting for 19 of 21 patients in this age group. However, the most common cause of rhabdomyolysis in patients older than 9 years was physical exertion. Rhabdomyolysis has been reported to be associated with a variety of viral infections, including influenza and Coxsackie.

### Statin-associated myopathy [^1157vY8W]. JAMA (2003). Low credibility.

Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are associated with various skeletal muscle complaints, including clinically important myositis and rhabdomyolysis, mild serum creatine kinase (CK) elevations, myalgia with and without elevated CK levels, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, and persistent myalgia and CK elevations after statin withdrawal. We performed a literature review to provide a clinical summary of statin-associated myopathy and discuss possible mediating mechanisms. We also update the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reports on statin-associated rhabdomyolysis.

Articles on statin myopathy were identified via a PubMed search through November 2002, and articles on statin clinical trials, case series, and review articles were identified through January 2003. Adverse event reports of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis were also collected from the FDA MEDWATCH database. The literature review found that reports of muscle problems during statin clinical trials are extremely rare. The FDA MEDWATCH Reporting System lists 3,339 cases of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis reported between January 1, 1990, and March 31, 2002. Cerivastatin was the most commonly implicated statin.

Few data are available regarding the frequency of less-serious events such as muscle pain and weakness, which may affect 1% to 5% of patients. The risk of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects with statin use can be exacerbated by several factors, including compromised hepatic and renal function, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and concomitant medications.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for statin-induced myopathy, more specifically with respect to treatment modifications, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend managing muscle symptoms, including pain, tenderness, stiffness, cramping, weakness, or fatigue, in statin-treated patients according to the following management strategy:

- **Severe symptoms**: Discontinue statins promptly in patients developing unexplained severe muscle symptoms or fatigue, and obtain an evaluation for rhabdomyolysis.

- **Resolving mild-to-moderate symptoms**:
	- Discontinue statins until the symptoms can be evaluated in patients developing mild-to-moderate muscle symptoms.
	- Resume the original or a lower dose of the same statin, if not contraindicated, to establish a causal relationship between muscle symptoms and statin therapy if mild-to-moderate symptoms resolve after statin discontinuation.
	- Discontinue the original statin if a causal relationship exists.
	- Switch to a low dose of a different statin once muscle symptoms resolve.
	- Increase the dose gradually as tolerated once the low-dose statin is tolerated.

- **Non-resolving mild-to-moderate symptoms**: Consider evaluating for other causes of muscle symptoms if muscle symptoms or elevated CK levels do not resolve completely after 2 months without statin treatment.

- **Non-statin causes**: Resume statin therapy at the original dose if persistent muscle symptoms are determined to arise from a condition unrelated to statin therapy or if the predisposing condition has been treated.

### Development of rhabdomyolysis in a child after norovirus gastroenteritis [^1149BXjV]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

In children, the most significant cause of rhabdomyolysis or muscle breakdown is viral infection. However, there are no reports that norovirus, a gastroenteric virus that commonly infects children, specifically causes rhabdomyolysis. Here, we report the first pediatric case of norovirus-associated rhabdomyolysis.

- **Case presentation**: The patient, a 2-year-old boy with fever, diarrhea, and vomiting, was referred to our hospital with dysstasia and transaminitis. He was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. Additionally, norovirus genogroup GII was detected from stool samples by real-time quantitative reverse transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction, and thereafter, the norovirus GII.4 variant was identified.

- **Conclusion**: However, the association between rhabdomyolysis and the isolated norovirus variant was not clarified. After treatment, the patient recovered without renal failure or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Rhabdomyolysis is a disease for which there is a need for early detection and treatment. If abnormal posture or muscle weakness is observed during the course of gastroenteritis, blood and urinary tests should be performed to rule out rhabdomyolysis.

Figure: A computed tomography (CT) scan of the lungs of a 60-year-old man before and after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and rhabdomyolysis, conducted in Wuhan, China in 2020, reveals significant findings.

- **Scan results**:
	- A) The CT scan before the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, conducted three days before hospital admission, showed the lungs were thickened and scattered with ground-glass shadows.
	- B) The CT scan after the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection with rhabdomyolysis, taken on hospital day 10, indicated that most of both lungs were covered with ground-glass shadows.
	- C) The CT scan after the SARS-CoV-2 infection with rhabdomyolysis, conducted on hospital day 19, indicated that pulmonary inflammation was improved.

### Rhabdomyolysis: a rare complication of Hashimoto's thyroiditis precipitated by statin therapy [^115pLDcK]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is the most common form of primary hypothyroidism. Muscular manifestations, such as weakness, pain, stiffness, and elevated muscle enzymes, are often observed in hypothyroidism. Statins are additionally known to cause myositis and rhabdomyolysis. This report presents the case of a middle-aged man on statin therapy, who experienced severe muscle aches and pain, and was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. Further evaluation identified underlying HT as the cause of his condition. He was managed with intravenous fluids and levothyroxine, alongside discontinuation of statins, which led to his improvement.

### Muscle weakness with a hidden cause [^1157cM6m]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) represent a diverse group of systemic autoimmune disorders characterized by skeletal muscle weakness with variable clinical manifestations. Dermatomyositis (DM) is a heterogeneous IIM and is associated with progressive muscle weakness, characteristic skin features, and an increased risk of malignancy. Here, we report a previously healthy man in his early 40s who presented to the emergency department with a 14-day history of symmetric progressive proximal muscle weakness. Both upper arms were painful and swollen, displaying marked weakness in arm elevation. Climbing stairs was no longer possible due to muscle weakness and pain. A facial and truncal rash as well as periungual erythema were noted. Laboratory analysis revealed highly elevated creatine kinase. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of DM was confirmed. A comprehensive search for malignancy revealed a non-palpable pure seminoma. While DM as a paraneoplastic phenomenon of seminoma is extremely rare, our case underlines the importance of a thorough tumor search.

### The etiology of rhabdomyolysis: an interaction between genetic susceptibility and external triggers [^1128c9Fw]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a complex condition relevant to many medical disciplines, involving the rapid dissolution of damaged or injured skeletal muscle. This disruption of skeletal muscle integrity leads to the direct release of intracellular muscle components, including myoglobin, creatine kinase (CK), aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes into the circulation and extracellular space. Clinical manifestations range from a largely asymptomatic illness with isolated serum CK level elevation (hyperCKaemia) to a life-threatening condition with profound myoglobinuria, often leading to acute renal failure. Definitions vary, but rhabdomyolysis is most commonly defined as a clinical syndrome of severe myalgia, muscle weakness, and swelling, with a sudden elevation of CK levels, with or without the presence of myoglobinuria, and a subsequent fall of CK levels.

Three retrospective cohort studies in a hospital setting, performed in 2005, 2009, and 2012, described the demographics and different causes of rhabdomyolysis. All three studies, performed when diagnostic genetic testing was not yet widely available, focused on external triggers as a cause for the rhabdomyolysis event and identified exogenous toxins as the most frequently reported trigger, followed by traumatic muscle injury [1, 2, 3]. However, recent reports suggest that rhabdomyolysis events can be attributed to a combination of certain environmental factors (e.g. strenuous exercise and/or febrile infection) and a predisposing genotype [4]. A combination of external triggers and genetic predisposition may thus

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis in the athlete: A clinical review [^1132yyR1]. Sports Health (2014). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for rhabdomyolysis, specifically with respect to risk stratification, the AOSSM 2014 guidelines recommend regarding the following patients as being at low risk in the context of exertional rhabdomyolysis:

- **Rapid clinical recovery**: Rapid clinical recovery and CK normalization after exercise restrictions.

- **Fitness level**: Sufficiently fit or well-trained athlete with a history of intense training/exercise.

- **Medical history**: No personal or family history of rhabdomyolysis.

- **Group cases**: Existence of other group or team-related cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis during the same exercise sessions.

- **Viral illness**: Suspected or documented concomitant viral illness.

- **Drug or supplement ingestion**: Ingestion of a drug or dietary supplement likely contributed to the development of exertional rhabdomyolysis.

### Livalo [^112QxCki]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Livalo may cause myopathy, characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including Livalo.

- **Risk factors for myopathy**: Risk factors include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher Livalo dosages [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Drug Interactions (7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]. Dosages of Livalo greater than 4 mg once daily were associated with an increased risk for severe myopathy in premarketing clinical studies. The maximum recommended dose of Livalo is 4 mg once daily.

- **Steps to prevent or reduce the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis**: Livalo is contraindicated in patients taking cyclosporine and not recommended in patients taking gemfibrozil [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. There are Livalo dosage restrictions for patients taking erythromycin or rifampin [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The following drugs, when used concomitantly with Livalo, may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis: lipid-modifying dosages of niacin (> 1 gram/day), fibrates, and colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Discontinue Livalo if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if Livalo is stopped.

### Uric acid in predicting the traumatic rhabdomyolysis induced acute kidney injury; a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1157HMrb]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis (RM) is a clinical syndrome distinguished by the disruption of structural integrity in skeletal muscle cells, leading to the release of intracellular constituents into the extracellular space. Trauma, immobilization, sepsis, and surgery are the most frequently reported causes of RM. In the case of rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a tragic yet preventable complication. Patients with RM are reported to have a 13–50% chance of developing AKI, which is associated with approximately a 30% mortality increase. Patient outcomes are worse in RM patients with AKI, which increases the medical burden. Therefore, prevention and early diagnosis of AKI improve prognosis for these patients.

A severe physical injury or trauma can cause traumatic rhabdomyolysis, which is characterized by the rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue. When there is significant muscle compression or crush injuries, such as those sustained in car accidents, crush syndrome, severe burns, compartment syndrome, or natural disasters, this condition may occur. The symptoms of traumatic rhabdomyolysis include muscle pain, weakness, dark urine (due to myoglobinuria), and, in severe cases, renal dysfunction. By hydration and other appropriate measures, and prompt medical intervention, the underlying trauma can be managed, complications prevented, and renal function supported. A mass disaster such as an earthquake will result in a large number of traumatic rhabdomyolysis patients. Management of these patients will be challenging given the special circumstances following the disaster.

### Lescol [^115yBbgE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis with renal dysfunction secondary to myoglobinuria has been reported with fluvastatin and with other drugs in this class. Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, has been reported.

Myopathy should be considered in any patients with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. Fluvastatin sodium therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Fluvastatin sodium therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient experiencing an acute or serious condition predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, such as sepsis, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled epilepsy.

The risk of myopathy and/or rhabdomyolysis during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors has been reported to be increased if therapy with either cyclosporine, gemfibrozil, erythromycin, or niacin is administered concurrently. Isolated cases of myopathy have been reported during post-marketing experience with concomitant administration of fluvastatin and colchicine. No information is available on the pharmacokinetic interaction between fluvastatin and colchicine. However, myotoxicity, including muscle pain, has been observed.

### Fluvastatin sodium [^116XHh37]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Skeletal muscle**: Rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria has been reported with fluvastatin and other drugs in this class. Fluvastatin capsules should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy, including advanced age (> 65 years), renal impairment, and inadequately treated hypothyroidism.

	- The risk of myopathy and/or rhabdomyolysis with statins increases with concomitant therapy with cyclosporine, erythromycin, fibrates, or niacin. Myopathy was not observed in a clinical trial involving 74 patients treated with fluvastatin and niacin. Isolated cases of myopathy have been reported during postmarketing experience with concomitant administration of fluvastatin and colchicine. No information is available on the pharmacokinetic interaction between fluvastatin and colchicine.

	- Uncomplicated myalgia has also been reported in fluvastatin-treated patients. In clinical trials, uncomplicated myalgia has been observed infrequently in patients treated with fluvastatin at rates indistinguishable from placebo. Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in CPK values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, was observed in less than 0.1% of fluvastatin clinical trials. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevation of CPK.

	- All patients should be advised to promptly report to their physician any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness.

### Rhabdomyolysis [^112CTP3q]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially life-threatening syndrome resulting from the breakdown of skeletal muscle fibers with leakage of muscle contents into the circulation. The most common causes include crush injury, overexertion, alcohol abuse, and certain medicines and toxic substances. Several inherited genetic disorders, such as McArdle's disease and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, are predisposing factors for the syndrome.

Clinical features are often nonspecific, and tea-colored urine is usually the first clue to the presence of rhabdomyolysis. Screening may be performed with a urine dipstick in combination with urine microscopy. A positive urine myoglobin test provides supportive evidence. Multiple complications can occur and are classified as early or late. Early complications include severe hyperkalemia that causes cardiac arrhythmia and arrest. The most serious late complication is acute renal failure, which occurs in approximately 15 percent of patients with the syndrome. Early recognition of rhabdomyolysis and prompt management of complications are crucial to a successful outcome.

### Primary adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deaminase deficiency in a hypotonic infant [^115DV8Um]. Journal of Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

The spectrum of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deaminase deficiency ranges from asymptomatic carriers to patients who manifest exercise-induced muscle pain, occasionally rhabdomyolysis, and idiopathic hyperCKemia. However, prior to the introduction of molecular techniques, rare cases with congenital weakness and hypotonia have also been reported. We report a case of a 6-month-old girl exhibiting congenital muscle weakness and hypotonia, muscle deficiency of adenosine monophosphate deaminase, and a homozygous C to T mutation at nucleotide 34 of the adenosine monophosphate deaminase-1 gene. This observation suggests the possible existence of a primary adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency manifested by congenital muscle weakness and hypotonia.

### Hashimoto's thyroiditis aggravated by goitrogenic diet presenting as rhabdomyolysis worsened by alcohol intake [^111fyE7j]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the most common form of primary hypothyroidism. Several muscular manifestations, such as pain, weakness, stiffness, and elevated muscle enzymes, have been observed in hypothyroidism. Alcohol is also known to cause myositis and rhabdomyolysis. Patients with thyroid issues should avoid certain foods like broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage, as they contain goitrogens. This case describes a young man who presented with severe muscle aches and pain, eventually diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. Further evaluation revealed underlying HT. Additionally, he had been consuming raw broccoli, which is goitrogenic, and alcohol, both of which worsened the rhabdomyolysis. He was managed with levothyroxine and intravenous fluids, leading to an improvement in his condition.

### Mlip causes recessive myopathy with rhabdomyolysis, myalgia and baseline elevated serum creatine kinase [^112W4Dbc]. Brain (2021). Low credibility.

Striated muscle needs to maintain cellular homeostasis in adaptation to increases in physiological and metabolic demands. Failure to do so can result in rhabdomyolysis. The identification of novel genetic conditions associated with rhabdomyolysis helps to shed light on hitherto unrecognized homeostatic mechanisms. Here we report seven individuals in six families from different ethnic backgrounds with biallelic variants in MLIP, which encodes the muscular lamin A/C-interacting protein, MLIP. Patients presented with a consistent phenotype characterized by mild muscle weakness, exercise-induced muscle pain, variable susceptibility to episodes of rhabdomyolysis, and persistent basal elevated serum creatine kinase levels. The biallelic truncating variants were predicted to result in disruption of the nuclear localizing signal of MLIP. Additionally, reduced overall RNA expression levels of the predominant MLIP isoform were observed in patients' skeletal muscle. Collectively, our data increase the understanding of the genetic landscape of rhabdomyolysis to now include MLIP as a novel disease gene in humans and solidifies MLIP's role in normal and diseased skeletal muscle homeostasis.

### Acute rhabdomyolysis in healthy woman [^115wV5fp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Our patient is a 42-year-old woman with muscle paralysis, muscle weakness, and fever. On admission, a neurologic examination showed proximal and distal weakness in the leg. Serum creatine phosphokinase and serum myoglobin levels were markedly increased (5600 UI/L and 5197 UI/L, respectively). There was no sign of renal failure. A nerve conduction study was negative. Serologic studies for virus titers showed the antibody immunoglobulin M cytomegalovirus.

Muscle weakness, paralysis, fever, and serum creatine kinase levels gradually improved after the administration of intravenous methylprednisolone. Cytomegalovirus infection was thought to have played a central role in this case, leading to acute but reversible peripheral muscle paralysis.

### Lipitor [^112wy938]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Lipitor exposure may be increased by drug interactions due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) and/or transporters (e.g. breast cancer resistant protein [BCRP], organic anion-transporting polypeptide [OATP1B1/OATP1B3], and P-glycoprotein [P-gp]), resulting in an increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Concomitant use of cyclosporine, gemfibrozil, tipranavir plus ritonavir, or glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir with Lipitor is not recommended. Lipitor dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain antiviral, azole antifungals, or macrolide antibiotic medications [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis have been reported with atorvastatin co-administered with lipid-modifying doses (> 1 gram/day) of niacin, fibrates, colchicine, and ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir. Consider if the benefit of using these products outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Concomitant intake of large quantities, more than 1.2 liters daily, of grapefruit juice is not recommended in patients taking Lipitor [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Discontinue Lipitor if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if Lipitor is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue Lipitor in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g. sepsis, shock, severe hypovolemia, major surgery).

### Muscle weakness in adults: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^1135ZYHJ]. American Family Physician (2020). High credibility.

Muscle weakness can be caused by a variety of conditions, including lumbar disk herniation, Graves' disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, and rhabdomyolysis. Electrolyte imbalances such as hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypocalcemia can also contribute to muscle weakness. Neurological and systemic diseases, such as facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, transient ischemic attack, Wilson's disease, chronic kidney disease, Kennedy's disease, and dialysis-related aluminum toxicity may play a role.

Infectious and inflammatory conditions like West Nile fever, poliomyelitis, botulism, and Klumpke paralysis, as well as conditions arising from disuse atrophy of muscle, subacute combined degeneration of the cord, and motor neuron diseases, may also lead to weakness. Common endocrine and connective tissue disorders, including Cushing's disease, systemic sclerosis, and polymyalgia rheumatica, are similarly implicated.

Other possible causes consist of acquired neuromyotonia, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis, vitamin deficiencies (E and thiamine), malnutrition disorders such as marasmus and kwashiorkor, and mitochondrial disorders like mitochondrial encephalopathy/lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes.

Genetic and metabolic disorders such as infantile X-linked spinal muscular atrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias, and succinyl-CoA synthetase deficiency also feature in the differential diagnosis. Additional conditions include spinal muscular atrophy type 3, sphingomyelinase deficiency, pyle metaphyseal dysplasia, muscle glycogen synthase deficiency, LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy, various types of glycogenosis, Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, autosomal recessive congenital muscular dystrophy, coenzyme Q10 deficiency, Chediak-Higashi disease, adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency, 2-methylbutyryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency, and autosomal dominant myotonia congenita.

### Rhabdomyolysis attributed to terbinafine: A rare occurrence that can be mistaken for terbinafine-induced hepatotoxicity [^112SffTM]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis associated with terbinafine use has been reported in only a few other cases in the literature, with one report coming from a postmarketing surveillance study. Due to its rarity, patients might not associate symptoms of rhabdomyolysis with terbinafine use unless prompted by their dermatologist. As a result, this adverse effect might be underreported. Routine monitoring of liver enzymes in patients taking terbinafine is still a debated topic. Some studies argue that hepatic monitoring of patients on terbinafine does not provide a benefit unless the patient is clinically symptomatic with signs of drug-induced liver injury.

Our patient was found to have rhabdomyolysis after receiving routine liver enzyme monitoring. Only after further questioning upon receiving abnormal laboratory results did the patient mention having symptoms of muscle weakness and pain. Our case emphasizes the importance of educating patients about the potential adverse effects of terbinafine and the need to discontinue the medication and seek treatment if concerning symptoms arise.

In conclusion, rhabdomyolysis associated with terbinafine is rare. The mechanism of action is unknown, but the association with exercise in our patient suggests a drug-facilitated reaction. Similar cases of drug-facilitated rhabdomyolysis and strenuous exercise have been reported with isotretinoin. Patients need to know the common symptoms of rhabdomyolysis, such as myalgia, darkened urine, and muscle weakness, and to discontinue the medication immediately if these symptoms arise.

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: an individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^11798seB]. Lancet (2022). High credibility.

Statistical analysis focused on variables that were previously specified. Data were converted into a common format based on the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium Study Data Tabulation Model. Adverse events were mapped to a common dictionary, the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 20.0.

The protocol prespecified that analyses of muscle symptoms would consider reported muscle pain (i.e. myalgia) and weakness separately from myopathy. Before the unmasking of treatment allocation, non-myopathic muscle outcomes were categorized as myalgia, limb pain, other musculoskeletal pain, muscle cramp or spasm, any muscle pain (the combination of the previous four outcomes), muscular fatigue or weakness, and any muscle pain or weakness (all the previous outcomes combined). We searched for creatine kinase values obtained within 2 weeks of the reported events to check for any biochemical evidence of muscle damage and assessed the effect of the statin on the distribution of all creatine kinase values, reported as multiples of the trial-specific upper limit of normal (ULN). Although the protocol specified that myopathy would be defined as muscle pain or weakness accompanied by creatine kinase more than ten times the ULN, it was redefined (before unmasking) as any event coded as myopathy or rhabdomyolysis due to the frequent absence of creatine kinase data.

### The safety of statins in clinical practice [^114dTYPJ]. Lancet (2007). High credibility.

Statin-induced myopathy is a condition associated with a range of symptoms, including rhabdomyolysis, myalgia, and increased serum creatinine. It is more common in elderly individuals or those with frailty. Other contributing factors can include statins, increased serum CK, and vitamin D deficiency. Patients may experience various types of pain such as thigh, buttock, hip, back, arm, shoulder, and calf pain, as well as proximal muscle weakness. Additionally, diabetes mellitus, increased urine myoglobin, and fibrate use may also be associated with this condition.

### Hemoadsorption therapy for myoglobin removal in rhabdomyolysis: Consensus of the Hemoadsorption in Rhabdomyolysis Task Force [^111kHBnG]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis was first described by Bywaters and Beall in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in 1941, who demonstrated the presence of pigmented casts in the renal tubules of bombing victims during World War II. Notably, this syndrome had previously been described by German pathologists, and a published summary of the literature provided a description that matched exactly with that in the BMJ.

Often referred to as "crush syndrome", rhabdomyolysis involves the breakdown of skeletal muscles following severe injury, which may result from trauma, major surgery, high voltage electrocution, intoxications, drug abuse, and infection. It is best described as a multifactorial syndrome with a clinical presentation that can range from mild muscle pain, weakness, and confusion to critical illness requiring multi-organ support.

Myoglobin release plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiological mechanisms behind rhabdomyolysis-related organ dysfunction, particularly acute kidney injury (AKI). After injury, serum myoglobin concentrations rise; however, due to rapid renal clearance, circulating levels may decrease within the first 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. When myoglobin concentration exceeds the kidney's reabsorbing capacity, myoglobin appears in the urine (myoglobinuria). Myoglobinuria detected within the first 24 hours post-injury is pathognomonic for the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. Although there is no consensus definition for rhabdomyolysis, a recent systematic review recommends defining it as a clinical syndrome of acute…

### Outbreak of Haff disease along the Yangtze River, Anhui Province, China, 2016 [^112PpvVZ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

The most commonly reported clinical features in this outbreak were myalgia and muscle weakness, as well as abnormal levels of myoglobin and CK. Increased serum myoglobin concentration is the basis for early diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis; however, myoglobin concentrations tend to normalize within 6–8 hours following exposure. Thus, the window of opportunity for diagnosis is short. Of note, elevated myoglobin concentrations were observed in all case-patients who were tested in this study; this may be due to prompt medical care and timely laboratory testing in the hospital.

Rhabdomyolysis is a common life-threatening syndrome characterized by the injury of skeletal muscle resulting in the leakage of intracellular contents into the circulatory system. Patients with rhabdomyolysis usually experience myalgia, muscle weakness, raised serum CK, and brown urine. The etiologic spectrum of rhabdomyolysis is extensive, including crush injuries, ischemia, strenuous exercise, extreme body temperatures, drugs, toxins, infections, hereditary causes, and inflammatory or autoimmune muscle disease. A substantial number of patients may have no cause identified.

We found that nerve paralysis and fever were rare symptoms. All crayfish were cooked thoroughly, and no industrial or chemical contamination was identified; therefore, this outbreak was unlikely to have been caused by infectious or chemical etiologies. Diaz et al. reported that an unidentified, heat-stable, algal toxin with primarily myotoxic rather than neurotoxic properties in seafood has been proposed as a cause of Haff disease.

### Rhabdomyolysis in intensive care unit-distinctive clinical indicators and prognosis [^1169CFtE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a serious medical condition characterized by the rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue. This process leads to the release of various cellular components into the bloodstream and surrounding tissues, including proteins such as myoglobin and enzymes like creatine kinase (CK), as well as electrolytes. The severity of rhabdomyolysis can vary significantly, ranging from mild cases with minimal symptoms and slightly elevated CK levels to severe, life-threatening conditions.

Although traumatic injury is a common cause, a wide range of other factors can also trigger this condition. Previous studies and our research have confirmed that infection, certain medications, pancreatitis, alcohol consumption, electrolyte imbalance, excessive physical exertion, and heatstroke can also lead to elevated CK levels. The diverse range of potential causes underscores the complexity of this condition and the importance of considering rhabdomyolysis in various clinical scenarios.

Given the diverse etiology of rhabdomyolysis, patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) with critical illnesses are particularly susceptible to developing rhabdomyolysis. This condition can lead to severe complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Previous studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and the incidence of AKI. Despite its clinical significance, the specific characteristics and risk factors contributing to mortality or adverse outcomes in ICU patients remain critical areas of investigation.

### Diagnostic evaluation of rhabdomyolysis [^116mXx2Z]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is characterized by severe acute muscle injury resulting in muscle pain, weakness, and/or swelling with release of myofiber contents into the bloodstream. Symptoms develop over hours to days after an inciting factor and may be associated with dark pigmentation of the urine. Serum creatine kinase and urine myoglobin levels are markedly elevated.

Clinical examination, history, laboratory studies, muscle biopsy, and genetic testing are useful tools for the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, helping differentiate acquired from inherited causes of the condition. Acquired causes include substance abuse, medication or toxic exposures, electrolyte abnormalities, endocrine disturbances, and autoimmune myopathies. Inherited predisposition to rhabdomyolysis can occur with disorders of glycogen metabolism, fatty acid β-oxidation, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Less common inherited causes include structural myopathies, channelopathies, and sickle-cell disease.

This review focuses on differentiating acquired and inherited causes of rhabdomyolysis and proposes a practical diagnostic algorithm.

### A risk prediction score for kidney failure or mortality in rhabdomyolysis [^115jGSJ2]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "McMahon score for kidney failure or mortality in rhabdomyolysis" is a clinical tool designed to predict kidney failure or mortality in patients with rhabdomyolysis. The primary components of the McMahon score include the patient's age, sex, initial creatinine, initial calcium, initial creatine phosphokinase, and whether the rhabdomyolysis is secondary to seizures, syncope, exercise, statins, or myositis, as well as initial phosphate and initial bicarbonate. Each component is assigned a specific value based on the patient's condition, and the total score is used to estimate the risk of kidney failure or mortality. The McMahon score is particularly useful in guiding clinical decision-making and patient management in cases of rhabdomyolysis.

The McMahon Score calculator estimates the risk of kidney failure or mortality in individuals with rhabdomyolysis, considering a combination of clinical and demographic factors. The calculator processes input across eight specific areas:

1. **Age (years)**: 80: 3 points
2. **Sex**:
	- **Male**: 0 points
	- **Female**: 1 point
3. **Initial creatinine (mg/dL)**: 2.2: 3 points
4. **Initial calcium (mg/dL)**: 7.5: 0 points
5. **Initial creatine phosphokinase (U/L)**:
	- **> 40,000**: 2 points
	- **≤ 40,000**: 0 points
6. **Cause of rhabdomyolysis (secondary to seizures, syncope, exercise, statins, or myositis)**:
	- **Yes**: 0 points
	- **No**: 3 points
7. **Initial phosphate (mg/dL)**:

### A systematic review on the definition of rhabdomyolysis [^1123GacT]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis (RML) is an interdisciplinary condition resulting from muscle cell injury, followed by the release of cell components into circulation. The etiology of RML has a broad range; a serious complication is acute kidney injury (AKI). Despite its high relevance, there is no established formal definition for RML.

- **Objectives**: A systematic review focused on RML definition to provide a recommendation for clinicians.

- **Method**: Systematic literature research in PubMed and Embase (1968–07/2018).

- **Results**: The database research presented 8136 articles in PubMed and 2151 in Embase. After screening, 614 papers were retained for statistical analysis. A retrospective study was the most used design (44%). A definition of RML was stated in 231 studies (37.6%), including a precise creatine kinase level (CK) cut-off most frequently (67.1%). In 53/231 (22.9%) studies, the CK cut-off was > 5× the upper limit of normal (ULN), and in 64/231 (27.7%) studies, > 1000 IU/L. Further components of definitions were elevated CK without specific thresholds and clinical symptoms. Exclusion criteria referring to the definition of RML were established in 113 studies, including myocardial, renal, cerebral, and neuromuscular characteristics.

- **Conclusion**: At present, we recommend a clinical syndrome of acute muscle weakness, myalgia, and muscle swelling combined with a CK cut-off value of > 1000 IU/L or CK > 5× ULN for the standard definition of a mild RML. Additionally, measured myoglobinuria and AKI indicate a severe type of RML. Exclusion criteria, as well as the chronological sequence, need to be considered for a comprehensive understanding of RML.

### Pathogenesis and treatment of renal dysfunction in rhabdomyolysis [^114BLNZp]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a major cause of acute renal failure, and recent experimental data have provided a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the renal dysfunction. Renal failure results from renal vasoconstriction, tubular damage caused by oxidant injury, and possibly tubular obstruction. Recent studies have provided greater insight into the rationale behind therapy and potential treatment strategies. This review thus aims to summarize the understanding of the causes, pathogenesis, and treatment of renal failure caused by rhabdomyolysis.

### Structural changes and contractility in muscle assessed by magnetic resonance imaging in individuals with ryanodine receptor 1-related rhabdomyolysis or myalgia [^11457SYf]. Muscle & Nerve (2024). Low credibility.

Ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1)-related myopathies, associated with variants in the RYR1 gene, present with a wide range of symptoms and severity. Two of the milder phenotypes associated with dominant pathogenic variants in RYR1 are rhabdomyolysis and myalgia. Only a few studies have objectively investigated the muscle function and structure of individuals with RYR1-related rhabdomyolysis/myalgia, showing inconsistent results. This study aimed to describe structural changes and contractility of muscles in individuals with RYR1-related rhabdomyolysis/myalgia.

We investigated 15 individuals with dominant variants in the RYR1 gene and compared them with 15 age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls using MRI, stationary isokinetic dynamometry, and comprehensive clinical evaluation. No significant differences were found between individuals with RYR1-related rhabdomyolysis/myalgia and healthy controls in peak torque, fat fraction, cross-sectional area, contractile cross-sectional area, or contractility (p > .05) in muscles of the lower back (MRI data only), thigh, or calf.

On clinical examination, three individuals exhibited weakness in hip or back extension on the Medical Research Council (MRC) test, and eight had muscle hypertrophy. Individuals with weakness were not hypertrophic. Most individuals with RYR1-related rhabdomyolysis/myalgia have close to normal strength, normal fat fraction, and contractility of muscles, and therefore constitute a mild phenotype of RYR1-related myopathies.

### Simvastatin [^111udfCv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Steps to prevent or reduce the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis include several important considerations:

- **Concomitant use contraindications**: The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with simvastatin is contraindicated. If short-term treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is required, temporarily suspend simvastatin during the duration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitor treatment. The concomitant use of simvastatin with gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, or danazol is also contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Dosage modifications**: Simvastatin dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking lomitapide, verapamil, diltiazem, dronedarone, amiodarone, amlodipine, or ranolazine [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Simvastatin use should be temporarily suspended in patients taking daptomycin. Lipid-modifying doses (≥ 1 gram/day) of niacin, fibrates, colchicine, and grapefruit juice may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **80 mg dosage considerations**: Use the 80 mg daily dosage of simvastatin tablets only in patients who have been taking simvastatin 80 mg daily chronically without evidence of muscle toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. If patients treated with an 80 mg daily dosage of simvastatin tablets are prescribed an interacting drug that increases the risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, switch to an alternate statin [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Discontinuation guidelines**: Discontinue simvastatin if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK increases may resolve if simvastatin is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue simvastatin in patients experiencing symptoms indicative of muscle issues.

There is growing appreciation of the wide range of clinical presentations seen in pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Rhabdomyolysis appears to be a rare but potentially serious manifestation of COVID-19. Here, we report an adolescent with COVID-19-associated rhabdomyolysis who required hemodialysis due to acute kidney injury. Pediatric providers should consider rhabdomyolysis and the possibility of acute renal failure in children with COVID-19.

### Hospital admissions from the emergency department of adult patients affected by myopathies [^112YuKvs]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

In the group of immune-mediated myopathies (dermatomyositis, necrotizing myopathy, or non-otherwise specified inflammatory myopathy, i.e. polymyositis), worsening of muscle weakness and respiratory failure were the most prevalent causes, except for dermatomyositis patients, who mostly complained of serious gastrointestinal events. More specifically, two patients had nausea and vomiting due to drug-induced hepatitis, one an acute diverticulitis, and another a malignant bowel occlusion.

The majority of patients in the undifferentiated (UD) group at admission were later discovered to have an associated chronic systemic disease responsible for the muscle symptoms (n = 33, 28%), mainly kidney disease (eight patients), liver disease (eight patients), and heart failure (five patients). Twenty-two patients (18%) were identified to have an acquired muscle injury (necrotizing fasciitis, muscle abscess, or hematoma). Sixteen patients (13%) had post-infectious rhabdomyolysis. Fourteen patients (12%) had muscle signs and symptoms, either drug-induced or associated with endocrine disorders. These included five cases of statin-associated hyperCKemia, four cases of hyperCKemia from neuroleptic treatment, two cases of hypothyroid myopathy, two cases of colchicine-induced myopathy, and one case of primary hyperaldosteronism. Eight patients (7%) had rhabdomyolysis after strenuous physical exercise. Finally, 27 patients (23%) were eventually diagnosed with a specific primary muscle disorder, either inflammatory or genetic (ND group). In this subgroup, an inflammatory myopathy was the most frequent diagnosis (23 patients, 85% of this group).

Primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is usually symptomatic and can manifest through a variety of symptoms. We describe a 51-year-old man who presented at our hospital with acute self-limited rhabdomyolysis and was found to have primary HIV infection. Our case and other reports suggest that a diagnosis of primary HIV infection needs to be considered for patients who present with acute rhabdomyolysis.

### Clinical spectrum of rhabdomyolysis presented to pediatric emergency department [^114qZkKj]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially life-threatening syndrome that can develop from a variety of causes. The aim of the work is to analyze the clinical spectrum and evaluate the prevalence of various etiologies in children who present to the emergency department (ED) with rhabdomyolysis.

- **Methods**: During a 6-year study period, we retrospectively analyzed the medical charts of patients aged 18 years or younger with a definite diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis and serum creatinine phosphokinase (CK) levels greater than 1000 IU/L. We analyzed the clinical spectrum and evaluated the potential risk factors of acute renal failure (ARF).

- **Results**: Thirty-seven patients (mean age = 10.2 ± 5.5 years), including 26 males and 11 females, were enrolled in the study. Two of the most common symptoms presented in these 37 patients were muscle pain and muscle weakness (83.8% and 73%, respectively). Dark urine was reported in only 5.4% of the patients. The leading cause of rhabdomyolysis in the 0- to 9-year age group was presumed infection, while the leading cause in the 10- to 18-year age group was trauma and exercise. The incidence of ARF associated with rhabdomyolysis was 8.1%, and no child required renal replacement therapy (RRT). We did not identify any reliable predictors of ARF or need for RRT.

- **Conclusions**: The classic triad of symptoms of rhabdomyolysis, which includes myalgia, weakness, and dark urine, is not always present in children. The cause of rhabdomyolysis in younger ages is different from that in the teenage group. However, the prognosis of rhabdomyolysis was good with appropriate management.

### Ritodrine-induced rhabdomyolysis and psychiatric symptoms: A case report and literature review [^112Fbysj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). High credibility.

- **Ritodrine-induced rhabdomyolysis**: Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome characterized by skeletal muscle destruction and the release of intracellular muscle content, which can cause systemic complications. The syndrome leads to muscle pain, weakness, dark tea-colored urine, and a significant elevation of serum CK levels. There is no universal definition of rhabdomyolysis, although the common definition includes up-regulated CK levels of more than five times the normal value.

	- In this case, we identified three reasons why the patient's rhabdomyolysis was probably induced by the administration of ritodrine. First, after administration of ritodrine for six weeks, the patient showed symptoms of muscle pain and generalized weakness, and the blood myoglobin, troponin, and ALT values increased. Second, the product information points out that ritodrine has an adverse reaction of rhabdomyolysis. Third, and most importantly, the muscle pain and general weakness were significantly relieved when the patient stopped administration of ritodrine for eight hours. The twins were delivered on the second day after stopping ritodrine. The serum high-sensitivity troponin T value and ALT value were normal after two days postpartum.

- **Conclusion**: Due to the timely detection and treatment of this case, no further physical injury occurred. CK is the most sensitive test for indicating damage to muscle cells. Generally, CK increases within 12 hours after muscle damage, reaches a peak after 1–3 days, and begins to decline after 3–5 days. The CK values of this patient did not increase further following the cessation of ritodrine administration.

### Clinical spectrum of muscle weakness in human West Nile virus infection [^115hoUJE]. Muscle & Nerve (2003). Low credibility.

Poliomyelitis has recently been identified as a cause of muscle weakness in patients with West Nile virus (WNV) infection. However, the clinical spectrum of WNV-associated weakness has not been described. We reviewed data on 13 patients with WNV infection.

Patients with muscle weakness were classified into one of three distinct groups based on clinical features.

- **Group 1**: Comprised five patients who developed acute flaccid paralysis; four had meningoencephalitis, and one presented without fever or other signs of infection. Paralysis was asymmetric, involving one to four limbs in individual patients. Electrodiagnostic studies confirmed involvement of anterior horn cells or motor axons.

- **Group 2**: Involved two patients without meningoencephalitis who developed severe but reversible muscle weakness, which recovered completely within weeks. Muscle weakness involved both lower limbs in one patient and one upper limb in the other.

- **Group 3**: Consisted of two patients who experienced subjective weakness and disabling fatigue, but had no objective muscle weakness on examination.

Additionally, two other patients developed exaggerated weakness in the distribution of preexisting lower motor neuron dysfunction. We conclude that the clinical spectrum of WNV-associated muscle weakness ranges from acute flaccid paralysis, with or without fever or meningoencephalitis, to disabling fatigue. Furthermore, preexisting dysfunction may predispose anterior horn cells to additional injury from WNV. Awareness of this spectrum will help to avoid erroneous diagnoses and inappropriate treatment.

### Rhabdomyolysis as the initial presentation of SARS-CoV-2 in an adolescent [^113d7UUB]. Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has created a global pandemic, with many cases affecting the elderly. However, children have been affected as well, with approximately 2.4% to 3.7% of cases reported. This case represents the first published instance of an adolescent presenting with rhabdomyolysis as the initial sign of novel coronavirus disease 2019, with extremely elevated creatinine kinase levels approaching almost 400,000 U/L. This case contributes to the growing body of literature documenting various life-threatening manifestations associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and underscores the importance of prompt recognition of these unique disease presentations to mitigate complications.

### Clinical spectrum of rhabdomyolysis presented to pediatric emergency department [^113XutVb]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is characterized by the breakdown of skeletal muscle with leakage of muscle contents, including electrolytes, myoglobin, and other sarcoplasmic proteins (e.g. creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase) into the circulation. Its major causes in children include infections, trauma, exertion, drugs, toxins, metabolic disorders, and electrolyte disorders. Typically, patients with rhabdomyolysis present with muscle pain, weakness, and reddish-brown urine. Nevertheless, the severity of rhabdomyolysis varies from an asymptomatic increase in creatine phosphokinase (CK) to severe complications, such as acute renal failure (ARF), cardiac arrhythmias, compartmental syndrome, hypovolemic shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

ARF is the most recognized complication of rhabdomyolysis. In a larger study of 191 children with a CK level greater than 1000 IU/L who were sent to the emergency department (ED), the prevalence of ARF was 5%. However, after reviewing the related literature, it appears that research discussing rhabdomyolysis in children presenting to the pediatric ED is still rare. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the clinical spectrum and prevalence of various etiologies in children with rhabdomyolysis who presented to the pediatric ED.

### Letybo [^112ytvxk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Excessive doses of Letybo may result in neuromuscular weakness, presenting with various symptoms. Respiratory support might be necessary if excessive doses lead to paralysis of the respiratory muscles. Symptoms of overdose are unlikely to manifest immediately after injection. In cases of accidental injection, oral ingestion, or suspected overdose, medical supervision is advised for several weeks to monitor for signs and symptoms of systemic muscular weakness or paralysis.

In the event of an overdose, antitoxin against botulinum toxin can be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, GA. However, this antitoxin will not reverse any effects of botulinum toxin that are already evident at the time of administration. For suspected or confirmed cases of botulinum toxin poisoning, contact your local or state Health Department to request antitoxin through the CDC. If you do not receive a response within 30 minutes, please contact the CDC directly at 1–770–488–7100.

### Rhabdomyolysis: An American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Critical Care Committee Clinical Consensus Document [^115HdJe4]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for rhabdomyolysis, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, AAST 2022 guidelines recommend suspecting rhabdomyolysis in patients with a medical condition causing increased metabolic demands on myocytes in excess of the available supply of ATP. This can result from extreme exertional demands on skeletal muscle from exercise, exogenous agents such as drugs or toxins, genetic defects or myopathies affecting the muscle cell, and infections.

### Rhabdomyolysis in intensive care unit-distinctive clinical indicators and prognosis [^11462oeb]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

Interestingly, although rhabdomyolysis has been reported in tumor patients following targeted therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery, our study found a lower incidence of malignant tumors in the RML group. This suggests that while rhabdomyolysis is a potential complication, it is relatively uncommon among ICU patients with malignancies. Muscle weakness, a notable symptom of rhabdomyolysis, was significantly more common in the RML group, highlighting its diagnostic importance. Additionally, the RML group had a markedly lower surgical intervention rate, suggesting that other factors contribute prominently to rhabdomyolysis occurrence.

For diagnosing rhabdomyolysis, while medical history and physical examinations offer valuable insights, laboratory studies confirm the diagnosis. CK levels are the most sensitive indicators of myocyte injury in rhabdomyolysis. Our analysis revealed significantly elevated CK levels in the RML group, alongside increased serum myoglobin and troponin I levels. Elevated myoglobin can lead to AKI through myoglobin precipitation with Tamm-Horsfall protein in acidic urine, causing tubular occlusion, and through hydroxyl radical oxidation. Troponin levels, although typically associated with cardiac conditions, can also be elevated due to non-cardiac causes such as rhabdomyolysis. Our findings confirmed abnormally elevated levels of troponin in the RML group.

### Rhabdomyolysis in older adults: Outcomes and prognostic factors [^115JX47M]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). High credibility.

From June 2013 to December 2019, 567 patients aged 18 years or older were admitted to Rennes University Hospital with a primary or secondary diagnosis of "rhabdomyolysis". Of these patients, 211 had CK levels below 5 times normal. We therefore selected the remaining 356 patients for actual rhabdomyolysis. Seven patients were excluded from the study because they were in detention. We contacted the other patients according to the planned protocol, and six refused to participate. Thus, 343 patients were included in the analysis. Of these, 124 were transferred to another hospital after an initial several-hours to a few-days hospital stay. Therefore, in-hospital mortality and complication rates were only available for 219 patients.

### The etiology of rhabdomyolysis: An interaction between genetic susceptibility and external triggers [^1157YdbC]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

In the present single-center study, we identified 1,302 patients with rhabdomyolysis. Ischemia/anoxia was the most frequent trigger, followed by trauma. Of these patients, 193 had clinical characteristics suggestive of a genetic susceptibility, and of those, 72 patients had a confirmed variant in a (putative) rhabdomyolysis-associated gene. Pathogenic variants in 22 different genes were identified, likely to lead to increased rhabdomyolysis susceptibility. In 121 patients, a genetic susceptibility was suspected based on the RHABDO features, but no pathogenic genetic variant was identified. These involved 39 patients in whom genetic testing was performed (32%). In 19 of these patients, one or more variants of uncertain significance were identified (49%). Patients with a proven genetic susceptibility were younger than those with a presumed susceptibility. However, this observation probably reflects the presence of congenital diseases that are often diagnosed already in infancy or childhood.

### Beyond muscle destruction: A systematic review of rhabdomyolysis for clinical practice [^116WceMs]. Critical Care (2016). High credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a disease that can be associated with various symptoms and conditions, including dyspepsia, dark urine, acute compartment syndrome (ALCS), decreased urine output, hyperkalemia, tachycardia, fever, traumatic injury, and statin use. It may also be linked to recent exercise, increased serum creatinine, vomiting, elevated serum creatine kinase (CK), increased urine myoglobin, and heightened serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Other associated factors are muscle cramps, decreased serum calcium, sports participation, muscle weakness, malaise, hyperuricemia, elevated serum myoglobin, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), nausea, myalgia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and abnormal urine color.

### Muscle weakness in adults: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^114rs1Wt]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Although the prevalence of muscle weakness in the general population is uncertain, it occurs in about 5% of U.S. adults 60 years and older. Determining the cause of muscle weakness can be challenging. True muscle weakness must first be differentiated from subjective fatigue or pain-related motor impairment with normal motor strength. Muscle weakness should then be graded objectively using a formal tool such as the Medical Research Council Manual Muscle Testing scale.

The differential diagnosis of true muscle weakness is extensive, including neurologic, rheumatologic, endocrine, genetic, medication- or toxin-related, and infectious etiologies. A stepwise approach to narrowing this differential diagnosis relies on the history and physical examination combined with knowledge of the potential etiologies.

Frailty and sarcopenia are clinical syndromes occurring in older people that can present with generalized weakness. Asymmetric weakness is more common in neurologic conditions, whereas pain is more common in neuropathies or radiculopathies. Identifying abnormal findings, such as Chvostek sign, Babinski reflex, hoarse voice, and muscle atrophy, will narrow the possible diagnoses.

Laboratory testing, including electrolyte, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and creatine kinase measurements, may also be helpful. Magnetic resonance imaging is indicated if there is concern for acute neurologic conditions, such as stroke or cauda equina syndrome, and may also guide muscle biopsy. Electromyography is indicated when certain diagnoses, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are being considered.

### Juvenile-onset permanent weakness in muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency [^115X3zvf]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

We describe a 41-year-old Moroccan woman with phosphofructokinase (PFK) deficiency who presented with slowly progressive muscular weakness since childhood, without rhabdomyolysis episodes or hemolytic anemia. Deltoid biopsy revealed massive glycogen storage in the majority of muscle fibers and polysaccharide deposits. PFK activity in the muscle was totally absent. A novel homozygous nonsense mutation was detected in the PFKM gene. Our observation suggests that juvenile-onset fixed muscle weakness may be a predominant clinical feature of PFK deficiency. Vacuolar myopathy with polyglucosan deposits remains an important morphological hallmark of this rare muscle glycogenosis.

### Rhabdomyolysis: a review [^117SPTVb]. Muscle & Nerve (2002). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis, a syndrome of skeletal muscle breakdown with leakage of muscle contents, is frequently accompanied by myoglobinuria, and if sufficiently severe, acute renal failure with potentially life-threatening metabolic derangements may ensue. A diverse spectrum of inherited and acquired disorders affecting muscle membranes, membrane ion channels, and muscle energy supply causes rhabdomyolysis. Common final pathophysiological mechanisms among these causes of rhabdomyolysis include an uncontrolled rise in free intracellular calcium and activation of calcium-dependent proteases, which lead to destruction of myofibrils and lysosomal digestion of muscle fiber contents. Recent advances in molecular genetics and muscle enzyme histochemistry may enable a specific metabolic diagnosis in many patients with idiopathic rhabdomyolysis.

### Lipitor [^113UuxQw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Lipitor may cause myopathy, characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK), and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including Lipitor.

- **Risk factors for myopathy**: Risk factors include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher Lipitor dosage [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)].

### An unexpected cause of proximal myopathy [^115RNhsg]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

A 25-year-old man presented with a short history of profound proximal muscle weakness such that he was unable to stand. Laboratory investigations demonstrated hypokalaemia and mildly elevated serum creatine kinase. He reported a history of 8–10 episodes of less severe weakness in the preceding 8 years, and his mother reported similar symptoms. The combination of weakness and hypokalaemia, with a probable family history, suggested the diagnosis of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis. He was treated with intravenous and oral potassium supplementation and regained full power within 24 hours.

### Lescol XL [^112DzSzL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Lescol XL may cause myopathy, characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK), and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins, including Lescol XL.

- **Myopathy risk**: Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in CK values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), was less than 0.1% in fluvastatin clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Risk factors for myopathy**: Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Prevention and management**: Avoid concomitant use of Lescol XL with gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, and fluconazole. When used concomitantly with Lescol XL, lipid-modifying doses (≥ 1 g/day) of niacin, fibrates, and colchicine may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

	- Discontinue Lescol XL if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK increases may resolve if Lescol XL is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue Lescol XL in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, such as sepsis, shock, severe hypovolemia, major surgery, trauma, or severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disturbances.
