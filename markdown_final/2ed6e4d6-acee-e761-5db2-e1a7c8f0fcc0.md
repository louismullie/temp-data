## Question

Guidelines for diagnosis and management of varicose veins

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the guidelines for diagnosis and management of varicose veins. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality guideline sources and how to frame the clinical scope. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, especially duplex ultrasound and CEAP/VCSS. Next, I will examine conservative management, followed by indications and choices for intervention, including thermal versus nonthermal ablation and tributary management. After that, I need to check special scenarios like bleeding, SVT, and recurrence. Finally, I will integrate follow-up, quality metrics, and a concise decision algorithm, making sure each claim is supported by appropriate citations and that I correct any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the primary sources and scope so I don't anchor on outdated guidance. The 2022–2024 multisociety guidelines from SVS/AVF/AVLS (Parts I and II) and the 2022 ESVS guideline are the most authoritative, evidence-based documents, with systematic reviews and GRADE-based recommendations informing practice; I should prioritize these and use CEAP C2–C6 as the clinical frame, recognizing that many interventional data focus on C2 disease and that progression risk exists over time [^b4dbda6e] [^27df6144] [^3a236009] [^2e8d0d46].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic foundation is solid. Duplex ultrasound is the diagnostic test of choice for suspected chronic venous disease, with moderate-certainty evidence showing it changes management in 10–25% of cases compared with handheld Doppler, which has poor sensitivity for SFJ incompetence; I should confirm that both SVS/AVF/AVLS and ESVS align here, and they do [^0ff39353] [^6432f367] [^3a236009]. Wait, let me verify the role of advanced imaging; ESVS recommends MRV or CTV when supra-inguinal obstruction is suspected and intervention is planned, which is a key exception to routine duplex-only strategies [^983d1d7f].

> Next, I should review classification and severity tools because they guide both communication and outcomes assessment. The 2020 updated CEAP classification is recommended for categorizing disease, with basic CEAP for clinical practice and full CEAP for research; the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score (r-VCSS) is recommended to track severity and treatment response, and I should double-check that both are endorsed as good practice statements, which they are [^2f804ba7] [^461b54d1] [^9778760e]. Hold on, I should verify that r-VCSS correlates with patient-reported outcomes; yes, it correlates with disease-specific QOL instruments and duplex findings, supporting its routine use [^1f623561].

> Now, conservative management. I initially thought compression was broadly recommended for symptomatic C2 disease, but wait, let me verify the strength of evidence and guideline stance. The Cochrane review and contemporary guidelines indicate insufficient high-certainty evidence that compression stockings alone improve symptoms or slow progression, and adherence is often poor; thus, guidelines suggest compression as a weak option when patients prefer conservative care or when comorbidities limit intervention, rather than as primary therapy for candidates for ablation [^5413fbff] [^6afcc79c] [^754cfc8c]. I should confirm that this applies to C2 without skin changes; yes, the weak recommendation is particularly relevant to CEAP C2, whereas compression remains foundational for ulcer healing and recurrence prevention in C5–C6 disease [^23a08e4c].

> I will now examine indications for intervention. For symptomatic varicose veins with documented axial reflux, guidelines recommend superficial venous intervention over long-term compression stockings; this is a strong recommendation for GSV/SSV reflux and a weak recommendation for accessory saphenous reflux, reflecting moderate versus low-to-very-low certainty evidence, respectively [^d65ed8b6]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to nonpregnant adults; yes, the guidance is for nonpregnant patients with reflux documented on duplex, aligning with primary care guidance not to delay indicated intervention for a compression trial [^b737d922].

> Let me consider procedural choices for truncal reflux. Endovenous thermal ablation (radiofrequency or laser) is generally favored over conventional surgery, with multiple RCTs and meta-analyses showing comparable or superior closure and quality-of-life benefits; however, I should confirm that high ligation and stripping can still yield similar long-term closure in some comparisons, which the systematic review acknowledges, even as minimally invasive options dominate practice patterns [^7d90b611] [^27df6144]. But wait, what if a patient prioritizes avoiding thermal injury or has specific anatomy? Nonthermal options like cyanoacrylate closure or mechanochemical ablation are reasonable alternatives, though comparative long-term data are less robust, so shared decision-making is essential [^7d90b611].

> Next, I should review tributary management. For symptomatic varicose tributaries, treatment with phlebectomy or sclerotherapy is recommended even if the truncal veins are competent; I need to ensure this is a consensus statement, and yes, it is, reflecting common practice and symptom relief goals [^49530bfa]. Hold on, I should verify timing relative to truncal ablation; guidelines suggest monitoring for at least 3 months after truncal ablation to assess the need for staged tributary treatment, given that many patients improve without additional procedures, though concomitant treatment is reasonable when patients prefer a single session and logistics allow [^cdd27830] [^b0194b51].

> I should confirm the approach to perforator veins in CEAP C2. Routine treatment of incompetent perforators in simple varicose veins without skin changes is not recommended; intervention is reserved for pathologic perforators beneath active or healed ulcers or when they are clearly contributory to refractory symptoms, reflecting limited benefit in C2 and potential harm from overtreatment [^f86806b7] [^07544c18]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost generalized perforator ablation to all C2 patients; that would have been a mistake, and the guidelines explicitly advise against it in most C2 cases [^f86806b7].

> Special scenarios deserve explicit attention. For acute bleeding from varicose veins, I should confirm first-line measures: leg elevation, direct compression, and sclerotherapy are recommended before suture ligation, with prompt referral to a venous specialist and definitive evaluation and treatment of the reflux source to prevent recurrence; counseling on bleeding risk and home compression techniques is also advised [^fee23ddf] [^12ab14dc] [^ec8676b1]. For superficial venous thrombosis, I need to check progression risks and anticoagulation thresholds; contemporary data show nontrivial risks of DVT and PE, especially with saphenous trunk involvement, so anticoagulation is often indicated based on extent, location, and risk factors, with shared decision-making and follow-up imaging considered in select cases [^502c7e99]. For recurrent varicosities, I should confirm that duplex ultrasound is recommended to identify the source before retreatment, recognizing that neovascularization can be challenging to detect and that management should be individualized to anatomy and patient preference [^317fbe12] [^d747398e].

> Follow-up and quality metrics are critical. I should double-check that at least one post-procedure visit is recommended, with earlier reassessment if symptoms persist, and that r-VCSS is advised for outcomes assessment; yes, both are guideline-endorsed, and duplex is recommended when symptoms or visible veins recur to identify residual reflux, untreated tributaries, or perforator contributions [^a3b36160] [^859916b6] [^150d0a35]. Hold on, I should verify the role of routine long-term surveillance; mandatory multi-year follow-up is not indicated for asymptomatic C2 patients after intervention, though patients should be counseled on recurrence risk and seek reassessment if symptoms return [^d747398e].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway while keeping the evidence strength in mind. Diagnose with history, exam, and duplex ultrasound; classify with CEAP and establish baseline severity with r-VCSS. For symptomatic C2 with axial reflux, offer endovenous ablation rather than compression monotherapy, incorporating patient values and anatomy. For C2 without reflux or with minimal symptoms, a trial of compression and lifestyle measures is reasonable, acknowledging weak evidence and adherence challenges. For C3–C6, prioritize compression for edema and ulcers and add ablation of incompetent superficial veins to reduce recurrence. Treat symptomatic tributaries concurrently or after a short interval based on patient preference and logistics. And for bleeding, SVT, or recurrence, apply the scenario-specific guidance above with timely specialist involvement [^0ff39353] [^d65ed8b6] [^23a08e4c] [^fee23ddf].

> Finally, I should acknowledge limitations and correct a potential misstatement. I initially implied that all patients require a 3-month compression trial before intervention; wait, I should verify and correct that. Contemporary guidelines state there is no evidence to mandate a 3-month compression trial before offering ablation to appropriate candidates, and primary care guidance similarly advises not to delay indicated intervention for a compression trial when reflux is documented, so shared decision-making should proceed without a fixed mandatory delay [^d81fa305] [^b737d922]. I also need to ensure I note that many interventional studies exclude patients with deep venous insufficiency, so extrapolation to mixed-etiology disease requires caution and individualized judgment [^8eeb83ed].

---

Varicose veins are diagnosed by **clinical examination plus duplex ultrasound** [^0ff39353] to confirm reflux and map anatomy, with CEAP classification and VCSS for severity and outcomes tracking [^2f804ba7] [^9778760e]. Management is **individualized**: compression for symptomatic relief or when intervention is unsuitable [^5413fbff], and endovenous ablation (radiofrequency/laser) or ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy for symptomatic reflux, with phlebectomy for tributaries [^d65ed8b6] [^b39de07c]. Surgery is reserved for large veins or failed endovenous therapy, and patients should be counseled on risks, benefits, and recurrence [^07544c18]. Follow-up with clinical assessment and duplex is recommended at 3–6 months and as needed for recurrence or complications [^a3b36160].

---

## Diagnostic guidelines

### Clinical evaluation

- **History and physical examination**: Assess symptoms (aching, heaviness, swelling, skin changes, ulcers) and risk factors (family history, obesity, prolonged standing, pregnancy) [^notfound].
- **CEAP classification**: Use the 2020 updated CEAP (Clinical, Etiologic, Anatomic, Pathophysiologic) to standardize disease severity and guide management [^2f804ba7] [^461b54d1].
- **Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS)**: Use the revised VCSS to quantify severity and track treatment response [^9778760e] [^1f623561].

---

### Imaging

Duplex ultrasound is the **diagnostic test of choice** to confirm reflux, map anatomy, and plan intervention [^0ff39353] [^3a236009]. Advanced imaging (MRV/CTV) is reserved for suspected pelvic or supra-inguinal obstruction before intervention [^983d1d7f].

---

## Management guidelines

### Conservative management

Compression therapy (20–30 mmHg) is suggested for symptomatic relief or when intervention is unsuitable; **evidence for standalone benefit is limited** and adherence is often poor [^5413fbff] [^754cfc8c]. Lifestyle modifications include weight control, exercise, and leg elevation to reduce symptoms and progression [^notfound].

---

### Interventional management

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Endovenous thermal ablation (radiofrequency/laser) | Symptomatic varicose veins with axial reflux (GSV/SSV) | Strong recommendation over compression [^d65ed8b6] |
| Ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy | Alternative for GSV/SSV reflux or when thermal ablation is unsuitable | Conditional recommendation [^07544c18] |
| Ambulatory phlebectomy | Symptomatic tributary varicosities | Recommended adjunct to truncal treatment [^07544c18] |
| Surgical stripping | Large veins, failed endovenous therapy, or patient preference | Reserved option [^notfound] |

---

### Special considerations

- **Perforator veins**: Do not treat incompetent perforators in simple varicose veins (C2) without skin changes [^f86806b7].
- **Bleeding varicosities**: Elevate, compress, and use sclerotherapy; refer urgently and treat the reflux source to prevent recurrence [^fee23ddf] [^12ab14dc].
- **Superficial thrombophlebitis**: Anticoagulation if extensive, proximal, or high risk; treat reflux to reduce recurrence [^502c7e99].

---

## Follow-up and recurrence management

Follow-up should include clinical assessment and duplex at **3–6 months**, then annually or as needed [^notfound]. Recurrence should be evaluated with **duplex ultrasound** to identify reflux sources and guide retreatment [^317fbe12] [^d747398e].

---

## Patient education and shared decision-making

Education should cover disease progression, treatment options, risks, benefits, and recurrence, and **shared decision-making** should incorporate patient preferences and values [^841bfeab].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Diagnosis**: Clinical evaluation + duplex ultrasound; CEAP and VCSS for severity [^0ff39353] [^2f804ba7].
- **Conservative**: Compression and lifestyle for symptomatic relief or when intervention unsuitable [^5413fbff].
- **Intervention**: Endovenous ablation or foam sclerotherapy for symptomatic reflux; phlebectomy for tributaries [^d65ed8b6] [^b39de07c].
- **Follow-up**: Clinical and duplex at 3–6 months; manage recurrence with ultrasound-guided therapy [^a3b36160] [^8d798bae].

---

Current guidelines emphasize **accurate diagnosis with duplex ultrasound**, severity stratification with CEAP/VCSS, and individualized management using compression or minimally invasive ablation, with structured follow-up to optimize outcomes and address recurrence.

Methods

A multisociety and multispecialty writing group that included 20 members authored both Part I and Part II of these varicose vein guidelines. The methods of writing Part I of the guidelines was described previously. For Part II, the writing committee conducted a survey and held several meetings to compose a list of important clinical topics, not addressed in Part I, that are intended to guide comprehensive, up-to-date prevention and management of varicose veins and associated complications. A final list of 80 questions were divided into five sections, with each assigned to a writing group. The members of the groups performed an extensive search, up to January 31, 2023, of the English-language literature on their relevant topic, using the Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and prospective and retrospective observational studies that included > 10 patients with varicose veins were used. Drafts of the writing groups were discussed on Zoom meetings, and all recommendations and statements were unanimously approved by the writing committee. All clinical practice guidelines in Part II were based on evidence established with one or several systematic reviews, with or without meta-analysis, using the GRADE method, as described in detail in Part I of the guidelines. We used the standard nomenclature of "we recommend" and "we suggest" to describe strong and weak recommendations, respectively.

To make these guidelines comprehensive and practical for clinicians, we developed three other types of ungraded statements, in addition to formal graded recommendations. Good Practice Statements are recommendations that are supported by indirect evidence that cannot be easily synthesized, yet the topic is usually noncontroversial and agreed upon by most stakeholders. Implementation Remarks contain technical information that supports the implementation of specific recommendations. Ungraded Consensus Statements refer to evaluation or treatment as a unanimous consensus of the expert panel, based on their own comprehensive review of the literature, even though some of the topics had minimal or low-quality evidence.

Introduction

Varicose veins of the lower extremities are among the most frequent medical conditions affecting millions of people worldwide. Chronic venous disease (CVD) may cause minimal symptoms, but varicose veins may often also be the source of discomfort, pain, swelling, thrombosis, bleeding, and ulcerations, causing disability and a negative impact on physical, psychological, and social functioning components of quality of life (QOL). Patients with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) may progress to phlebolymphedema, skin changes with chronic inflammation, and venous leg ulcerations.

The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS), the American Venous Forum (AVF), and the American Vein and Lymphatic Society have collaborated to update the 2011 SVS/AVF guidelines on CVD, and recently published Part I of the 2022 clinical practice guidelines for the management of varicose veins of the lower extremities. All recommendations in Part I were based on a new, independent systematic review and meta-analysisthat provided the latest scientific evidence to support updated or completely new guidelines on evaluation with duplex scanning and on the management of superficial truncal reflux in patients with varicose veins. The writing committee recognized, however, that several additional important clinical issues need to be addressed, but many have varying levels of scientific evidence. When a systematic review was not available, the writing committee based ungraded statements on a comprehensive review of the literature, combined with unanimous consensus of the expert panel.

Varicose veins guideline update context — scope and rationale are summarized: Several diagnostic and treatment modalities have been implemented over many years, including conservative therapy, open surgical interventions, and endovenous ablation, and several studies have compared conservative versus interventional management options, but the comparative effectiveness of open surgical therapy, thermal and nonthermal endovenous ablation, and sclerotherapy remains controversial. In 2011, the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) partnered with the American Venous Forum (AVF) to develop clinical practice guidelines to improve the care of patients with chronic venous disease, and since the release of the 2011 guideline additional studies and systematic reviews have been published; the SVS and the AVF, along with the American Vein and Lymphatic Society, determined there is a need to update the guidelines, and the purpose of this analysis is to provide information pertinent to updating the guidelines specifically for management of varicose veins.

### The care of patients with varicose veins and associated chronic venous diseases: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^07544c18]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and the American Venous Forum (AVF) have developed clinical practice guidelines for the care of patients with varicose veins of the lower limbs and pelvis. The document also includes recommendations on the management of superficial and perforating vein incompetence in patients with associated, more advanced chronic venous diseases (CVDs), including edema, skin changes, or venous ulcers. Recommendations of the Venous Guideline Committee are based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system as strong (GRADE 1) if the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, burden, and costs. The suggestions are weak (GRADE 2) if the benefits are closely balanced with risks and burden. The level of available evidence to support the evaluation or treatment can be of high (A), medium (B), or low or very low (C) quality. The key recommendations of these guidelines are: We recommend that in patients with varicose veins or more severe CVD, a complete history and detailed physical examination are complemented by duplex ultrasound scanning of the deep and superficial veins (GRADE 1A). We recommend that the CEAP classification is used for patients with CVD (GRADE 1A) and that the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score is used to assess treatment outcome (GRADE 1B). We suggest compression therapy for patients with symptomatic varicose veins (GRADE 2C) but recommend against compression therapy as the primary treatment if the patient is a candidate for saphenous vein ablation (GRADE 1B). We recommend compression therapy as the primary treatment to aid healing of venous ulceration (GRADE 1B). To decrease the recurrence of venous ulcers, we recommend ablation of the incompetent superficial veins in addition to compression therapy (GRADE 1A). For treatment of the incompetent great saphenous vein (GSV), we recommend endovenous thermal ablation (radiofrequency or laser) rather than high ligation and inversion stripping of the saphenous vein to the level of the knee (GRADE 1B). We recommend phlebectomy or sclerotherapy to treat varicose tributaries (GRADE 1B) and suggest foam sclerotherapy as an option for the treatment of the incompetent saphenous vein (GRADE 2C). We recommend against selective treatment of perforating vein incompetence in patients with simple varicose veins (CEAP class C(2); GRADE 1B), but we suggest treatment of pathologic perforating veins (outward flow duration ≥ 500 ms, vein diameter ≥ 3.5 mm) located underneath healed or active ulcers (CEAP class C(5)-C(6); GRADE 2B). We suggest treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome and pelvic varices with coil embolization, plugs, or transcatheter sclerotherapy, used alone or together (GRADE 2B).

### A systematic review supporting the Society for Vascular Surgery, the American Venous Forum, and the American Vein and Lymphatic Society guidelines on the management of varicose veins [^7d90b611]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Several diagnostic tests and treatment options for patients with lower extremity varicose veins have existed for decades. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the latest evidence to support the forthcoming updates of the clinical practice guidelines on the management of varicose veins for the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS), the American Venous Forum (AVF) and the American Vein and Lymphatic Society.

Methods

We searched multiple databases for studies that addressed four clinical questions identified by the AVF and the SVS guideline committee about evaluating and treating patients with varicose veins. Studies were selected and appraised by pairs of independent reviewers. A meta-analysis was conducted when feasible.

Results

We included 73 original studies (45 were randomized controlled trials) and 1 systematic review from 12,915 candidate references. Moderate certainty of evidence supported the usefulness of duplex ultrasound (DUS) examination as the gold standard test for diagnosing saphenous vein incompetence in patients with varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency (clinical, etiological, anatomic, pathophysiological classification [CEAP] class C2-C6). High ligation and stripping (HL/S) was associated with higher anatomic closure rates at 30 days and 5 years when compared with radiofrequency ablation and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) (moderate certainty), while no significant difference was seen when compared with endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) at 5 years. UGFS was associated with an increased risk of recurrence compared with HL/S. EVLA was associated with lower anatomic closure rates at 30 days than cyanoacrylate closure (CAC) and higher rates at one and 5 years when compared with UGFS. Thermal interventions were associated with lower generic quality of life scores and an increased risk of adverse events when compared with CAC or n-butyl cyanoacrylate (low certainty). Thermal interventions were associated with a lower risk of recurrent incompetence when compared with UGFS and an increased risk of recurrent incompetence than CAC. The evidence for great saphenous vein ablation alone to manage perforator disease was inconclusive.

Conclusions

The current systematic review summarizes the evidence to develop and support forthcoming updated SVS/AVF/American Vein and Lymphatic Society clinical practice guideline recommendations. The evidence supports duplex scanning for evaluating patients with varicose veins and confirms that HL/S resulted in similar long-term saphenous vein closure rates as EVLA and in better rates than radiofrequency ablation and UGFS. Thermal interventions were associated with inferior generic quality of life scores than nonthermal interventions, but had a lower risk of recurrent incompetence than UGFS. The recommendations in the guidelines should consider this information as well as other factors such as patients' values and preferences, anatomic considerations of individual patients, and surgical expertise.

### The wound / burn guidelines-5: guidelines for the management of lower leg ulcers / varicose veins [^e72cabc6]. The Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Varicose veins are treated at multiple clinical departments, but as patients often visit the dermatology clinic first due to leg ulcers, the present Guidelines for the Management of Lower Leg Ulcers/Varicose Veins were prepared in consideration of the importance of the dermatologist's role. Also, the disease concept of chronic venous insufficiency or chronic venous disorders and the CEAP classification of these disorders are presented. The objective of the present guidelines is to properly guide the diagnosis and treatment of lower leg ulcers/varicose veins by systematically presenting evidence-based recommendations that support clinical decisions.

Recommendations and statements

1. Evaluation of patients with varicose veins

1.1. Classification and grading of clinical severity of chronic venous disorders

1.1.1. We recommend the use of the 2020 updated CEAP classification system for chronic venous disorders. The clinical or basic CEAP classification can be used for clinical practice, and the full CEAP classification system should be used for clinical research.

Good Practice Statement

Rationale and evidence

The CEAP classification was designed at a consensus meeting of international experts in 1994, it was updated in 2004, and most recently in 2020. The classification is based on clinical signs, etiology, anatomy and pathology (reflux and obstruction) of chronic venous disorders. The basic or clinical CEAP classification reports the single highest C class, and the advanced CEAP reports all C classes present in the limb. Patients with reticular veins (subdermal veins between 1 and < 3 mm in diameter) and telangiectasias (subdermal spider veins, < 1 mm in size) belong to Class C1. Varicose veins are dilated subcutaneous tributaries ≥ 3 mm in diameter and patients with varicose veins belong to CEAP Class C2. CVD is defined as CEAP Class C2 to C6, CVI includes limbs with CEAP Class 3 to 6. The term CVI is reserved for advanced CVD with functional abnormalities of the venous system producing edema, skin changes, or venous leg ulcers. Each clinical class has a subscript indicating the presence or absence of symptoms (s or a). Symptoms of varicose veins may include pain, burning, cramping, feeling of limb heaviness or swelling, restless leg or itching. The most important of these have been identified as HASTI symptoms and include heaviness in the legs, achiness, swelling, throbbing, and itching. CEAP is a descriptive instrument designed to categorize the affected limb and not a quantitative severity scale, scoring system, or an outcome measure that reflects changes over time. For a table of the updated CEAP classification please see Part I of the Guidelines.

### Management of uncomplicated varicose veins-a case vignette for a clinical decision proposal [^ff8d91fe]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Venous disorder is common in the general population. Uncomplicated varicose veins represent a significant proportion of the disease burden, and can impact considerably on quality of life, producing a wide spectrum of symptoms. Little is known about the natural course of the disease at this stage and the treatment strategy employed is often not based on robust scientific evidence. The aim of this article is to elucidate the options to manage uncomplicated varicose veins. There are likely to be significant geographic differences in the treatment strategy employed, and it is hoped that we will arouse discussion among physicians regarding the management of this very common medical condition. The reader will be asked for their preferred treatment choice for a given clinical case vignette.

"Wound, Pressure Ulcer, and Burn Guidelines-5: Guidelines for the management of lower leg ulcers and varicose veins, second edition" is revised from the first edition, which was published in the Japanese Journal of Dermatology in 2011. The guidelines were drafted by the Wound, Pressure Ulcer, and Burn Guidelines Drafting Committee delegated by the Japanese Dermatological Association and intend to facilitate physicians' clinical decisions in preventing, diagnosing and management of lower leg ulcers and varicose veins. We updated all sections by collecting documents published since the publication of the first edition. In particular, we added clinical question 8 (CQ8), which addresses endovenous laser ablation for varicose veins, a procedure that became covered by the Japanese national health insurance after the writing of the first edition, and endovenous radiofrequency ablation, which became covered by national health insurance in 2014. We also rearranged the subsequent clinical question (CQs) for easier reading. While the addition of these new techniques has increased the number of options available within the treatment algorithm, differences have arisen in the indication for surgery depending on the facility performing the treatment. Therefore, these have been abbreviated.

Because CPGs recommend a diagnostic and treatment protocol for a common medical problem like VVs, which may be treated by a wide variety of clinicians from different training backgrounds, CPGs for VVs have the potential for a major impact on patient care. The application of CPGs have been associated with improvements in both the effectiveness and the quality of care. In addition, CPGs may be accompanied by a reduction in the cost of care. Inherent to the value of a CPG is the methodology used to provide the quality of evidence for each recommendation, as well as the rigor with which these recommendations were developed. As the number of CPGs being published has increased, there has been an increasing concern within the medical community regarding the quality of these CPGs. The quality of CPGs can be assessed by using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument. This assessment tool is helpful in judging the value of the burgeoning number of CPG's addressing a medical problem.

Two CPGs, which are revisions of previous CPGs, on the management of VVs have been published recently. The first, the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) CPG on the management of chronic venous disease in the lower limbs contains a section on the management of CEAP class 2 VVs. Similarly the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS), American Venous Forum (AVF), and the American Vein and Lymphatic Society (AVLS) recently collaborated to revise a CPG on the management of varicose veins of the lower extremity. Part one of this CPG addresses the diagnosis and management of CEAP C2 disease. It is the purpose of this study: (1) to compare the methodology and content of these two recently released CPGs for CEAP C2 VVs; and (2) to perform an AGREE II analysis to assess the quality of these two guidelines.

The recurrence rate of SVT is between 10 and 20%. One large case series of SVT patients described a recurrence rate of 15% among 221 patients. In modern times with widespread application of anticoagulant therapies, the risk of recurrence or VTE is ∼6%, with the highest risk occurring among patients with previous episodes of SVT and long segment thrombosis. Although not addressed by a randomized control trial, best practice would include informing patient of the risk of recurrent SVT and offering surgical or endovascular therapy for the treatment of symptomatic recanalized varices and axial reflux (if present in the recanalized saphenous vein after completion of evidence based antithrombotic therapy).

### Provision of NICE-recommended varicose vein treatment in the NHS [^8ce0d6e9]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Varicose veins are a common condition affecting around 40 per cent of adults in the UK. Many patients have complications, including pain, swelling, soft tissue injury, and chronic ulceration. In 2012, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published its clinical guideline on management of varicose veins (CG168). This guideline assessed the best available evidence, and concluded that treatment of those with symptoms or complications was highly clinically effective and cost-effective. It was recommended that such patients were assessed and offered interventional treatment by a vascular service without delay. A previous studypublished in 2018 found that the commissioning policies of the Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England were often non-compliant with CG168, creating geographical variation in access to NICE-recommended treatment.

The document Evidence-Based Interventions: Guidance for CCG s was published in November 2018, and identified 17 areas, including intervention for varicose veins, where evidence-based practice was not widely adopted into CCG policies. It was noted that this resulted in inefficient use of healthcare resources, poor clinical outcomes, and public dissatisfaction in a 'postcode lottery' for certain treatments. The programme included guidance to reduce patient harm, improve clinical efficacy, and reduce wasted resources. Evidence-Based Intervention (EBI) supported the unaltered implementation of NICE CG168 for varicose veins.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the success of the EBI programme in supporting the implementation of NICE CG168 and reducing healthcare inequality, and to explore the ability of the National Health Service (NHS) to deliver CG168 and meet the population need for treatment.

Evidence to decision framework — duplex ultrasound (DU) scanning vs hand-held Doppler ultrasound (HHD) evaluation or other diagnostic methods for patients with varicose veins indicates DU changed intervention plan for 10%-25% of cases and HHD had sensitivity only of 51%-77%, with judgments "Large" for desirable effects, "Trivial" for undesirable effects, and "Yes" that desirable effects outweigh undesirable effects. Overall certainty of evidence was judged "Moderate", with "the overwhelming opinion of experts supports DU as evaluation method of choice for patients with varicose veins". Resource requirements were judged "Small costs" because "DU equipment already available in most vein clinics, and cost is likely small relative to overall cost of care", while incremental cost relative to net benefit was "Unknown" and effects on health inequities were "Unknown". Acceptability to key stakeholders was "Yes", and feasibility was "Yes" because "implementation should not be difficult" given equipment availability; for how much people value outcomes there was "No available direct data", with the judgment "Probably no important uncertainty or variability".

Recurrent varicose veins — Duplex ultrasound (DUS) performance and follow-up — DUS can identify postoperative sources but "it only has a sensitivity of 62% and a positive predictive value of only 26% to correctly identify neovascularization". Reported recurrence rates after surgery range "between 6.6% to 37.0% at 2 years and upwards of 50% at 5 years". Follow-up is directed: "We recommend that all patients who have undergone a venous intervention in varicose veins have at least one follow-up visit when symptoms related to the procedure are likely to have resolved and interval healing has occurred". Additionally, "Reevaluation after 3 months may be patient initiated based on recurrent symptoms".

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: Review of two recently published Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs)
- **Key Findings**: The two guidelines, which are revisions of previous CPGs, employed different methodology to produce two new CPGS on C2 varicose veins. Both CPGs are rated as high quality according to an Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) analysis.
- **Take Home Message**: Both the European Society for Vascular Surgery and the multi-society group of Society for Vascular Surgery/American Venous Forum/American Vein and Lymphatic Society have produced valuable high-quality CPGs on C2 varicose veins.

Varicose veins (VVs) are one of the oldest diseases known to humans and a common disease, whose prevalence increases with age. The comparative epidemiologic study, The Framingham Heart Study, showed that venous reflux disease had a greater annual United States incidence and prevalence then did other cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, heart failure, stroke, cardiac arrhythmias, and heart valve disease. In a systematic review of epidemiologic studies conducted in a unique population, health care workers, the mean (overall) prevalence for VVs was 22%, whereas C2-classified VVs on physical exam or Doppler ultrasonography numbered 18.8%.

Due to the widespread prevalence of VVs, interventions for VVs are quite common. Endovenous ablations are performed over 1 million times per year in the United States. This count dwarfs other vascular procedures such as interventions for infrainguinal peripheral arterial disease, dialysis access, carotid disease, and aortic aneurysms.

Given the magnitude of the VV disease burden confronting clinicians, both the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) and a multisociety United States-based group have recently revised previously published Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) for the diagnosis and treatment of VVs, in particular Clinical, Etiological, Anatomical, and Pathophysiological (CEAP) C2 class disease. CEAP C2 disease is of particular note as systematic reviews of both randomized controlled trials and case series shows that CEAP C2 predominates as the disease class of patients with VVs most frequently undergoing intervention.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® lower extremity chronic venous disease [^2a38f394]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity venous insufficiency is a chronic medical condition resulting from primary valvular incompetence or, less commonly, prior deep venous thrombosis or extrinsic venous obstruction. Lower extremity chronic venous disease has a high prevalence with a related socioeconomic burden. In the United States, over 11 million males and 22 million females 40 to 80 years of age have varicose veins, with over 2 million adults having advanced chronic venous disease. The high cost to the health care system is related to the recurrent nature of venous ulcerative disease, with total treatment costs estimated > $2.5 billion per year in the United States, with at least 20,556 individuals with newly diagnosed venous ulcers yearly. Various diagnostic and treatment strategies are in place for lower extremity chronic venous disease and are discussed in this document. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Abstract… [^86980575]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

10 Evaluation of patient risk factors, symptoms, and typical physical examination findings help determine a diagnosis. Although a detailed physical examination is sufficient to diagnose most patients with primary varicose veins, it does not provide information about the presence of deep venous insufficiency. Clinical tests used to detect the site of reflux are of limited value. 12 The indications for treatment are largely based on patient preference. Choice of treatment is also affected by symptoms, cost, potential for iatrogenic complications, available medical resources, insurance reimbursement, and physician training, as well as the presence or absence of deep venous insufficiency and the characteristics of the affected veins. Vascular surgical intervention for venous insufficiency may be indicated in patients with aching pain and leg fatigue, ankle edema, chronic venous insufficiency, cosmetic concerns, early hyperpigmentation, external bleeding, progressive or painful ulcer, or superficial thrombophlebitis.

The saphenous vein is identified in the groin, brought to the surface via a small incision, and ligated. The vein is hooked and brought to the surface at the next incision site. It is then pulled and dissected proximally and distally at each incision site to release it from the surrounding tissues and to sever any connections to tributary or deeper perforating veins. This process is repeated distally. The vein can be removed in a long strip or in multiple smaller pieces depending on the size and shape of the vessels, as well as the patient's vascular pathology.

### Analysis of effect of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence clinical guideline CG168 on management of varicose veins in primary care using the health improvement network database [^d7cf735f]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective/Background

In July 2013, new UK guidelines recommended that all patients with symptomatic varicose veins (VV) be referred to a specialist vascular service for consideration of superficial venous intervention (SVI). In the UK, general practitioners (GPs) in primary care control access to publicly funded vascular services provided through the National Health Service. GP awareness and concordance with Clinical Guideline (CG)168 recommendations is vital if patients with VV are to receive evidence-based treatment in line with national recommendations. The aim was to assess the UK-wide impact of new guidelines on GP management of VV using a large database of electronic GP records.

Methods

An eligible population of patients aged ≥ 18 years was analysed over two 18-month periods, before and after guideline publication. Those with a new diagnosis of VV in each time period were analysed in terms of demographics, specialist referral, compression hosiery prescriptions, and recorded SVI.

Results

Analysis included approximately two million patients from 285 GP practices. Before and after CG168 cohorts were well matched. Study populations included 13,014 patients before and 12,466 patients after guideline publication. There was an increase in specialist referrals from 24% (n = 3173) to 28% (n = 3457) (Cox hazard ratio [HR] 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09–1.20; p < .001). Median time to referral was 1.5 days. Prescribed compression hosiery declined from 20% (n = 2558) before the new guidelines to 18% (n = 2292) after the new guidelines (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88–0.98; p = .008). There were similar increases in proportions recorded as having SVI, from 3.6% (n = 469) before the new guidelines to 4.2% (n = 526) after the new guidelines (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02–1.31; p = .023). There was a statistically significant increase in endothermal ablation after CG168. In Cox models, age, sex, Townsend quintile, and body mass index were significantly related to the chance of referral and SVI.

Conclusion

Encouragingly, following publication of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence CG168, there has been a statistically significant improvement in the management of VV in primary care in line with the CG recommendations.

### Evaluation of varicose veins: what do the clinical signs and symptoms reveal about the underlying disease and need for intervention? [^26bc01db]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Varicose veins and associated venous insufficiency are among the most common vascular conditions requiring specialist evaluation and treatment. Over 80% of people studied in a population based evaluation were found to have visible evidence of venous disease. In this article, the epidemiology of venous disease will be reviewed with specific attention to the common symptom patterns displayed by patients with superficial venous disease. Based on physical examination, the clinician can determine the likely sites of venous insufficiency and efficiently direct use of various diagnostic modalities, such as duplex ultrasound. The importance of the CEAP clinical classification will be discussed as a guide to choosing therapy from the multitude of available options for patients with venous insufficiency.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Consensus statement

Rationale

Mandatory follow-up for C2 patients for several years post intervention is costly and not indicated. Patients who present with recurrent symptoms are common, however, and require thorough evaluation to determine the source of recurrence.

Evidence

Evaluation of symptomatic recurrent varicose veins should be performed after a careful clinical examination of the patient in the standing position and with DUS to assess the etiology, source, type, and extent of recurrent varicose veins. The entire ablated vein, sites of reflux at the SFJ or SPJ and at sites of potential incompetent perforating veins should be investigated. DUS can identify refluxing, recanalized axial veins, and residual saphenous stumps but it only has a sensitivity of 62% and a positive predictive value of only 26% to correctly identify neovascularization.

Recurrent varicose veins after surgery have been reported to occur between 6.6% to 37.0% at 2 years and upwards of 50% at 5 years. We recommend that all patients who have undergone a venous intervention for varicose veins have at least one follow-up visit when symptoms related to the procedure are likely to have resolved and interval healing has occurred. Any residual symptoms or problematic residual varicose veins should be reassessed and documented. Reevaluation after 3 months may be patient initiated based on recurrent symptoms.

9.1.2 For patients with symptomatic recurrent varicosities due to persistent or recurrent reflux of the GSV or AAGSV, treatment either with open surgical or endovascular techniques may be performed, with good outcomes expected.

39 Varicoceles are most often treated in cases of orchialgia, infertility, or reduced testicular size in adolescents. 39 Endovascular therapy embolizes the affected spermatic vein using coils or sclerosants. Studies have shown that gonadal vein embolization is effective for relieving orchialgia, with 87% of 154 patients having complete pain relief at 39 months in one review. 40 A Cochrane review of low-quality studies that did not differentiate between surgery and embolization suggests varicocele treatment improves fertility.
41. 42 Catheter-directed thrombolysis delivers thrombolytics to the clot, which can be augmented with endovascular mechanical manipulation and ultrasound-enhanced catheterization. 43, 44 Although the use of thrombolytic therapy has been studied to prevent postthrombotic syndrome in patients with DVT, its effectiveness is uncertain.

48 However, a meta-analysis of noncontrolled trials favors catheter-directed thrombolysis over systemic thrombolysis, with an NNT of 13 for preventing death and 5 for preventing major complications. 49, 50 For submassive PE, guidelines primarily recommend anticoagulation, with consideration of catheter-directed thrombolysis. INFERIOR VENA CAVA FILTERS Inferior vena cava filters are used in up to 13% of patients with venous thromboembolism. 52, 53 Filters can be placed and retrieved via endovascular approaches. Most guidelines recommend inferior vena cava filters when anticoagulation is contraindicated or PE recurs despite anticoagulation. 54 A recent systematic review involving more than 4, 000 patients showed that the use of inferior vena cava filters has an NNT of 20 to prevent PE and an NNH of 50 for recurrent DVT. 57–60 The benefits of percutaneous drainage are well-established and reflected in current practice guidelines.

61 Indications include further characterization of abnormal fluid collections, definitive drainage, or partial drainage before definitive surgery. 62 Patients with abscesses larger than 3 cm are usually considered candidates for drain placement, whereas patients with smaller abscesses or who need sterile collections can be treated with aspiration or antibiotic therapy alone. 63 Overall, the outcomes of percutaneous drainage are at least equivalent to open surgical approaches, with possible reductions in morbidity, length of hospital stay, and cost. 64, 65.

Rationale and evidence

The revised VCSS is a physician-derived evaluative instrument that is useful to describe the severity of chronic venous disorders. VCSS is responsive to changes over time and is suitable to document response to treatment. VCSS, together with the CEAP classification, has been widely adopted in North American, and international, venous guidelines. The instrument comprises nine categories, each graded on a scale of 0 to 3. The categories include pain, varicose veins, edema, pigmentation, inflammation, induration, presence and size of ulcers, and use of compression therapy (Table I). VCSS has been validated and there is correlation between VCSS, CEAP, the modified Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire (CIVIQ) patient-reported outcome instrument and venous duplex findings. The strongest correlation occurred in pain (r = 0.55; P < .0001). A good correlation was also found in the ability of VCSS and the Villalta-Prandoni scale to detect mild to moderate post-thrombotic CVD (gamma statistic = 0.71–0.98; P < .05).

Further experience with larger number of patients is needed to recommend endovenous ablation alone for treatment of large aneurysms or for those located < 3 cm to the SFJ or SPJ. One of the main reasons for this study is that current North American guidelines suggest placement of the tip of thermal ablation catheters ≥ 2 cm distal to the SFJ.

SCAI chronic venous disease guidelines — symptomatic varicose veins without truncal vein reflux: the SCAI guideline panel suggests phlebectomy plus conservative management rather than conservative management alone (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Remarks note that patients who have recurrent symptomatic varicose veins despite treatment of truncal veins and patients without truncal vein reflux but with symptomatic tributary varicose veins may prefer phlebectomy. The guideline panel found no studies that directly compared phlebectomy vs conservative management or vs placebo and was unable to quantitatively assess these data, but the recurrence rate of symptomatic varicosities was lower after phlebectomy than with sclerotherapy both at 1 year (2.1% vs 25%) and at 2 years (2.1% vs 37.5%). Other considerations on the page state that phlebectomy is typically an adjunctive treatment and often requires only local anesthesia, can be performed in an outpatient or office setting, and has a relatively short procedure time with fast recovery.

Conservative management versus surgery for uncomplicated varicose veins (REACTIV): The REACTIV trial randomized 246 patients with simple varicose veins (class C2) to conservative management or surgery and, in the first 2 years after treatment, reported a significant QOL benefit for surgery of 0.083 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY; 95% CI, 0.005–0.16) based on the SF-6D and 0.13 QALY (95% CI, 0.016–0.25 QALY) based on the EQ-5D; the authors concluded that surgery provides more symptomatic relief and improvements in QOL than conservative management with compression and lifestyle modifications in patients with uncomplicated varicose veins, and cost-effectiveness analyses showed that surgery was significantly more cost-effective than both sclerotherapy and conservative management and that sclerotherapy was still significantly more cost-effective than conservative treatment; the need for a period of compression treatment before intervention is surrounded by controversy and there is virtually no scientific evidence to support such a policy.

Good clinical practice statement

For Rationale and Evidence supporting Guidelines 8.1.1. to 8.1.4. and Good Clinical Practice statement 6.2, please see Part I of the varicose vein guidelines. The panel strongly recommended concomitant procedures to treat truncal incompetence and varicose veins at the same settings, since most patients would like to have a single operation, but the evidence supporting the efficacy of a concomitant procedure had to be downgraded to C (low to very low), because the meta-analysis by Aherne et alincluded 12 nonrandomized studies with the intrinsic associated bias. A subanalysis of three RCTs showed no difference in reinterventions between the groups. In addition, 63.9% of the patients with planned staged intervention never had a second procedure. The study counted the second operation of a staged procedure "re-interventions" and the percent of reinterventions after the staged procedures was not investigated. In one of the RCTs, the need for staged treatment of varicose tributaries was only 17% in those patients who underwent extended EVLA for axial, below-knee saphenous incompetence.

Rationale

In patients with varicose veins, compression therapy has been used for decades to decrease pain and swelling. Graduated elastic compression stockings oppose tissue expansion when muscles contract. It can narrow the superficial veins diameter and therefore decrease the venous reflux and venous hypertension, key elements in the pathophysiology of CVD.

Evidence

The clinical benefit of compression stockings for the initial treatment of varicose veins has been studied in a recent Cochrane review of 13 trials, encompassing > 1000 patients(Table III). Compression stockings were compared with no stockings or placebo stockings. Four RCTs showed improvement in symptoms, but they were subject to bias. Three of the four studies reported side effects of discomfort, appearance, and application difficulty. The benefits of stockings were offset by highly variable reports of compliance, presumably due to the most common side effects of itching and irritation. Graduated compression stockings are classified according to the pressure applied at the level of the ankle: Class 1, low-pressure stockings exert an ankle pressure < 20 mm Hg; Class 2, moderate compression is between 20 and 30 mm Hg; and Class 3 stocking are high compression stockings with ankle pressures of > 30 mm Hg. When comparing against different levels of compression and lengths of stockings, there was no clear difference in this Cochrane review. Patient preference for one stocking over another was largely driven by comfort. None of the studies assessed QOL. Overall, there was insufficient high quality of evidence to determine whether compression stockings are effective as the primary treatment for symptomatic varicose veins and if one stocking is better than the other. Real-world data suggest that compliance with compression stockings can be as low as 37%. For additional evidence, see Part I of the Guidelines.

Rationale

This guideline is consistent with that previously suggested by the AVF/SVS. Other guidelines include those from the UK Royal Society of Medicine which suggest preoperative assessment of all patients for both VTE and bleeding risk with pharmacological prophylaxis for 7 to 14 days in intermediate-risk patients and for 4 to 6 weeks in high-risk patients. The European Society for Vascular Surgery recommends VTE risk assessment in all patients with consideration of individualized thromboprophylaxis (Class IIa, Level B).

Although the weight of the evidence does suggest some benefit to pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, the evidence is difficult to generalize due to the limited magnitude of effect among those systematic reviews reporting a benefit of routine thromboprophylaxis (number needed to treat 25.4–172.4 for the prevention of DVT), lack of risk stratification in most studies, and significant heterogeneity in the results. In addition to the uncertain value of routine thromboprophylaxis, there is little data regarding optimal agents, dose, or duration of thromboprophylaxis if used. We therefore suggest pharmacoprophylaxis in high-risk patients, but with a low certainty of evidence.

10 Evaluation of patient risk factors, symptoms, and typical physical examination findings help determine a diagnosis. Although a detailed physical examination is sufficient to diagnose most patients with primary varicose veins, it does not provide information about the presence of deep venous insufficiency. Clinical tests used to detect the site of reflux are of limited value. 12 The indications for treatment are largely based on patient preference. Choice of treatment is also affected by symptoms, cost, potential for iatrogenic complications, available medical resources, insurance reimbursement, and physician training, as well as the presence or absence of deep venous insufficiency and the characteristics of the affected veins. Vascular surgical intervention for venous insufficiency may be indicated in patients with aching pain and leg fatigue, ankle edema, chronic venous insufficiency, cosmetic concerns, early hyperpigmentation, external bleeding, progressive or painful ulcer, or superficial thrombophlebitis.

The saphenous vein is identified in the groin, brought to the surface via a small incision, and ligated. The vein is hooked and brought to the surface at the next incision site. It is then pulled and dissected proximally and distally at each incision site to release it from the surrounding tissues and to sever any connections to tributary or deeper perforating veins. This process is repeated distally. The vein can be removed in a long strip or in multiple smaller pieces depending on the size and shape of the vessels, as well as the patient's vascular pathology.

Evidence

As discussed before, the CEAP classification is not a severity scale but a classification scheme for patients with chronic venous disorders describing the clinical, etiologic, anatomical, and pathophysiologic features. Conceptually, however, it has often been pondered whether patients with varicose veins (C2) can undergo treatment to prevent progression to CVI later in life. In the Bonn Vein Study,1978 participants were followed up for a mean of 6.6 years. The prevalence of varicose veins rose from 22.7% to 25.1% (Table X). Participants with C2 disease increased to higher C-classes in 19.8% for nonsaphenous varicose veins and in 31.8% for saphenous varicose veins. The main risk factor for progression was obesity. The Edinburgh Vein Study had a 13-year follow-up; a progression rate of 57.8% (4.3% per year) was reported, of those with C2 disease at baseline, 31.9% progressed to CVI. Risk factors for progression included a family history of varicose veins, previous DVT and obesity. Kostas et al followed 73 mostly asymptomatic contralateral limbs for 5 years in patients who underwent treatment of symptomatic varicose veins of one lower extremity. CVD progression was significantly less in patients who were not obese and did not gain weight during the study. Patients who did not use compression stockings preoperatively and during the follow-up or had stopped using them also had significantly higher incidence of progression compared with those who used compression.

Disease progression in patients with varicose veins (C2 disease)

A Cochrane study in 2013 looked at nonpharmacological interventions to prevent CVI in standing workers. This systemic review concluded that due to the limited number of trials and study participants, there was insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions as to whether nonpharmacologic strategies including compression were effective at preventing the development of CVI in standing workers. Another systematic review of compression for uncomplicated C2 disease found no consensus on the class of compression needed for the effective management of varicose veins and no evidence that wearing compression slows the progression or recurrence of varicose veins. Although evidence presented in these guidelines show that interventions on varicose veins are associated with improved QOL and decreased morbidity, no study examined the role of surgical or endovascular therapies on C2 patients to prevent longitudinal progression to CVI. The role of treatment in preventing such progression remains undefined.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Despite recognition that superficial thrombophlebitis, also known as SVT, is more common than DVT, there is less awareness of its associated morbidity and little consensus on its management. While traditionally thought of as benign, recent studies have highlighted its association with DVT and PE if left untreated. Studies show that SVT may progress to DVT in 6% to 44% of patients; 20% to 33% may have asymptomatic PE; and 2% to 13% may have symptomatic PE. Superficial venous thrombosis involving the saphenous trunk has the greatest association with VTE. Although the majority of SVT occurs in varicose veins, SVT in nonvaricose veins confers greater morbidity and few studies have stratified treatment based on this distinction. Several therapies including surgery, compression stockings, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aim to reduce pain and inflammation, however, given the associated progression to VTE, anticoagulation is recommended. Of note, the application of warm compresses to the site of SVT has never been evaluated in any study.

Varicose veins — evidence synthesis key questions note that the guideline panel prioritized five critical questions most relevant to current management: (1) the diagnostic utility of duplex ultrasound (DU) in adults with varicose veins (class C2-C6); (2) high ligation and surgical stripping vs any endovenous ablation technique for patients with varicose veins and axial incompetence of the great saphenous vein (GSV) or small saphenous vein (SSV); (3) thermal vs nonthermal endovenous ablation technique outcomes for patients with varicose veins and axial incompetence of the GSV or SSV; (4) incompetent perforating vein ablation vs no perforator ablation for patients with simple varicose veins (CEAP class C2) with or without axial incompetence of the GSV or SSV; and (5) treatment of varicose tributaries with phlebectomy or sclerotherapy, concomitant with, or staged after, endovenous ablation of the incompetent GSV or SSV.

Postintervention follow-up and duplex ultrasound (DU) reassessment — For patients with persistent symptoms, new symptoms, or residual visible varicose veins, they should be reassessed with physical examination and DU to determine the cause of the residual symptoms; the authors recommend that all patients who have undergone a venous intervention for varicose veins have at least one follow-up visit at ~3 months and the patients with residual symptoms or visible residual varicose veins should be reassessed using DU of the truncal, tributary, deep, and perforator veins throughout the entire leg; the DU study should be used to identify the treated veins with both complete and incomplete closure, residual untreated tributary veins, and incompetent deep and perforator veins; if all intended truncal and tributary veins have been treated and yet the symptoms persist, other potential causes of the persistent symptoms should be considered, including residual incompetent tributary veins and IPVs.

Varicose vein procedure–related DVT and ARTE management — For acute isolated distal DVT after a varicose vein procedure without symptoms or risk factors for extension, we suggest serial imaging of the deep veins for 2 weeks; if distal DVT has symptoms or risk factors for extension, we suggest anticoagulation. For acute proximal DVT after a varicose vein procedure, we recommend anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant (over a vitamin K antagonist). For symptomatic ARTE after endovenous ablation, we recommend anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant (over a vitamin K antagonist). The guideline endorses CHEST VTE recommendations, noting the evidence base was adopted without review. For asymptomatic ARTE III and IV after endovenous ablation, anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant (over a vitamin K antagonist) should be performed, and when anticoagulation is given for ARTE following endovenous ablation, treatment should be continued until the thrombus retracts.
