## Question

Lactose dose for constipation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate lactulose dose for constipation in adults, how to titrate it, and how it fits into current guidelines compared with other options like polyethylene glycol. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the correct agent, because lactulose and lactose are different. Then, I should verify the labeled adult starting dose and whether dose is expressed in grams or milliliters. Next, I will review the recommended titration strategy and what outcomes to expect. After that, I should confirm safety monitoring, side effects, and maximum dose. Finally, I will integrate guideline context to position lactulose relative to alternatives, especially PEG, and consider special populations and a practical implementation plan.

> Let me first confirm the agent, because I need to ensure we are discussing lactulose and not lactose. Lactulose is a synthetic, nonabsorbable disaccharide used as an osmotic laxative for constipation, whereas lactose is a dietary sugar relevant to lactose intolerance and is not used as a laxative, so the dosing question clearly refers to lactulose rather than lactose [^112HRkbt] [^114rMza1].

> I will now examine the labeled adult starting dose to anchor the regimen. The FDA labeling for lactulose solution states the usual adult dose is 10 to 20 g daily, which corresponds to 15 to 30 mL of the common 10 g/15 mL solution, and some patients may require up to 60 mL daily if needed, with the understanding that 24 to 48 hours may be required to produce a normal bowel movement [^111LUiX4] [^115bPRTD] [^112HRkbt] [^111rNQLW].

> Next, I should review titration strategy. Wait, let me verify whether there is a fixed schedule or a symptom-based approach. Guideline summaries emphasize individualized titration based on clinical response and tolerability, and two randomized trials in older adults illustrate pragmatic strategies such as starting at 15 mL daily and halving the dose after three consecutive days with a bowel movement or doubling if no stool for more than 48 hours, which provides a practical template even though the optimal algorithm is not rigidly standardized [^113fvra5] [^112J3haJ].

> I need to check the onset and expectations so counseling is accurate. Lactulose typically takes 24 to 48 hours to exert effect, so patients should not expect immediate relief and should be counseled accordingly to avoid premature dose escalation or premature discontinuation [^112HRkbt] [^111rNQLW].

> Now, let me consider side effects and monitoring. Bloating and flatulence are common and dose dependent, and excessive dosing can cause diarrhea with potential electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia and hypernatremia, so if diarrhea occurs the dose should be reduced promptly, and in older or debilitated patients on prolonged therapy periodic electrolyte checks are reasonable, while I should also confirm there is no clear maximum dose in the guideline beyond which use is contraindicated, which is consistent with flexible, response-guided titration rather than a hard ceiling [^112mVq5j] [^112J3haJ] [^111rNQLW].

> Hold on, I should verify how guidelines position lactulose relative to other options. The AGA-ACG guideline suggests lactulose after failure or intolerance of over-the-counter therapies as a conditional recommendation, but multiple high-quality sources and meta-analyses indicate polyethylene glycol is generally preferred over lactulose due to greater effectiveness and fewer adverse effects, which aligns with primary care guidance favoring PEG as first-line osmotic therapy in adults with chronic constipation [^112mVq5j] [^114SbQon] [^112jqUJ3] [^114KtWKs].

> Let me reconsider pediatric implications briefly so I do not overgeneralize. PEG is recommended as first-line maintenance therapy in children, with lactulose considered only if PEG is unavailable, and lactulose is not FDA-approved for infants, so the adult dosing framework here should not be extrapolated to infants or young children without pediatric-specific guidance [^114E4xjY] [^117V8iu6].

> But wait, what about special populations and comorbidities? Lactulose is the only osmotic agent with published safety data in pregnancy, and although I initially thought it contained no galactose, I should double-check the excipients. The solution contains galactose and is contraindicated in patients who require a low-galactose diet, and because lactulose is metabolized by colonic bacteria, coadministration with nonabsorbable antacids may blunt the desired colonic acidification and efficacy, which should be kept in mind when reviewing concurrent medications [^112J3haJ] [^111rNQLW] [^112HRkbt].

> Next, I should review a practical implementation plan. Start with 15 mL daily of the standard solution and reassess after 48 to 72 hours, if there is inadequate response increase to 30 mL daily and then to 60 mL daily if still needed, if diarrhea occurs reduce the dose, consider mixing with juice or milk to improve palatability, and counsel on the delayed onset to set expectations. For patients who do not achieve acceptable response or who have significant bloating, consider switching to PEG rather than escalating lactulose indefinitely [^112HRkbt] [^115bPRTD] [^114SbQon].

> In summary, the standard adult starting dose of lactulose is 10 to 20 g daily, typically 15 to 30 mL of the 10 g/15 mL solution, titrated to effect up to a maximum of 60 mL daily if necessary, with bloating and flatulence as common dose-related side effects and diarrhea prompting dose reduction. Given guideline positioning, lactulose is reasonable after OTC failures, but PEG is generally preferred when available due to better efficacy-tolerability balance, so lactulose remains a viable alternative rather than the first-choice osmotic in most adults [^111LUiX4] [^115bPRTD] [^112mVq5j] [^114SbQon] [^114KtWKs].

---

Lactulose is dosed at **10–20 g/day** (15–30 mL) for constipation, titrated to effect [^115bPRTD]; if needed, increase to a maximum of 40 g/day (60 mL) [^111tJCtq]. Onset is **24–48 hours**, and common side effects include bloating, flatulence, and cramping [^111tJCtq] [^112Fvxzw]; reduce dose if diarrhea occurs to avoid electrolyte disturbances [^112J3haJ]. Lactulose is recommended when OTC therapies fail or are not tolerated [^112mVq5j]; PEG is generally preferred over lactulose due to better tolerability and efficacy [^114SbQon] [^112jqUJ3].

---

## Recommended dose and administration

- **Standard adult dose**: 10–20 g/day (15–30 mL or 1–2 packets) [^115bPRTD] [^111LUiX4].
- **Maximum dose**: 40 g/day (60 mL or 2–4 packets) if needed [^115bPRTD] [^111tJCtq].
- **Administration**: Mix with water, juice, or milk to improve taste [^115bPRTD].
- **Onset**: 24–48 hours for a normal bowel movement [^112HRkbt].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing recommendations

RCTs in older adults show that **15 mL/day** is effective and well tolerated [^notfound], and a **30 mL/day** bedtime regimen is effective for 12 weeks. These data support 15–30 mL/day as the usual adult dose, with titration based on response [^113fvra5].

---

## Dose titration and adjustment

- **Initial dose**: 10–20 g/day (15–30 mL) [^115bPRTD].
- **Increase**: If no response, increase to 40 g/day (60 mL) [^111tJCtq].
- **Decrease**: If diarrhea occurs, reduce dose to avoid electrolyte disturbances [^112Fvxzw].

---

## Side effects and tolerability

Common side effects include **bloating, flatulence, and cramping** [^112HRkbt]; these are dose-dependent and may limit use [^112mVq5j]. Excessive dosing can cause diarrhea with potential electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypernatremia) [^112J3haJ].

---

## Comparison with other osmotic laxatives

| **Attribute** | **Lactulose** | **Polyethylene glycol (PEG)** |
|-|-|-|
| Efficacy | Effective, but less than PEG [^112jqUJ3] | More effective than lactulose [^114SbQon] |
| Tolerability | More bloating, flatulence [^112mVq5j] | Better tolerated, less gas [^116wWSKT] |
| Guideline preference | Second-line after OTC failure [^112mVq5j] | First-line osmotic laxative [^113iaxH4] |

---

## Special populations

- **Pregnancy**: Safe; only osmotic studied in pregnancy [^112J3haJ].
- **Diabetes**: Use cautiously; contains galactose and lactose [^111rNQLW].
- **Elderly**: Monitor electrolytes with prolonged use [^111rNQLW].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line**: PEG preferred over lactulose [^114SbQon] [^112jqUJ3].
- **Second-line**: Lactulose after OTC failure or intolerance [^112mVq5j].
- **Dose**: 10–20 g/day (15–30 mL); max 40 g/day (60 mL) [^115bPRTD] [^111tJCtq].
- **Titration**: Adjust to response and tolerability [^113fvra5].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for bloating, flatulence, cramping, and electrolyte disturbances [^112HRkbt] [^113fvra5].

---

Lactulose is effective for constipation at **10–20 g/day**, titrated to 40 g/day if needed, with onset in 24–48 hours; PEG is generally preferred due to better tolerability and efficacy [^112jqUJ3].

Data extraction

Two reviewers were involved in a four-step approach for data collection. All steps were performed independently. First, titles and abstracts of the identified citations were screened to see if they met the study selection criteria. Full texts of potentially relevant articles were reviewed to assess if they met the selection criteria. For the studies that did meet the selection criteria, one reviewer conducted extraction of data using a standardised Excel spreadsheet. A second reviewer independently confirmed the accuracy of the extracted data. As the final step, both reviewers determined if the study was to be included in the systematic review and network meta-analysis. Disagreements were resolved by consensus involving an additional two reviewers.

The following study characteristics were extracted: author; title; journal; publication year; population (adult/paediatric); study design; patient age; characteristics; definition of constipation; inclusion/exclusion criteria; intent to treat population (ITT); per protocol population for defecation frequency; mean duration of constipation prior to study intervention; comparability of study groups; sub-analysis based on age; study duration; study medications, dose and duration of treatment. To avoid comparisons of different subjective composite measures of efficacy, a single objective outcome was selected for the primary analysis – mean number of bowel movements per week. Assessment of defaecation frequency was made after a 2-week treatment period (if available) or at end of treatment (mean plus standard deviation [SD] or standard error [SE]). When data was available for both bowel movements and complete spontaneous bowel movements per week the later data was used in the analysis. Where data was only available graphically, estimates of the values were extracted by scaled measurement. Where means were not available, medians and interquartile ranges were collected. All data were adjusted to mean number of bowel movements per week (plus standard deviation) to allow meaningful comparison between the studies. To assess secondary endpoints, data regarding safety, tolerability, and compliance or willingness to continue therapy were collected.

All included studies were assessed for the risk of bias by two reviewers according to recommendations outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Each potential source of bias was graded as high, low or unclear, relating to whether the potential for bias was low or high. Studies were considered as high quality if all of the criteria were graded as low risk of bias.

### Low-dose lactulose produces a tonic contraction in the human colon [^1174ebyA]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2006). Low credibility.

Lactulose (10–20 g day(-1)) is used to treat constipation. At this therapeutic dose, its effects on colonic motility remain unknown. Twenty-two healthy subjects swallowed a probe with an infusion catheter, six perfused catheters and a balloon connected to a barostat. Colonic phasic and tonic motor activity was recorded in fasting state. In group 1, four volunteers ingested 15 g lactulose and motility was recorded for 5 h after entry of lactulose into the caecum; in group 2, motility was recorded during (3 h) and 2 h after intracolonic infusion of isoosmotic and isovolumetric solutions containing sodium chloride alone (n = 9) or with 15 g lactulose (n = 9). In a last group of volunteers, isotopic colonic transit after ingestion of lactulose (10 g, n = 9) was assessed and compared with a control group (n = 17). Ingestion or intracolonic infusion of 15 g lactulose significantly decreased barostat bag volume (maximal decrease: 45 ± 12% and 35 ± 9% of basal value respectively). Phasic contractions remained unchanged. Tonic and phasic motility was unchanged by the isotonic and isovolumetric infusion of saline. Ingestion of lactulose significantly accelerated isotopic colonic transit time compared with the control group. We conclude that in healthy humans, 10–15 g ingestion or intracaecal infusion of lactulose produces a prolonged tonic contraction that may be involved in the laxative effect of lactulose.

### Impact of guideline awareness in public pharmacies on counseling of patients with acute or chronic constipation in a survey of pharmacy personnel [^1119MN2R]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

We have conducted an online survey in July 2017 on the DocCheck Research platform using an existing panel of German HCPs. Based on the anonymous character of the survey, ethical committee approval was neither required nor recommended by applicable laws and regulations in Germany at the time the survey was performed. As participants were recruited from an existing panel of HCPs having indicated their willingness to contribute to surveys like this, additional participant consent was not required. The survey was planned to include about 200 HCPs working in public pharmacies with about equal representation of PHs and PTs (actual participation 104 PHs and 97 PTs).

The survey first asked whether participants had ever done a dedicated search for treatment recommendations for acute and chronic constipation (yes/no). If yes, a follow-up question asked which sources were used routinely to obtain information on constipation (seven options plus "other, to be specified"; multiple nominations possible). Thereafter, the survey presented two hypothetical cases typical for a pharmacy setting. One was a 62-year old woman with chronic constipation, diagnosed by a physician as chronic functional constipation. The other was a 42-year old woman planning a vacation trip and knowing from previous trips that she often suffers from acute constipation during such trips; she now wished to prophylactically buy a medicine for acute constipation to be used if needed. The verbatim German text of the case descriptions and an English translation are shown in the Online Supplement. Following each case presentation, participants were requested to rank choices for recommendation from the typical portfolio available in Germany, representing the ten most often recommended treatment options (bisacodyl, SPS, macrogol, lactulose, anthrachinones (e.g. extracts from Senna leaves or fruits), salinic laxatives (e.g. MgSO₄ or Na₂SO₄), glycerin, enema, bulk-forming agents and "others" (to be identified if selected)). Options were presented in random order and participants were asked to perform ranking by on-screen drag and drop. An open question asked for the rationale behind their top-three recommendations. The next two questions asked to rank the ten options for efficacy and tolerability, respectively, again with a request to provide a rationale for the top-three choices. A separate question asked to rank the ten options about strength of evidence and underlying reasons (for the top 3 choices). A final question inquired whether the addition of electrolytes was required in macrogol preparations in the treatment of constipation. Thereafter, a summary excerpt of medical treatment recommendations from the applicable German guideline was provided (verbatim text and English translation in Online Supplement). Thereafter, each of the original cases and questions was asked again to explore a possible change of recommendations and underlying reasons.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on constipation [^1141C5hN]. Gastroenterology (2013). Medium credibility.

Initial treatment approach for constipation — after discontinuing medications that can cause constipation and performing blood and other tests as guided by clinical features, a therapeutic trial (ie, fiber supplementation and/or osmotic or stimulant laxatives) is recommended before anorectal testing (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). NTC and STC can be safely managed with long-term use of laxatives (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

American Gastroenterological Association–American College of Gastroenterology guideline — chronic idiopathic constipation, lactulose: Dose titration is per symptom response and side effects; there is no clear maximum dose, and it may cause hypernatremia and hypokalemia if patients experience significant diarrhea; it is the only osmotic agent studied in pregnancy.

### American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: pharmacological management of chronic idiopathic constipation [^1156redj]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Secretagogues — lubiprostone for adults with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) who do not respond to over-the-counter (OTC) agents — the panel suggests the use of lubiprostone over management without lubiprostone (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). It can be used as a replacement or as an adjunct to OTC agents; duration of treatment in trials was 4 weeks, but the drug label does not provide a limit; nausea may occur and the risk of nausea is dose-dependent and seems to be lower when taken with food and water. Lubiprostone is approved by FDA for treating CIC at a dose of 24 μg 2 times daily; for IBS-C, the approved dose is 8 μg 2 times daily, and among individuals who respond, these effects generally manifest within 2 days. In randomized trials, lubiprostone increased spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week versus placebo (MD 1.98; 95% CI 1.17–2.79) and may increase responder rates (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.36–2.06), 226 more per 1,000 (from 122 to 358 more), with little to no difference in serious adverse events though increased risk could not be ruled out (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.62–2.42). Nausea was observed in 35% and led to discontinuation in only 5% of individuals; systemic absorption is negligible, and individuals with moderate or severe hepatic insufficiency should receive a lower dose (i.e., 8 μg twice daily).

### A 12-week, randomized, controlled trial with a 4-week randomized withdrawal period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linaclotide in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^116TVYbg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Patients were excluded if they reported loose (mushy) or watery stools for > 25% of their BMs during the 12 weeks before screening or, during the baseline period, a BSFS (Bristol Stool Form Scale) score of 7 (watery, no solid pieces) for any SBM, or a BSFS score of 6 (fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool) for > 1 SBM. Other key exclusion criteria included history of cathartic colon, laxative or enema abuse, ischemic colitis, or pelvic floor dysfunction (unless successful treatment had been documented by a normal balloon expulsion test); bariatric surgery for treatment of obesity or surgery to remove a segment of the gastrointestinal tract at any time before the screening visit, surgery of the abdomen, pelvis, or retroperitoneal structures during the 6 months before the screening visit, appendectomy or cholecystectomy during the 60 days before the screening visit, or other major surgery during the 30 days before the screening visit; history of diverticulitis or any chronic condition that could be associated with abdominal pain or discomfort and could confound the assessments in the trial (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, chronic pancreatitis, polycystic kidney disease, ovarian cysts, endometriosis, lactose intolerance); family history of a familial form of colorectal cancer. In general, patients were excluded if they were taking drugs that could cause constipation (e.g. narcotics); however, patients taking certain drugs for IBS that might be constipating (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants) were eligible provided that they were on a stable dose for at least 30 days before the screening visit and there was no plan to change the dose after the screening visit. Colonoscopy requirements were based on the American Gastroenterological Association guidelines. Women of childbearing potential were required to use contraceptives and have a negative serum pregnancy test. Patients were asked to refrain from making any major lifestyle changes (e.g. starting a new diet or changing their exercise pattern) during the trial.

### Lactose intolerance but not lactose maldigestion is more frequent in patients with irritable bowel syndrome than in healthy controls: a meta-analysis [^112b44jv]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Search results

Using the terms mentioned above, we found 647 articles in the three databases for evaluation, 213 in PubMed, 413 in Embase and 21 in Cochrane Library. We also examined 14 further articles from the reference lists of relevant articles, so 661 articles were found in total. After using the language (only English) and species (only humans) filters in Embase, PubMed and the Cochrane Library, 520 of 647 studies were further assessed and none of the articles from the reference lists were excluded. After removing duplicates, title and abstract screening, 89 articles reporting on lactose consumption‐related disorders in IBS and eligible for further evaluation were found. The detailed screening of the full‐text papers identified 16 articles for further assessment, of which two were not suitable for statistical analysis. Altogether 14 case‐control studies met the inclusion criteria and remained for quantitative analysis. 26, 27, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 The flow chart of the systematic literature search was based on the PRISMA 2009 guideline and is detailed on Figure 1. At the time of the literature search, we found no eligible paper that used the most recent diagnostic criteria (Rome IV) for IBS. The basic characteristics of the articles and the raw data are summarized in Tables 1 and S2. The proportion of each IBS subtype and the used lactose doses, diagnostic methods for LM and thresholds in the studies included in the meta‐analysis are detailed in Table 2. A quality assessment (NOS) of the articles is summarized in Tables 3 and S3.

### American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: pharmacological management of chronic idiopathic constipation [^112mVq5j]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults — lactulose after failure or intolerance of OTC therapies: Recommendation 4 states that in adults with CIC who fail or are intolerant to OTC therapies, the panel suggests the use of lactulose over management without lactulose. Implementation considerations indicate that bloating and flatulence are dose-dependent and common side effects, which may limit its use in clinical practice.

### Impact of guideline awareness in public pharmacies on counseling of patients with acute or chronic constipation in a survey of pharmacy personnel [^113qdYP6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

To explore knowledge and attitude of HCPs, we presented them with two typical cases, one suffering from functional chronic constipation and one wishing to preventively obtain a product for the management of acute constipation (Online Supplement). For each clinical case, we asked them to rank frequently used prescription-free treatments and explain their reasoning behind those choices. Thereafter, HCPs were presented with excerpts of the applicable guideline and then were asked again to rank available prescription-free treatments and explain the reasoning behind their choices. Interestingly, choices and underlying reasoning differed considerably between the case with functional chronic and with anticipated acute constipation.

The applicable guideline for chronic functional constipation provides three first-line options if general measures have yielded insufficient efficacy: bisacodyl, macrogol and SPS. However, HCPs endorsed bisacodyl and SPS much less frequently than the guideline would recommends. In contrast, fiber and lactulose were recommended much more frequently than bisacodyl or SPS by participating HCPs. However, most patients with chronic functional constipation have already tried managing their condition by increased fiber intake – and failed. Moreover, lactulose is not recommended as first-line treatment in the guideline. Correspondingly, reasons such as intended long-term use, perceived gentle effect and being a "natural"/phytotherapeutic remedy featured highly among stated reasons despite not being listed as major rationale for the guideline-recommended treatments. Studies showing good efficacy and tolerability along with high patient satisfaction with bisacodyl or SPS were also apparently not a major consideration in recommendations. Following presentation of excerpts from the guideline, recommendations shifted (more frequent recommendation of bisacodyl and SPS, less frequent of bulking agents and lactulose), which is much more in line with the guideline. Conversely, the use of macrogol was recommended rarely for the case with acute constipation, but that recommendation surged after presentation of guideline excerpts. Of note, the existence of a guideline recommendation was not provided as a reason for recommendation before excerpts from the guideline had been presented but became a frequently named reason thereafter.

### Chronic constipation: new insights, better outcomes? [^117Coowf]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Constipation is a symptom that affects around 11–20% of the adult population yearly. Most physicians consider infrequency of defecation as a hallmark of constipation. However, most patients view excessive straining as the biggest component of constipation and only a minority of patients with constipation have infrequent bowel movements. Constipation might be due to many different medical conditions or occur as a side-effect of drug therapy. When these medical conditions or drug therapies are not present, a diagnosis of functional constipation, chronic idiopathic constipation, or irritable bowel syndrome with constipation is often made. In all patients with constipation, rectal outlet dysfunction should be excluded by physical examination because this condition occurs in approximately 25% of patients diagnosed with idiopathic constipation and can be improved with different therapeutic approaches than administration of laxatives. Because of the availability of over-the-counter laxatives, most patients consider themselves able to self-manage constipation, and patients have often tried many different treatments before seeking professional help. The physician must carefully assess these previous efforts of self-treatment, optimise them, and strategically use the increasing list of prescription medications for management.

Regarding specific circumstances for constipation, more specifically with respect to patients with cancer (laxatives), ESMO 2018 guidelines recommend to offer osmotic laxatives (such as polyethylene glycol, lactulose, or magnesium and sulfate salts) or stimulant laxatives (such as senna, cascara, bisacodyl, and sodium picosulfate) when laxatives are needed.

### Naldemedine for opioid-induced constipation in patients with cancer: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^115xNCt6]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations must be acknowledged. First, before enrollment, approximately 30% of patients had been using rescue laxatives and 20% of patients had been using strong opioids, albeit for rescue use only. Despite this, the proportions were well balanced, and we believe this was unlikely to affect conclusions. Second, although the majority of enrolled patients were outpatients with abdominal cancer, our study enrolled a heterogeneous population of patients with cancer with different types, stages, and treatments of cancer, which might affect the result as confounding factors. Third, our study had a relatively short treatment period, which may not capture long-term effects and safety of naldemedine for OIC prevention in patients with cancer receiving regularly dosed opioids therapy. Thus, examining the long-term efficacy of OIC when naldemedine is administered prophylactically is necessary. Fourth, the study was conducted only in a Japanese population in specific settings (ie, palliative care consultation in acute hospital settings). Thus, the generalizability of the results might be limited with regard to other ethnic populations and settings. Fifth, BFI > 28.8 score is not exactly the same as a diagnosis of OIC on the basis of Rome IV criteria but rather indicates clinically significant constipation. We do not believe setting the threshold value of 28.8 affects our conclusion because all end points, including analyses of mean BFI values, achieved the same results. Sixth, this study did not compare the efficacy of naldemedine and traditional laxatives, as well as other PAMORAs, and this should be investigated in a further study. Seventh, cost-effectiveness was not explored in this study and should be investigated in future studies. Finally, the lactose used in the intervention and placebo drugs in this study might have affected bowel movements, especially in lactose-intolerant individuals.

In conclusion, naldemedine prevented constipation and improved constipation-related QOL, with possible preventive effect on OINV, in patients with cancer starting regularly dosed opioids therapy.

### KRISTALOSE® (lactulose) for oral solution cumberland… [^116tPzYT]. FDA (DailyMed) (2018). Low credibility.

KRISTALOSE® is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and no enzyme capable of hydrolysis of this disaccharide is present in human gastrointestinal tissue. As a result, oral doses of lactulose reach the colon virtually unchanged. In the colon, lactulose is broken down primarily to lactic acid, and also to small amounts of formic and acetic acids, by the action of colonic bacteria, which results in an increase in osmotic pressure and slight acidification of the colonic contents. This in turn causes an increase in stool water content and softens the stool. KRISTALOSE® For Oral Solution is indicated for the treatment of constipation. In patients with a history of chronic constipation, lactulose therapy increases the number of bowel movements per day and the number of days on which bowel movements occur. Since KRISTALOSE® For Oral Solution contains galactose, it is contraindicated in patients who require a low galactose diet. Nausea and vomiting have been reported. There have been no reports of accidental overdosage. In the event of overdosage, it is expected that diarrhea and abdominal cramps would be the major symptoms. Medication should be terminated. The usual adult dosage is 10 g to 20 g of lactulose daily. The dose may be increased to 40 g daily if necessary. Twenty-four to 48 hours may be required to produce a normal bowel movement. INDICATIONS: For the treatment of constipation. See accompanying package insert. USUAL ADULT DOSAGE: 10 to 20 grams daily. See accompanying package insert. Since lactulose does not exert its effect until it reaches the colon, and since transit time through the colon may be slow, 24–48 hours may be required to produce a normal bowl movement. This unit dose packet is not child resistant. INDICATIONS: For the treatment of constipation. See accompanying package insert.

### Macrogol (polyethylene glycol) laxatives in children with functional constipation and faecal impaction: a systematic review [^113kBWc5]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Previously published reviews on the management of childhood constipation have commented on the lack of high quality clinical trials in the field, – despite the widespread use of laxatives. Although there remain significant gaps in the evidence base, this literature review has demonstrated that the evidence base of current clinical practice is now improving.

The placebo-controlled study of PEG+E by Thomson et al defines a baseline proof of principle in a relatively mildly affected population, while the two phase study by Candy et al confirms that, once disimpacted, even severely affected children can be maintained satisfactorily on low doses of PEG+E (the mean daily dose was just under two paediatric dose sachets). PEG+E could also be used as monotherapy whereas almost one third of patients on lactulose required senna. No patient on PEG+E reimpacted compared with almost one in four on lactulose.

The five studies comparing PEG with lactulose – exhibit some potentially important differences that prevent the results being pooled in meta-analysis. Firstly, they involve three different agents: PEG 3350, PEG 3350+E and PEG 4000. While there is no a priori reason for supposing that these will behave functionally differently as laxatives, one cannot necessarily assume equivalence. Secondly, there are dose differences: in two casesthe dose was titrated according to clinical response, subject to an upper limit; in one casea single titration was permitted, with add-in therapy being required beyond that; and in the other two studiesthere was a fixed dose regime. Finally, there are methodological concerns regarding the analysis of the Gremse et al studyin that the presented results exclude the patients who had withdrawn due to lack of efficacy, biasing the results in favour of lactulose.

### Lactulose solution USP 10 g / 15 mL… [^112HRkbt]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

Lactulose is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and no enzyme capable of hydrolysis of this disaccharide is present in human gastrointestinal tissue. As a result, oral doses of lactulose solution reach the colon virtually unchanged. In the colon, lactulose is broken down primarily to lactic acid, and also to small amounts of formic and acetic acids, by the action of colonic bacteria, which results in an increase in osmotic pressure and slight acidification of the colonic contents. This in turn causes an increase in stool water content and softens the stool. For the treatment of constipation. In patients with a history of chronic constipation, lactulose solution therapy increases the number of bowel movements per day and the number of days on which bowel movements occur. Since lactulose solution contains galactose, it is contraindicated in patients who require a low galactose diet. Since lactulose solution contains galactose and lactose, it should be used with caution in diabetics. In the event that an unusual diarrheal condition occurs, contact your physician. Elderly, debilitated patients who receive lactulose solution for more than six months should have serum electrolytes measured periodically. Results of preliminary studies in humans and rats suggest that nonabsorbable antacids given concurrently with lactulose may inhibit the desired lactulose-induced drop in colonic pH. Therefore, a possible lack of desired effect of treatment should be taken into consideration before such drugs are given concomitantly with lactulose solution. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when lactulose solution is administered to a nursing woman. Precise frequency data are not available.

Initial dosing may produce flatulence and intestinal cramps, which are usually transient. Excessive dosage can lead to diarrhea with potential complications such as loss of fluids, hypokalemia, and hypernatremia. The usual dose is 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls daily. The dose may be increased to 60 mL daily if necessary. Twenty-four to 48 hours may be required to produce a normal bowel movement.

### Lactulose versus polyethylene glycol for chronic constipation [^112jqUJ3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Constipation is a common clinical problem. Lactulose and Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) are both commonly used osmotic laxatives that have been shown to be effective and safe treatments for chronic constipation. However, there is no definitive data as to which provides the best treatment.

Objectives

To identify and review all relevant data in order to determine whether Lactulose or Polyethylene Glycol is more effective at treating chronic constipation and faecal impaction.

Search Strategy

We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL databases, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of lactulose and polyethylene glycol in the management of faecal impaction and chronic constipation.

Selection Criteria

Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials which compared lactulose with polyethylene glycol in the management of chronic constipation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data on study methods, participants, interventions used and outcomes measured was extracted from each study. Data was entered into the Cochrane Review Manager software (RevMan 5.0) and analysed using Cochrane MetaView.

Main Results

In the present meta-analysis, we considered for the first time all ten randomised controlled trials so far performed. The findings of our work indicate that Polyethylene glycol is better than lactulose in outcomes of stool frequency per week, form of stool, relief of abdominal pain and the need for additional products. On subgroup analysis, this is seen in both adults and children, except for relief of abdominal pain.

Authors' Conclusions

Polyethylene Glycol should be used in preference to Lactulose in the treatment of Chronic Constipation.

2.3 Quality assessment of the individual studies

The quality and the biases of the included studies were analyzed with the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale (NOS) for case‐control studies. 31 Two authors (IMC, PV) independently assessed the risk of bias in each paper included in the statistical analysis. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. If the discussion did not result in consensus, a third author was consulted (PH). The NOS for case‐control studies contains eight items covering three main domains (selection, comparability and exposure). A study can be awarded a maximum of one star for each numbered item; on the contrary, a maximum of two stars can be given for comparability. Each item was rated as "high risk" (zero stars), "low risk" (one star) or "unclear risk" (zero stars) corresponding to the definitions.

2.4 Data extraction

At the end of the screening process, relevant data were independently extracted from studies by two independent reviewers (JC and PV). These included: prevalence of LM and LI (subjective or objective) as the outcome parameters, first author, year of publication and country of origin, study design, basic characteristics of the study population (age, percentage of females and IBS subtypes, size of the study groups), diagnostic criteria for IBS, diagnostic methods, thresholds and lactose dose used to diagnose maldigestion. Data for the risk of bias (NOS) assessment were collected as well. Extracted data were validated by five co‐authors (ZsSz; DP; MB; ÁV; JT).

### Treatment of chronic constipation: current pharmacologic approaches and future directions [^115VE9SK]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic constipation is a common condition that affects up to 27% of the population. Dietary and lifestyle measures are usually the first-line therapy, but if these fail to have an effect then a variety of prescription and consumer laxatives are available. Traditional laxatives include bulking agents, osmotic agents, stool softeners, and stimulants of the gastrointestinal tract. All have been found to be more effective than placebo at relieving symptoms of constipation, but these results have been obtained primarily in short (4-week) trials and no class of laxative has been shown to be superior to another. Traditional laxatives work in many, but not all, patients and some patients cannot cope with the side effects, unpleasant taste, the requirements of the dosing regimen, or the notion of dose increase. New enterokinetic agents that affect peristalsis through selective interaction with 5-hydroxytryptamine-4 receptors and novel agents acting on intestinal secretion could offer an alternative option for patients with chronic constipation who cannot get adequate relief from current laxatives.

TABLE 2
Overview of key clinical trials investigating the therapeutic efficacy and safety of bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate in constipation.

Note

It was not until 2011 that Kamm et al reported the results of the first large randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group study that determined the efficacy and safety of treatment with bisacodyl in patients with constipation (as defined by the Rome III criteria) over a 4 week period. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either bisacodyl 10 mg once daily (n = 247) or matching placebo (n = 121). Patients receiving bisacodyl had a significantly increased mean number of CSBMs per week over the treatment period, from 1.1 at baseline for both groups to 5.2 with bisacodyl and 1.9 in the placebo. (Figure 3A). In addition to improvements in objective constipation‐related symptoms, such as straining with defecation or stool consistency, patients also reported improvements in other parameters. Overall satisfaction scores for bowel habits, bothersomeness of constipation, and abdominal discomfort and bloating improved with bisacodyl compared with placebo (unpublished data, see Table 2). Over the study period, the most common AEs in patients treated with bisacodyl were diarrhea and abdominal pain, experienced by 53.4% and 24.7% of patients, respectively, compared with 1.7% and 2.5% in the placebo group, respectively. 17.8% of the bisacodyl‐treated patients withdrew prematurely because of AEs, compared with only 5.0% of the placebo group. In the bisacodyl group, the percentage of premature withdrawals decreased over time from 10.5% at week 1 to 2.5% at week 4. However, it should be noted that patients started treatment with a bisacodyl dose of 10 mg daily and were allowed to reduce their dose during the treatment period. The percentage of patients with drug‐related AEs in the bisacodyl group declined markedly from 57% at Week 1 to 5% at Week 4 (Table 3 and Figure 3B). This reduction in AEs corresponds with the reduction of the bisacodyl dose during the treatment period. Patients reduced their mean weekly dose from 56 mg in Week 1 to 48 mg in Week 2 and 45 mg in Week 4, with 58% of patients in the bisacodyl arm able to reduce their daily dose from 10 mg to 5 mg by the end of the treatment period (Figure 3C). This finding suggests that the starting dose of bisacodyl selected in this study was too high for a considerable proportion of patients and that treatment was well tolerated once a patient identified a suitable dose. Indeed, treatment tolerability assessed by the patient (using a 4‐point ordinal verbal rating scale: 1 = good, 4 = bad) was significantly better in the bisacodyl group compared with placebo.

### Effectiveness of laxatives in elderly – a cross sectional study in nursing homes [^112iWn3F]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Choice of laxatives

All laxatives used in this study have been proven to be superior to placebo. Lactulose was the most frequently used laxative and the only one regularly used for long-term treatment in high doses. The frequent use of lactulose, despite the rather high price, depends on local therapeutic tradition. The drug was for a long time the only osmotic laxative on the market in Norway, and was believed to have fewer side effects during long-term treatment. The definitions of high doses for continuous treatment has, however, not been defined and was arbitrarily chosen. Some new treatment alternatives (such as lubiprostone and prucalopride) were not available, and could perhaps have improved the outcome for some participants.

Although all regimens are known to be effective, and that one is not superior to another, tailoring the regimens to the individual subject could probably improve the outcome. Guidelines propose algorithms for treatment of constipation. Some guidelines differ between acute and chronic constipation, degrees of constipation, and different subgroups such as slow transit, normal transit, anorectal outlet obstruction, constipation in pregnancy etc. In this study, these guidelines were not in regular use and the treatment was neither adapted to the cause of constipation nor sufficiently individualized. All patients were probably given the same initial treatment, and depending on the effect, the dose was increased or a new regimen added depending on local traditions. This explains why a significant proportion of subjects with hard stools did not use osmotically acting laxatives, why subjects with infrequent bowel movements did not use prokinetics (which was not available) or contact laxatives, and why subjects in need of manual manoeuvres to facilitate a bowel movement did not use enemas or osmotically acting laxatives, which are recommended treatments for these complaints.

The prescription of laxatives is the physicians' responsibility, but in daily practice registered nurses often accomplish this treatment rather independently. Increased involvement of physicians and tailoring of the treatment to the individual patient could probably improve the outcome. The insufficient understanding of the actual patho-physiology in the individual subject makes tailoring of the treatment difficult.

### Clinical implications of lactose malabsorption versus lactose intolerance [^114m6EHW]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The majority of the world's adult population and an estimated 80 million Americans are hypolactasic and hence malabsorb ingested lactose. Although lactose malabsorption is easily identified, less readily assessed is the clinically important question of how often does this malabsorption induce symptoms. This review summarizes: (1) knowledge concerning the etiology and diagnosis of hypolactasia and the pathophysiology of the symptoms of lactose malabsorption and (2) the results of well-controlled trials of the symptomatic response of lactose malabsorbers to varying dosages of lactose and the efficacy of therapeutic interventions to alleviate these symptoms. We conclude that the clinical significance of lactose malabsorption has been overestimated by both the lay public and physicians in that commonly ingested doses of lactose (ie, the quantity in a cup of milk) usually do not cause perceptible symptoms when ingested with a meal. Symptoms occur when the lactose dosage exceeds that in a cup of milk or when lactose is ingested without other nutrients. Simple dietary instruction, rather than the use of commercial products to reduce lactose intake, is recommended for the vast majority of lactose-malabsorbing subjects.

### The effect of fiber supplementation on chronic constipation in adults: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113GhpGV]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

The findings of this review have important implications. National guidelines for chronic constipation suggest increasing fiber intake, but there is a lack of detail on the types, doses, and durations of fiber supplementation. This may result in nonstandardized recommendations in clinical care, with patients left to choose the type and regime of fiber supplements, likely leading to dissatisfaction. This review provides important evidence on the optimal fiber supplementation, which can support clinicians in providing standardized and effective recommendations to patients with chronic constipation. A previous systematic review showed a dose-dependent response for fiber doses > 15 g/d. The current review shows that a smaller cutoff of > 10 g/d is still effective; this dose may be more realistic to ingest and more tolerable than doses > 15 g/d, potentially increasing compliance and satisfaction with treatment.

This is the largest systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of fiber supplementation in chronic constipation. It identified more than double the number of trials than the most recent systematic review, thus allowing for more robust subgroup analyses of specific fibers, doses, and treatment durations. This review strictly adhered to recommendations from the Cochrane Handbook and PRISMA guidelines. Efforts were made to search gray literature with no language restrictions, reducing publication bias. Limitations of this review include significant heterogeneity amongst outcomes, explained by the types of fiber and differences in the methods used to measure outcomes. While included studies provided further insight into the effects of certain fiber types in chronic constipation (e.g. psyllium), for other types (e.g. pectin), only single studies contributed to the subanalyses; therefore, how effective these fiber types might be remains unclear. No studies in this review had a low risk of bias.

### Constipation in adults [^116QhkJz]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although there are defined criteria for the diagnosis of constipation, in practice, diagnostic criteria are less rigid, and in part depend on the perception of normal bowel habit. Constipation is highly prevalent, with approximately 12 million general practitioner prescriptions for laxatives in England in 2001.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of non-drug interventions, and of other interventions, in adults with idiopathic chronic constipation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2006 (BMJ Clinical evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 42 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: arachis oil, biofeedback, bisacodyl, cascara, docusate, exercise, glycerine suppositories, glycerol, high-fibre diet, increasing fluids, ispaghula husk, lactitol, lactulose, macrogols (polyethylene glycols), magnesium salts, methylcellulose, paraffin, phosphate enemas, seed oils, senna, sodium citrate enemas, sterculia.

American Gastroenterological Association–American College of Gastroenterology guideline — limitations, evidence gaps, and implementation — highlights heterogeneity and scope constraints. It notes "clinical trials did not uniformly evaluate interventions for patient important outcomes on efficacy, adverse effects, and tolerability", and "there was a paucity of data for the most commonly used treatments of CIC such as fiber, lactulose, senna, and docusate". There was "variability in the definition of inclusion criteria, efficacy, and tolerability outcomes", and "Most of the included studies followed the patients for the short term, and the safety and tolerance of these medications in the long term is not well studied". For comparisons, "we grouped individual drugs against placebo arms and did not aim to inform on the relative efficacy of pharmacological agents", and "Network meta-analysis is an appropriate statistical method to facilitate indirect comparison against a common comparator such as placebo or other active treatment". Scope is limited as "This guideline is limited to covering pharmacological interventions for the treatment of CIC in otherwise healthy adults and does not apply to pediatric populations or to individuals who are pregnant or with opioid-induced constipation or malignancy". Regarding economics and participation, "we did not perform formal cost-effectiveness analyses" and "There was no patient representative in the guideline development panel, which is a limitation for this study".

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation – a European perspective [^116wWSKT]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

Undigestible fibers attract water, which leads to a larger and softer fecal mass. Systematic reviews of older studies indicate that fiber increases the number of bowel movements, but the quality of these studies is inconsistent and the treatment duration was usually limited to 4 weeks or less. It has been shown that patients with slow transit and/or impaired defecation are unlikely to respond to fiber.

Most comparative data suggest that lactulose and polyethylene glycol (PEG) have similar efficacy, but with lower incidence of vomiting and flatulence associated with the latter.PEG provides well-tolerated and effective relief in constipated patients. In a 6-month placebo-controlled study, 304 patients with chronic constipation received either 17 g PEG or placebo. Fifty-two percent of PEG-treated patients compared with 11% of placebo-treated patients (P < 0.001) were successfully relieved from constipation (according to modified Rome criteria) for more than 50% of their treatment weeks. No treatment-related safety differences were observed between the PEG and placebo groups during the study, with the exception of GI complaints (39.7% PEG-treated patients vs 25% placebo-treated patients; P = 0.015). This difference was observed due to abdominal distension, diarrhea, loose stools, flatulence and nausea, which are considered usual effects of laxative use. In addition, a retrospective study of institutional patients with chronic constipation reported good long-term results for up to 12 months, and for up to 5 months in a randomized prospective study in adultand pediatric constipated patients.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on constipation [^1139fPjM]. Gastroenterology (2013). Medium credibility.

Constipation — medical management is outlined as follows: We suggest a gradual increase in fiber intake, as both foods included in the diet and as supplements and/or an inexpensive osmotic agent, such as milk of magnesia or polyethylene glycol. Depending on stool consistency, the next step may be to supplement the osmotic agent with a stimulant laxative (eg, bisacodyl or glycerol suppositories), which is preferably administered 30 minutes after a meal. For these agents, dosing includes polyethylene glycol 17 g daily, milk of magnesia 1 oz twice daily, and psyllium 15 g daily, with glycerin or bisacodyl suppositories, and the approximate daily cost is $1 or less. A newer agent should be considered when symptoms do not respond to laxatives; two such drugs are lubiprostone and linaclotide whose daily costs were $7-$9, and prucalopride is not available in the United States but has been approved in other countries. Biofeedback therapy improves symptoms in more than 70% of patients with defecatory disorders. Patients who do not respond to standard approaches may require colonic manometry and barostat testing, which is only available at selected centers.

Key Points

Bisacodyl is a locally acting laxative with unique dual mechanism of action upon gut secretion and motility, and is considered a standard treatment for constipation.
We provide the first overview of the historic background, pharmacokinetics, and mechanism of action of bisacodyl, including practical guidance for clinicians and explore open questions warranting further research.
Recent advances in the understanding of colonic motility and the distinct effects of available laxatives on colonic motor patterns suggest that bisacodyl still has unexplored potential.

Implementation considerations state that while the trials were conducted for 4 wk, longer term use is probably appropriate, but data are needed to better understand tolerance and side effects; the dose evaluated in trials is higher than commonly used doses in practice, the panel suggests starting at lower dose and increase if no response; and abdominal pain and cramping may occur with a higher dose of senna.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^111rpC7o]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

In many clinical studies, only a minority of patients with LI on HBT report satisfactory improvement in symptoms after treatment to reduce intake of dairy products or supplement lactase. Moreover, it remains unclear, to what extent the therapy itself and conditioning of patient expectations contribute to outcome. Lack of improvement can also be due to the presence of functional bowel disorders, which are present in many patients referred for investigation. These patients are sensitive to various nutrients, mechanical and chemical stimuli and, therefore, rarely respond to restriction of dairy products alone.

IBS patients develop symptoms after ingestion of a range of poorly absorbed, fermentable carbohydrates (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs)) that includes but is not restricted to lactose even in LM patients. A low-FODMAP diet improves abdominal symptoms in 50%–80% of IBS patients. This dietary therapy requires commitment from the patient and is best delivered by professional dietician. Identification of factors predicting dietary outcome would improve compliance and cost-effectiveness of this intervention; however, in a large clinical study neither clinical presentation nor HBT results (high dose lactose 50 g or fructose 35 g) predicted response to the low-FODMAP diet. The response to an intermediate dose of a representative, non-absorbable FODMAP (eg, lactulose 20 g) that rarely c symptoms in health, but often induces bloating, abdominal pain and diarrhea in FGID patients may improve the ability of HBT to identify individuals that respond to this dietary intervention. Alternatively, bioassays to identify saccharolytic bacteria and/or fermentation capacity in faecal samples might be developed that predict outcome of lactose (or FODMAP) restriction in patients.

### Systematic review: effective management strategies for lactose intolerance [^114rMza1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Lactose intolerance resulting in gastrointestinal symptoms is a common health concern. Diagnosis and management of this condition remain unclear.

Purpose

To assess the maximum tolerable dose of lactose and interventions for reducing symptoms of lactose intolerance among persons with lactose intolerance and malabsorption.

Data Sources

Multiple electronic databases, including MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library, for trials published in English from 1967 through November 2009.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials of individuals with lactose intolerance or malabsorption.

Data Extraction

Three investigators independently reviewed articles, extracted data, and assessed study quality.

Data Synthesis

36 unique randomized studies (26 on lactase- or lactose-hydrolyzed milk supplements, lactose-reduced milk, or tolerable doses of lactose; 7 on probiotics; 2 on incremental lactose administration for colonic adaptation; and 1 on another agent) met inclusion criteria. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that 12 to 15 g of lactose (approximately 1 cup of milk) is well tolerated by most adults. Evidence was insufficient that lactose-reduced solution or milk with a lactose content of 0 to 2 g, compared with greater than 12 g, is effective in reducing symptoms of lactose intolerance. Evidence for probiotics, colonic adaptation, and other agents was also insufficient.

Limitations

Most studies evaluated persons with lactose malabsorption rather than lactose intolerance. Variation in enrollment criteria, outcome reporting, and the composition and dosing of studied agents precluded pooling of results and limited interpretation.

Conclusion

Most individuals with presumed lactose intolerance or malabsorption can tolerate 12 to 15 g of lactose. Additional studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of lactose intolerance treatment.

### (lactulose solution, USP 10 g / 15 mL) [^112Fvxzw]. FDA (DailyMed) (2022). Medium credibility.

For older children and adolescents, the total daily dose is 40 to 90 ml. If the initial dose causes diarrhea, the dose should be reduced immediately. If diarrhea persists, lactulose should be discontinued. Rectal When the adult patient is in the impending coma or coma stage of portal-systemic encephalopathy and the danger of aspiration exists, or when the necessary endoscopic or intubation procedures physically interfere with the administration of the recommended oral doses, lactulose solution may be given as a retention enema via a rectal balloon catheter. Cleansing enemas containing soapsuds or other alkaline agents should not be used. Since lactulose solution contains galactose, it is contraindicated in patients who require a low galactose diet. Precise frequency data are not available. Lactulose may produce gaseous distention with flatulence or belching and abdominal discomfort such as cramping in about 20% of patients.

Excessive dosage can lead to diarrhea with potential complications such as loss of fluids, hypokalemia, and hypernatremia. Lactulose causes a decrease in blood ammonia concentration and reduces the degree of portalsystemic encephalopathy. These actions are considered to be results of the following: Bacterial degradation of lactulose in the colon acidifies the colonic contents. This acidification of colonic contents results in the retention of ammonia in the colon as the ammonium ion. Since the colonic contents are then more acid than the blood, ammonia can be expected to migrate from the blood into the colon to form the ammonium ion. The acid colonic contents convert NH₃ to the ammonium ion +, trapping it and preventing its absorption. The laxative action of the metabolites of lactulose then expels the trapped ammonium ion from the colon. Experimental data indicate that lactulose is poorly absorbed.

Lactulose given orally to man and experimental animals resulted in only small amounts reaching the blood. Urinary excretion has been determined to be 3% or less and is essentially complete within 24 hours. When incubated with extracts of human small intestinal mucosa, lactulose was not hydrolyzed during a 24-hour period and did not inhibit the activity of these extracts on lactose. Lactulose reaches the colon essentially unchanged. There it is metabolized by bacteria with the formation of low molecular weight acids that acidify the colon contents.

### The effect of fiber supplementation on chronic constipation in adults: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1169eWXY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic constipation is a common gastrointestinal disorder with an estimated prevalence of 12% in adults. It is characterized by predominant symptoms of infrequent, difficult, or incomplete defecation. Chronic constipation impacts quality of life, with impairments in social functioning and mental health. In the United States, each year there are more than 2.5 million visits to medical centers where constipation is the leading diagnosis, with annual direct costs of the condition ranging from $1912 to $11,991 per patient.

The management of chronic constipation can be challenging. Recommendations include lifestyle advice (e.g. increasing dietary fiber), followed by laxatives. However, half of people with constipation are dissatisfied with the current treatment options, primarily because of a lack of effectiveness and side effects. This highlights the need for better access to management strategies that can safely and effectively improve constipation symptoms.

Fiber supplementation is indicated as first-line management for chronic constipation in British, American, and European guidelines. Fiber encompasses all carbohydrates that are neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine and have a degree of polymerization of 3 or more monomeric units, plus lignin. This includes prebiotic fibers, which are substrates that are selectively utilized by host microorganisms, conferring a health benefit. Soluble, viscous fibers can influence stool bulking directly through water retention in the colon, resulting in softer stools. Insoluble, nonviscous fibers can cause mechanical stimulation of the gut mucosa that accelerates gut transit time (GTT). Fermentable fibers may increase stool bulk indirectly through fermentation byproducts that influence contractile activity in the gut and increase microbial biomass through changes in the gut microbiome. However, fermentation also results in the production of gas, which can cause side effects, such as flatulence or bloating.

A meta-analysis published in 2016 indicated beneficial effects of fiber supplementation at improving stool frequency and consistency in adults with chronic constipation, although its consumption led to side effects, such as flatulence. The review included only 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), limiting the interpretation of the overall effectiveness and subgroup analyses based upon the types of fiber, doses, and treatment durations, rendering its application to clinical practice challenging. Many studies have since been performed evaluating a range of types and doses of fiber and measuring additional outcomes. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effects of fiber supplementation on response to treatment, stool output, GTT, symptoms, quality of life, adverse events, and compliance in adults with chronic constipation.

### Osmotic and stimulant laxatives for the management of childhood constipation [^112HBPYn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Constipation within childhood is an extremely common problem. Despite the widespread use of osmotic and stimulant laxatives by health professionals to manage constipation in children, there has been a long standing paucity of high quality evidence to support this practice.

Objectives

We set out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of osmotic and stimulant laxatives used to treat functional childhood constipation.

Search Methods

The search (inception to May 7, 2012) was standardised and not limited by language and included electronic searching (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialized Trials Register), reference searching of all included studies, personal contacts and drug companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared osmotic or stimulant laxatives with either placebo or another intervention, with patients aged 0 to 18 years old were considered for inclusion. The primary outcome was frequency of defecation. Secondary endpoints included faecal incontinence, disimpaction, need for additional therapies and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Relevant papers were identified and the authors independently assessed the eligibility of trials. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The Cochrane RevMan software was used for analyses. Patients with final missing outcomes were assumed to have relapsed. For continuous outcomes we calculated a mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model. For dichotomous outcomes we calculated an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using a fixed-effect model. The chi square and I(2) statistics were used to assess statistical heterogeneity. A random-effects model was used in situations of unexplained heterogeneity

Main Results

Eighteen RCTs (1643 patients) were included in the review. Nine studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. Meta-analysis of two studies (101 patients) comparing polyethylene glycol (PEG) with placebo showed a significantly increased number of stools per week with PEG (MD 2.61 stools per week, 95% CI 1.15 to 4.08). Common adverse events in the placebo-controlled studies included flatulence, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea and headache. Meta-analysis of 4 studies with 338 participants comparing PEG with lactulose showed significantly greater stools per week with PEG (MD 0.95 stools per week, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.44), although follow up was short. Patients who received PEG were significantly less likely to require additional laxative therapies. Eighteen per cent of PEG patients required additional therapies compared to 30% of lactulose patients (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.89). No serious adverse events were reported with either agent. Common adverse events in these studies included diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and pruritis ani. Meta-analysis of 3 studies with 211 participants comparing PEG with milk of magnesia showed that the stools/wk was significantly greater with PEG (MD 0.69 stools per week, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.89). However, the magnitude of this difference is quite small and may not be clinically significant. One child was noted to be allergic to PEG, but there were no other serious adverse events reported. Meta-analysis of 2 studies with 287 patients comparing liquid paraffin (mineral oil) with lactulose revealed a relatively large statistically significant difference in the number of stools per week favouring paraffin (MD 4.94 stools per week, 95% CI 4.28 to 5.61). No serious adverse events were reported. Adverse events included abdominal pain, distention and watery stools. No statistically significant differences in the number of stools per week were found between PEG and enemas (1 study, 90 patients, MD 1.00, 95% CI -1.58 to 3.58), dietary fibre mix and lactulose (1 study, 125 patients, P = 0.481), senna and lactulose (1 study, 21 patients, P > 0.05), lactitol and lactulose (1 study, 51 patients, MD -0.80, 95% CI -2.63 to 1.03), and PEG and liquid paraffin (1 study, 158 patients, MD 0.70, 95% CI -0.38 to 1.78).

Authors' Conclusions

The pooled analyses suggest that PEG preparations may be superior to placebo, lactulose and milk of magnesia for childhood constipation. GRADE analyses indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome (number of stools per week) was low or very low due to sparse data, inconsistency (heterogeneity), and high risk of bias in the studies in the pooled analyses. Thus, the results of the pooled analyses should be interpreted with caution because of quality and methodological concerns, as well as clinical heterogeneity, and short follow up. However, PEG appears safe and well tolerated. There is also evidence suggesting the efficacy of liquid paraffin (mineral oil), which was also well tolerated. There is no evidence to demonstrate the superiority of lactulose when compared to the other agents studied, although there is a lack of placebo controlled studies. Further research is needed to investigate the long term use of PEG for childhood constipation, as well as the role of liquid paraffin.

### Consensus recommendations on initiating prescription therapies for opioid-induced constipation [^113qEKK5]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Outcome Measures

Outcome measures may be either objectively measured or directly reported by patients. Objective outcome measures can be collected by clinicians as well as by patients and typically provide numerical values for stool frequency, time‐based outcomes (e.g. time to laxation, transit time [measured using the lactulose hydrogen breath test]), Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) score (i.e. stool consistency) 12, and use of rescue therapy 23, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36. Patient‐reported outcome (PRO) measures are direct reports from patients about how they feel or function with regard to a condition and its therapy, without interpretation by others 37. In OIC, PROs include constipation intensity/severity, ease/difficulty of defecation, incomplete evacuation, straining, discomfort, constipation distress, and satisfaction (i.e. satisfaction with BMs or treatment) 12, 35, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45.

Objective Outcome Measures

The definition of OIC proposed by Camilleri et al. 3 includes two elements that are objectively measured — BM frequency and stool consistency, the latter commonly assessed using the BSFS 12, 33. Improvements in these outcomes have been identified as important to patients with OIC 9, 18, 46, 47, and BM frequency is the central element used in most OIC clinical trials 12. However, the degree of change in this outcome that is considered meaningful may vary among patients 18, 47. One longitudinal study found that patients with OIC would like to have ≥ 1 BM per day 18, whereas a separate study involving an online patient survey demonstrated that only 1 additional BM per week was viewed as a meaningful improvement 47. Stool frequency and consistency are important to patients but may not sufficiently portray the severity of OIC 46, 48 or the discomfort and other bothersome OIC symptoms 49.

### Ineffectiveness of Lactobacillus GG as an adjunct to lactulose for the treatment of constipation in children: a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial [^117D5ToM]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if Lactobacillus GG (LGG) is an effective adjunct to lactulose for treating constipation in children.

Study Design

Eighty-four children (2–16 years of age) with constipation (< 3 spontaneous bowel movements [BMs] per week for at least 12 weeks) were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial in which they received 1 mL/kg/day of 70% lactulose plus 10⁹ colony-forming units (CFU) of LGG (experimental group, n = 43) or a placebo (control group, n = 41) orally twice daily for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was treatment success, and analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Results

Treatment success, defined as ≥ 3 spontaneous BMs per week with no fecal soiling, was similar in the control and experimental groups at 12 weeks (28/41 [68%] vs 31/43 [72%], respectively; p = 0.7) and at 24 weeks (27/41 [65%] vs 27/42 [64%], respectively; P = 1.0]. Groups also did not differ in their mean number of spontaneous BMs per week or episodes of fecal soiling per week at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Adverse events and overall tolerance did not differ between groups.

Conclusion

LGG, as dosed in this study, was not an effective adjunct to lactulose in treating constipation in children.

### Macrogol (polyethylene glycol) laxatives in children with functional constipation and faecal impaction: a systematic review [^111MTqnE]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

There have been no clinical studies which have compared PEG with PEG+E. Of the seven studies reviewed, five compared PEG and two compared PEG+E with either placebo or another laxative.

Despite these issues, there appears to be a consensus amongst the studies that treatment with PEG is more effective than with lactulose, with neither agent appearing to have a convincing advantage in terms of tolerability. PEG-based laxatives confer the advantage that in high doses they can be used for disimpaction, and, as they are not fermented by colonic bacteria, do not result in increased gas production.

The comparison of PEG versus milk of magnesia was a well designed and executed study relating to an agent that would not be widely regarded as a first line agent in Europe. Nonetheless, it adds to our understanding of these agents both in terms of efficacy and tolerability.

### Currently recommended treatments of childhood constipation are not evidence based: a systematic literature review on the effect of laxative treatment and dietary measures [^113vvdCZ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Constipation is a common complaint in children and early intervention with oral laxatives may improve complete resolution of functional constipation. However, most treatment guidelines are based on reviews of the literature that do not incorporate a quality assessment of the studies.

Objective

To investigate and summarise the quantity and quality of the current evidence for the effect of laxatives and dietary measures on functional childhood constipation.

Methods

The Medline and Embase databases were searched to identify studies evaluating the effect of a medicamentous treatment or dietary intervention on functional constipation. Methodological quality was assessed using a validated list of criteria. Data were statistically pooled, and in case of clinical heterogeneity results were summarised according to a best evidence synthesis.

Results

Of the 736 studies found, 28 met the inclusion criteria. In total 10 studies were of high quality. The included studies were clinically and statistically heterogeneous in design. Most laxatives were not compared to placebo. Compared to all other laxatives, polyethylene glycol (PEG) achieved more treatment success (pooled relative risk (RR): 1.47; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.76). Lactulose was less than or equally effective in increasing the defecation frequency compared to all other laxatives investigated. There was no difference in effect on defecation frequency between fibre and placebo (weighted standardised mean difference 0.35 bowel movements per week in favour of fibre, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.74).

Conclusion

Insufficient evidence exists supporting that laxative treatment is better than placebo in children with constipation. Compared to all other laxatives, PEG achieved more treatment success, but results on defecation frequency were conflicting. Based on the results of this review, we can give no recommendations to support one laxative over the other for childhood constipation.

### Chronic constipation [^1153La1D]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic constipation is a common disorder that affects approximately 20% of the population and significantly impacts an individual's quality of life. The diagnosis can be made using standard criteria, and in the absence of alarm signs or symptoms, a determination of the underlying etiology/etiologies should be undertaken. In many instances, these will be gleaned from the history and physical examination. Specialized diagnostic testing may be warranted after the failure of initial laxative trials. Many therapeutic classes of laxatives exist with recent analyses indicating that practicing physicians prefer to use over-the-counter therapies in lieu of more strongly evidence-based prescription pharmaceuticals.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: the North American Consensus [^113mASEr]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Breath tests (BTs) are important for the diagnosis of carbohydrate maldigestion syndromes and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). However, standardization is lacking regarding indications for testing, test methodology and interpretation of results. A consensus meeting of experts was convened to develop guidelines for clinicians and research.

Methods

Pre-meeting survey questions encompassing five domains; indications, preparation, performance, interpretation of results, and knowledge gaps, were sent to 17 clinician-scientists, and 10 attended a live meeting. Using an evidence-based approach, 28 statements were finalized and voted on anonymously by a working group of specialists.

Results

Consensus was reached on 26 statements encompassing all five domains. Consensus doses for lactulose, glucose, fructose and lactose BT were 10, 75, 25 and 25g, respectively. Glucose and lactulose BTs remain the least invasive alternatives to diagnose SIBO. BT is useful in the diagnosis of carbohydrate maldigestion, methane-associated constipation, and evaluation of bloating/gas but not in the assessment of oro-cecal transit. A rise in hydrogen of ≥ 20p.p.m. by 90min during glucose or lactulose BT for SIBO was considered positive. Methane levels ≥ 10p.p.m. was considered methane-positive. SIBO should be excluded prior to BT for carbohydrate malabsorption to avoid false positives. A rise in hydrogen of ≥ 20p.p.m. from baseline during BT was considered positive for maldigestion.

Conclusions

BT is a useful, inexpensive, simple and safe diagnostic test in the evaluation of common gastroenterology problems. These consensus statements should help to standardize the indications, preparation, performance and interpretation of BT in clinical practice and research.

### Current management strategies and therapeutic targets in chronic constipation [^112qS6Wd]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Constipated patients who are refractory to simple lifestyle interventions will usually resort to laxatives, whether prescribed or over the counter. Clinical trial evidence is scarce for older medications such as laxatives, especially with a condition as chronic and subjective as constipation. Newer polyethylene glycol-based laxatives have been investigated under rigorous clinical trial settings, but comparisons between different laxatives are not available. Newer prokinetic agents, targeting peristalsis, intestinal secretion and the colonic flora, have been developed for laxative refractory constipation. This review focuses on the evidence for each of these agents, and the relative indications for each of them.

1 INTRODUCTION

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most frequently diagnosed disorders in gastroenterology, which can be defined by the Rome IV criteria system. 1, 2, 3 It is characterized by abdominal pain related to defecation, and associated with a change in stool frequency or consistency (diarrhea, constipation, or a combination of these), without any organic disease or pathological abnormality of the gut‐wall. 4 Four subtypes of IBS can be separated: diarrheal (IBS‐D), constipation (IBS‐C), mixed or alternating (IBS‐M/A) and unclassified (IBS‐U) form. 5, 6 IBS can lead to significant quality of life impairment, decreased work productivity and an increase of health care and social costs. 7, 8, 9, 10 The prevalence of IBS is high in Western countries, affecting 10%‐20% of the adult population. 11, 12, 13 Its pathogenesis remains unknown, but numerous factors may contribute to its development. 3, 14, 15, 16 Treatment is often multimodal, comprising of non‐pharmacological and pharmacological methods. A novel effective treatment option is a low‐FODMAP diet (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols), which suggests that certain food types, containing disaccharides like lactose, can trigger symptoms of patients with IBS. 17, 18, 19

Figure 2.
The low FODMAP diet is a three step process.

Each phase of the 3-step ‟top-down" LFD should be implemented in a personalized manner to maximize benefits and minimize restrictions. However, an alternative approach exists whereby only a few specific FODMAP subgroups are restricted based on diet history and ethnic risk profiles. This approach, termed bottom-up or FODMAP gentle, restricts only 1 or 2 FODMAP subgroups initially, evaluating symptom response and continuing to restrict further only if required. Emerging data suggest that fructans, mannitol, and galacto-oligosaccharides are reportedly the most consistent FODMAP subgroup to trigger symptoms, and lactose may be helpful to restrict in genetically susceptible individuals, although this remains controversial; hence, these may be most relevant to restrict initially (Figure 3). While only limited data exist for this approach, it may be best suited for those with milder symptoms, nutritional deficiencies, or at risk of disordered eating. The traditional top-down approach may be more challenging to undertake in the initial weeks, but following the rechallenge (phase 2) and maintenance (phase 3) phases, it may be better able to identify specific food triggers and hence improve the long-term success of the diet, although this has not been specifically studied.

Lactulose — chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults who fail or are intolerant to over-the-counter (OTC) therapies: The panel suggests the use of lactulose over management without lactulose (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Two RCTs in elderly participants evaluated lactulose syrup, including a multicenter Netherlands study with 103 participants using an initial dose of 15 mL of 50% lactulose daily for 3 weeks, with dose reduced by half after 3 consecutive days with defecation, doubled if no defecation occurred for more than 48 hours, then reduced back to 15 mL after 3 consecutive days; a U.S. study included 55 participants who received 30 mL daily at bedtime for 12 weeks. Lactulose is approved by the FDA for constipation at 10–20 g (15–30 mL or 1–2 packets) daily and may be increased to 40 g (60 mL or 2–4 packets) daily if needed. Bloating and flatulence are dose-dependent and common side effects, which may limit its use in clinical practice.

Chronic idiopathic constipation — senna recommendation: In adults with CIC, the panel suggests the use of senna over management without senna (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Implementation considerations state that trials were conducted for 4 weeks and longer term use is probably appropriate but needs data on tolerance and side effects; the dose evaluated in trials is higher than commonly used and the panel suggests starting at a lower dose and increase if there is no response; and abdominal pain and cramping may occur with a higher dose of senna.

### A randomised, double-blind study of polyethylene glycol 4000 and lactulose in the treatment of constipation in children [^116G2YdZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

The study has a number of strengths and weaknesses. The strengths include the randomised, double-blind comparative design, which has not been used extensively in studies of constipation in paediatric populations, the qualification of the reference centres and the low rate of study discontinuations and of major protocol violations. Since the two preparations compared in this study have a different taste, there was some risk of compromising the blinding, although the medication was provided in identical sachets, using an identical dosing regimen. The mean treatment exposure was high in both groups and the acceptability of the two preparations was high, with compliance superior to > 80% in all but three patients in both treatment arms. Data collected using a patient diary filled in by the parents cannot be independently ascertained, which may compromise their accuracy. However, the use of a patient diary represents a pragmatic solution to data collection in the community setting and such patient-related outcome measures are recommended in current guidelines for follow-up assessment of bowel habits in children. In the PP population, but not in the ITT population, there was an indication of an interaction between treatment and study centre, with the treatment effect being more pronounced in patients treated at site 1 compared to site 2. However, it should be noted that the change from baseline in stool frequency at site 2 was still nearly twofold higher in the PEG 4000 group than in the lactulose group, and that the study was insufficiently powered to detect significant between-group differences at the site level. We have no obvious explanation for the treatment × site interaction in the PP population, but this may possibly relate to the fact that four of the five major protocol violations in the lactulose group related to patients enrolled at site 2.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of polyethylene glycol with and without electrolytes in constipation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112kBLjf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Polyethylene glycols were first used in lavage solutions in preparation for gastrointestinal interventions such as colonoscopy or bowel surgery. For this indication, they are given in high doses and are generally administered with electrolytes to reduce the risk of large electrolyte shifts. Later, lower doses were used for the management of constipation. More recent formulations were developed without electrolytes to reduce the sodium load, improve taste and potentially patient acceptance and compliance also.

The clinical effectiveness of polyethylene glycols in the management of constipation in adults is well established and confirmed in a recent meta-analysis by Belsey et al. This analysis demonstrated that polyethylene glycol is more effective than placebo and active comparators such as lactulose in the treatment of non-organic constipation. In this analysis however, all polyethylene glycol formulations were treated as the same and it did not provided any insight regarding the clinical utility of the addition of electrolytes to polyethylene glycol. In some countries PEG + E is more widely used than PEG for the management of constipation. The reasons for this are multifactorial and include the perception that PEG + E is a more effective treatment for constipation and safer in terms of preventing electrolyte imbalance. There however is a lack of evidence to support or refute these perceptions.

The objective of this systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) was to assess the relative effectiveness of polyethylene glycol with or without electrolytes in the management of functional constipation in adults. The primary end point was the difference in the mean number of bowel movements per week. Secondary endpoints relate to the relative safety, tolerability and compliance or willingness to continue polyethylene glycol therapy.

Treatment options

Current treatment options

Current laxatives aid defecation by decreasing stool consistency (softening) and/or artificially or indirectly stimulating colon motility, via one or more of a number of mechanisms (Table 3).

Table 3
Drugs commonly used in the treatment of constipation,

Well-designed, placebo-controlled, blinded, clinical trials of older laxatives are sparse. Although many trials report improvements in the number of bowel movements per week and some report improvements of certain symptoms, many studies are small and lack comprehensive clinically relevant treatment endpoints. Similarly, there is a lack of head-to-head comparisons; hence, there is a lack of evidence to determine whether one laxative class is superior to another. It is also largely unknown if laxative treatments address the impaired quality of life observed in patients with chronic constipation, as most studies have failed to assess quality of life measures. Indeed, for some patients, laxatives can worsen certain symptoms, such as bloating and flatulence.

### Evaluation and treatment of functional constipation in infants and children: evidence-based recommendations from ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN [^112BVfM8]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Medium credibility.

Maintenance therapy for childhood constipation — PEG with or without electrolytes is recommended as the first-line maintenance treatment. A starting dose of 0.4 g·kg⁻¹·day⁻¹ is recommended and the dose should be adjusted according to the clinical response. Addition of enemas to the chronic use of PEG is not recommended. Lactulose is recommended as the first-line maintenance treatment, if PEG is not available. Based on expert opinion, the use of milk of magnesia, mineral oil, and stimulant laxatives may be considered as an additional or second-line treatment. Maintenance treatment should continue for at least 2 months. All symptoms of constipation symptoms should be resolved for at least 1 month before discontinuation of treatment. Treatment should be decreased gradually. In the developmental stage of toilet training, medication should only be stopped once toilet training is achieved.

### A randomised, double-blind study of polyethylene glycol 4000 and lactulose in the treatment of constipation in children [^117VVDqo]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic constipation is frequent in children. The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of PEG 4000 and lactulose for the treatment of chronic constipation in young children.

Methods

This randomised, double-blind study enrolled 88 young children aged 12 to 36 months, who were randomly assigned to receive lactulose (3.3 g per day) or PEG 4000 (8 g per day) for four weeks. The primary efficacy variable was stool frequency during the fourth week of treatment. Secondary outcomes were the number and frequency of subjective symptoms associated with defecation at each visit.

Results

Stool frequency was comparable in the two groups at baseline (lactulose: 0.7 ± 0.5; PEG 4000: 0.5 ± 0.55). Mean stool frequency increased from 0.70 ± 0.50 stools/day at baseline to 0.80 ± 0.41 at Week 4 in the lactulose group and from 0.50 ± 0.55 to 1.10 ± 0.55 stools/day in the PEG 4000 group. A significant difference was observed in the adjusted mean change from baseline, which was 0.15 stools/day in the lactulose group and 0.51 stools/day in the PEG 4000 group, with a least-squares mean difference of 0.36 stools/day [95% CI: 0.16 to 0.56]. With respect to secondary outcome variables, stool consistency and ease of stool passage improved more in the PEG 4000 group (p = 0.001). The incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups, the majority of which were mild.

Conclusions

PEG 4000 has superior efficacy to lactulose for the treatment of chronic constipation in young children and is well tolerated.

### Persistent constipation and abdominal adverse events with newer treatments for constipation [^1163VRaG]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Results

Twenty trials included sufficient information to calculate the number and percentage of participants who remained constipated at the end of the trial. Constipation was an entry criterion for each trial. Figure 1 displays the percentage of individuals who received active treatment or placebo and were constipated at the end of the trial stratified by type of constipation and then by active treatment. Results from each trial were below the identity line, indicating that the percentage of constipated patients with active treatment was less than the percentage of constipated individuals with placebo in the same trial. In all figures, the vertical and horizontal distances from any point to the identity line form the two equal sides of an isosceles triangle and represent the magnitude of the difference between active treatment and placebo.

The percentage of individuals who were constipated with active treatment is plotted as a function of the corresponding value with placebo. If more than one dose of active treatment was tested in a particular trial, the value from the highest dose is analysed. The dashed diagonal line is the identity line. Symbols above the identity line indicate that the value for constipation with active treatment is higher than the corresponding value with placebo, and values below the identity line indicate the opposite.

### Lack of benefit of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 as an addition to the treatment of functional constipation [^114hsGwc]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17983 in the treatment of functional constipation in children. The trial was a single-center randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were allocated into the 2 groups; intervention group which received L reuteri DSM 17983 and lactulose and placebo group which received placebo and lactulose. Due to small recruitment rate study was terminated prematurely; therefore, only 33 children (12 girls, median age 4.5 years, range 2–16) were randomized. There was no difference between groups in the stool frequency, stool consistency, pain, soiling rate and dose of the lactulose. This study found that L reuteri DSM 17938 adds no benefit to the treatment of constipation in children. Due to small sample size, these results, however, should be interpreted with caution.

### American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: pharmacological management of chronic idiopathic constipation [^114e8Xm5]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) — randomized trial regimens and key efficacy findings include the following: Three randomized, placebo-controlled trials studied the effect of PEG on constipation. In two trials, the treatment consisted of 15 g of PEG with electrolytes dissolved in 250 mL of water twice daily; one had a 28-week treatment period and another used an initial 4-week PEG phase with responders randomized to PEG or placebo for 20 weeks. In a United States trial, participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to PEG 3350 or placebo at a dose of 17 g mixed in 8 ounces of liquid once daily for 6 months. PEG likely results in an increase in complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week compared with placebo (MD 2.90, CI 2.12–3.68).

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacological therapies for functional constipation in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117JvmN9]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

There has been a substantial increase in studies on functional constipation in children as new therapies are deployed. We aimed to provide an up-to-date, methodologically robust systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of pharmacological therapies for functional constipation in children.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library from inception to Feb 5, 2025. We included randomised controlled trials that involved children aged 0 years to younger than 18 years with functional constipation treated with pharmacological interventions compared with placebo, no treatment, or other interventions and with at least a 2-week follow-up period. Studies were excluded if there was no definition of functional constipation, children with organic causes for constipation or previous bowel surgery were included, children with faecal incontinence without the presence of constipation were included, or the aim of treatment was faecal disimpaction rather than maintenance therapy. Pairs of authors independently extracted summary data from published reports and critiqued studies. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane tool. Meta-analyses estimated risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences, and 95% CIs. Certainty of evidence was established with GRADE. Our main outcomes were treatment success (as defined by study authors), defecation frequency, and withdrawals due to adverse events. This study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022368719).

Findings

Our search identified 4595 articles, of which 59 randomised controlled trials were included, representing 7045 participants with functional constipation. Interventions included polyethylene glycol (n = 36 studies), lactulose (n = 18), magnesium oxide or magnesium hydroxide (n = 7), picosulfate (n = 1), liquid paraffin (n = 4), prucalopride (n = 1), lubiprostone (n = 2), linaclotide (n = 3), plecanatide (n = 1), enemas (n = 2), and domperidone (n = 1). Meta-analyses for treatment success showed that polyethylene glycol was probably more effective than placebo (RR 1·74 [95% CI 1·25–2·41], moderate certainty of evidence) and may be more effective than lactulose (1·35 [1·11–1·64], low certainty of evidence). There might be no difference in treatment success for linaclotide compared with placebo (1·21 [0·69–2·13], low certainty of evidence), but linaclotide probably leads to higher defecation frequency per week (mean difference 1·10 [95% CI 0·40–1·80], moderate certainty of evidence). There is low to moderate certainty evidence that prucalopride is not more effective than placebo (RR 1·68 [95% CI 0·77 to 3·68]).

Interpretation

Polyethylene glycol is probably more effective than placebo and key comparator therapies and should be considered the standard of first-line care. Future studies should consider polyethylene glycol as an index therapy, and clearly describe methods, patient characteristics, and previous therapeutics.

Funding

None.

### Constipation in adults [^11497xFa]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although there are defined criteria for the diagnosis of constipation, in practice, diagnostic criteria are less rigid, and depend in part on the perception of normal bowel habit. Constipation is highly prevalent, with approximately 12 million general practitioner prescriptions for laxatives in England in 2001.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of non-drug interventions, bulk-forming laxatives, faecal softeners, stimulant laxatives, osmotic laxatives, prostaglandin derivatives, and 5-HT4 agonists in adults with idiopathic chronic constipation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 51systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: arachis oil, biofeedback, bisacodyl, cascara, docusate, exercise, glycerol/glycerine suppositories, high-fibre diet, increasing fluids, ispaghula husk, lactitol, lactulose, lubiprostone, macrogols (polyethylene glycols), magnesium salts, methylcellulose, paraffin, phosphate enemas, seed oils, senna, sodium citrate enemas, prucalopride, and sterculia.

### A randomised, double-blind study of polyethylene glycol 4000 and lactulose in the treatment of constipation in children [^11357evC]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Three study populations were assessed, namely a safety population, defined as all patients who received at least one dose of study medication, an intent to treat (ITT) population, defined as all patients in the safety population for whom at least one post-treatment measure of stool frequency was available, and a per protocol (PP) population, defined as all patients in the ITT population without a major protocol deviation. The primary efficacy analysis was performed in the ITT population and a sensitivity analysis in the PP population. The safety analysis was performed in the safety population.

In the case of premature study discontinuation, the last data value recorded in the patient diary was assigned according to the principle of last observation carried forward (LOCF). In the case of missing data for stool on a given day during any week, the mean of the values on other days in the same week was used to interpolate the missing one. For a given week, the mean value was computed only if at least four of the seven daily assessments of the week in question were documented.

The primary objective of the study was to detect a difference in stool frequency during the fourth week between the two treatment groups. Stool frequency during the fourth week of treatment was assessed across treatment arms using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), in which site and baseline stool frequency (during Week -1) were treated as covariates. In addition, the 95% adjusted confidence interval for the treatment effect was also estimated. Interactions between treatment group on the one hand and site and baseline stool frequency on the other were estimated.

Because of potential deviations from normality of stool frequency, (as established by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test both on raw and transformed data using log, square root and Box-Cox transformations), a post hoc sensitivity analysis was performed to compare the treatment effects using a generalised estimating equation model with a Poisson distribution for repeated measures, taking into account baseline stool frequency, site, treatment, study period and interactions between treatment and study period, treatment and site and treatment and baseline stool frequency.

Functional constipation in children — fiber supplementation: The search identified 111 studies including 3 systematic reviews; Tabbers et al found limited evidence that additional fiber improves constipation compared with placebo and that increased fiber intake is not as effective as lactulose, while Pijpers et al concluded that the pooled weighted standardized mean difference was 0.35 bowel movements per week in favor of fiber (95% CI −0.04 to 0.74), which is neither statistically significant nor clinically relevant; based on these reviews, 3 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 2 more randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were later included, leading to 5 studies overall; in conclusion, evidence does not support the use of fiber supplements in the treatment of functional constipation.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The usual dose is 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls (15 to 30 mL, containing 10 g to 20 g of lactulose) daily. The dose may be increased to 60 mL daily if necessary. Twenty-four to 48 hours may be required to produce a normal bowel movement.

Note: Some patients have found that lactulose solution may be more acceptable when mixed with fruit juice, water or milk.
