## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications can be combined to help a patient stop smoking cigarettes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-approved first-line pharmacotherapies and their mechanisms. Then, I should verify which combinations have the strongest evidence and how much benefit they add. Next, I will review dosing, timing, and safety, including special populations. Finally, I will integrate behavioral support and outline a practical, stepwise approach with contingencies for partial response or intolerance, making sure I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the first-line medications and their mechanisms, because I need to ensure I'm not mixing incompatible classes. The FDA-approved options are nicotine replacement therapy in five forms (patch, gum, lozenge, nasal spray, inhaler), bupropion, and varenicline; each increases quit rates versus placebo, with varenicline and combination NRT generally outperforming single-form NRT or bupropion in head-to-head and network meta-analyses [^115ro1Eo] [^116xBDMc] [^1166C5iM].

> Wait, let me verify the principle of combination therapy before listing specific pairs. The strongest, most consistent evidence supports combining behavioral counseling with pharmacotherapy, which roughly doubles quit success versus either alone; within pharmacotherapy, the clearest benefit is for combination NRT (patch plus a fast-acting form) and for varenicline, with emerging but mixed data on adding NRT to varenicline and on bupropion plus NRT or varenicline [^112ctX4X] [^1166C5iM] [^116xBDMc].

> I will now examine combination NRT, since that is the most reliably effective combination. High-certainty evidence shows that using a long-acting patch with a fast-acting NRT (gum, lozenge, nasal spray, or inhaler) increases long-term abstinence versus a single NRT product, with a risk ratio around 1.25–1.27; this is why combination NRT is considered standard when NRT is chosen and is a first-line option alongside varenicline in many guidelines [^116vjfFV] [^1114WWMc] [^1166C5iM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about varenicline plus NRT; I should double-check the magnitude and certainty. The Cochrane component network meta-analysis suggests varenicline is among the most effective monotherapies and that combination NRT performs comparably, but adding NRT to varenicline shows a modest, conditional benefit signal rather than a consistent, large effect; some guidelines conditionally recommend varenicline plus patch, whereas others note mixed results and suggest reserving it for partial responders or those with high dependence [^116xBDMc] [^114QZm4i] [^115UFmRC].

> Next, I should review bupropion combinations. Bupropion plus NRT is reasonable and FDA-recognized, with some trials and meta-analytic signals suggesting added benefit, though results are less consistent than for combination NRT; bupropion may also be combined with varenicline in select cases, but evidence is limited and tolerability should be monitored closely, especially for neuropsychiatric effects and blood pressure changes [^117TTevX] [^1178jKJu] [^114cZnty].

> Let me think about dosing and timing, because getting these wrong can blunt benefit. For combination NRT, typical practice is a 21 mg/24-hour patch with 2–4 mg gum or lozenge as needed for breakthrough cravings, often for 12 weeks, with some evidence that extending to 24 weeks improves outcomes; preloading NRT for 1–2 weeks before quit day may modestly improve success, and tapering the patch near the end is reasonable though evidence for tapering is mixed [^116vjfFV] [^113HAYvA] [^115352bN]. For varenicline, start 0.5 mg daily for 3 days, then 0.5 mg twice daily for 4 days, then 1 mg twice daily, beginning 1 week before quit day or using a flexible quit date between days 8–35; extending total treatment to 24 weeks reduces relapse in some patients [^1147Kp9N] [^1129MTnJ] [^115UFmRC].

> I need to ensure safety and contraindications are addressed. Varenicline and bupropion are safe in stable cardiovascular disease, and the historical boxed warning for neuropsychiatric events has been removed; nonetheless, monitor for mood changes, sleep disturbance, and, with bupropion, seizures or hypertension, especially in combination with NRT; in pregnancy, avoid varenicline and bupropion and use NRT with caution, preferably after the first trimester and with close supervision [^114CmZXK] [^117Xb75K] [^112HPYDn].

> But wait, what if the patient is not ready to quit abruptly? I should confirm that gradual reduction strategies are acceptable. Evidence suggests gradual reduction to quit can achieve rates comparable to abrupt quitting, and varenicline-assisted reduction over 12 weeks with a flexible quit date is effective even in smokers not ready to quit immediately; this can be paired with behavioral support and, if needed, preloading NRT to reduce smoking satisfaction before the quit day [^113KDG9b] [^113yS88W] [^116vjfFV].

> Next, I should review behavioral support, because medication without counseling underperforms. Combining pharmacotherapy with counseling — in person, by phone, or digitally — increases quit rates by roughly 50–80% versus medication alone; even brief clinician advice improves outcomes, and proactive referral to quitlines or structured programs is recommended; I need to ensure I build follow-up into the plan to sustain adherence and address lapses [^112ctX4X] [^1166C5iM] [^115352bN].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach, and I will double-check each element against guidelines. For most adults who smoke, start with varenicline or combination NRT, add behavioral support, set a quit date or use a flexible quit date with varenicline, and extend treatment to 24 weeks if dependence is high or relapse risk persists; if varenicline is not tolerated or declined, use combination NRT or bupropion with counseling; if there is a partial response, consider adding a second medication such as bupropion to varenicline or adding fast-acting NRT to varenicline, recognizing the evidence base is stronger for combination NRT than for varenicline plus NRT [^114QZm4i] [^1166C5iM] [^116xBDMc].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and adjust the plan accordingly. In patients with cardiovascular disease, varenicline and combination NRT are first-line and safe in stable disease; in diabetes, varenicline is effective but monitor for weight gain and glycemic changes; in COPD, prioritize cessation with the same first-line options and consider longer treatment durations given high relapse risk; in pregnancy, avoid varenicline and bupropion and use NRT with caution and supervision [^117Xb75K] [^115qidMj] [^111nrKuW].

> I should confirm monitoring and follow-up elements to prevent relapse. Schedule check-ins during the first month and periodically thereafter to assess adherence, side effects, cravings, and lapses; reinforce that lapses are common and not failure, and encourage reattempts with adjusted therapy; consider adherence-enhancing strategies if underuse is suspected, as better adherence correlates with higher quit success, albeit with modest effect sizes in trials [^112zy4kw] [^1166C5iM].

> In summary, the most evidence-based medication combinations are combination NRT (patch plus a fast-acting NRT) and varenicline, each of which should be paired with behavioral counseling; adding NRT to varenicline is reasonable in select cases but offers a smaller, less consistent benefit, and bupropion combinations are alternatives when first-line choices are unsuitable or as rescue strategies; I need to ensure dosing, timing, safety screening, and longitudinal follow-up are optimized to translate trial benefits into real-world success [^116vjfFV] [^1166C5iM] [^116xBDMc] [^114QZm4i].

The most effective medication combinations for smoking cessation are **varenicline plus nicotine patch** [^114QZm4i] or **bupropion plus nicotine patch** [^notfound], both of which increase quit rates compared to monotherapy [^1166C5iM]. Combination nicotine replacement therapy (patch plus a fast-acting form such as gum, lozenge, or spray) is also highly effective and recommended as first-line therapy [^116vjfFV] [^1166C5iM]. These combinations should be paired with behavioral counseling to maximize success [^112ctX4X] [^1166C5iM]. Avoid combining varenicline with bupropion unless supervised, as evidence is limited and side effects may increase [^1178jKJu].

## Medication combinations to avoid or use with caution

- **Varenicline + bupropion**: Limited evidence; use only with close monitoring for neuropsychiatric effects and seizures [^notfound].
- **Multiple NRT forms beyond patch + one fast-acting product**: No added benefit and may increase adverse effects [^notfound].
- **Non-FDA-approved combinations**: Avoid untested combinations outside clinical trials [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **First-line combinations**: Varenicline plus patch, bupropion plus patch, and combination NRT are all recommended first-line options [^114QZm4i] [^1166C5iM].
- **Behavioral support**: Combine all pharmacotherapy with counseling or behavioral support to maximize quit rates [^112ctX4X] [^1166C5iM].
- **Individualization**: Tailor therapy to patient preference, comorbidities, and prior quit history [^115BB8p8] [^1166C5iM].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

- **Neuropsychiatric effects**: Monitor for depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, especially with varenicline and bupropion [^notfound].
- **Cardiovascular effects**: Monitor blood pressure and heart rate, particularly with bupropion and NRT [^117TTevX].
- **Pregnancy**: Use NRT preferentially; avoid varenicline and bupropion unless benefits outweigh risks [^112H3qCb].

### An appraisal of smoking cessation aids [^115E5qi7]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Smoking cessation is the single most efficacious intervention to reduce and prevent smoking-associated morbidity and mortality. This review presents an updated summary of current treatment options. Resources available for management of smoking cessation efforts and variables that may guide treatment of subgroups of patients have also been highlighted.

Recent Findings

The US Department of Health and Human Services released updated guidelines for treatment of smoking cessation in 2008. Recent meta-analyses have reviewed the newly Food and Drug Administration approved drug, varenicline, as well as some new nonpharmacological approaches to treating tobacco dependence.

Summary

Several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic aids have proven efficacy in smoking cessation management. The best results are obtained by combining modalities. Tailoring therapy improves success rate.

### Is a combination of varenicline and nicotine patch more effective in helping smokers quit than varenicline alone? A randomised controlled trial [^114WMz3j]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and varenicline are both effective in helping smokers quit. There is growing interest in combining the two treatments to improve treatment outcomes, but no experimental data exist on whether this is efficacious. This double-blind randomised controlled trial was designed to evaluate whether adding nicotine patches to varenicline improves withdrawal relief and short-term abstinence rates.

Methods

117 participants seeking help to stop smoking were randomly allocated to varenicline plus placebo patch or varenicline plus nicotine patch (15 mg/16 hour). Varenicline use commenced one week prior to the target quit date (TQD), patch use started on the TQD. Ratings of urges to smoke and cigarette withdrawal symptoms were collected weekly over 4 weeks post-TQD. Medication use and smoking status were established at 1, 4 and 12 weeks. Participants lost to follow-up were included as continuing smokers.

Results

92% of participants used both medications during the first week after the TQD. The combination treatment generated no increase in nausea or other adverse effects. It had no overall effect on urges to smoke or on other withdrawal symptoms. The combination treatment did not improve biochemically validated abstinence rates at 1 week and 4 weeks post-TQD (69% vs 59%, p = 0.28 and 60% vs 59%, p = 0.91, in the nicotine patch and placebo patch arm, respectively), or self reported abstinence rates at 12 weeks (36% vs. 29%, p = 0.39, NS).

Conclusions

The efficacy of varenicline was not enhanced by the addition of nicotine patches, although further trials would be useful to exclude the possibility of type II error.

### Diminishing benefit of smoking cessation medications during the first year: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111GTPzV]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tobacco use is the most common cause of preventable death in the world today 1, 2, causing more than 7 million deaths per year 3. The fastest way to reduce the burden of smoking is through smoking cessation by current smokers 4. The effectiveness of US FDA‐recommended first‐line smoking cessation medications 5 is undisputed when considering evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Systematic reviews and meta‐analyses conducted by the Cochrane Collaboration 6, 7, 8, the US Public Health Services, 5 England's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 9 and others 10, 11, 12, 13 show consistently that smoking cessation medications help smokers quit.

However, the magnitude of benefit to individual smokers and populations is less well understood. There are two sources of confusion. First, it is possible that the benefits of medications decline, even in the context of RCTs. Many smokers who quit relapse 14, 15, 16, 17, leading to declines in quit rates over time 18, 19, 20, 21. This is well illustrated by a recent study (n = 1086), which found initial quit rates of at least 24 hours' duration to be 70–80%, with declines over time to approximately 20% for varenicline, nicotine patch and combination nicotine groups by 1 year 22. Original reports of studies often describe quit rates at a single time‐point, with 6 months used as a standard, on the grounds that it is possible to 'make reliable estimates of permanent cessation' on the basis of 6‐month continued abstinence 23. Reviews and meta‐analyses usually provide a single summary measure based on quit rates at a single time‐point, or as a summary based on several time‐points (Cochrane Reviews: 6 months or more, 6–24 months 6, 7, 8; the US Public Health Service: 6 months 5; independent reviewers: 6 or 12 months 10, 12.). Representing smoking cessation at a single or composite time‐point obscures the more complex reality of declining quit rates: neither the benefit to an individual as time progresses nor to a population is easily grasped. The problem is compounded because few studies continue beyond 1 year 6, 7, 8.

### What to do with a patient who smokes [^116zbSGT]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Despite the reality that smoking remains the most important preventable cause of death and disability, most clinicians underperform in helping smokers quit. Of the 46 million current smokers in the United States, 70% say they would like to quit, but only a small fraction are able to do so on their own because nicotine is so highly addictive. One third to one half of all smokers die prematurely. Reasons clinicians avoid helping smokers quit include time constraints, lack of expertise, lack of financial incentives, respect for a smoker's privacy, fear that a negative message might lose customers, pessimism because most smokers are unable to quit, stigma, and clinicians being smokers. The gold standard for cessation treatment is the 5 As (ask, advise, assess, assist, and arrange). Yet, only a minority of physicians know about these, and fewer put them to use. Acceptable shortcuts are asking, advising, and referring to a telephone "quit line" or an internal referral system. Successful treatment combines counseling with pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement therapy with or without psychotropic medication such as bupropion). Nicotine replacement therapy comes in long-acting (patch) or short-acting (gum, lozenge, nasal spray, or inhaler) forms. Ways to counter clinicians' pessimism about cessation include the knowledge that most smokers require multiple quit attempts before they succeed, that rigorous studies show long-term quit rates of 14% to 20%, with 1 report as high as 35%, that cessation rates for users of telephone quit lines and integrated health care systems are comparable with those of individual clinicians, and that no other clinical intervention can offer such a large potential benefit.

### Smoking cessation interventions [^115352bN]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 1 in 5 adults uses tobacco products. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States despite its known health effects. Although nearly one-half of people who smoke try to quit each year, only up to 1 in 20 who quit without support achieve abstinence for at least six months. All patients, including school-aged children and adolescents, should be asked if they smoke and offered evidence-based treatments for smoking cessation. Use of the 5 A's framework (ask, advise, assess, assist, arrange) can help clinicians promote smoking cessation. Clinical studies have demonstrated that combining pharmacotherapy with effective behavior strategies is significantly more effective than either approach alone. Pharmacotherapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for smoking cessation include nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline. Extended use (greater than 12 weeks) of a controller therapy (varenicline, bupropion, or nicotine patch) is associated with significantly higher sustained quit rates and lower relapse rates than standard use (six to 12 weeks). e-Cigarettes are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for smoking cessation, and evidence supporting their benefit is inconclusive. Lung cancer screening is recommended for adults 50 to 80 years of age who have a 20-pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Lung cancer screening should be combined with smoking cessation tools and treatment.

### Nonpharmacologic therapy for smoking cessation: characteristics and efficacy of current approaches [^113gVvfs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

This article reviews the most common nonpharmacologic approaches used to support smoking cessation and, where possible, provides estimates of their efficacy in controlled clinical trials. Virtually all of the approaches that have been systematically evaluated to date have demonstrated modest efficacy in increasing quit rates. A cornerstone of effective treatment is tobacco dependence counseling, for which there is a dose-response relation between the intensity of counseling (total minutes of contact) and its effectiveness. New approaches in which treatment is tailored to individual patient characteristics appear promising for the future but require further study. Also, new technologies that permit delivery of smoking interventions to a wider range of patients could have a significant impact on reducing smoking prevalence worldwide in the future. Overall, the clinical literature strongly endorses combining nonpharmacologic interventions with pharmacotherapy to optimize support for smokers who are trying to quit.

### Evaluating clinical stop-smoking services globally: towards a minimum data set [^1114Lt8f]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Studies in some high‐income countries suggest that specific medicines and types of behavioural support can improve smokers' chances of long‐term success at stopping 7. However, in order to apply this work globally we ideally need to know more about their effectiveness throughout the world. More broadly, there is considerable room for improvement in stop‐smoking support in all settings. We need to build incrementally on our understanding of how combinations of behaviour change techniques, delivered in what way, to what kinds of smoker and in what settings provide the optimal outcomes 7.

In the future, the challenge for tobacco use cessation will be to improve upon the strategies currently available and, more importantly, to identify support options that are clearly effective, cost‐effective and affordable in different populations and different regions. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can only take us so far with this, and suffer from the well‐established limitations of generalizability, practicability, cost and time‐scale 8. A programme of research is required, complementing the existing evidence base from RCTs, to provide vital information about what approaches work most effectively throughout a broad range of settings. This programme should consist of quasi‐experimental and epidemiological studies that examine variations in smoking cessation outcomes among different cohorts of smokers using different methods of quitting, adjusting for as many confounding factors as possible 9. This kind of approach has already paid dividends in the United Kingdom, where the combination of a common national standard for outcome assessment 10 and the centralized collection of mandatory smoking cessation service (performance data by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, now NHS Digital) has enabled confirmation of findings from RCTs concerning the relative effectiveness of different forms of medication, and identification of specific treatments with improved success rates 11.

### Smoking cessation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115zq2oK]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is increasing in prevalence, and is predicted to become the third leading cause of deaths worldwide by 2020. The precise prevalence of COPD is not known, as many individuals with the disease are left undiagnosed, despite the requirement of only simple spirometry testing for disease detection. The major risk factor for the development of COPD is cigarette smoking, with 90% of deaths from COPD directly attributable to smoking. Therefore smoking cessation is the most effective means of halting or slowing the progress of this disease. This review summarizes and compares the differential characteristics of smokers with COPD vs. those without COPD in relation to their smoking behavior and quitting attempts, and discusses the various strategies that can be used to help patients quit and improve their likelihood of long-term smoking cessation. Of the various behavioral interventions available that can increase the likelihood of smoking cessation, one of the simplest and most effective strategies that physicians can use is simply to advise their patients to quit, particularly if this advice is combined with informing the patients of their "lung age". We also discuss the pharmacologic therapies used to enhance the likelihood of quitting, including nicotine replacement, bupropion SR and varenicline, along with novel nicotine vaccines, which are currently undergoing clinical trials.

### Smoking cessation [^112Qw6Pk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, and its harms are well established. Physicians have more evidence-based resources than ever before to effectively treat smoking, including new uses and combinations of U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacotherapies and expanded community programs. In addition, electronic nicotine delivery systems are potential treatment tools, but their safety and efficacy need to be established. Finally, high-priority groups, such as persons with cancer diagnoses or hospitalized patients, may benefit from particular attention to their tobacco use.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115pEjRJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Traditionally, the clinical community has engaged tobacco use as the toxic antecedent to chronic disease, and so it follows that clinicians have focused on methods to increase the patient's motivation to stop. Our 21st-century perspective, however, engages tobacco use as the cardinal manifestation of a disturbance in the brain's molecular-learning mechanisms. From that perspective, the treatment team's responsibility extends beyond facilitating quitting and includes maximizing longitudinal control over the compulsion to smoke.

The main limitation of our guideline is the limited number of recommendations included. Because our objective was to identify a functional, evidence-based pharmacotherapy pathway, we began the process by identifying an optimal controller medication on which to build additional clinical recommendations. By necessity, our guideline could not address all possible pharmacotherapy options. Future guidelines should consider optimal controller strategies for patients in whom varenicline has previously failed or who have previously refused this treatment.

The guideline addresses several limiting misconceptions, including the value of combination pharmacotherapy, the approach to patients who are reluctant to stop smoking, and the safety and efficacy of treating vulnerable behavioral health patients.

### Is a combination of varenicline and nicotine patch more effective in helping smokers quit than varenicline alone? A randomised controlled trial [^1156ryhU]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nicotine replacement treatment (NRT) and varenicline are both effective in helping smokers stop smoking. Their efficacy however is limited. In routine use, the majority of smokers receiving intensive support and either of these two medications are likely to fail in their attempt to quit. The possibility has been raised that combining these two medications may increase treatment efficacy.

In terms of observable effects on smokers, the two medications appear alike although varenicline has antagonist as well as agonist effects. They both seem to achieve their effect on abstinence by alleviating the discomfort of nicotine withdrawal. They also make cigarettes smoked while on the medications less rewarding and thus may facilitate extinction. The latter effect has been demonstrated for both varenicline and NRT, although the evidence for the NRT effect seems weak.

In terms of neuro-physiological targets, varenicline affects primarily alpha4 beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) where it has higher affinity than nicotine and so essentially blocks nicotine effects, as well as acting as a partial agonist. Nicotine from NRT acts on nAChRs in a similar manner to nicotine from tobacco smoke, but delivery from NRT is much slower.

It is not clear if the central effects of the two medications are sufficiently different to allow synergy, but if they do differ, their combination could have several beneficial effects. It could in theory improve withdrawal relief and/or assist smokers who may not react much or at all to one of them, but who may be sensitive to the effects of the other. Another putative mechanism concerns the timing of the treatment regimen of the two medications. Varenicline is used for 1–2 weeks prior to quitting, concurrently with smoking. It is possible that from the target quit day (TQD), when nicotine intake from cigarettes ceases, the addition of NRT to replace any effects which nicotine from cigarettes may still have had up to that point, could reduce post-quitting urges to smoke and withdrawal discomfort. It is also possible of course that the targets of the two medications overlap too much for their combination to provide any additional benefit, or that the receptor occupancy provided by varenicline blocks any additional effects of NRT.

### A comprehensive approach to tobacco dependence interventions [^113qfX2m]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Tobacco smoking remains the leading preventable cause of death and illness in the United States. Smoking cessation is particularly relevant for individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease because it is known from multiple studies that individuals who quit smoking experience an initial improvement in pulmonary function, a decreased rate of normal age-related decline in FEV1, a lower risk of hospital admission, and improved survival. Tobacco dependence must be recognized as a chronic disease, and comprehensive treatment for the tobacco-dependent patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease begins with a physician's inquiry into smoking and encouragement to quit, followed by an assessment of the level of dependence and the severity of withdrawal symptoms during previous quit attempts. Combination pharmacotherapy is recommended for the initial treatment of most smokers, especially those with moderate to high baseline levels of tobacco dependence. The patient's history, combined with his or her personal preference, can guide the clinician in initiating an appropriate treatment regimen. Given the chronic nature of tobacco dependence, clinicians must anticipate relapses and the need for recurrent, long-term follow-up. Comprehensive tobacco treatment consultation should be sought whenever possible for patients with high levels of tobacco dependence and multiple relapses or failed quit attempts.

### Pharmacological smoking cessation of adults aged 30–50 years with COPD [^113o3wbB]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Making smoking cessation treatment equally available to all individuals requires more than offering free advice on smoking cessation. Socioeconomic factors must be considered before the type of smoking cessation treatment is chosen. Individually tailored smoking cessation treatment should be offered to patients with COPD to reduce the social inequality observed in this group. One way could be to permanently include smoking cessation medication in the national reimbursement system to lower the prices. To increase the success rates of smoking cessation, medical treatment should be combined with professional counseling.

Smoking cessation is the cornerstone in the treatment of COPD, especially in younger patients since their lungs seem particularly vulnerable to the damaging effects of tobacco use. Health promotion is a core task in general practice. Helping people to quit smoking is an action with considerable impact on public health. Our study emphasizes that there is room for better support and motivation to help young people with COPD to successful smoking cessation.

Offer treatment and connect to resources — "The third step is to offer smoking cessation treatment, which translates into providing a pharmacotherapy prescription and actively connecting the patient to behavioral support resources", and patients "are encouraged to set a quit date, usually within the next month, to provide a structure for the quit attempt". Under pharmacotherapy, "Pharmacotherapy should be offered to every patient who is willing to accept it, with rare exceptions", and "It can also be started even in patients who are not ready to quit smoking immediately, because it can help motivate patients to reduce their smoking and increase the odds of them eventually making a quit attempt"; "Prescriptions should be written even for over-the-counter medications" to support coverage, reinforcement, and documentation. For behavioral support, "Either the clinician or office staff should proactively connect a smoker to his/her preferred form of behavioral support", and "Studies have shown that a clinician's active referral to a behavioral support program for smoking cessation is more effective than simply providing advice or information about these".

### Combining default choices and an encounter decision aid to improve tobacco cessation in primary care patients: a pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial [^116vHd5X]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Tobacco smoking led to 7.7 million deaths worldwide in 2019 and remains the leading cause of preventable mortality in Switzerland. Quitting smoking at age 35 to 44 or 45 to 54 years provides a gain in life expectancy of 9 and 6 years, compared to continuing to smoke. Multiple interventions can be delivered in primary care to promote smoking cessation, such as providing advice, prescribing pharmacological therapy, and possibly encouraging use of electronic cigarettes.

However, primary care providers (PCPs) less often provide medications or counselling for tobacco use than other major risk factors (e.g. hypertension, diabetes).PCPs often inquire about tobacco consumption and provide brief advice, but rarely prescribe treatments or provide help to quit over repeated visits. This may in part be due to several guidelines recommending PCPs to only offer quit support to patients who are motivated to quit and "opt-in". However, motivation to quit is not stable over timeand is a poor predictor of willingness to discuss quitting. An alternative approach is to discuss treatments for smoking cessation as the default choice for all current smokers, with possibility to "opt-out", similar to how treatments are presented for high blood pressure or diabetes. Defaults can have a strong impact on choices and treatment use.

### Combined pharmacotherapy and behavioural interventions for smoking cessation [^112ctX4X]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Both behavioural support (including brief advice and counselling) and pharmacotherapies (including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline and bupropion) are effective in helping people to stop smoking. Combining both treatment approaches is recommended where possible, but the size of the treatment effect with different combinations and in different settings and populations is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effect of combining behavioural support and medication to aid smoking cessation, compared to a minimal intervention or usual care, and to identify whether there are different effects depending on characteristics of the treatment setting, intervention, population treated, or take-up of treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register in July 2015 for records with any mention of pharmacotherapy, including any type of NRT, bupropion, nortriptyline or varenicline.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials evaluating combinations of pharmacotherapy and behavioural support for smoking cessation, compared to a control receiving usual care or brief advice or less intensive behavioural support. We excluded trials recruiting only pregnant women, trials recruiting only adolescents, and trials with less than six months follow-up.

Data Collection and Analysis

Search results were prescreened by one author and inclusion or exclusion of potentially relevant trials was agreed by two authors. Data was extracted by one author and checked by another. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

Fifty-three studies with a total of more than 25,000 participants met the inclusion criteria. A large proportion of studies recruited people in healthcare settings or with specific health needs. Most studies provided NRT. Behavioural support was typically provided by specialists in cessation counselling, who offered between four and eight contact sessions. The planned maximum duration of contact was typically more than 30 minutes but less than 300 minutes. Overall, studies were at low or unclear risk of bias, and findings were not sensitive to the exclusion of any of the six studies rated at high risk of bias in one domain. One large study (the Lung Health Study) contributed heterogeneity due to a substantially larger treatment effect than seen in other studies (RR 3.88, 95% CI 3.35 to 4.50). Since this study used a particularly intensive intervention which included extended availability of nicotine gum, multiple group sessions and long term maintenance and recycling contacts, the results may not be comparable with the interventions used in other studies, and hence it was not pooled in other analyses. Based on the remaining 52 studies (19,488 participants) there was high quality evidence (using GRADE) for a benefit of combined pharmacotherapy and behavioural treatment compared to usual care, brief advice or less intensive behavioural support (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.68 to 1.98) with moderate statistical heterogeneity (I² = 36%). The pooled estimate for 43 trials that recruited participants in healthcare settings (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.18) was higher than for eight trials with community-based recruitment (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.76). Compared to the first version of the review, previous weak evidence of differences in other subgroup analyses has disappeared. We did not detect differences between subgroups defined by motivation to quit, treatment provider, number or duration of support sessions, or take-up of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Interventions that combine pharmacotherapy and behavioural support increase smoking cessation success compared to a minimal intervention or usual care. Updating this review with an additional 12 studies (5,000 participants) did not materially change the effect estimate. Although trials differed in the details of their populations and interventions, we did not detect any factors that modified treatment effects apart from the recruitment setting. We did not find evidence from indirect comparisons that offering more intensive behavioural support was associated with larger treatment effects.

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: current understanding and future research needs in tobacco control and treatment [^115aB4hU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Caring for Current Smokers — In the U.S., fewer healthcare providers are offering tobacco-dependence counseling than a decade ago, and tobacco-dependent patients are less likely to receive treatment than patients with other chronic conditions. Evidence suggests that healthcare providers can positively influence patients' ability to quit, and clinicians with the knowledge base and demonstrated ability to implement evidence-based strategies may facilitate a decrease in smoking rates, reduce the rates of tobacco-related illnesses, and lower the costs associated with treating these comorbid conditions. Smokers who receive advice from a healthcare professional about cessation are more likely to make a quit attempt than those who do not, and smokers whose primary care physicians counseled them reported increased satisfaction with their care in degrees directly proportional to the number of counseling interventions received. Although some individuals are able to quit smoking without assistance, the combination of counseling and medications more than doubles quit success, and tobacco treatment support systems have been embedded into electronic health records and have successfully augmented provider efforts to screen patients for tobacco use at every encounter.

### Antidepressants for smoking cessation [^1178jKJu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The pharmacological profiles and mechanisms of antidepressants are varied. However, there are common reasons why they might help people to stop smoking tobacco: nicotine withdrawal can produce short-term low mood that antidepressants may relieve; and some antidepressants may have a specific effect on neural pathways or receptors that underlie nicotine addiction.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the efficacy, harms, and tolerability of medications with antidepressant properties in assisting long-term tobacco smoking cessation in people who smoke cigarettes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, most recently on 29 April 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people who smoked, comparing antidepressant medications with placebo or no pharmacological treatment, an alternative pharmacotherapy, or the same medication used differently. We excluded trials with fewer than six months of follow-up from efficacy analyses. We included trials with any follow-up length for our analyses of harms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data and assessed risk of bias using standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome measure was smoking cessation after at least six months' follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence available in each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Our secondary outcomes were harms and tolerance outcomes, including adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), psychiatric AEs, seizures, overdoses, suicide attempts, death by suicide, all-cause mortality, and trial dropouts due to treatment. We carried out meta-analyses where appropriate.

Main Results

We included a total of 124 studies (48,832 participants) in this review, with 10 new studies added to this update version. Most studies recruited adults from the community or from smoking cessation clinics; four studies focused on adolescents (with participants between 12 and 21 years old). We judged 34 studies to be at high risk of bias; however, restricting analyses only to studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not change clinical interpretation of the results. There was high-certainty evidence that bupropion increased smoking cessation rates when compared to placebo or no pharmacological treatment (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.72; I² = 16%; 50 studies, 18,577 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence that a combination of bupropion and varenicline may have resulted in superior quit rates to varenicline alone (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.55; I² = 15%; 3 studies, 1057 participants). However, there was insufficient evidence to establish whether a combination of bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) resulted in superior quit rates to NRT alone (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44; I² = 43%; 15 studies, 4117 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was moderate-certainty evidence that participants taking bupropion were more likely to report SAEs than those taking placebo or no pharmacological treatment. However, results were imprecise and the CI also encompassed no difference (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.48; I² = 0%; 23 studies, 10,958 participants). Results were also imprecise when comparing SAEs between people randomised to a combination of bupropion and NRT versus NRT alone (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.26 to 8.89; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 657 participants) and randomised to bupropion plus varenicline versus varenicline alone (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.42; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 1268 participants). In both cases, we judged evidence to be of low certainty. There was high-certainty evidence that bupropion resulted in more trial dropouts due to AEs than placebo or no pharmacological treatment (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.65; I² = 2%; 25 studies, 12,346 participants). However, there was insufficient evidence that bupropion combined with NRT versus NRT alone (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.92; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 737 participants) or bupropion combined with varenicline versus varenicline alone (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.45; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 1230 participants) had an impact on the number of dropouts due to treatment. In both cases, imprecision was substantial (we judged the evidence to be of low certainty for both comparisons). Bupropion resulted in inferior smoking cessation rates to varenicline (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.80; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 7564 participants), and to combination NRT (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.98; I² = 0%; 2 studies; 720 participants). However, there was no clear evidence of a difference in efficacy between bupropion and single-form NRT (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.13; I² = 0%; 10 studies, 7613 participants). We also found evidence that nortriptyline aided smoking cessation when compared with placebo (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.78; I² = 16%; 6 studies, 975 participants), and some evidence that bupropion resulted in superior quit rates to nortriptyline (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.82; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 417 participants), although this result was subject to imprecision. Findings were sparse and inconsistent as to whether antidepressants, primarily bupropion and nortriptyline, had a particular benefit for people with current or previous depression.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that bupropion can aid long-term smoking cessation. However, bupropion may increase SAEs (moderate-certainty evidence when compared to placebo/no pharmacological treatment). There is high-certainty evidence that people taking bupropion are more likely to discontinue treatment compared with people receiving placebo or no pharmacological treatment. Nortriptyline also appears to have a beneficial effect on smoking quit rates relative to placebo, although bupropion may be more effective. Evidence also suggests that bupropion may be as successful as single-form NRT in helping people to quit smoking, but less effective than combination NRT and varenicline. In most cases, a paucity of data made it difficult to draw conclusions regarding harms and tolerability. Further studies investigating the efficacy of bupropion versus placebo are unlikely to change our interpretation of the effect, providing no clear justification for pursuing bupropion for smoking cessation over other licensed smoking cessation treatments; namely, NRT and varenicline. However, it is important that future studies of antidepressants for smoking cessation measure and report on harms and tolerability.

### Treatment of tobacco smoking: a review [^1166C5iM]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

More deaths in the US are attributed to cigarette smoking each year than to any other preventable cause. Approximately 34 million people and an estimated 14% of adults in the US smoke cigarettes. If they stopped smoking, they could reduce their risk of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and potentially gain up to 10 years of life.

Observations

Tobacco smoking is a chronic disorder maintained by physical nicotine dependence and learned behaviors. Approximately 70% of people who smoke cigarettes want to quit smoking. However, individuals who attempt to quit smoking make an average of approximately 6 quit attempts before achieving long-term abstinence. Both behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy while using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products, varenicline, or bupropion are effective treatments when used individually, but they are most effective when combined. In a meta-analysis including 19 488 people who smoked cigarettes, the combination of medication and behavioral counseling was associated with a quit rate of 15.2% over 6 months compared with a quit rate of 8.6% with brief advice or usual care. The EAGLES trial, a randomized double-blind clinical trial of 8144 people who smoked, directly compared the efficacy and safety of varenicline, bupropion, nicotine patch, and placebo and found a significantly higher 6-month quit rate for varenicline (21.8%) than for bupropion (16.2%) and the nicotine patch (15.7%). Each therapy was more effective than placebo (9.4%). Combining a nicotine patch with other NRT products is more effective than use of a single NRT product. Combining drugs with different mechanisms of action, such as varenicline and NRT, has increased quit rates in some studies compared with use of a single product. Brief or intensive behavioral support can be delivered effectively in person or by telephone, text messages, or the internet. The combination of a clinician's brief advice to quit and assistance to obtain tobacco cessation treatment is effective when routinely administered to tobacco users in virtually all health care settings.

Conclusions and Relevance

Approximately 34 million people in the US smoke cigarettes and could potentially gain up to a decade of life expectancy by stopping smoking. First-line therapy should include both pharmacotherapy and behavioral support, with varenicline or combination NRT as preferred initial interventions.

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: current understanding and future research needs in tobacco control and treatment [^111V8ZXS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Tobacco dependence severity and pharmacotherapy optimization — patients who are heavy smokers, highly nicotine-dependent, or have high baseline serum cotinine are at higher risk of relapse within 30 days of stopping tobacco-dependence medication than less-dependent counterparts, highlighting the need for individualized care and better outcome measures. An evolving understanding of the variable nature of nicotine dependence is likely to improve individualization based on biomarkers or phenotypic characterizations, and strategies to optimize the dose, duration, and combination of existing FDA-approved medications could have a transformative clinical effect. High-throughput models to study medications approved for other indications could accelerate understanding and have practical implications, and current knowledge gaps include overemphasis on outcomes related to "cessation" rather than "control".

### New NCCN guidelines: smoking cessation for patients with cancer [^1138Dj4w]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2015). Low credibility.

Even after a cancer diagnosis, for any stage and prognosis, patients with cancer can reap health benefits from smoking cessation. To address the clinical problems associated with smoking in cancer patients, the NCCN created a new set of NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for 2015. At NCCN 20th Annual Conference, Dr. Peter Shields presented these inaugural guidelines, focusing primarily on the adverse outcomes associated with smoking in patients with cancer, the common barriers to smoking cessation in this patient population, simple yet effective assessment approaches, and treatment recommendations that center on the combination of pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapy.

Abstract

Background

The pharmacological profiles and mechanisms of antidepressants are varied. However, there are common reasons why they might help people to stop smoking tobacco: nicotine withdrawal can produce short‐term low mood that antidepressants may relieve; and some antidepressants may have a specific effect on neural pathways or receptors that underlie nicotine addiction.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the efficacy, harms, and tolerability of medications with antidepressant properties in assisting long‐term tobacco smoking cessation in people who smoke cigarettes.

We excluded trials with fewer than six months of follow‐up from efficacy analyses. We included trials with any follow‐up length for our analyses of harms.

Data collection and analysis

We extracted data and assessed risk of bias using standard Cochrane methods.

Our primary outcome measure was smoking cessation after at least six months' follow‐up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence available in each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — tobacco use treatment states that all adults should be assessed at every healthcare visit for tobacco use and their status recorded to facilitate cessation, adults who use tobacco should be firmly advised to quit, and in adults who use tobacco a combination of behavioral interventions plus pharmacotherapy is recommended to maximize quit rates; it also recommends tobacco abstinence to reduce ASCVD risk, notes it is reasonable to dedicate trained staff to tobacco treatment in every healthcare system, and states that all adults and adolescents should avoid secondhand smoke exposure to reduce ASCVD risk. There are 7 FDA-approved cessation medications, including 5 forms of nicotine replacement, and the black box warnings about neuropsychiatric events have been removed by the FDA.

### Smoking cessation: integration of behavioral and drug therapies [^113tep9J]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Family physicians should take advantage of each contact with smokers to encourage and support smoking cessation. Once a patient is identified as a smoker, tools are available to assess readiness for change. Using motivational interviewing techniques, the physician can help the patient move from the precontemplation stage through the contemplation stage to the preparation stage, where plans are made for the initiation of nicotine replacement and/or bupropion therapy when indicated. Continued motivational techniques and support are needed in the action stage, when the patient stops smoking. Group or individual behavioral counseling can facilitate smoking cessation and improve quit rates. Combined use of behavioral and drug therapies can dramatically improve the patient's chance of quitting smoking. A plan should be in place for recycling the patient through the appropriate stages if relapse should occur.

### Strategies to help a smoker who is struggling to quit [^115xm4Gv]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death worldwide. Stopping tobacco use benefits virtually every smoker. Most of the 19% of US residents who smoke want to quit and have tried to do so. Most individual quit attempts fail, but two-thirds of smokers use no treatment when trying to quit. Treating tobacco dependence is one of the most cost-effective actions in health care. With a brief intervention, physicians can prompt smokers to attempt to quit and connect them to evidence-based treatment that includes pharmacotherapy and behavioral support (ie, counseling). Physicians can link smokers to effective counseling support offered by a free national network of telephone quit lines. Smokers who use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, or varenicline when trying to quit double their odds of success. The most effective way to use NRT is to combine the long-acting nicotine patch with a shorter-acting product (lozenge, gum, inhaler, or nasal spray) and extend treatment beyond 12 weeks. Observational studies have not confirmed case reports of behavior changes associated with varenicline and bupropion, and these drugs' benefits outweigh potential risks. A chronic disease management model is effective for treating tobacco dependence, which deserves as high a priority in health care systems as treating other chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^115UFmRC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Smoking cessation pharmacotherapy — efficacy and first-line options in cardiovascular disease (CVD) smokers: In comparative trials, quit rates were varenicline (21.8%), bupropion (16.2%), nicotine patch (15.7%), and placebo (9.4%), and quit rates were higher in smokers without psychiatric illness than in those with psychiatric illness, but the relative efficacy across drugs was similar. Extending varenicline for 6 months to prevent relapse is effective and has been approved by the FDA, and meta-analyses suggest that varenicline and combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are similarly efficacious as stand-alone therapies, making these 2 approaches first-line recommendations for smoking cessation in smokers with CVD. The efficacy of combining varenicline with nicotine patch to promote smoking cessation has been studied with mixed results; although the mechanism of benefit is not clear, the combination is generally well-tolerated and is an option for smokers who do not succeed with the individual products alone.

### An algorithm for tailoring pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation: results from a Delphi panel of international experts [^115BB8p8]. Tobacco Control (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence-based smoking cessation guidelines recommend nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion SR and varenicline as first-line therapy in combination with behavioural interventions. However, there are limited data to guide clinicians in recommending one form over another, using combinations, or matching individual smokers to particular forms.

Objective

To develop decision rules for clinicians to guide differential prescribing practices and tailoring of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation.

Methods

A Delphi approach was used to build consensus among a panel of 37 international experts from various health disciplines. Through an iterative process, panellists responded to three rounds of questionnaires. Participants identified and ranked "best practices" used by them to tailor pharmacotherapy to aid smoking cessation. An independent panel of 10 experts provided cross-validation of findings.

Results

There was a 100% response rate to all three rounds. A high level of consensus was achieved in determining the most important priorities: (1) factors to consider in prescribing pharmacotherapy: evidence, patient preference, patient experience; (2) combinations based on: failed attempt with monotherapy, patients with breakthrough cravings, level of tobacco dependence; (3) specific combinations, main categories: (a) two or more forms of NRT, (b) bupropion + form of NRT; (4) specific combinations, subcategories: (1a) patch + gum, (1b) patch + inhaler, (1c) patch + lozenge; (2a) bupropion + patch, (2b) bupropion + gum; (5) impact of comorbidities on selection of pharmacotherapy: contraindications, specific pharmacotherapy useful for certain comorbidities, dual purpose medications; (6) frequency of monitoring determined by patient needs and type of pharmacotherapy.

Conclusion

An algorithm and guide were developed to assist clinicians in prescribing pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. There appears to be good justification for "off-label" use such as higher doses of NRT or combination therapy in certain circumstances. This practical tool reflects best evidence to date of experts in tobacco cessation.

### Combination nicotine replacement therapy: strategies for initiation and tapering [^114LxBZD]. Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Several studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated the efficacy of combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for patients who wish to quit smoking. However, there is limited guidance with respect to initiation and tapering of combination NRT. We attempt to review the evidence and rationale behind combination NRT, present the dosing used in combination NRT studies, and propose a step-down approach for tapering of combination NRT with integration of behavioral strategies.

### Promoting smoking cessation [^112H3qCb]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Cigarette smoking causes significant morbidity and mortality in the United States. Physicians can use the five A's framework (ask, advise, assess, assist, arrange) to promote smoking cessation. All patients should be asked about tobacco use and assessed for motivation to quit at every clinical encounter. Physicians should strongly advise patients to quit smoking, and use motivational interviewing techniques for patients who are not yet willing to stop smoking. Clinical contacts with unmotivated patients should emphasize the rewards and relevance of quitting, as well as the risks of smoking and anticipated barriers to abstinence. These messages should be repeated at every opportunity. Appropriate patients should be offered pharmacologic assistance in quitting, such as nicotine replacement therapies, bupropion, and varenicline. Use of pharmacologic support during smoking cessation can double the rate of successful abstinence. Using more than one type of nicotine replacement therapy ("patch plus" method) and combining these therapies with bupropion provide additional benefit. However, special populations pose unique challenges in pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. Nicotine replacement therapies increase the risk of birth defects and should not be used during pregnancy. They are usually safe in patients with cardiovascular conditions, except for those with unstable angina or within two weeks of a coronary event. Varenicline may increase the risk of coronary events. Nicotine replacement therapies are safe for use in adolescents; however, they are less effective than in adults. Physicians also should arrange to have repeated contact with smokers around their quit date to reinforce cessation messages.

Research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — We recommend studies comparing the smoking quit rate of individuals who undergo spirometry with those who do not, including comparisons among those with and without airflow obstruction; studies to clarify the optimal approach to achieve abstinence from smoking with examples including a controller plus a reliever versus a controller or reliever alone, varied pharmacological combinations and durations, varied counseling intensities, and add-on therapies if initial therapy fails; studies that measure the potential benefits and harms of e-cigarettes, both short- and long-term; studies that compare outcomes among patients who have quit smoking, reduced the amount that they smoke, or continued smoking the same amount; studies investigating the genetic basis of smoking addiction and cessation; studies comparing existing smoking cessation strategies and seeking novel smoking cessation strategies and drugs; and studies to determine whether marijuana smoking increases the incidence of COPD and to identify which individuals are at greatest risk.

### Smoking cessation [^114JsYoL]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Smoking is a risk factor for the four leading causes of death in the United States, yet 48 million Americans — 24% of the U.S. adult population — continue to smoke. Approximately 70% of people who smoke visit a physician each year, yet only half report ever being advised to quit smoking by their physician. Smoking cessation is difficult due to nicotine addiction and withdrawal symptoms. Expert groups such as the National Cancer Institute and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research offer protocols for smoking cessation that primary care physicians can use in their office practice. Recent developments in the pharmacotherapy of smoking cessation has led the U.S. Public Health Service to update the practice guidelines for treating tobacco use and dependence. Pharmacotherapy, which includes nicotine replacement therapy, offers assistance to patients who want to stop smoking. However, the cost of pharmacotherapy may be a barrier for some. Other nonpharmacologic therapies, such as counseling, are also effective.

### Diminishing benefit of smoking cessation medications during the first year: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112UmP1x]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

We did not compare results from different cessation medications directly, due to the fact that few head‐to‐head comparisons were available.

Length of treatment with medication and type of behavioural counseling may contribute to length of cessation success. We did not evaluate these or other potential modifiers.

Implications

The common practice of providing RRs or ORs at single or composite time‐points to describe effectiveness of smoking cessation medications 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 26 does not inform providers and policymakers fully about the benefits of smoking cessation medications at the individual and population levels.
Clinicians and policymakers should be aware that the public health benefits of smoking cessation medications are considerably smaller than those indicated by the risk difference at 6 months and diminish over time, most intervention group participants are smokers at 1 year and only a small proportion of intervention arm participants benefit in the long term from the medications. Nevertheless, even these small effects confer important long‐term benefits of public health significance.
Researchers and/or reviewers should collect and report on quit rates at various time‐points, including long‐term end‐points of at least 1 year and preferably much longer; report on RDs and quit rates in addition to RRs; strive to minimize attrition rates among study participants, and report numbers of participants followed‐up at every time‐point.
Statistical software used for meta‐analysis should provide straightforward procedures for calculating intervention group‐specific, appropriately weighted RDs and quit rates for each time‐point.
Improved smoking cessation strategies, with supportive environments for promotion of cessation and prevention of relapse, are needed urgently to help millions of smokers quit smoking permanently.

Proactive Telephone Counseling

Telephone-based cessation services were developed in the early 1980s by the National Cancer Institute and have been shown to be an effective treatment for smoking cessation. Called "quitlines", these services offer advantages in that they are widely accessible, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use. Systems have been developed to help physicians refer patients to a quitline, so that a patient does not even have to make the first phone call. Proactive telephone counseling enhances the patient's ability to quit, and in general, more sessions are associated with greater success. Although services can range from 1 to 12 calls, most receive an average of 3 calls or fewer.

Every state has telephone counseling services and there is also a National Quitline funded by the National Cancer Institute. State quitlines are funded by a combination of state and federal funds, and most offer free or low-cost services. Quitlines are estimated to reach about 1% of smokers in the United States, or about 400,000 annually at a mean cost of $1.69 per smoker.

Pharmacological Interventions

In addition to psychosocial treatments, there are also pharmacological treatments that can be prescribed at a level 1.0 intensity of care or above. Adding medications to counseling increases the success rate in quitting compared with either treatment alone. Currently, nicotine patches, gum, and lozenges do not require a prescription. However, nicotine nasal spray, nicotine inhaler, bupropion, and varenicline are also all US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for smoking cessation and require a prescription from a healthcare professional. All 7 US FDA -approved medications are proven to be effective in helping a patient to manage withdrawal symptoms and at least double the chances the person will be successful in quitting compared with not using medication. However, healthcare professionals can be especially helpful in assisting and educating patients to use these medications correctly, and can also prescribe combinations of medications to help patients quit. Among tobacco users, only 7.6% receive a prescription for a tobacco-cessation medication during a healthcare visit; rates are even lower for Medicare recipients. Medical management of a quit attempt by a prescriber provides additional counseling time, although medications are generally more effective if given in combination with several sessions of tobacco counseling. Although tobacco medications may be available through private or public insurance, there are often restrictions on the use including coverage limits (eg, 12–24 weeks only).

### Pharmacological treatments for smoking cessation [^115ro1Eo]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Among the 3 first-line smoking cessation treatments (nicotine replacement therapy [NRT], bupropion, and varenicline), which is most effective in helping people who smoke achieve and maintain abstinence from smoking for at least 6 months, and what serious adverse events are associated with each?

Bottom Line

Higher rates of smoking cessation were associated with NRT (17.6%) and bupropion (19.1%) compared with placebo (10.6%). Varenicline (27.6%) and combination NRT (31.5%) (eg, patch plus inhaler) were most effective for achieving smoking cessation. None of the therapies was associated with an increased rate of serious adverse events.

What others are saying

A collaborative statement on current chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) research needs, published by the ATS and the European Respiratory Society, positions pretreatment in pursuit of smoking reduction as a potential mechanism for reducing COPD respiratory symptoms but does not address the potential role of pretreatment for all patients with COPD who continue to smoke. The ATS research statement on smoking-cessation interventions in lung cancer screening programs identified the profound drop-off in intervention rates after assessment of quit readiness as a potential point for performance improvement but did not make specific pretreatment recommendations. The Canadian Cancer Society produced an educational flyer encouraging agency among smokers not ready to quit. It offers advice for preparing for a quit attempt but does not address the role of pharmacotherapy.

Research needs

Given the cumulative effect of varenicline on abstinence during the treatment phase, guidance regarding the optimal duration of treatment, including methods for determining when continuation is unlikely to derive further benefit, is critical to maximizing impact on outcomes. Future research needs to measure outcomes important to patients, such as QOL and other substance use, when conducting trials on patients who are unready to quit. In addition, given the identified synergistic effect of nicotine on varenicline, studies evaluating the impact of combination pharmacotherapy on treatment outcomes are warranted. Finally, research on subgroup populations with comorbidities should be considered. For example, should patients with COPD who continue to smoke receive longer-duration treatment, given their recognized dependence severity? Would patients with a history of depression or alcoholism benefit from combination pretreatment with bupropion? Does the pharmacotherapy follow-up interval after initiation have an impact on efficacy?

Question 6: In Tobacco-Dependent Adults with Comorbid Psychiatric Conditions, Including Substance-Use Disorder, Depression, Anxiety, Schizophrenia, and/or Bipolar Disorder, for Whom Treatment Is Being Initiated, Should Clinicians Start with the Optimal Controller Identified for Patients without Psychiatric Conditions or Use a Nicotine Patch?

Rationale for question

Before the publication of the EAGLES clinical trial, there was a boxed warning regarding possible neuropsychiatric adverse events for both varenicline and bupropion. These concerns stemmed from case reports and postmarketing surveillance, as no RCTs found evidence for these events and early observations suggested no significant increase in neuropsychiatric adverse events with pharmacotherapy compared with placebo, even among patients with preexisting mental illness. Given the persistent stigma assigned to varenicline within the behavioral health community, the panel believed it important to evaluate the evidence guiding the clinical question of whether varenicline or nicotine should be used in adults with comorbid psychiatric conditions.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^115kAaHT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) pharmacotherapy — availability, efficacy, and use: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved 5 nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products as well as bupropion and varenicline, and these medications are more effective than placebo for 6 months or more and are safe for patients with CVD; in the United States, NRT is available over the counter or by prescription as patches, gum, and lozenges, and by prescription only as a nasal spray and oral inhaler. Each NRT product has about the same efficacy, increasing quit rates with risk ratios of ~1.6 compared with placebo, and combining the nicotine patch with a more rapidly absorbed form is more effective than using a single product, with a risk ratio of 1.34 compared with single use of a single product. Combination NRT is now considered the standard of care for using NRT and should be recommended as initial therapy when NRT is chosen, nicotine patches are typically marketed with doses that taper over 12 weeks but tapering is optional, the typical duration of treatment is 12 weeks, and no harm from long-term NRT use has been reported.

### Reducing risk in smokers [^1149iAYf]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. For smokers who want to quit, nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion are frequently recommended. Currently, disagreement surrounds the extent of risk reduction from quitting, the consequences of the change of nicotine replacement therapy to over-the-counter status, and the safety and efficacy of new tobacco products being marketed by tobacco companies. This article reviews the current evidence relevant to these and other developments in smoking interventions and describes the most effective strategies that smokers can use to reduce their risk.

Recent Findings

Although it may take approximately 10 to 30 years of abstinence for former smokers' risk of lung cancer to reach that of never smokers, quitting at any time is substantially less risky than continuing to smoke. Quitting after diagnosis also prolongs survival. Bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy are effective pharmacotherapies, doubling quit rates compared with self-quitting. However, many users of over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy are using it inappropriately. More research is needed to determine the long-term health effects of modified tobacco products and their efficacy in helping smokers quit. Switching to "low tar" filter cigarettes to reduce lung cancer risk, however, is clearly ineffective. The most effective interventions for quitting continue to be a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic approaches.

Summary

Health care practitioners should encourage all smokers to attempt cessation and emphasize pharmacotherapy as an important aid to quitting. Professionals who educate patients on the appropriate use of pharmacotherapy and follow-up on smokers' attempts to quit will help reduce the societal burden and personal risks of smoking.

### An algorithm for tailoring pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation: results from a Delphi panel of international experts [^112oyKSE]. Tobacco Control (2009). Low credibility.

Helping smokers quit is a critical, yet often perplexing role for physicians. While pharmacotherapy generally doubles the odds of quitting successfully, these smoking cessation aids are not widely prescribed or used by smokers. Although guidelines exist in several countries (United States, United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand) – that recommend nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion SR as first-line medication, limited data are available to guide clinicians in selecting specific forms of pharmacotherapy for individual smokers. While varenicline, a new pharmacotherapeutic option, has demonstrated therapeutic superiority over existing first-line medications, – post-marketing reviews have recently raised safety concerns regarding varenicline.

The health benefits of smoking cessation are well documented. Smokers who quit reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease, lung disease, and cancer and increase their life expectancy substantially. While most smokers make several quit attempts before they succeed, about one in four who use any pharmacotherapy will eventually quit smoking. Evidence indicates that pharmacotherapy increases the odds of success and may reduce symptoms of withdrawal for those who smoke 10 or more cigarettes per day. While a few studies have shown that pharmacotherapy works even in the absence of psychosocial therapies, most studies show that combining pharmacotherapy and psychosocial treatments increases quit rates.

A Cochrane reviewincluding 123 trials concluded that all types of NRT increased the odds of quitting by approximately one-and-a-half to twofold. In addition, the effectiveness of NRT was independent of the intensity of behavioural support provided to the smoker. Bupropion SR and nortriptyline (antidepressants) were found to increase rates of smoking cessation in a Cochrane review of antidepressants including 53 trials. When prescribed as monotherapy, bupropion (31 trials) and nortriptyline (four trials) both doubled the odds of cessation. Bupropion and nortriptyline appear to have similar effectiveness to NRT. Other antidepressants (fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, moclobemide, venlafaxine) have not shown significant benefit as an aid to smoking cessation. While studies of rimonabant have been completed, no reviews currently exist and there have been conflicting results regarding its efficacy in the US and Europe.

### Non-nicotine pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation [^117Fa2hz]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

International chronic obstructive pulmonary disease guidelines recommend that smokers be strongly advised to quit, and should be offered help in doing so. The most effective smoking-cessation interventions combine behavioural support with pharmacotherapies. For smokers who do not wish to use nicotine replacement treatments, bupropion is a safe and effective non-nicotine alternative first-line treatment. Nortriptyline and clonidine have demonstrated efficacy in aiding smoking cessation, but are regarded as second-line therapies. A number of other non-nicotine treatments show promise, but more data are required before these can be recommended in assisting smokers to stop.

Treatment algorithm for patients not ready to make a quit attempt — smokers who are not currently ready to accept help to quit should receive at least one of two evidence-based motivational treatments: 1) motivational interviewing; and 2) provision of smoking cessation medications as part of a plan to gradually cut back on smoking. Under the branch "Current smoker not ready to quit now", treatments include "Motivational interviewing (risks, rewards, roadblocks)", "Prescribe and/or offer free medication samples of stop smoking medications and encourage to reduce quantity smoked", "Discuss the use of non-combustible tobacco product if not interested in using stop smoking medications", and "Advise patient to adopt smoke-free home and car policy". Follow-up specifies "Reassess* with patients within 1 month", with the footnote clarifying "Reassess by connecting with the patient within ~ 1 month through the following: face-to-face contact during an office visit, sending MyChart query, e-mail or text message, or calling the patient on the phone". Subsequent branches state, "If ready to quit, refer/connect to stop smoking treatments", or "If not ready to quit, repeat provision of treatment". The text notes supportive measures where "Emerging evidence suggests that motivational interviewing… can increase quit attempts among smokers initially unwilling to quit", and "Reducing cigarettes per day via cessation medication… can also increase later quit attempts and abstinence".

Pharmacotherapy recommendations for smokers with CVD and ACS — All FDA‑approved smoking cessation medications (NRT, bupropion, and varenicline) promote smoking cessation and are tolerable and effective options for smokers with stable CVD. Meta-analyses indicate that varenicline and combination NRT are more effective than bupropion or single NRT products, making these 2 approaches first-line recommendations, while single NRT and bupropion are considered second-line for CVD. The committee recommended using combinations of agents for smokers who have only a partial response and fail to achieve complete tobacco abstinence with individual agents. In ACS, varenicline demonstrated efficacy in a randomized trial of hospitalized smokers who started in-hospital, with no significant difference in major cardiovascular events versus placebo over 52 weeks; bupropion was not effective in 2 trials, and no randomized trial has tested NRT in ACS. In light of evidence on equivalent efficacy of combined NRT and varenicline in the general population, the committee recommends either treatment for smokers with ACS. Coverage may influence selection because nonprescription NRT is not uniformly covered and varenicline is often covered, but with copay and sometimes restrictions. Committee members differed on timing: some recommended starting varenicline in-hospital with NRT as needed while titrating to full dose, whereas others recommended starting at or after discharge; as the discharge medication, some preferred NRT, noting it achieves steady-state dose more rapidly than varenicline. Existing data support alternate approaches, including preloading or using therapies to help smokers reduce tobacco use immediately with the goal of complete abstinence subsequently, and most efficacy trials provided behavioral counseling along with pharmacotherapy.

Treatment of tobacco use — recommendations emphasize systematic assessment and cessation support: All adults should be assessed at every healthcare visit for tobacco use and their tobacco use status recorded as a vital sign to facilitate tobacco cessation. To achieve tobacco abstinence, all adults who use tobacco should be firmly advised to quit. In adults who use tobacco, a combination of behavioral interventions plus pharmacotherapy is recommended to maximize quit rates. In adults who use tobacco, tobacco abstinence is recommended to reduce ASCVD risk. To facilitate tobacco cessation, it is reasonable to dedicate trained staff to tobacco treatment in every healthcare system. All adults and adolescents should avoid secondhand smoke exposure to reduce ASCVD risk. There are 7 FDA-approved cessation medications, including 5 forms of nicotine replacement, and the black box warnings about neuropsychiatric events have been removed by the FDA.

It is in the best interest of patients to quit smoking tobacco because persistent smoking is associated with second primary cancers, treatment complications, and decreased survival. Some surgeons will not operate on individuals who currently smoke due to increased postoperative pulmonary complications; however, active smoking should not be used to exclude patients with early-stage lung cancer from surgical treatment that will prolong survival. Programs using behavioral counseling combined with FDA‑approved medications can be very useful, and the American Cancer Society (ACS) offers resources on How to Quit Using Tobacco.

### Interventions to increase adherence to medications for tobacco dependence [^112zy4kw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pharmacological treatments for tobacco dependence, such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), have been shown to be safe and effective interventions for smoking cessation. Higher levels of adherence to these medications increase the likelihood of sustained smoking cessation, but many smokers use them at a lower dose and for less time than is optimal. It is important to determine the effectiveness of interventions designed specifically to increase medication adherence. Such interventions may address motivation to use medication, such as influencing beliefs about the value of taking medications, or provide support to overcome problems with maintaining adherence.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions aiming to increase adherence to medications for smoking cessation on medication adherence and smoking abstinence compared with a control group typically receiving standard care.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register, and clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) to the 3 September 2018. We also conducted forward and backward citation searches.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, cluster-randomised or quasi-randomised studies in which adults using active pharmacological treatment for smoking cessation were allocated to an intervention arm where there was a principal focus on increasing adherence to medications for tobacco dependence, or a control arm providing standard care. Dependent on setting, standard care may have comprised minimal support or varying degrees of behavioural support. Included studies used a measure that allowed assessment of the degree of medication adherence.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data for included studies and assessed risk of bias. For continuous outcome measures, we calculated effect sizes as standardised mean differences (SMDs). For dichotomous outcome measures, we calculated effect sizes as risk ratios (RRs). In meta-analyses for adherence outcomes, we combined dichotomous and continuous data using the generic inverse variance method and reported pooled effect sizes as SMDs; for abstinence outcomes, we reported and pooled dichotomous outcomes. We obtained pooled effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models. We conducted subgroup analyses to assess whether the primary focus of the adherence treatment ('practicalities' versus 'perceptions' versus both), the delivery approach (participant versus clinician-centred) or the medication type were associated with effectiveness.

Main Results

We identified two new studies, giving a total of 10 studies, involving 3655 participants. The medication adherence interventions studied were all provided in addition to standard behavioural support. They typically provided further information on the rationale for, and emphasised the importance of, adherence to medication or supported the development of strategies to overcome problems with maintaining adherence (or both). Seven studies targeted adherence to NRT, two to bupropion and one to varenicline. Most studies were judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias, with four of these studies judged at high risk of attrition or detection bias. Only one study was judged to be at low risk of bias. Meta-analysis of all 10 included studies (12 comparisons) provided moderate-certainty evidence that adherence interventions led to small improvements in adherence (i.e. the mean amount of medication consumed; SMD 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.18; I² = 6%; n = 3655), limited by risk of bias. Subgroup analyses for the primary outcome identified no significant subgroup effects, with effect sizes for subgroups imprecisely estimated. However, there was a very weak indication that interventions focused on the 'practicalities' of adhering to treatment (i.e. capabilities, resources, levels of support or skills) may be effective (SMD 0.21, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.38; I² = 39%; n = 1752), whereas interventions focused on treatment 'perceptions' (i.e. beliefs, cognitions, concerns and preferences; SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.24; I² = 0%; n = 839) or on both (SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.16; I² = 0%; n = 1064), may not be effective. Participant-centred interventions may be effective (SMD 0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.23; I² = 20%; n = 2791), whereas those that are clinician-centred may not (SMD 0.09, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.23; I² = 0%; n = 864). Five studies assessed short-term smoking abstinence (five comparisons), while an overlapping set of five studies (seven comparisons) assessed long-term smoking abstinence of six months or more. Meta-analyses resulted in low-certainty evidence that adherence interventions may slightly increase short-term smoking cessation rates (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.21; I² = 0%; n = 1795) and long-term smoking cessation rates (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.40; I² = 48%; n = 3593). In both cases, the evidence was limited by risk of bias and imprecision, with CIs encompassing minimal harm as well as moderate benefit, and a high likelihood that further evidence will change the estimate of the effect. There was no evidence that interventions to increase adherence to medication led to any adverse events. Studies did not report on factors plausibly associated with increases in adherence, such as self-efficacy, understanding of and attitudes toward treatment, and motivation and intentions to quit.

Authors' Conclusions

In people who are stopping smoking and receiving behavioural support, there is moderate-certainty evidence that enhanced behavioural support focusing on adherence to smoking cessation medications can modestly improve adherence. There is only low-certainty evidence that this may slightly improve the likelihood of cessation in the shorter or longer-term. Interventions to increase adherence can aim to address the practicalities of taking medication, change perceptions about medication, such as reasons to take it or concerns about doing so, or both. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to confirm which approach is more effective. There is no evidence on whether such interventions are effective for people who are stopping smoking without standard behavioural support.

### Pharmacotherapy for nicotine dependence [^116NX8pb]. CA (2005). Low credibility.

Approximately 50% of long-term cigarette smokers die prematurely from the adverse effects of smoking, including on cancer, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, or other illness. This risk can be substantially reduced by smoking cessation, with greater benefits occurring the earlier in the smoking career that cessation occurs. However, cessation provides benefits at any stage, including after the onset of smoking-related disease, by improving the prognosis and quality of life. Clinicians can have a significant impact on reducing tobacco use by their patients by following the US Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guidelines. Proven strategies include structured methods of advising cigarette smokers to quit and guidance to facilitate their efforts, as well as the use of various pharmacotherapies. Pharmacotherapies for tobacco dependence include nicotine replacement medications in the form of gum, transdermal patch, lozenge, sublingual tablet, nasal spray, and vapor inhaler formulations. The only nonnicotine medication that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is bupropion. Combination therapies, long-term medication therapies, and harm reduction strategies may further improve outcome with approved medications. Further, new medications such as varenicline and rimonabant are likely to reach tobacco users who are refractory to current treatments. Increasing the treatment options, increasing availability, and reducing the perceived cost of these medications may have an additional public health impact.

### Systematic review: smoking cessation intervention strategies for adults and adults in special populations [^113Eq79a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

While smoking cessation interventions have been shown to work, questions remain about how to increase their efficacy.

Purpose

To examine strategies for effective tobacco treatment in adults and special populations.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Applied Health (CINAHL), Cochrane Library, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, Psychological Abstracts, and Sociological Abstracts (1 January 1980 to 10 June 2005).

Study Selection

Systematic reviews; randomized, controlled trials; and observational studies.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently abstracted data on study design, population, sample size, treatment, outcomes, and quality.

Data Synthesis

Findings from systematic reviews were summarized and compared with findings from original research published beyond date ranges included in the reviews. Strength of evidence was used to assess the body of evidence. Our review included studies evaluating the efficacy of cessation strategies, such as self-help, counseling, single pharmaceutical agents, combined pharmacotherapies, and pharmacotherapies combined with psychological counseling. Research findings consistent with previous reviews show that self-help strategies alone are ineffective, but counseling and pharmacotherapy used either alone or in combination can improve rates of success with quit attempts. Two studies of self-help materials reported discrepancies across effects. Five studies provided mixed results for counseling interventions. Fourteen studies provided sufficient evidence of the efficacy of single pharmacotherapy, combined pharmacotherapy, and psychological interventions either with or without pharmacotherapy. Few studies focused on ways to reach or treat special populations. Three studies with hospitalized patients had findings consistent with a previous review showing no strong evidence that clinical diagnosis affected the likelihood of quitting. New evidence was insufficient to address the effectiveness of interventions for persons with coexisting psychiatric conditions and substance abuse problems.

Limitations

Previous systematic reviews variably cover the range of issues we addressed. More recent studies do not fill all gaps, especially those for persons with coexisting disease.

Conclusions

Although self-help strategies alone marginally affect quit rates, individual and combined pharmacotherapies and counseling either alone or in combination can significantly increase cessation. Using effective smoking treatments is strongly encouraged for all populations, especially those with high and heavy rates of smoking, such as psychiatric and substance abuse populations.

Smoking cessation

Never smoking and smoking cessation are essential self‐care behaviors with significant benefit to smokers and those exposed to tobacco smoke. Smokers who quit after a CVD event have better outcomes than those who continue to smoke, with health benefits that begin almost immediately. In those who quit, the risk of a recurrent event is the same as a nonsmoker within 3 years, and the risk of death from CVD is decreased by two thirds in former smokers versus those who continue to smoke. 106, 107 Smoking reduction rather than cessation has little effect on clinical or biological markers, confirming that even minor exposure to tobacco smoke is harmful and illustrating the importance of complete cessation. 108, 109, 110

Smoking cessation is an extremely challenging self‐care behavior because of the addiction to tobacco, but medication can facilitate quitting, 111 even in those who are not yet ready to quit. In one trial, patients who were not willing to quit in the next month, but were willing to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked, were randomized to varenicline or placebo and instructed to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked by 50%, 75%, and 100% over 12 weeks. At weeks 21 to 24, those randomized to the varenicline group had a 38% abstinence rate compared with 13% in the placebo group. 112 Psychosocial interventions, behavioral interventions, telephone counseling, and self‐help materials are also effective in promoting smoking cessation, with the best results achieved with more intense interventions. 113 Group therapy is as effective as individual therapy, especially when augmented by physician advice or nicotine replacement therapy. 114 Healthcare providers who give brief advice to quit at every interaction with a smoker increase the odds of quitting by 34%, 115 which is further enhanced with brief counselling. 116 A combined approach to smoking cessation significantly increases the likelihood that a smoker will be able to quit. 117 Patients who quit after an acute CVD event may be more successful at maintaining this self‐care behavior over time than patients with a slowly progressing chronic disease. 118, 119 More research is needed to understand how best to help smokers quit.

### Incorporating lifestyle medicine into occupational medicine practice: ACOEM guidance statement [^117R9Mcz]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Tobacco use — adult screening and cessation interventions: Tobacco remains "the major preventable cause of death, disease, and disability in the US, causing 480,000 deaths each year", and "nearly 70% want to quit with about half making a quit attempt each year", while "Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body and increases risk of injury". The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that "clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco". Approved drugs "can be used alone or in combination, such as combining two forms of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or adding NRT to another medication"; an "adaptive approach to treatment, adjusting medications based on patient response, can also increase quit rates", and "Brief tobacco-dependence treatment can be effective, but higher-intensity interventions with increased frequency of counseling improve the chance for success". Regarding electronic cigarettes, "none are approved by the FDA for that purpose" and "Electronic cigarettes are not an approved treatment for smoking cessation", with the USPSTF recommending clinicians "provide cessation interventions with proven effectiveness and established safety". Patients often need multiple attempts — "smokers make an average of six quit attempts" and "some smokers may make 30 or more attempts" — and clinicians unable to provide treatment directly can refer to "quit lines, which are operated in all 50 states and can be accessed at 1-800-QUIT-NOW; and may offer free or discounted NRT".

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^113HAYvA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This helps to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, and ease the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence. Although there is high-certainty evidence that NRT is effective for achieving long-term smoking abstinence, it is unclear whether different forms, doses, durations of treatment or timing of use impacts its effects.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long-term smoking cessation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords, most recently in April 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded studies that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up of fewer than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Separate reviews cover studies comparing NRT to control, or to other pharmacotherapies.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. We measured smoking abstinence after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and study withdrawals due to treatment. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 68 completed studies with 43,327 participants, five of which are new to this update. Most completed studies recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. We judged 28 of the 68 studies to be at high risk of bias. Restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results for any comparisons apart from the preloading comparison, which tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day whilst still smoking. There is high-certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast-acting form plus patch) results in higher long-term quit rates than single form (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.37; I² = 12%; 16 studies, 12,169 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg patches are as effective as 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29; I² = 38%; 5 studies, 1655 participants), and that 21 mg patches are more effective than 14 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08; 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence, again limited by imprecision, also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16-hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 3446 participants). Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward. There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 4395 participants). High-certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast-acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar long-term quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05; I² = 0%; 8 studies, 3319 participants). We found no clear evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low-certainty evidence); duration of combination NRT use (low- and very low-certainty evidence); or fast-acting NRT type (very low-certainty evidence). Cardiac AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low- or very low-certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no clear evidence of an effect on these outcomes, and rates were low overall. More withdrawals due to treatment were reported in people using nasal spray compared to patches in one study (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 10.46; 1 study, 922 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and in people using 42/44 mg patches in comparison to 21/22 mg patches across two studies (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 544 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single-form NRT and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum can result in an increase in the chances of successfully stopping smoking. Due to imprecision, evidence was of moderate certainty for patch dose comparisons. There is some indication that the lower-dose nicotine patches and gum may be less effective than higher-dose products. Using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate-certainty evidence that using NRT before quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is limited. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are reported.

### Small cell lung cancer, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114afT6Z]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Small cell lung cancer — epidemiology and tobacco cessation: Approximately 13% of lung tumors will be classified as small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in 2025, with an estimated 30,000 new cases in the United States, and the male-to-female incidence ratio has been close to 1:1 in the last few years. Nearly all cases are attributable to cigarette smoking, and patients who continue to smoke during treatment have increased toxicity and shorter survival; therefore, tobacco smoking cessation counseling and intervention should be strongly promoted, patients who previously smoked should be strongly encouraged to remain abstinent, and programs using behavioral counseling combined with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved medications can be very useful.

### Smoking cessation in patients with respiratory diseases: a high priority, integral component of therapy [^114ZZ8rm]. The European Respiratory Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Smoking cessation is the one of the most important ways to improve the prognosis of patients with respiratory disease. The Task Force on guidelines for smoking cessation in patients with respiratory diseases was convened to provide evidence-based recommendations on smoking cessation interventions in respiratory patients. Based on the currently available evidence and the consensus of an expert panel, the following key recommendations were made. 1) Patients with respiratory disease have a greater and more urgent need to stop smoking than the average smoker, so respiratory physicians must take a proactive and continuing role with all smokers in motivating them to stop and in providing treatment to aid smoking cessation. 2) Smoking cessation treatment should be integrated into the management of the patient's respiratory condition. 3) Therapies should include pharmacological treatment (i.e. nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion or varenicline) combined with behavioural support. 4) Respiratory physicians should receive training to ensure that they have the knowledge, attitudes and skills necessary to deliver these interventions or to refer to an appropriate specialist. 5) Although the cost of implementing these recommendations will partly be offset by a reduction in attendance for exacerbations, etc., a budget should be established to enable implementation. Research is needed to establish optimum treatment strategies specifically for respiratory patients.

### Managing tobacco use: the neglected cardiovascular disease risk factor [^111n1zBU]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the leading avoidable cause of death worldwide. Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) increases the risk of CVD among non-smokers. Smoking cessation benefits all smokers, regardless of age or amount smoked. The excess risk of CVD is rapidly reversible, and stopping smoking after a myocardial infarction reduces an individual's risk of CVD mortality by 36% over 2 years. Smoking cessation is a key component of primary and secondary CVD prevention strategies, but tobacco use often receives less attention from cardiologists than other risk factors, despite the availability of proven treatments that improve smoking cessation rates. Both psychosocial counselling and pharmacotherapy are effective methods to help smokers quit, but they are most effective when used together. The first-line medications licensed to aid smoking cessation, nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion and varenicline, are effective in and appropriate for patients with CVD. An evidence-based approach for physicians is to routinely ask all patients about smoking status and SHS exposure, advise all smokers to quit and all patients to adopt smoke-free policies for their home and car, and offer all smokers in the office or hospital brief counselling, smoking cessation pharmacotherapy, and referral to local programmes where psychosocial support can be sustained in person or by telephone. Like other chronic diseases, tobacco use requires a long-term management strategy. It deserves to be managed as intensively as other CVD risk factors.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^117KyWfW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Current tobacco treatment guidelines have established the efficacy of available interventions, but they do not provide detailed guidance for common implementation questions frequently faced in the clinic. An evidence-based guideline was created that addresses several pharmacotherapy-initiation questions that routinely confront treatment teams. Methods: Individuals with diverse expertise related to smoking cessation were empaneled to prioritize questions and outcomes important to clinicians. An evidence-synthesis team conducted systematic reviews, which informed recommendations to answer the questions. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach was used to rate the certainty in the estimated effects and the strength of recommendations. Results: The guideline panel formulated five strong recommendations and two conditional recommendations regarding pharmacotherapy choices. Strong recommendations include using varenicline rather than a nicotine patch, using varenicline rather than bupropion, using varenicline rather than a nicotine patch in adults with a comorbid psychiatric condition, initiating varenicline in adults even if they are unready to quit, and using controller therapy for an extended treatment duration greater than 12 weeks. Conditional recommendations include combining a nicotine patch with varenicline rather than using varenicline alone and using varenicline rather than electronic cigarettes. Conclusions: Seven recommendations are provided, which represent simple practice changes that are likely to increase the effectiveness of tobacco-dependence pharmacotherapy.

### Treating tobacco dependence: guidance for primary care on life-saving interventions. position statement of the IPCRG [^114dJfLp]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Guidance

Primary-care health professionals have an important role to play in triggering quit attempts and assisting with those quit attempts. Effective smoking cessation interventions in primary care are based on an awareness of which strategies have been shown to work (Table 3), and on making the most of available resources.

Table 3
Adapting Very Brief Advice on Smoking to your context

Key recommendations are summarised in Table 4.

Table 4
Key recommendations

a Recommendations graded according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network system (described ataccessed January 2008)

b Effective when provided by trained counsellors

Use every opportunity to promote smoke-free living

Consider whether your practice can implement some or all of these strategies to raise awareness of the benefits of quitting and offer support. Become a "no-smoking" practice; institute a smoking ban on practice premises for staff as well as visitors. Place posters and smoking cessation literature in the waiting area. Set up systems to prompt you to ask each patient about smoking; routinely record smoking status in medical records, and review it at least yearly. A combination of these strategies, promoting use of effective medication and use of support services (such as telephone counselling services: "quit lines") can more than double quit rates among your patients, compared with no intervention. –

Opportunistically provide clear, personalised, non-judgemental advice to quit, and offer appropriate and available help to quit. For every 100 people who receive brief advice from a primary-care doctor to quit smoking, up to three extra people will succeed in quitting for at least 6 months than if no advice is given. Approximately 40% of smokers make some attempt to quit after such advice. This shows that intervention really can make a difference (Fig. 1). We support the every contact count model, which requires every health-care professional in the system in contact with a smoker to have the competence and confidence to be able to help someone quit. More people see primary-care providers in a year, than any other health-care professional, and, therefore, primary care needs to get it right. Where people with respiratory conditions are managed in secondary care, smoking cessation should be the first line treatment for all smokers. Where primary care is the main caregiver, but refers to secondary care for an episode of care, for example from surgeons, anaesthetists and midwives then collaboration is essential as outcomes in surgery and maternity will improve with smoking cessation.

### Pharmacological and electronic cigarette interventions for smoking cessation in adults: component network meta-analyses [^112fbzDn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Tobacco smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disease worldwide. Stopping smoking can reduce this harm and many people would like to stop. There are a number of medicines licenced to help people quit globally, and e-cigarettes are used for this purpose in many countries. Typically treatments work by reducing cravings to smoke, thus aiding initial abstinence and preventing relapse. More information on comparative effects of these treatments is needed to inform treatment decisions and policies.

Objectives

To investigate the comparative benefits, harms and tolerability of different smoking cessation pharmacotherapies and e-cigarettes, when used to help people stop smoking tobacco.

Search Methods

We identified studies from recent updates of Cochrane Reviews investigating our interventions of interest. We updated the searches for each review using the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group (TAG) specialised register to 29 April 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs and factorial RCTs, which measured smoking cessation at six months or longer, recruited adults who smoked combustible cigarettes at enrolment (excluding pregnant people) and randomised them to approved pharmacotherapies and technologies used for smoking cessation worldwide (varenicline, cytisine, nortriptyline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and e-cigarettes) versus no pharmacological intervention, placebo (control) or another approved pharmacotherapy. Studies providing co-interventions (e.g. behavioural support) were eligible if the co-intervention was provided equally to study arms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening, data extraction and risk of bias (RoB) assessment (using the RoB 1 tool). Primary outcome measures were smoking cessation at six months or longer, and the number of people reporting serious adverse events (SAEs). We also measured withdrawals due to treatment. We used Bayesian component network meta-analyses (cNMA) to examine intervention type, delivery mode, dose, duration, timing in relation to quit day and tapering of nicotine dose, using odds ratios (OR) and 95% credibility intervals (CrIs). We calculated an effect estimate for combination NRT using an additive model. We evaluated the influence of population and study characteristics, provision of behavioural support and control arm rates using meta-regression. We evaluated certainty using GRADE.

Main Results

Of our 332 eligible RCTs, 319 (835 study arms, 157,179 participants) provided sufficient data to be included in our cNMA. Of these, we judged 51 to be at low risk of bias overall, 104 at high risk and 164 at unclear risk, and 118 reported pharmaceutical or e-cigarette/tobacco industry funding. Removing studies at high risk of bias did not change our interpretation of the results. Benefits We found high-certainty evidence that nicotine e-cigarettes (OR 2.37, 95% CrI 1.73 to 3.24; 16 RCTs, 3828 participants), varenicline (OR 2.33, 95% CrI 2.02 to 2.68; 67 RCTs, 16,430 participants) and cytisine (OR 2.21, 95% CrI 1.66 to 2.97; 7 RCTs, 3848 participants) were associated with higher quit rates than control. In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional eight (95% CrI 4 to 13), eight (95% CrI 6 to 10) and seven additional quitters per 100 (95% CrI 4 to 12), respectively. These interventions appeared to be more effective than the other interventions apart from combination NRT (patch and a fast-acting form of NRT), which had a lower point estimate (calculated additive effect) but overlapping 95% CrIs (OR 1.93, 95% CrI 1.61 to 2.34). There was also high-certainty evidence that nicotine patch alone (OR 1.37, 95% CrI 1.20 to 1.56; 105 RCTs, 37,319 participants), fast-acting NRT alone (OR 1.41, 95% CrI 1.29 to 1.55; 120 RCTs, 31,756 participants) and bupropion (OR 1.43, 95% CrI 1.26 to 1.62; 71 RCTs, 14,759 participants) were more effective than control, resulting in two (95% CrI 1 to 3), three (95% CrI 2 to 3) and three (95% CrI 2 to 4) additional quitters per 100 respectively. Nortriptyline is probably associated with higher quit rates than control (OR 1.35, 95% CrI 1.02 to 1.81; 10 RCTs, 1290 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), resulting in two (CrI 0 to 5) additional quitters per 100. Non-nicotine/placebo e-cigarettes (OR 1.16, 95% CrI 0.74 to 1.80; 8 RCTs, 1094 participants; low-certainty evidence), equating to one additional quitter (95% CrI -2 to 5), had point estimates favouring the intervention over control, but CrIs encompassed the potential for no difference and harm. There was low-certainty evidence that tapering the dose of NRT prior to stopping treatment may improve effectiveness; however, 95% CrIs also incorporated the null (OR 1.14, 95% CrI 1.00 to 1.29; 111 RCTs, 33,156 participants). This might lead to an additional one quitter per 100 (95% CrI 0 to 2). Harms There were insufficient data to include nortriptyline and non-nicotine EC in the final SAE model. Overall rates of SAEs for the remaining treatments were low (average 3%). Low-certainty evidence did not show a clear difference in the number of people reporting SAEs for nicotine e-cigarettes, varenicline, cytisine or NRT when compared to no pharmacotherapy/e-cigarettes or placebo. Bupropion may slightly increase rates of SAEs, although the CrI also incorporated no difference (moderate certainty). In absolute terms bupropion may cause one more person in 100 to experience an SAE (95% CrI 0 to 2).

Authors' Conclusions

The most effective interventions were nicotine e-cigarettes, varenicline and cytisine (all high certainty), as well as combination NRT (additive effect, certainty not rated). There was also high-certainty evidence for the effectiveness of nicotine patch, fast-acting NRT and bupropion. Less certain evidence of benefit was present for nortriptyline (moderate certainty), non-nicotine e-cigarettes and tapering of nicotine dose (both low certainty). There was moderate-certainty evidence that bupropion may slightly increase the frequency of SAEs, although there was also the possibility of no increased risk. There was no clear evidence that any other tested interventions increased SAEs. Overall, SAE data were sparse with very low numbers of SAEs, and so further evidence may change our interpretation and certainty. Future studies should report SAEs to strengthen certainty in this outcome. More head-to-head comparisons of the most effective interventions are needed, as are tests of combinations of these. Future work should unify data from behavioural and pharmacological interventions to inform approaches to combined support for smoking cessation.

### Diminishing benefit of smoking cessation medications during the first year: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1158sdKD]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Although smoking cessation medications have shown effectiveness in increasing abstinence in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is unclear to what extent benefits persist over time. This paper assesses whether the benefits of smoking cessation medications decline over the first year.

Methods

We selected studies from three systematic reviews published by the Cochrane Collaboration. RCTs of first-line smoking cessation medications, with 6- and 12-month follow-up, were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analysis was used to synthesize information on sustained abstinence (SA) at 6 versus 12 months and 3 versus 6 months, using the risk difference (RD) ('net benefit') between intervention and control group quit rates, the relative risk (RR) and the odds ratio (OR).

Results

Sixty-one studies (27647 participants) were included. Fewer than 40% of intervention group participants were sustained abstinent at 3 months (bupropion: 37.1%; nicotine replacement therapy (NRT): 34.8%; varenicline: 39.3%); approximately a quarter were sustained abstinent at 6 months (bupropion: 25.9%; NRT: 26.6%; varenicline: 25.4%), and approximately a fifth were sustained abstinent at 12 months (bupropion: 19.9%; NRT: 19.8%%; varenicline: 18.7%). There was only a small decline in RR (3 months: 1.95 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.74–2.18, P < 0.0001]; 6 months: 1.87 (95% CI = 1.67–2.08 P < 0.0001); 12 months: 1.75 (95% CI = 1.56–1.95, P < 0.0001) between intervention and control groups over time, but a substantial decline in net benefit [3 months: RD = 17.3% (14.5–20.1%); 6 months: RD = 11.8% (10.0–13.7%); 12 months: RD = 8.2% (6.8–9.6%)]. The decline in net benefit was statistically significant between 3 and 6 [RD = 4.95% (95% CI = 3.49–6.41%), P < 0.0001] and 6 and 12 months [RD = 3.00% (95% CI = 2.36%-3.64%), P < 0.0001)] for medications combined and individual medications.

Conclusions

The proportion of smokers who use smoking cessation medications who benefit from doing so decreases during the course of the first year, but a net benefit still remains at 12 months.

### Diminishing benefit of smoking cessation medications during the first year: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116AGf8U]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background and aims

Although smoking cessation medications have shown effectiveness in increasing abstinence in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is unclear to what extent benefits persist over time. This paper assesses whether the benefits of smoking cessation medications decline over the first year.

Methods

We selected studies from three systematic reviews published by the Cochrane Collaboration. RCTs of first‐line smoking cessation medications, with 6‐ and 12‐month follow‐up, were eligible for inclusion. Meta‐analysis was used to synthesize information on sustained abstinence (SA) at 6 versus 12 months and 3 versus 6 months, using the risk difference (RD) ('net benefit') between intervention and control group quit rates, the relative risk (RR) and the odds ratio (OR).

Results

Sixty‐one studies (27 647 participants) were included. Fewer than 40% of intervention group participants were sustained abstinent at 3 months (bupropion: 37.1%; nicotine replacement therapy (NRT): 34.8%; varenicline: 39.3%); approximately a quarter were sustained abstinent at 6 months (bupropion: 25.9%; NRT: 26.6%; varenicline: 25.4%), and approximately a fifth were sustained abstinent at 12 months (bupropion: 19.9%; NRT: 19.8%%; varenicline: 18.7%). There was only a small decline in RR (3 months: 1.95 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.74–2.18, P < 0.0001]; 6 months: 1.87 (95% CI = 1.67–2.08 P < 0.0001); 12 months: 1.75 (95% CI = 1.56–1.95, P < 0.0001) between intervention and control groups over time, but a substantial decline in net benefit [3 months: RD = 17.3% (14.5–20.1%); 6 months: RD = 11.8% (10.0–13.7%); 12 months: RD = 8.2% (6.8–9.6%)]. The decline in net benefit was statistically significant between 3 and 6 [RD = 4.95% (95% CI = 3.49–6.41%), P < 0.0001] and 6 and 12 months [RD = 3.00% (95% CI = 2.36%–3.64%), P < 0.0001)] for medications combined and individual medications.

Conclusions

The proportion of smokers who use smoking cessation medications who benefit from doing so decreases during the course of the first year, but a net benefit still remains at 12 months.

### Reduction versus abrupt cessation in smokers who want to quit [^113KDG9b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The standard way to stop smoking is to quit abruptly on a designated quit day. A number of smokers have tried unsuccessfully to quit this way. Reducing smoking before quitting could be an alternative approach to cessation. Before this method is adopted it is important to determine whether it is at least as successful as abrupt quitting.

Objectives

1. To compare the success of reducing smoking to quit and abrupt quitting interventions. 2. To compare adverse events between arms in studies that used pharmacotherapy to aid reduction.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group specialised register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycInfo for topic specific terms combined with terms used to identify trials of tobacco addiction interventions. We also searched reference lists of relevant papers and contacted authors of ongoing trials. Date of most recent search: November 2009.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited adults who wanted to quit smoking. Studies included at least one condition which instructed participants to reduce their smoking and then quit and one condition which instructed participants to quit abruptly.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up. We pooled the included trials using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model. Trials were split for two sub-group analyses: pharmacotherapy vs no pharmacotherapy, self help therapy vs behavioural support. Adverse events were summarised as a narrative. It was not possible to compare them quantitatively as there was variation in the nature and depth of reporting across studies.

Main Results

Ten studies were relevant for inclusion, with a total of 3760 participants included in the meta-analysis. Three of these studies used pharmacotherapy as part of the interventions. Five studies included behavioural support in the intervention, four included self-help therapy, and the remaining study had arms which included behavioural support and arms which included self-help therapy. Neither reduction or abrupt quitting had superior abstinence rates when all the studies were combined in the main analysis (RR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.79 to 1.13), whether pharmacotherapy was used (RR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.65 to 1.22), or not (RR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.78 to 1.21), whether studies included behavioural support (RR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.64 to 1.17) or self-help therapy (RR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.78 to1.23). We were unable to draw conclusions about the difference in adverse events between interventions, however recent studies suggest that pre-quit NRT does not increase adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Reducing cigarettes smoked before quit day and quitting abruptly, with no prior reduction, produced comparable quit rates, therefore patients can be given the choice to quit in either of these ways. Reduction interventions can be carried out using self-help materials or aided by behavioural support, and can be carried out with the aid of pre-quit NRT. Further research needs to investigate which method of reduction before quitting is the most effective, and which categories of smokers benefit the most from each method, to inform future policy and intervention development.

### Efficacy and safety of varenicline for smoking cessation in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial [^115qidMj]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseaseand is highly prevalent among patients with type 2 diabetes. It is not surprising that smoking exacerbates the combined harmful effects of hyperglycemia and other risk factors, accelerating vascular damage in patients with diabetes. Increased risk of total mortality, coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease has been observed in smokers with diabetes compared with nonsmokers with diabetes. Consistent with these observations is that stopping smoking has been associated with reduced mortality risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, patients with type 2 diabetes who participated in smoking cessation programs were found to have better glycemic control and lower cardiometabolic risk factors. Therefore, counseling on quitting smoking and treatment of tobacco addiction should be components of routine diabetes care.

Behavioral counseling and smoking cessation medications are generally combined in efforts to help people quit smoking. Consideration of smoking cessation methods should include the individual circumstances and underlying diseases of the smoker. High-quality evidence supports the benefits of individually delivered smoking cessation counseling, and combining smoking cessation medications with counseling can substantially reduce smoking rates. Nonetheless, the evidence for efficacious smoking cessation interventions in patients with diabetes is limited.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have indicated that varenicline is more efficacious for smoking cessation than placebo, bupropion, or nicotine replacement therapy. Varenicline has been shown to be efficacious also in smokers with cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or depressive disorders. The efficacy and safety of varenicline in smokers with diabetes have not been extensively studied, however. A retrospective pooled analysis of 15 RCTs including 323 smokers with type 2 diabetes found that varenicline was efficacious for these patients and had a safety profile that was similar to that for smokers without diabetes.

Smokers with diabetes may differ from other smokers regarding not only risks but also reasons for smoking and motivations to quit. Evidence suggests that they are less motivated to quit than other smokers, possibly because they fear weight gain. When assisting patients with diabetes in quitting smoking, health care professionals should closely monitor metabolic parameters and not assume that these parameters will improve. In particular, prevention of weight gain after smoking cessation must be considered a top priority because of its detrimental implications for several metabolic parameters and diabetic control. For example, Lycett et alfound among 3131 adult smokers with type 2 diabetes who quit smoking, an increase in hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) level within the first year after quitting.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^1114WWMc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Combination versus single form

See Table 1. Pooled data from 16 studies found greater quit rates following combination NRT treatment when compared to single‐type NRT for smoking cessation (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.37; I² = 12%; 16 studies, 12,169 participants; Analysis 4.1). When split into subgroups, this was equally true for combination therapy compared to: (1) patch alone (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.37; I² = 28%; 13 studies, 9522 participants); (2) a fast‐acting form of NRT alone (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.54; I² = 0%; 6 studies, 2364 participants); (3) a choice of a single form of NRT (patch or fast‐acting NRT; RR 5.16, 95% CI 1.18 to 22.6; 1 study, 253 participants). There was no clear evidence of subgroup differences (I² = 45.8%, P = 0.16, effect consistent across groups). Results were not sensitive to removing studies at a high risk of bias.

### Diminishing benefit of smoking cessation medications during the first year: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111LuH7L]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

The second reason for confusion is the nearly exclusive use of the relative risk (RR) (the ratio of the probability of success in intervention versus control groups) or odds ratio (OR) (the ratio of the odds of success in intervention versus control groups) to describe intervention effects. These measures have been shown to be stable over time and settings in smoking cessation 24, 25. However, like all summary measures, they provide only partial information. An RR of 2 indicates that medication doubles the probability of quitting; it could equally well describe an intervention group quit rate of 2% and a control group quit rate of 1% or an intervention quit rate of 80% and a control quit rate of 40%. These represent vastly different scenarios in terms of benefit to individuals or populations. The risk difference (RD), another important summary measure, overcomes this problem: it presents differences in probabilities of success between intervention and control groups, allowing consideration of the magnitude of benefit. The corresponding RDs for our examples are 1 and 40%, respectively. However, the RD is used far less often than the RR or the OR. Cochrane Reviews generally present RRs in the results of smoking cessation medication reviews 6, 7, 8, while NICE 9 and others 10, 11, 12, 13 present ORs. The European guideline on cardiovascular disease prevention describes relative benefit based on the OR: 'Overall, NRT and bupropion help ∼80% more people to quit than placebo' (26, p. 92). Information on the percentage of people who benefit from treatment is often absent 26 or unclear 7, 8.

In this study, we assessed effects and changes in effects of cessation medication over time from published RCTs, with several complementary measures. Using studies included in Cochrane Collaboration Systematic Reviews, we present quit rates, RRs, RDs, and ORs from RCTs of first‐line smoking cessation medications at three time‐points (3, 6 and 12 months), and test whether benefits decreased over time.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111SgGRu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Terminology — preferred language and medication categories for tobacco-dependence care are specified as follows: the terms treatment of tobacco dependence and treatment encompass clinician evaluation and management, whereas cessation, quit, and abstinence refer to outcomes; pharmacotherapy denotes the tools to achieve clinical objectives, with terms such as pharmacologic supports, quit-smoking medications, and cessation aids avoided; the term treatment team emphasizes an integrated, multidisciplinary approach; the dichotomous terms success and failure are avoided in favor of a continuum of control over compulsion from uncontrolled to controlled; and medications are characterized as controllers or relievers, with controller medications expected to have a delayed onset that reduces the frequency and intensity of the impulse to smoke.

### Combining default choices and an encounter decision aid to improve tobacco cessation in primary care patients: a pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial [^114nmn9u]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous research has suggested that presenting smoking cessation counselling, treatment, and referralas the default choice convincingly increases uptake and may improve tobacco cessation. However, interventions to date have been limited to hospitalized patients and pregnant women; implementation of such an approach in primary care could have an even bigger impact given the frequency of contacts with current smokers. Motivation to quit is not a predictor of patients' openness to discuss treatments or quit success after controlling for nicotine dependence. A promising alternative would be to discuss smoking cessation with all current smokers, reserving brief interventions for those who refuse a discussion and motivational interviewing for those who express ambivalence.

A potential downside of this approach is a resurgence of medical paternalism and a failure to involve patients in a sensitive decision. Explicitly involving patients with a decision aid (DA) could offset that effect and improve patient involvement. DAs are "designed to help patients make specific and deliberate choices from among healthcare options; they are intended to supplement (rather than replace) clinicians' counseling about options". They improve patient knowledge, participation in decision-making, and congruency between informed values and care choices compared to usual care, and are typically used either to prepare for a clinician consultation or during the consultation (encounter DAs).DAs can also increase provider knowledge and focus discussions; PCPs often cite lack of time and insufficient experience prescribing smoking cessation medications as barriers to treating tobacco use.

Few studies have evaluated DAs for smoking cessation, with a trend towards an increase in quit attempts. Two studies evaluated encounter DAs, including one randomized trial of 130 patients scheduled for elective surgery. The DA improved decision quality but not behavior; however that DA focused on the decision whether to quit and not treatments. We created an encounter DA comparing smoking cessation treatments, and observed anecdotally that it provided an acceptable means of presenting treatment options to smokers regardless of their level of motivation.

Given the potential of default choices to increase the number of discussions about smoking cessation and of the DA to augment patient involvement, we thought their use together could trigger more quit attempts and facilitate the prescription of smoking cessation aids, resulting in higher rates of tobacco abstinence at 6-months follow-up. The aim of this trial was thus to assess the effect of training PCPs to offer smoking cessation treatments as the default choice using an encounter DA.

### Health-care interventions to promote and assist tobacco cessation: a review of efficacy, effectiveness and affordability for use in national guideline development [^111wPdr5]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

Results

The efficacy, effectiveness and affordability of the major categories of intervention are presented in this section, with the behavioural interventions considered first and then the pharmacological interventions. Within each of these categories, we consider the interventions in approximate order in which effectiveness was first established by Cochrane reviews. Table 1 summarizes the main conclusions concerning efficacy while Table 2 shows assessments of affordability.

Table 1
Efficacy of health‐care smoking cessation interventions from Cochrane reviews.

Table 2
Affordability a of health‐care smoking cessation interventions.

With regard to efficacy statements, some interventions use active comparators as the control condition. For example, face‐to‐face support usually uses brief advice as a comparator which would, in itself, be expected to have an effect. This means that the total effect of some interventions will be underestimated. Therefore, Table 1 also shows a projected estimate of the total effect size of the interventions. To be conservative, the affordability estimates use the lower figure, but users can enter the total effect size estimate in the affordability calculator if they wish.

Some interventions would be expected to combine in terms of effectiveness. For example, combining medication to behavioural support is expected to produce an approximately additive effect.

Behavioural interventions

Brief advice

Brief opportunistic advice involves a health‐care worker raising the topic of smoking with a patient, advising the patient to stop and/or offering support and follow‐up. It would normally be expected to take no more than 20 minutes and most of the interventions evaluated took considerably less time than this (usually approximately 5 minutes).

Efficacy

When given by a physician to unselected smokers attending a consultation for a medical condition, brief smoking cessation advice has been found in multiple RCTs to increase 6–12‐month continuous abstinence rates by an average of 2 percentage points [95% confidence interval (CI) = 2–3] compared with doing nothing or usual care, with an advantage for more intensive compared with minimal advice (> 20 minutes) (see Table 1) 30. Evidence for efficacy of brief opportunistic advice to stop by other health‐care workers is suggestive rather than conclusive 31, 32.

There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the efficacy of brief opportunistic health‐care worker advice to promote cessation of use of tobacco products other than cigarettes.

### Bupropion hydrochloride — Bupropion hydrochloride — sr [^117TTevX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Individualization of Therapy

Patients are more likely to quit smoking and remain abstinent if they are seen frequently and receive support from their physicians or other healthcare professionals. It is important to ensure that patients read the instructions provided to them and have their questions answered. Physicians should review the patient's overall smoking cessation program that includes treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR). Patients should be advised of the importance of participating in the behavioral interventions, counseling, and/or support services to be used in conjunction with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) [see Medication Guide].

Patients who fail to quit smoking during an attempt may benefit from interventions to improve their chances for success on subsequent attempts. Patients who are unsuccessful should be evaluated to determine why they failed. A new quit attempt should be encouraged when factors that contributed to failure can be eliminated or reduced, and conditions are more favorable.

2.4 Maintenance

Tobacco dependence is a chronic condition. Some patients may need on-going treatment. Whether to continue treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) for periods longer than 12 weeks for smoking cessation must be determined for individual patients.

2.5 Combination Treatment with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets (SR) and a Nicotine Transdermal System (NTS)

Combination treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) and NTS may be prescribed for smoking cessation. The prescriber should review the complete prescribing information for both bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) and NTS before using combination treatment [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Monitoring for treatment-emergent hypertension in patients treated with the combination of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) and NTS is recommended.

2.6 Dose Adjustment in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

In patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 7 to 15), the maximum dose should not exceed 150 mg every other day. In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 5 to 6), consider reducing the dose and/or frequency of dosing [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Pharmacological and electronic cigarette interventions for smoking cessation in adults: component network meta-analyses [^116xBDMc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Tobacco smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disease worldwide. Stopping smoking can reduce this harm and many people would like to stop. There are a number of medicines licenced to help people quit globally, and e‐cigarettes are used for this purpose in many countries. Typically treatments work by reducing cravings to smoke, thus aiding initial abstinence and preventing relapse. More information on comparative effects of these treatments is needed to inform treatment decisions and policies.

Objectives

To investigate the comparative benefits, harms and tolerability of different smoking cessation pharmacotherapies and e‐cigarettes, when used to help people stop smoking tobacco.

Search methods

We identified studies from recent updates of Cochrane Reviews investigating our interventions of interest. We updated the searches for each review using the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group (TAG) specialised register to 29 April 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs and factorial RCTs, which measured smoking cessation at six months or longer, recruited adults who smoked combustible cigarettes at enrolment (excluding pregnant people) and randomised them to approved pharmacotherapies and technologies used for smoking cessation worldwide (varenicline, cytisine, nortriptyline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and e‐cigarettes) versus no pharmacological intervention, placebo (control) or another approved pharmacotherapy. Studies providing co‐interventions (e.g. behavioural support) were eligible if the co‐intervention was provided equally to study arms.

Data collection and analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening, data extraction and risk of bias (RoB) assessment (using the RoB 1 tool). Primary outcome measures were smoking cessation at six months or longer, and the number of people reporting serious adverse events (SAEs). We also measured withdrawals due to treatment. We used Bayesian component network meta‐analyses (cNMA) to examine intervention type, delivery mode, dose, duration, timing in relation to quit day and tapering of nicotine dose, using odds ratios (OR) and 95% credibility intervals (CrIs). We calculated an effect estimate for combination NRT using an additive model. We evaluated the influence of population and study characteristics, provision of behavioural support and control arm rates using meta‐regression. We evaluated certainty using GRADE.

Main results

Of our 332 eligible RCTs, 319 (835 study arms, 157,179 participants) provided sufficient data to be included in our cNMA. Of these, we judged 51 to be at low risk of bias overall, 104 at high risk and 164 at unclear risk, and 118 reported pharmaceutical or e‐cigarette/tobacco industry funding. Removing studies at high risk of bias did not change our interpretation of the results.

Benefits

We found high‐certainty evidence that nicotine e‐cigarettes (OR 2.37, 95% CrI 1.73 to 3.24; 16 RCTs, 3828 participants), varenicline (OR 2.33, 95% CrI 2.02 to 2.68; 67 RCTs, 16,430 participants) and cytisine (OR 2.21, 95% CrI 1.66 to 2.97; 7 RCTs, 3848 participants) were associated with higher quit rates than control. In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional eight (95% CrI 4 to 13), eight (95% CrI 6 to 10) and seven additional quitters per 100 (95% CrI 4 to 12), respectively. These interventions appeared to be more effective than the other interventions apart from combination NRT (patch and a fast‐acting form of NRT), which had a lower point estimate (calculated additive effect) but overlapping 95% CrIs (OR 1.93, 95% CrI 1.61 to 2.34). There was also high‐certainty evidence that nicotine patch alone (OR 1.37, 95% CrI 1.20 to 1.56; 105 RCTs, 37,319 participants), fast‐acting NRT alone (OR 1.41, 95% CrI 1.29 to 1.55; 120 RCTs, 31,756 participants) and bupropion (OR 1.43, 95% CrI 1.26 to 1.62; 71 RCTs, 14,759 participants) were more effective than control, resulting in two (95% CrI 1 to 3), three (95% CrI 2 to 3) and three (95% CrI 2 to 4) additional quitters per 100 respectively.

Nortriptyline is probably associated with higher quit rates than control (OR 1.35, 95% CrI 1.02 to 1.81; 10 RCTs, 1290 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), resulting in two (CrI 0 to 5) additional quitters per 100. Non‐nicotine/placebo e‐cigarettes (OR 1.16, 95% CrI 0.74 to 1.80; 8 RCTs, 1094 participants; low‐certainty evidence), equating to one additional quitter (95% CrI ‐2 to 5), had point estimates favouring the intervention over control, but CrIs encompassed the potential for no difference and harm. There was low‐certainty evidence that tapering the dose of NRT prior to stopping treatment may improve effectiveness; however, 95% CrIs also incorporated the null (OR 1.14, 95% CrI 1.00 to 1.29; 111 RCTs, 33,156 participants). This might lead to an additional one quitter per 100 (95% CrI 0 to 2).

Harms

There were insufficient data to include nortriptyline and non‐nicotine EC in the final SAE model. Overall rates of SAEs for the remaining treatments were low (average 3%). Low‐certainty evidence did not show a clear difference in the number of people reporting SAEs for nicotine e‐cigarettes, varenicline, cytisine or NRT when compared to no pharmacotherapy/e‐cigarettes or placebo. Bupropion may slightly increase rates of SAEs, although the CrI also incorporated no difference (moderate certainty). In absolute terms bupropion may cause one more person in 100 to experience an SAE (95% CrI 0 to 2).

Authors' conclusions

The most effective interventions were nicotine e‐cigarettes, varenicline and cytisine (all high certainty), as well as combination NRT (additive effect, certainty not rated). There was also high‐certainty evidence for the effectiveness of nicotine patch, fast‐acting NRT and bupropion. Less certain evidence of benefit was present for nortriptyline (moderate certainty), non‐nicotine e‐cigarettes and tapering of nicotine dose (both low certainty).

There was moderate‐certainty evidence that bupropion may slightly increase the frequency of SAEs, although there was also the possibility of no increased risk. There was no clear evidence that any other tested interventions increased SAEs. Overall, SAE data were sparse with very low numbers of SAEs, and so further evidence may change our interpretation and certainty.

Future studies should report SAEs to strengthen certainty in this outcome. More head‐to‐head comparisons of the most effective interventions are needed, as are tests of combinations of these. Future work should unify data from behavioural and pharmacological interventions to inform approaches to combined support for smoking cessation.

### Health-care interventions to promote and assist tobacco cessation: a review of efficacy, effectiveness and affordability for use in national guideline development [^111Ex6JS]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

In the case of some interventions the target population may be all smokers coming into contact with a clinical service, whereas in others it may be smokers who are willing to use a particular method to help them in a quit attempt. Evidence from high‐income countries suggests that, even where they are widely available, only about 5% of smokers currently use face‐to‐face behavioural interventions to help them stop, but more than 30% may use a medication such as nicotine replacement therapy, which they can buy from a shop or pharmacy 22, 23.

The key efficacy statements in this review take the following form:
When given to [population category], [intervention category] has been found in multiple (≥ 2) RCTs to increase 6–12‐month abstinence rates by [range of values] compared with [comparator].

Effectiveness judgements

For internationally applicable statements of effectiveness, it is important to recognize that the implementation of the intervention, the intervention provider and population of tobacco users may differ widely. For example, evidence on physician advice may or may not generalize to advice from other types of health‐care worker, and the effectiveness of a given type of health‐care worker may vary across cultures. Therefore, it is necessary to form judgements about probable transferability on the basis of inference and whatever relevant evidence is available.

A review was conducted using PubMed and Web of Science of studies of effectiveness of the interventions covered by the efficacy review. The initial search was conducted using labels to identify the intervention (e.g. 'brief advice', 'counselling', 'behavioural support', 'telephone', 'nicotine replacement therapy', 'varenicline', 'bupropion', 'self‐help', 'internet', 'text messaging') combined with 'smoking cessation' or 'tobacco cessation'. Studies were included if they were RCTs that could provide information about the generalizability of the RCTs in the Cochrane reviews or where they were observational studies that estimated the incremental cessation rates in samples using the intervention, taking account of important confounding variables such as severity of dependence on tobacco 24. Judgements about real‐world effectiveness were made by consensus among the authors based on the efficacy findings supplemented by this additional information and analysis. The consensus process involved drafting propositions and going through an iterative process of re‐drafting until all the members of the authorship team and international advisory panel agreed.

### Varenicline [^113kieYd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide)

 Initiate Treatment and Continue to Attempt to Quit if Lapse

Instruct patients to set a date to quit smoking and to initiate varenicline tablets treatment one week before the quit date. Alternatively, the patient can begin varenicline tablets dosing and then set a date to quit smoking between days 8 and 35 of treatment. Encourage patients to continue to attempt to quit if they have early lapses after quit day [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

For patients who are sure that they are not able or willing to quit abruptly, a gradual approach to quitting smoking with varenicline tablets may be considered. Patients should begin varenicline tablets dosing and reduce smoking during the first 12 weeks of treatment, then quit by the end of that period and continue treatment for an additional 12 weeks for a total of 24 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Encourage patients who are motivated to quit and who did not succeed in stopping smoking during prior varenicline tablets therapy for reasons other than intolerability due to adverse events, or who relapsed after treatment to make another attempt with varenicline tablets once factors contributing to the failed attempt have been identified and addressed [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Studies (14.6)].

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111nrKuW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management — smoking cessation evidence and research needs indicate that stopping smoking increases life expectancy, with those who stop at 30, 40, or 50 years of age gaining about 10, 9, and 6 years of life expectancy, respectively, compared with those who continue smoking. Smoking cessation reduces the rate of decline of lung function in patients with COPD and is an important goal of treating smokers with COPD. Communicating spirometry results as a smoker's "lung age" improved the likelihood of smoking cessation, but data are conflicting, with higher quit rates reported when spirometry identified COPD and another study showing that confronting smokers with abnormal spirometry results did not improve smoking cessation rates. Smokers with COPD appear to be just as responsive as smokers without COPD to pharmacotherapy directed at smoking cessation, and depression negatively impacts smoking cessation whereas cardiovascular disease does not. Pharmacologic aids can be allocated into controllers (e.g., nicotine patch, bupropion, varenicline) targeting long-term abstinence and relievers (e.g., nicotine gum) for rapid relief of acute cravings; controllers are taken on a regular schedule and relievers are used on an as-needed basis, although outcomes for this strategy have not been studied in controlled trials. Pharmacologic therapy with two controller agents also can be considered and is recommended by some guidelines due to improved efficacy compared with single agents, but the optimal combination of agents and the duration of therapy remain unknown. The combination of pharmacotherapy plus counseling improves smoking cessation compared with either alone, yet the optimal intensity of counseling is unknown; in one study the intensity of counseling related to improvement in the quit rate, whereas another study found no differences between low- or high-intensity counseling in addition to pharmacotherapy. Regarding electronic cigarettes, additional research has become an urgent need because the presumed benefits are unproven and the long-term risks are unknown.

### Antidepressants for smoking cessation [^1168F1UB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

There are two reasons to believe antidepressants might help in smoking cessation. First, depression may be a symptom of nicotine withdrawal, and smoking cessation sometimes precipitates depression. Second, nicotine may have antidepressant effects that maintain smoking for some smokers. Antidepressants may substitute for this effect.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of antidepressant medications in aiding long term smoking cessation. The drugs include bupropion; doxepin; fluoxetine; imipramine; moclobemide; nortriptyline; paroxetine; selegiline; sertraline, tryptophan and venlafaxine.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register which includes trials indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciSearch and PsycLIT, and other reviews and meeting abstracts, in September 2001.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomized trials comparing antidepressant drugs to placebo or an alternative therapeutic control for smoking cessation. We excluded trials with less than 6 months follow-up.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of study population, the nature of the drug therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomisation, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up in patients smoking at baseline. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effects model.

Main Results

There was one trial each of moclobemide, sertraline and venlafaxine, two of fluoxetine and nortriptyline, and five trials of bupropion, one of which tested long term use to prevent relapse. Nortriptyline and bupropion both increased cessation. In one trial the combination of bupropion and nicotine patch produced slightly higher quit rates than patch alone.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Some antidepressants (bupropion and nortriptyline) can aid smoking cessation. It is not clear whether these effects are specific for individual drugs, or would occur with any antidepressant.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113yUNFJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Foundations of Tobacco-Dependence Treatment — All patients should be screened for tobacco use, and the potential diagnosis of tobacco dependence should be assessed. The diagnosis of tobacco dependence, as well as the toxic effects of tobacco exposure, should be incorporated into the patient's problem list. Simply encouraging patients to stop smoking is insufficient. All patients who use tobacco should be provided with evidence-based treatment, including pharmacotherapy, to help them stop. Tobacco-dependence interventions require longitudinal follow-up, akin to the longitudinal evaluation and management of other chronic illnesses.

### Treating tobacco use and dependence: 2008 update [^111tXRcg]. USPHS (2008). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for tobacco use, more specifically with respect to pharmacotherapy, nicotine replacement therapy, USPHS 2008 guidelines recommend to consider offering the following combinations of first-line pharmacotherapy in patients willing to quit:

- long-term (> 14 weeks) nicotine patch and other nicotine replacement therapy (gum and spray)

- nicotine patch and nicotine inhaler

- nicotine patch and sustained-release bupropion.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^116vjfFV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to replace nicotine from cigarettes to ease the transition from cigarette smoking to abstinence. It works by reducing the intensity of craving and withdrawal symptoms. Although there is clear evidence that NRT used after smoking cessation is effective, it is unclear whether higher doses, longer durations of treatment, or using NRT before cessation add to its effectiveness.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long-term smoking cessation, compared to one another.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register, and trial registries for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search: April 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded trials that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up less than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Trials comparing NRT to control, and trials comparing NRT to other pharmacotherapies, are covered elsewhere.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. Smoking abstinence was measured after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and study withdrawals due to treatment. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome for each study, where possible. We grouped eligible studies according to the type of comparison. We carried out meta-analyses where appropriate, using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We identified 63 trials with 41,509 participants. Most recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. People enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day. We judged 24 of the 63 studies to be at high risk of bias, but restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results, apart from in the case of the preloading comparison. There is high-certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast-acting form + patch) results in higher long-term quit rates than single form (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.36, 14 studies, 11,356 participants; I² = 4%). Moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg are as effective as 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29, 5 studies, 1655 participants; I² = 38%), and that 21 mg are more effective than 14 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08, 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence (again limited by imprecision) also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16-hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41, 3 studies, 3446 participants; I² = 0%). Five studies comparing 4 mg gum to 2 mg gum found a benefit of the higher dose (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.83, 5 studies, 856 participants; I² = 63%); however, results of a subgroup analysis suggest that only smokers who are highly dependent may benefit. Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward; there was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44, 9 studies, 4395 participants; I² = 0%). High-certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast-acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar long-term quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05, 8 studies, 3319 participants; I² = 0%). We found no evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low-certainty evidence); 16-hour versus 24-hour daily patch use; duration of combination NRT use (low- and very low-certainty evidence); tapering of patch dose versus abrupt patch cessation; fast-acting NRT type (very low-certainty evidence); duration of nicotine gum use; ad lib versus fixed dosing of fast-acting NRT; free versus purchased NRT; length of provision of free NRT; ceasing versus continuing patch use on lapse; and participant- versus clinician-selected NRT. However, in most cases these findings are based on very low- or low-certainty evidence, and are the findings from single studies. AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low- or very low-certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no evidence of an effect on cardiac AEs, SAEs or withdrawals. Rates of these were low overall. Significantly more withdrawals due to treatment were reported in participants using nasal spray in comparison to patch in one trial (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 10.46, 922 participants; very low certainty) and in participants using 42/44 mg patches in comparison to 21/22 mg patches across two trials (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50, 2 studies, 544 participants; I² = 0%; low certainty).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single-form NRT, and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum, can increase the chances of successfully stopping smoking. For patch dose comparisons, evidence was of moderate certainty, due to imprecision. Twenty-one mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than 14 mg (24-hour) patches, and using 25 mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than using 15 mg (16-hour) patches, although in the latter case the CI included one. There was no clear evidence of superiority for 42/44 mg over 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches. Using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate-certainty evidence that using NRT prior to quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is of low and very low certainty. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are both measured and reported.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^113yS88W]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Preloading pharmacotherapy and gradual reduction strategies for smokers not ready to quit: Medication preloading involves starting pharmacotherapy while the smoker is still smoking to reduce satisfaction from smoking, reduce the number of cigarettes smoked per day, and enhance the likelihood of subsequent quitting; clinical trials of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) preloading have had mixed results, and separate trials of NRT and varenicline with a flexible quit date have been promising, enabling prescription for smokers not ready to set a quit date. For gradual reduction, a meta-analysis of gradual reduction versus abrupt quitting found similar quit rates, and a randomized trial found that abruptly quitting versus reducing cigarette smoking for 2 weeks prior to quitting was more effective. In contrast, varenicline-assisted gradual reduction over 3 months before the quit date enhanced quit rates over placebo in smokers who were not ready to quit in the next 30 days.

### Antidepressants for smoking cessation [^115dpWYy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

There at least two reasons to believe antidepressants might help in smoking cessation. Depression may be a symptom of nicotine withdrawal, and smoking cessation sometimes precipitates depression. In some individuals, nicotine may have antidepressant effects that maintain smoking. Antidepressants may substitute for this effect.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to assess the effect of antidepressant medications in aiding long-term smoking cessation. The drugs include bupropion; doxepin; fluoxetine; imipramine; moclobemide; nortriptyline; paroxetine; selegiline; sertraline, tryptophan and venlafaxine.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register which includes trials indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciSearch and PsycINFO, and other reviews and meeting abstracts, in December 2002.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomized trials comparing antidepressant drugs to placebo or an alternative therapeutic control for smoking cessation. For the meta-analysis, we excluded trials with less than six months follow-up.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of study population, the nature of the drug therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up in patients smoking at baseline, expressed as an odds ratio (OR). We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effects model.

Main Results

There was one trial each of moclobemide, sertraline and venlafaxine, two of fluoxetine, five of nortriptyline, and twenty trials of bupropion. In the bupropion trials, 18 had a placebo arm, two of which tested long-term use to prevent relapse. Nine of the bupropion trials have been published in full. Nortriptyline (five trials, OR 2.80, 95% CI 1.81–4.32) and bupropion (16 trials, OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.67–2.34) both increased the odds of cessation. In one trial the combination of bupropion and nicotine patch produced slightly higher quit rates than patch alone, but this was not replicated in a second study. Two trials of extended therapy with bupropion to prevent relapse after initial cessation have failed to detect a long-term benefit.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The antidepressants bupropion and nortriptyline can aid smoking cessation but selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine) do not.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^116hkRXf]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Tobacco cessation — evidence overview and scope: Table 8 summarizes recommended behavioral interventions and pharmacotherapy for tobacco treatment, noting there are 7 FDA-approved cessation medications, including 5 forms of nicotine replacement, and that the black box warnings about neuropsychiatric events have been removed by the FDA. The net benefit of FDA-approved tobacco-cessation pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions (even just 3 minutes of practical advice), alone or combined, in nonpregnant adults (≥ 18 years of age) who smoke is substantial. In pregnant women who smoke, the net benefit of behavioral interventions on perinatal outcomes and smoking abstinence is substantial, whereas evidence on pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation in pregnant women is insufficient and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.

### Varenicline tartrate (varenicline) [^1129MTnJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide)

Initiate Treatment and Continue to Attempt to Quit if Lapse

Instruct patients to set a date to quit smoking and to initiate varenicline treatment one week before the quit date. Alternatively, the patient can begin varenicline dosing and then set a date to quit smoking between days 8 and 35 of treatment. Encourage patients to continue to attempt to quit if they have early lapses after quit day [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

For patients who are sure that they are not able or willing to quit abruptly, a gradual approach to quitting smoking with varenicline may be considered. Patients should begin varenicline dosing and reduce smoking during the first 12 weeks of treatment, then quit by the end of that period and continue treatment for an additional 12 weeks for a total of 24 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Encourage patients who are motivated to quit and who did not succeed in stopping smoking during prior varenicline therapy for reasons other than intolerability due to adverse events, or who relapsed after treatment to make another attempt with varenicline once factors contributing to the failed attempt have been identified and addressed [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Studies (14.6)].

### Motivating and helping smokers to stop smoking [^111yBgHq]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Smokers try to quit only once every 2 to 3 years and most do not use proven treatments. Repeated, brief, diplomatic advice increases quit rates. Such advice should include a clear request to quit, reinforcing personal risks of smoking and their reversibility, offering solutions to barriers to quitting, and offering treatment. All smokers should be encouraged to use both medications and counseling. Scientifically proven, first-line medications are nicotine gum, inhaler, lozenge, and patch plus the nonnicotine medication bupropion. Proven second-line medications are clonidine, nicotine nasal spray, and nortriptyline. These medications are equally effective and safe and the incidence of dependence is very small. The proven psychosocial therapies are behavioral and supportive therapies. These are as effective as medications and are effective via individual counseling, group, and telephone formats. The writing of this article was supported in part by Senior Scientist Award DA-00450 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^117NWQvQ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Terminology

It is well established that nicotine addiction is a compulsive disorder, characterized not by insufficient motivation to stop but also by amplified unconscious motivation to continue the maladaptive behavior. Dependence is a chronic relapsing and remitting disease, requiring longitudinal management. For these reasons, several deliberate language choices were used during the production of this document:

- The terms treatment of tobacco dependence and treatment encompass the totality of evaluation and management services provided by clinicians, whereas the terms cessation, quit, and abstinence are limited to discussions of outcome.
- Pharmacotherapy is used to describe the general class of tools used to achieve clinical objectives. The more common terms pharmacologic supports, quit-smoking medications, and cessation aids are avoided to emphasize the clinicians' role in longitudinal management.
- Although we recognize the unique role of the prescriber in pharmacotherapeutic decision-making, we also recognize the importance of associated caregivers in achieving pharmacotherapeutic goals and addressing patient concerns. The term treatment team is used to emphasize the preference for an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to treatment.
- The dichotomous terms success and failure are not used, favoring instead the concept of a compulsion to smoke that exists on a therapeutic continuum from uncontrolled to controlled. Control over compulsion emphasizes the waxing and waning nature of therapeutic effects over time and highlights the need for longitudinal vigilance.
- Medications have been categorized as controllers or relievers on the basis of their pharmacokinetics. Controller medications are expected to have a delayed onset of effect, acting to reduce the frequency and intensity of the impulse to smoke, whereas reliever medications are expected to have more acute effects, useful in relieving the impact of cue-induced cravings.

Disclaimer

It is important to realize that guidelines cannot account for all potential clinical circumstances. This guideline is not intended to supplant clinician judgment, and its recommendations should not be considered mandates. For all recommendations, we have considered the balance of desirable and undesirable effects, certainty of evidence, patients' values and preferences, resources required, equity, acceptability, and feasibility. Clinicians are encouraged to apply the recommendations in the clinical context of each individual patient, particularly regarding the patient's values and preferences.

### Combination therapies for smoking cessation: a hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis [^115fpgJq]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Treatment guidelines recommend the use of combination therapies for smoking cessation, particularly behavioral therapy (BT) as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy. However, these guidelines rely on previous reviews with important limitations. This study's objective was to evaluate the efficacy of combination therapies compared with monotherapies, using the most rigorous data available.

Evidence Acquisition

A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of pharmacotherapies, BTs, or both were conducted. The Cochrane Library, Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases were systematically searched from inception to July 2015. Inclusion was restricted to RCTs reporting biochemically validated abstinence at 12 months. Direct and indirect comparisons were made in 2015 between therapies using hierarchical Bayesian models.

Evidence Synthesis

The search identified 123 RCTs meeting inclusion criteria (60,774 participants), and data from 115 (57,851 participants) were meta-analyzed. Varenicline with BT increased abstinence more than other combinations of a pharmacotherapy with BT (varenicline versus bupropion: OR = 1.56, 95% credible interval [CrI] = 1.07, 2.34; varenicline versus nicotine patch: OR = 1.65, 95% CrI = 1.10, 2.51; varenicline versus short-acting nicotine-replacement therapies: OR = 1.68, 95% CrI = 1.15, 2.53). Adding BT to any pharmacotherapy compared with pharmacotherapy alone was inconclusive, owing to wide CrIs (OR = 1.17, CrI = 0.60, 2.12). Nicotine patch with short-acting nicotine-replacement therapy appears safe and increases abstinence versus nicotine-replacement monotherapy (OR = 1.63, CrI = 1.06, 3.03). Data are limited concerning other pharmacotherapy combinations and their safety and tolerability.

Conclusions

Evidence suggests that combination therapy benefits may be less than previously thought. Combined with BT, varenicline increases abstinence more than other pharmacotherapy with BT combinations.

### Diminishing benefit of smoking cessation medications during the first year: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^11256MUT]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Net benefit still remained at the end of the study. Over all medications, one in five trial participants in the intervention arm was a sustained non‐smoker at the 12‐month end‐point, and benefit from medication at 12 months accrued to 8.2 of 100 participants in the treatment arms. Previous research has shown that quit rates continue to decline after the first year in the context of RCTs. A meta‐analysis of long‐term results from NRT trials showed that quit rates declined by 30% between 1 year and an average of 4.3 years 11. This suggests that our estimated net benefit of medication of 8.2% at the end of 1 year would decline further to less than 6% by 4 years. Because there may be some small continuing decline in quit rates beyond 4 years, 6% probably reflects the upper limit of long‐term medication benefit to smokers under ideal RCT conditions. Under real‐world conditions, the benefit of these medications is likely to be lower than in the context of trials, due to poorer adherence to treatment protocol and fewer patient/provider interactions in real‐world settings than in RCTs 36, 37, 38.

The decay of benefit found in this paper during the first year of treatment is important at both individual and population levels. At the individual level, providers would be well served by realistic expectations when prescribing medications: clinicians could plan from the outset to continue to intervene over time. Identification of the decline in benefit over time is also useful at the population level: it contributes to understanding of the lack of clear population‐level impact of smoking cessation medications in societies 21, 36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 and highlights the importance of relapse prevention at both clinical and societal levels.

### Quitting smoking among adults-United States, 2000–2015 [^114KZsfh]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Quitting cigarette smoking benefits smokers at any age (1). Individual, group, and telephone counseling and seven Food and Drug Administration-approved medications increase quit rates (1–3). To assess progress toward the Healthy People 2020 objectives of increasing the proportion of U.S. adults who attempt to quit smoking cigarettes to ≥ 80.0% (TU-4.1), and increasing recent smoking cessation success to ≥ 8.0% (TU-5.1), * CDC assessed national estimates of cessation behaviors among adults aged ≥ 18 years using data from the 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS). During 2015, 68.0% of adult smokers wanted to stop smoking, 55.4% made a past-year quit attempt, 7.4% recently quit smoking, 57.2% had been advised by a health professional to quit, and 31.2% used cessation counseling and/or medication when trying to quit. During 2000–2015, increases occurred in the proportion of smokers who reported a past-year quit attempt, recently quit smoking, were advised to quit by a health professional, and used cessation counseling and/or medication (p < 0.05). Throughout this period, fewer than one third of persons used evidence-based cessation methods when trying to quit smoking. As of 2015, 59.1% of adults who had ever smoked had quit. To further increase cessation, health care providers can consistently identify smokers, advise them to quit, and offer them cessation treatments (2–4). In addition, health insurers can increase cessation by covering and promoting evidence-based cessation treatments and removing barriers to treatment access (2,4–6).

### Smoking cessation by combined medication and counselling: a feasibility study in lung cancer patients [^113nLvZa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This prospective study evaluated a comprehensive smoking cessation program including pharmacotherapy in smokers with newly diagnosed lung cancer. Achieved smoking abstinence rate was 37.5% after 12 and 32.8% after 24 weeks and thus comparable to results in other patient groups or healthy subjects. A recent unblinded study randomly assigned 303 patients with newly diagnosed cancer to an intensive treatment group, with 11 smoking cessation telephone counselling sessions coupled with 12 weeks of free cessation medication or to standard therapy. The 7-day abstinence rates at 6-month were 35% in the intensive treatment versus 22% in the standard group. A study using only brief advice in cancer patients reported a biochemically validated quit rate at 6 months of 6%. When comparing these and other studies, it should be kept in mind that comparison is difficult because of diversities in enrolled patients, assessment of abstinence and intensity of the cessation intervention.

There is only limited evidence on smoking cessation in lung cancer patients. Previous studies were retrospective and included only a limited number of patients (15–49 patients). Importantly, side effects of pharmacotherapy were not systematically evaluated. Thus, a recent Cochrane review stated insufficient evidence for smoking cessation in patients with lung cancer mainly due to the limited number of patients with lung cancer included and the uncontrolled design.

Smoking abstinence was numerically higher in the varenicline group as compared to the nicotine replacement group, but this observational study was not designed to show differences between different forms of treatment. In persons trying to quit smoking varenicline is known to be more effective as compared to nicotine replacement therapy.

Most of the patients chose pharmacotherapy following smoking cessation counselling. Only six patients decided against any medication. Among these, most patients had already stopped smoking within the 4 weeks before enrollment into the study and the score of the Fagerström-test was lower than in the other patients, indicating lesser nicotine addiction. Thus, our study revealed that intense cessation counselling during hospitalization for diagnosis and subsequent treatment of lung cancer leads to a high proportion of patients using pharmacotherapy as an aid for smoking cessation. In a prospective, representative German survey of over 10.000 smokers, cessation attempts only 7.6% used nicotine replacement therapy and 0.4% used varenicline. A high proportion of patients using pharmacotherapy is important since this nearly doubles the success rate.

### National trends in cessation counseling, prescription medication use, and associated costs among US adult cigarette smokers [^115CkAcN]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States despite the considerable decrease in smoking prevalence since the release more than 50 years ago of the first US Surgeon General's report on the health implications of cigarette smoking. An estimated 480 0000 US residents die of smoking-related illnesses each year. Overall, smoking costs the nation at least $130 billion in medical care and more than $150 billion in lost productivity annually. Consequently, federally sponsored programs, like Medicare, and private health plans have an enormous economic burden. An estimated 60% of the US health care spending attributable to cigarette smoking is paid by public programs.

Smoking cessation substantially reduces smoking-related morbidity and mortality. When used separately or in combination, smoking cessation counseling and cessation pharmacotherapies are associated with higher cessation rates. Even brief cessation advice or counseling by health care professionals has been associated with effectiveness. Thus, clinical guidelines recommend that smoking cessation counseling be addressed at every clinical visit.

In the United States, 7 US Food and Drug Administration–approved smoking cessation pharmacotherapies are available, including 5 forms of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) as well as bupropion hydrochloride and varenicline tartrate. The NRTs are available over the counter (OTC), but the 2 non-NRT medications are prescription only. Although each of these agents is more efficacious than placebo in smoking cessation, clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated superior efficacy of prescription non-NRT, especially varenicline, as compared with OTC NRT. Thus, the 2018 American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on Tobacco Cessation Treatment guidelines recommend prescription varenicline as the first-line pharmacotherapeutic agent for smoking cessation. Nonetheless, data are lacking on trends in the uptake of prescription smoking cessation therapies, and their associated costs, among the general population of US adult smokers.

The objective of this study was to present the 10-year trends in physician advice to quit smoking and prescription smoking cessation medication use along with their associated total and out-of-pocket expenditures in a nationally representative sample of adult active smokers in the United States.

### How quit smoking medicines work… [^111JWi9b]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

How Quit Smoking Medicines Work How does Nicotine Replacement Therapy work.
- Nicotine Replacement Therapy works by replacing some of the nicotine you used to get from cigarettes, so you don't feel as uncomfortable after quitting.
- There are five different NRTs approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for quitting smoking.
- Nicotine is the active ingredient in all of them.
- Nicotine patches, gum, and lozenges are the most common quit-smoking medicines, and you can buy them without a prescription.
- NRTs supply nicotine without the hundreds of harmful chemicals that cigarette smoke contains.
- NRT helps lessen the uncomfortable feelings that come when you stop getting nicotine from cigarettes.
- When used as directed, most people get enough nicotine from NRT to avoid having overwhelming cravings and withdrawal symptoms.
- However, even using quit-smoking medicine you will likely still have some discomfort and urges to smoke.
- The good news is there are many ways you can get help dealing with these.
- Using the long-acting patch at the same time as a short-acting NRT, like the lozenge or gum, can help decrease withdrawal even more. Learn more about ways to use a combination of medicines. How do quit-smoking pills work. There are two quit-smoking medicines approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration that are pills: bupropion and varenicline. Bupropionhas many effects on the brain, including helping people quit smoking. It decreases craving and other nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Vareniclinehas two main effects:

- It mimics some of the effects that nicotine has on parts of your brain, reducing your urge to smoke and some withdrawal symptoms.
- It reduces the enjoyment you get from the nicotine in cigarettes. This can make it easier to quit and stay quit.

It does this by attaching strongly to the same parts of your brain that nicotine attaches to, but without stimulating them as strongly as nicotine. This means that nicotine from a cigarette has fewer places to attach because the varenicline is already there. In other words, varenicline makes it harder to get a nicotine "buzz".

### Diminishing benefit of smoking cessation medications during the first year: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116aEiVY]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Intent‐to‐treat (ITT) approach

We followed the assumption made by most investigators that individuals lost to follow‐up be considered continuing smokers 10, 28, 29. We found that this definition was not applied uniformly in the field: some researchers included only participants who received an initial dose of medication, or excluded participants for non‐compliance with protocol or other reasons. We applied a strict, uniform, ITT approach, using the following method: for all quit rates, the number randomized to treatment or control was the denominator. For numerators, the number of quitters was used if provided. Otherwise, if the authors had specified an ITT analysis, we back‐calculated the numerator based on the reported quit rate and the number randomized to the group and rounded to the nearest whole number. If a number other than the number randomized was reported as the denominator, we used that denominator to back‐calculate the numerator, rounded to the nearest whole number, and then divided by the number randomized to that group.

Comparisons

Some studies included more than two treatment groups. For 2 × 2 factorial designs that included a medical and a non‐medical (behavioural/ psychological) intervention, two separate comparisons were performed: one for the active non‐medical intervention and one for the inactive non‐medical intervention. In cases where high‐ and low‐dependent smoker subgroups were randomized separately to intervention and control arms, each subgroup was treated in the meta‐analysis as a separate study. In studies with multiple doses and a single control, participants assigned any non‐zero dose were combined into a single intervention group. For trials with multiple intervention arms which did not have a clear 2 × 2 design, we compared the two groups that were identical on all aspects of the intervention except for provision of medication. Information on included treatment groups is presented in Supporting information, Table S1.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was sustained abstinence (SA) from smoking. We used SA to denote any measure of long‐term abstinence including, but not restricted to, the terms 'sustained abstinence', 'prolonged abstinence' (PA) or 'continuous abstinence' (CA). We did not differentiate between whether slips were allowed or whether a grace period was allowed. The secondary outcome was point prevalence (PP) of smoking. Quit rates could be based on biochemical validation or self‐report. When both were available, the former were used. We also performed a sensitivity analysis including only biochemically validated SA quit rates.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114QZm4i]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline — initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults — formulated five strong recommendations and two conditional recommendations regarding pharmacotherapy choices. Strong recommendations include using varenicline rather than a nicotine patch, using varenicline rather than bupropion, using varenicline rather than a nicotine patch in adults with a comorbid psychiatric condition, initiating varenicline in adults even if they are unready to quit, and using controller therapy for an extended treatment duration greater than 12 weeks. Conditional recommendations include combining a nicotine patch with varenicline rather than using varenicline alone and using varenicline rather than electronic cigarettes. Seven recommendations are provided, which represent simple practice changes that are likely to increase the effectiveness of tobacco-dependence pharmacotherapy. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach was used to rate the certainty in the estimated effects and the strength of recommendations.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^115qVXdU]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

2018 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on tobacco cessation — team-based care and core clinical actions are specified as follows: The Decision Pathway recommends that clinicians and practices establish a team-based system of care that recognizes cigarette smoking as a chronic relapsing substance use disorder caused by addiction to nicotine, and the care team should ensure that patients are asked about cigarette smoking and other tobacco product use at all clinical encounters. Patients who use any tobacco product should receive clear advice to stop tobacco use and be offered a brief intervention that includes prescriptions for proven pharmacological smoking cessation aids and proactive connection to evidence-based behavioral support based in the healthcare system and/or the community. Former smokers, especially recent quitters, should be monitored closely for possible relapse back to smoking, and nonsmokers should routinely be asked about exposure to secondhand smoke and advised to avoid it.

### Behavioural interventions as adjuncts to pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation [^112Crsqf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Effective pharmacotherapies are available to help people who are trying to stop smoking, but quitting can still be difficult and providing higher levels of behavioural support may increase success rates further.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of increasing the intensity of behavioural support for people using smoking cessation medications, and to assess whether there are different effects depending on the type of pharmacotherapy, or the amount of support in each condition.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register in July 2012 for records with any mention of pharmacotherapy, including any type of NRT, bupropion, nortriptyline or varenicline that evaluated the addition of personal support or compared two or more intensities of behavioural support.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials in which all participants received pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation and conditions differed by the amount of behavioural support. Controls could receive less intensive personal contact, or just written information. We did not include studies that used a contact matched control to evaluate differences between types or components of support. We excluded trials recruiting only pregnant women, trials recruiting only adolescents, and trials with less than six months follow-up.

Data Collection and Analysis

Search results were prescreened by one author and inclusion or exclusion of potentially relevant trials was agreed by both authors. Data were extracted by one author and checked by the other. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

Thirty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria with over 15,000 participants in the relevant arms. There was very little evidence of statistical heterogeneity (I² = 3%) so all studies were pooled in the main analysis. There was evidence of a small but statistically significant benefit from more intensive support (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.24) for abstinence at longest follow-up. All but two of the included studies provided four or more sessions of support. Most trials used nicotine replacement therapy. Significant effects were not detected for studies where the pharmacotherapy was nortriptyline (two trials) or varenicline (one trial), but this reflects the absence of evidence. In subgroup analyses, studies that provided at least four sessions of personal contact for the intervention and no personal contact for the control had slightly larger effects (six trials, RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.45), as did studies where all intervention counselling was via telephone (six trials, RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.41). Weaker evidence for a benefit of providing additional behavioural support was seen in the trials where all participants, including those in the control condition, had at least 30 minutes of personal contact (18 trials, RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.25). None of the differences between subgroups were significant, and the last two subgroup analyses were not prespecified. No trials were judged at high risk of bias on any domain.

Authors' Conclusions

Providing behavioural support in person or via telephone for people using pharmacotherapy to stop smoking has a small but important effect. Increasing the amount of behavioural support is likely to increase the chance of success by about 10 to 25%, based on a pooled estimate from 38 trials. A subgroup analysis of a small number of trials suggests the benefit could be a little greater when the contrast is between a no contact control and a behavioural intervention that provides at least four sessions of contact. Subgroup analysis also suggests that there may be a smaller incremental benefit from providing even more intensive support via more or longer sessions over and above some personal contact.

Postcessation weight gain — prevalence, mitigation, and counseling — notes that about 80% of smokers gain an average of 3 to 6 kg in the first 3 months after quitting, yet this weight gain does not attenuate the cardiovascular (CV) benefits of tobacco abstinence. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) can help control or mitigate weight gain, and a Cochrane review found bupropion, NRT, and varenicline reduced postcessation weight change while the medication was being used, although these medications appear to delay rather than prevent weight gain. It is reasonable to advise patients not to replace cigarettes with food, to decrease high fat consumption, and to increase physical activity. Patients with an elevated body mass index who smoke should be advised to focus first on smoking cessation rather than weight loss; a "Maintain, Don't gain" approach can be recommended, and daily exercise should be strongly encouraged in line with guidance recommending adults achieve 30 minutes per day of brisk exercise on most days of the week.

### Nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^112HPYDn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to temporarily replace much of the nicotine from cigarettes to reduce motivation to smoke and nicotine withdrawal symptoms, thus easing the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence.

Objectives

The aims of this review were: To determine the effect of NRT compared to placebo in aiding smoking cessation, and to consider whether there is a difference in effect for the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, oral and nasal sprays, inhalers and tablets/lozenges) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes. To determine whether the effect is influenced by the dosage, form and timing of use of NRT; the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; or the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated. To determine whether combinations of NRT are more likely to lead to successful quitting than one type alone. To determine whether NRT is more or less likely to lead to successful quitting compared to other pharmacotherapies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning 'NRT' or any type of nicotine replacement therapy in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search July 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow-up of less than six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We identified 150 trials; 117 with over 50,000 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The risk ratio (RR) of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.60 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53 to 1.68). The pooled RRs for each type were 1.49 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.60, 55 trials) for nicotine gum; 1.64 (95% CI 1.52 to 1.78, 43 trials) for nicotine patch; 1.95 (95% CI 1.61 to 2.36, 6 trials) for oral tablets/lozenges; 1.90 (95% CI 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials) for nicotine inhaler; and 2.02 (95% CI 1.49 to 2.73, 4 trials) for nicotine nasal spray. One trial of oral spray had an RR of 2.48 (95% CI 1.24 to 4.94). The effects were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. The effect was similar in a small group of studies that aimed to assess use of NRT obtained without a prescription. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum, but weaker evidence of a benefit from higher doses of patch. There was evidence that combining a nicotine patch with a rapid delivery form of NRT was more effective than a single type of NRT (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.51, 9 trials). The RR for NRT used for a short period prior to the quit date was 1.18 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.40, 8 trials), just missing statistical significance, though the efficacy increased when we pooled only patch trials and when we removed one trial in which confounding was likely. Five studies directly compared NRT to a non-nicotine pharmacotherapy, bupropion; there was no evidence of a difference in efficacy (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.18). A combination of NRT and bupropion was more effective than bupropion alone (RR 1.24; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.45, 4 trials). Adverse effects from using NRT are related to the type of product, and include skin irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and tablets. There is no evidence that NRT increases the risk of heart attacks.

Authors' Conclusions

All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50 to 70%, regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.
