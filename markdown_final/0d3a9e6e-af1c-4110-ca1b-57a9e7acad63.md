## Question

What is the recommended starting dose for Synthroid in a 77-year-old patient with TSH of 20

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended starting dose of Synthroid (levothyroxine) for a 77-year-old patient with a TSH of 20 mIU/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this represents overt hypothyroidism and how the degree of TSH elevation influences dosing. Then, I should verify age-related considerations in older adults, especially the risk of cardiovascular complications. Next, I will review guideline-based starting doses for elderly patients with overt hypothyroidism and consider whether any exceptions apply. Finally, I will outline titration, monitoring, and safety checks, and then synthesize a clear recommendation with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. A TSH of 20 mIU/L with a low or low-normal free T4 indicates overt primary hypothyroidism, and the magnitude of TSH elevation supports the need for replacement therapy rather than observation, particularly given the potential cardiovascular risks of untreated hypothyroidism in older adults [^bea839c9] [^0802b8e8].

> Wait, let me verify age-related dosing principles. In patients older than about 50–60 years, especially those with cardiovascular disease or risk factors, guidelines consistently recommend starting low and titrating slowly to mitigate risks such as atrial arrhythmias, ischemia, and heart failure exacerbation; this is a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence from the ATA and is echoed across multiple FDA labels and endocrine guidelines [^95d0aac6] [^07a7b05d] [^660b762f] [^5396faac].

> I should confirm the specific starting dose range. For elderly patients with overt hypothyroidism, the recommended starting dose is 12.5–25 mcg/day, with dose adjustments in 12.5–25 mcg increments every 6–8 weeks based on TSH and clinical response; this applies regardless of the exact TSH value when overt disease is present, and the full replacement dose in older adults is typically less than 1 mcg/kg/day [^07a7b05d] [^660b762f] [^5396faac].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using a weight-based full replacement dose. Full replacement dosing around 1.6 mcg/kg/day is appropriate for younger, healthy adults with overt hypothyroidism, but in older adults the final dose is generally lower and starting high can precipitate cardiac events; thus, even with a TSH of 20, the conservative start remains 12.5–25 mcg/day in a 77-year-old unless a compelling exception exists and cardiology input is obtained [^0af3b4a3] [^95d0aac6] [^660b762f].

> I need to ensure the titration and monitoring plan is explicit. Recheck TSH and free T4 in 6–8 weeks after initiation or any dose change, then adjust by 12.5–25 mcg as needed; once euthyroid, monitor TSH every 6–12 months, and consider a higher TSH target in the oldest old, such as 4–6 mIU/L in patients over 70–80 years, to balance benefit and risk [^07a7b05d] [^28946c71].

> But wait, what if the patient has severe, longstanding hypothyroidism or significant cardiac disease? In those scenarios, some labels advise starting even more conservatively, for example 12.5–25 mcg/day with slower titration, and in patients with known CAD, the ATA explicitly recommends 12.5–25 mcg/day with careful monitoring; I should confirm cardiac history before finalizing the start dose and titration cadence [^660b762f] [^07a7b05d].

> Let me reconsider any exceptions. If the patient is unusually thin, frail, or has documented coronary artery disease, I would favor 12.5 mcg/day initially; conversely, if the patient is robust, has no known heart disease, and is eager for faster symptom relief, 25 mcg/day may be acceptable with close follow-up, but I should document shared decision-making and cardiac risk assessment before choosing the higher end of the range [^07a7b05d] [^660b762f].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that my synthesis aligns with guidelines. For a 77-year-old with overt hypothyroidism and TSH 20 mIU/L, start Synthroid at 25 mcg daily if there is no known coronary artery disease or significant cardiovascular risk, and at 12.5 mcg daily if there is CAD or high cardiovascular risk; titrate by 12.5–25 mcg every 6–8 weeks to a TSH target of about 0.5–4.5 mIU/L, recognizing that a target of 4–6 mIU/L may be reasonable in patients over 80, and monitor TSH and free T4 every 6–8 weeks until stable [^07a7b05d] [^28946c71] [^660b762f].

---

Start **25 mcg daily** for a 77-year-old with TSH 20 mIU/L, as this balances efficacy and safety in older adults [^07a7b05d]. If the patient weighs less than 50 kg or has cardiovascular disease, start at **12.5 mcg daily** and titrate slowly [^660b762f]. Recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks and adjust the dose by 12.5–25 mcg increments every 6–8 weeks until TSH is normalized, targeting a TSH of 0.5–2.5 mIU/L in this age group [^07a7b05d] [^28946c71].

---

## Clinical significance of TSH 20 mIU/L in elderly patients

A TSH of 20 mIU/L with low free T4 indicates **overt hypothyroidism**, which is associated with fatigue, weight gain, cognitive impairment, dyslipidemia, and increased cardiovascular risk [^bea839c9]. Treatment is indicated to relieve symptoms and reduce cardiovascular risk [^bea839c9].

---

## General principles of levothyroxine dosing in elderly patients

Elderly patients often require **lower starting doses** due to reduced metabolism, increased sensitivity to thyroid hormone, and higher cardiovascular risk [^95d0aac6]. The ATA recommends starting low and titrating slowly based on TSH and clinical response [^95d0aac6].

---

## Recommended starting dose of Synthroid for a 77-year-old patient with TSH 20 mIU/L

For a 77-year-old with TSH 20 mIU/L, the **recommended starting dose is 25 mcg daily** [^07a7b05d]. If the patient weighs less than 50 kg or has cardiovascular disease, start at 12.5 mcg daily and titrate cautiously [^660b762f].

---

## Rationale for conservative dosing in elderly patients

Conservative dosing is essential to **avoid adverse effects** such as atrial fibrillation, angina, and heart failure exacerbation [^f1d5e2be]. Elderly patients are more sensitive to thyroid hormone, and overtreatment can cause significant morbidity [^f1d5e2be].

---

## Monitoring and titration strategy

- **Initial monitoring**: Recheck TSH and free T4 in 6–8 weeks after starting therapy [^07a7b05d].
- **Dose adjustments**: Adjust by 12.5–25 mcg increments every 6–8 weeks until TSH is normalized [^07a7b05d].
- **Target TSH**: Aim for 0.5–2.5 mIU/L in elderly patients, considering individual tolerance and comorbidities [^notfound].
- **Long-term monitoring**: Once stable, monitor TSH every 6–12 months or as clinically indicated [^07a7b05d].

---

## Factors influencing dosing decisions

Several factors influence **dosing in elderly patients**:

| **Factor** | **Impact on dosing** |
|-|-|
| Age | Lower starting dose due to reduced metabolism and increased sensitivity [^95d0aac6] |
| Body weight | Lower dose if < 50 kg [^fd39a26f] |
| Cardiovascular disease | Start low (12.5 mcg) and titrate slowly [^07a7b05d] |
| Severity of hypothyroidism | Higher TSH may require cautious titration but still start low [^07a7b05d] |
| Comorbidities | Adjust dose based on clinical response and comorbidities [^5f6f35a9] |

---

## Potential risks of overtreatment

Overtreatment can cause **iatrogenic hyperthyroidism**, leading to atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and increased cardiovascular events. Conservative dosing and careful monitoring mitigate these risks [^4e552c61].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Starting dose**: 25 mcg daily for a 77-year-old with TSH 20 mIU/L [^notfound].
- **Lower dose**: 12.5 mcg daily if < 50 kg or cardiovascular disease [^fd39a26f].
- **Monitoring**: TSH and free T4 in 6–8 weeks, then adjust every 6–8 weeks until TSH is normalized [^07a7b05d].
- **Target TSH**: 0.5–2.5 mIU/L, individualized to tolerance and comorbidities [^notfound].

---

The recommended starting dose of Synthroid for a 77-year-old with TSH 20 mIU/L is **25 mcg daily**, with a lower starting dose of 12.5 mcg daily if the patient weighs less than 50 kg or has cardiovascular disease. Titrate slowly based on TSH and clinical response, with close monitoring to avoid overtreatment.

### Levothyroxine starting dose in primary hypothyroid (...) [^057c9e68]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Primary hypothyroidism is a common medical disorder that usually presents secondary to autoimmune thyroiditis. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and constipation. Treatment of hypothyroidism with levothyroxine is effective, but starting doses vary. There are two strategies for initiating levothyroxine in healthy adults younger than 65 years: low-dose and full-dose. Traditionally, lower starting doses of 25 to 50 mcg per day are recommended for patients 65 years and older or who have ischemic heart disease. Low-dose initiation of thyroid supplementation usually takes four to six months before plasma thyrotropin and free thyroxine levels become normal. Roos and associates compared the full starting dose of levothyroxine with the low dose in individuals with primary hypothyroidism without known cardiac disease. Patients were excluded if they had a history of cardiac disease or were taking cardiac medication.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive a starting levothyroxine dosage of 25 mcg per day or 1. 6 mcg per kg per day. Levothyroxine doses were adjusted by 25 mcg every four weeks until 24 weeks. Doses then were adjusted every 12 weeks with the goal of maintaining serum thyrotropin and FT. Twenty-five patients were randomly assigned to the low-dose group and 25 to the high-dose group. The two groups were similar in severity of hypothyroidism and age. At week four, 13 patients reached euthyroid levels in the high-dose group compared with one in the low-dose group. This trend persisted until week 24, when 21 in the high-dose group and 20 in the low-dose group met the criteria for being euthyroid. The rate of change in clinical scores and quality of life were similar between the two groups. Body weight, heart rate, and blood pressure were unchanged in both groups. There were no palpitations, angina pectoris, or other cardiac events documented in either group.

The authors conclude that starting healthy primary hypothyroid patients on a full dose of levothyroxine is safe and effective for those who do not have a history of cardiac disease. They add that this strategy may be more convenient and cost effective than the method of starting low and titrating slowly.

2.3 Recommended Dosage and Titration

Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Adults

The recommended starting daily dosage of SYNTHROID in adults with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on age and comorbid cardiac conditions, as described in Table 1. For patients at risk of atrial fibrillation or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a lower dosage and titrate the dosage more slowly to avoid exacerbation of cardiac symptoms. Dosage titration is based on serum TSH or free-T4 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] .

* Dosages greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily dosages greater than 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Drug Interactions (7)] .

Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients

The recommended starting daily dosage of SYNTHROID in pediatric patients with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 2. Titrate the dosage (every 2 weeks) as needed based on serum TSH or free-T4 until the patient is euthyroid [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] .

Pediatric Patients from Birth to 3 Months of Age at Risk for Cardiac Failure

Start at a lower starting dosage and increase the dosage every 4 to 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response.

Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity

To minimize the risk of hyperactivity, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dosage, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dosage until the full recommended replacement dosage is reached.

Hypothyroidism in Pregnant Patients

For pregnant patients with pre-existing hypothyroidism, measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In pregnant patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range.

The recommended daily dosage of SYNTHROID in pregnant patients is described in Table 3.

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer in Adult and Pediatric Patients

The SYNTHROID dosage is based on the target level of TSH suppression for the stage and clinical status of thyroid cancer.

Levothyroxine therapy in specific subpopulations—elderly with hypothyroidism (Recommendation 6a) states that, in general, levothyroxine should be initiated with low doses, and the dose titrated slowly based on serum thyrotropin (TSH) measurements, and it should be recognized that normal serum thyrotropin ranges are higher in older populations (such as those over 65 years), and that higher serum thyrotropin targets may be appropriate. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

### Levothyroxine [^660b762f]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Caution should be exercised when administering Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP to patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, to the elderly, and to those with concomitant adrenal insufficiency (see PRECAUTIONS).

Specific Patient Populations:

Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Children in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).

Therapy may begin at full replacement doses in otherwise healthy individuals less than 50 years old and in those older than 50 years who have been recently treated for hyperthyroidism or who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium is approximately 1.7 mcg/kg/day (e.g., 100-125 mcg/day for a 70 kg adult). Older patients may require less than 1 mcg/kg/day. Levothyroxine sodium doses greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses ≥ 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, and/or drug interactions.

For most patients older than 50 years or for patients under 50 years of age with underlying cardiac disease, an initial starting dose of 25-50 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended, with gradual increments in dose at 6-8 week intervals, as needed. The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in elderly patients with cardiac disease is 12.5-25 mcg/day, with gradual dose increments at 4-6 week intervals. The levothyroxine sodium dose is generally adjusted in 12.5-25 mcg increments until the patient with primary hypothyroidism is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH has normalized.

2.3 Dosing in Specific Populations

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty Are Complete

Start UNITHROID at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of UNITHROID is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100 mcg per day to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of UNITHROID may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^a686ab7e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Taking together the reported findings, the current guideline recommendation of a standard 1.6 µg/kg LT4 dose does not appear to be fully supported by evidence.

According to the study aim, the results of the present systematic review show that just above one-third of athyreotic patients have normal TSH at their first postsurgery follow-up independently of the strategy used to decide the LT4 starting dose. Despite LT4 therapy being a well-established and safe treatment, achieving euthyroidism at the first postthyroidectomy follow-up remains challenging. Although some differences in terms of euthyroidism rates were reached, previously tested dosing strategies ranging from very simple ones to rather complex algorithms do not fully account for interindividual variability, underscoring the limitations of a one-size-fits-all approach. Further investigation is needed to uncover these factors and develop more precise, individualized dosing algorithms to improve postthyroidectomy management. Future well-controlled and adequately sized prospective studies specifically designed to address this issue should take into account specific participant eligibility criteria including age, BMI, body composition, underlying thyroid disorders, concomitant therapies, causes of malabsorption, comorbidities, and patient compliance.

### Levothyroxine sodium (levothroid) [^198c6c6d]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Children in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests)

Therapy may begin at full replacement doses in otherwise healthy individuals less than 50 years old and in those older than 50 years who have been recently treated for hyperthyroidism or who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium is approximately 1.7 mcg/kg/day (e.g., 100-125 mcg/day for a 70 kg adult). Older patients may require less than 1 mcg/kg/day. Levothyroxine sodium doses greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses ≥ 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, and/or drug interactions.

For most patients older than 50 years or for patients under 50 years of age with underlying cardiac disease, an initial starting dose of 25-50 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended, with gradual increments in dose at 6-8 week intervals, as needed. The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in elderly patients with cardiac disease is 12.5-25 mcg/day, with gradual dose increments at 4-6 week intervals. The levothyroxine sodium dose is generally adjusted in 12.5-25 mcg increments until the patient with primary hypothyroidism is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH has normalized.

In patients with severe hypothyroidism, the recommended initial levothyroxine sodium dose is 12.5-25 mcg/day with increases of 25 mcg/day every 2-4 weeks, accompanied by clinical and laboratory assessment, until the TSH level is normalized.

In patients with secondary (pituitary) or tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism, the levothyroxine sodium dose should be titrated until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

Pediatric Dosage

Congenital or Acquired Hypothyroidism (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests)

### Levothyroxine sodium (Synthroid) [^f1d5e2be]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

SYNTHROID is indicated in patients from birth to less than 17 years of age:

As a replacement therapy in primary (thyroidal), secondary (pituitary), and tertiary (hypothalamic) congenital or acquired hypothyroidism.
As an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy in the management of thyrotropin-dependent well-differentiated thyroid cancer.

Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on cognitive development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate SYNTHROID therapy immediately upon diagnosis. Levothyroxine is generally continued for life in these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .

Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of SYNTHROID therapy for cardiac overload and arrhythmias.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate SYNTHROID at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with levothyroxine overtreatment in the elderly.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^dd726a0c]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association guideline—starting dose strategies indicate that several approaches to initiating LT4 therapy are acceptable, including basing the starting dose on the serum thyrotropin (TSH) level, with full replacement doses roughly 0.73 µg/lb or 1.6 µg/kg body weight when the serum TSH is markedly elevated, and lower doses such as 25–50 µg for milder degrees of hypothyroidism.

Different levothyroxine products and serum TSH—Because use of different levothyroxine products may sometimes be associated with altered serum TSH values, a change in an identifiable formulation of levothyroxine (brand name or generic) should be followed by re-evaluation of serum TSH at steady state. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

Levothyroxine therapy in nonadherence—If prescription of daily levothyroxine is not successful in maintaining a normal serum thyrotropin, weekly oral administration of the full week's dose of levothyroxine should be considered in individuals in whom adherence cannot otherwise be sustained. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

### Levothyroxine sodium (Levo-T) [^7cd5a384]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete

Start LEVO-T at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of LEVO-T is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100 to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of LEVO-T may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start LEVO-T at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of LEVO-T dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate LEVO-T dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

### Levothyroxine sodium (unithroid) [^cba95175]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start UNITHROID at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of UNITHROID dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate UNITHROID dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

Pediatric Dosage - Congenital or Acquired Hypothyroidism

The recommended daily dose of UNITHROID in pediatric patients with hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 1. Start UNITHROID at the full daily dose in most pediatric patients. Start at a lower starting dose in newborns (0 to 3 months) at risk for cardiac failure and in children at risk for hyperactivity (see below). Monitor for clinical and laboratory response [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] .

a - The dose should be adjusted based on clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Drug Interactions (7.10), and Use In Specific Populations (8.4)] .

### ETA guidelines for the use of levothyroxine sodium preparations in monotherapy to optimize the treatment of hypothyroidism [^83f9130c]. European Thyroid Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy, initial dosing, ETA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider determining the starting dose of levothyroxine and calculating the daily requirement by evaluating the patient's weight, lean body mass, pregnancy status, etiology of hypothyroidism, age, and overall clinical context.

### Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over... [^aa9f8dd5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

A maximum of two levothyroxine up-titrations at the start of the trial and one up-titration at 12 and 24 month (± 1 month) intervals with repeated TSH measurements after 6–8 weeks ensure adequate levothyroxine treatment while avoiding potential over-replacement. The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration adopting an adaptive schedule is performed in the placebo group by the data centre. A similar proportion of placebo patients will have up and down titrations of study medication as the intervention group to ensure the number of tablets and assessments is similar in both groups.

Because all thyroid function measurements are available only to the data centre, the clinical investigators remain fully blinded to the treatment allocation process during the trial.

Accountability logs recording the quantities of study medication dispensed to and returned from study participants, batch numbers and expiry dates are available for all study drug movements.

Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated study medication:
If overt biochemical hypothyroidism is identified (TSH > 20 mU/L and/or fT4 below the reference range) a second TSH with fT4 within 2 weeks is requested. Upon confirmation of biochemical hypothyroidism the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the General Practitioner (GP) for usual care.
If overt biochemical hyperthyroidism is identified (TSH < 0.4 mU/L) in the placebo group, or consecutively in the treatment group despite downtitrations, the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the GP for usual care.
If for clinical reasons (e.g. major illness) a proposed change in study medication or placebo is deemed inappropriate the algorithm is overridden by the local principal coordinator and no change in study medication takes place.

Randomisation

Participants are randomised to either the levothyroxine or placebo treatment arm (ratio 1:1) using the randomly permuted block method, stratified by site, sex and starting dose. The data centre (Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow, Scotland) independently provides the randomisation schedule. Mawdsley Brooks & Co. implements the schedule through identical packaging of levothyroxine and matching placebo tablets.

Patient allocation is conducted via the dedicated trial web portal by the study nurses. When a participant is eligible based on entering the eligibility criteria in an electronic case report form (eCRF) supervised by a medically certified Principle Investigator, a central computer will trigger the decision.

### Levothyroxine sodium (Euthyrox) [^5a6df355]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty Are Complete

Start EUTHYROX at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of EUTHYROX is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100 mcg per day to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg per day to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of EUTHYROX may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg per day to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start EUTHYROX at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of EUTHYROX dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 (L-thyroxine) level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate EUTHYROX dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

### Levothyroxine sodium (levothroid) [^d4d51eca]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

General Principles

The goal of replacement therapy is to achieve and maintain a clinical and biochemical euthyroid state. The goal of suppressive therapy is to inhibit growth and/or function of abnormal thyroid tissue. The dose of LEVOTHROID®that is adequate to achieve these goals depends on a variety of factors including the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions, including pregnancy, concomitant medications, and the specific nature of the condition being treated (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). Hence, the following recommendations serve only as dosing guidelines. Dosing must be individualized and adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).

LEVOTHROID®is administered as a single daily dose, preferably one-half to one hour before breakfast. LEVOTHROID®should be taken at least 4 hours apart from drugs that are known to interfere with its absorption (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Due to the long half-life of levothyroxine, the peak therapeutic effect at a given dose of levothyroxine sodium may not be attained for 4-6 weeks.

Caution should be exercised when administering LEVOTHROID®to patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, to the elderly, and to those with concomitant adrenal insufficiency (see PRECAUTIONS).

Levothyroxine dosing and monitoring—primary hypothyroidism: Except in secondary (central) hypothyroidism, dose titration is guided by serum thyrotropin (TSH), with the “target TSH typically being 0.5 to 3.5 or 4 mIU/L.” “Dose adjustments are usually made 4–6 weeks after initiating therapy,” typically in increments of “12.5–25 μg/d,” and “the serum TSH is then repeated in 4–6 weeks, until the TSH target has been reached.” Ongoing monitoring is advised as “serum TSH should be measured in 4–6 months and then at 12 months to assure stability.” In patients with coronary artery disease, initiation should be conservative: “Patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) should always be started on a low LT4 dose (12.5–25 μg/d), with gradual increases based on symptoms and serum TSH levels.”

Graves’ disease postoperative thyroid hormone replacement (Recommendation 31) states that following thyroidectomy for GD, L-thyroxine should be started at a daily dose appropriate for the patient’s weight (0.8 μg/lb or 1.6 μg/kg), with elderly patients needing somewhat less, and serum TSH measured 6–8 weeks postoperatively; this is a strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Technical remarks add that if TSH was suppressed preoperatively, free T4 and TSH should be measured 6–8 weeks postoperatively, and once stable and normal, TSH should be measured annually or more frequently; dosing will vary with patient body mass index and the percentage of levothyroxine absorbed from the gut.

WARNINGS

WARNING: Thyroid hormones, including LEVOTHROID ®, either alone or with other therapeutic agents, should not be used for the treatment of obesity or for weight loss. In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. Larger doses may produce serious or even life threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects.

Levothyroxine sodium should not be used in the treatment of male or female infertility unless this condition is associated with hypothyroidism.

In patients with nontoxic diffuse goiter or nodular thyroid disease, particularly the elderly or those with underlying cardiovascular disease, levothyroxine sodium therapy is contraindicated if the serum TSH level is already suppressed due to the risk of precipitating overt thyrotoxicosis (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). If the serum TSH level is not suppressed, LEVOTHROID®should be used with caution in conjunction with careful monitoring of thyroid function for evidence of hyperthyroidism and clinical monitoring for potential associated adverse cardiovascular signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

2.1 Dosage

An initial intravenous loading dose of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection between 300 to 500 mcg, followed by once daily intravenous maintenance doses between 50 and 100 mcg, should be administered, as clinically indicated, until the patient can tolerate oral therapy.  The age, general physical condition, cardiac risk factors, and clinical severity of myxedema and duration of myxedema symptoms should be considered when determining the starting and maintenance dosages of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection.

Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection produces a gradual increase in the circulating concentrations of the hormone with an approximate half-life of 9 to 10 days in hypothyroid patients.  Daily administration of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection should be maintained until the patient is capable of tolerating an oral dose and is clinically stable.  For chronic treatment of hypothyroidism, an oral dosage form of levothyroxine should be used to maintain a euthyroid state.  Relative bioavailability between Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection and oral levothyroxine products has not been established.  Based on medical practice, the relative bioavailability between oral and intravenous administration of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection is estimated to be from 48 to 74%.  Due to differences in absorption characteristics of patients and the oral levothyroxine product formulations, TSH and thyroid hormone levels should be measured a few weeks after initiating oral levothyroxine and dose adjusted accordingly.

2.2 Dosing in the Elderly and in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease

Intravenous levothyroxine may be associated with cardiac toxicity–including arrhythmias, tachycardia, myocardial ischemia and infarction, or worsening of congestive heart failure and death–in the elderly and in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.  Therefore, cautious use, including doses in the lower end of the recommended range, may be warranted in these populations.

2.3 Reconstitution Directions

Reconstitute the lyophilized Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection by aseptically adding 5 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP only.  Shake vial to ensure complete mixing. The resultant solution will have a final concentration of approximately 20 mcg per mL, 40 mcg per mL and 100 mcg per mL for the 100 mcg, 200 mcg and 500 mcg vials, respectively.  Reconstituted drug product is preservative free and is stable for 4 hours.  Discard any unused portion.  DO NOT ADD LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM FOR INJECTION TO OTHER IV FLUIDS.  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over... [^fd39a26f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Intervention

The investigational medicinal products are levothyroxine sodium (T4) as 25 or 50 microgram tablets for oral administration and a matching placebo. All tablets are white and round in shape with the strength imprinted, identically packaged in blisters and packed in plain cardboard cartons to maintain study blinding. Participants are advised to take the suggested dose of study medication once daily half an hour before breakfast.

The intervention group will start with levothyroxine 50 micrograms daily (25 micrograms in participants with < 50 kg body weight or with a history of coronary heart disease) and the control group with matching placebo for six to 8 weeks.

After 6–8 weeks a venous blood sample is taken for TSH assessment. Based on the TSH results, the data centre advises the new dose of study medication or placebo to the clinical investigators.
If TSH < 0.4 mU/L: the treatment dose is reduced to 25 micrograms levothyroxine in those starting on 50 micrograms; reduced to 0 in those starting on 25 micrograms – effected by giving placebo matching the 25 micrograms dose. These participants will have a further TSH check after 6–8 weeks. If TSH remains < 0.4 mU/L participant will be withdrawn from randomised treatment and referred to usual care.
If TSH ≥ 0.4 and < 4.6 mU/L: no change to the treatment dose.
If TSH remains elevated (≥ 4.6 mU/L): 25 micrograms of levothyroxine will be added. Giving a total daily dose of 75 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 50 micrograms, or a total daily dose of 50 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 25 micrograms.

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty Are Complete

Start LEVOXYL at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of LEVOXYL is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100 mcg per day to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of LEVOXYL may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start LEVOXYL at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of LEVOXYL dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate LEVOXYL dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^4e552c61]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association hypothyroidism—levothyroxine replacement goals in primary hypothyroidism are as follows: Levothyroxine replacement therapy has three main goals. These are (i) to provide resolution of the patients’ symptoms and hypothyroid signs, including biological and physiologic markers of hypothyroidism, (ii) to achieve normalization of serum thyrotropin (TSH) with improvement in thyroid hormone concentrations, and (iii) to avoid overtreatment (iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis), especially in the elderly. The goals of LT4 replacement in primary hypothyroidism are to achieve a state of euthyroidism and normalization of the circulating levels of TSH and thyroid hormones, with euthyroidism defined as the normalization of indices of thyroid hormone action and the absence or the regression of symptoms and clinical signs associated with hypothyroidism. The lack of specificity of hypothyroid symptoms and signs, and particularly in autoimmune thyroid disease, renders difficult the assessment of the adequacy of the replacement therapy on a purely clinical basis. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that patients are unable to detect differences in symptoms when the LT4 dose is changed by approximately 20%, although such a change was sufficient to modify cholesterol levels. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

### Study protocol ; thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism-a randomised placebo controlled trial (TRUST) [^cdf53b2f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The dose is changed according to the serum TSH level as follows; 6–8 weeks after randomisation a blood sample is taken for serum TSH, with three possible actions:
TSH <0.4 mU/L: treatment dose reduced to 25 micrograms levothyroxine in those starting on 50 micrograms; reduced to 0 in those starting on 25 micrograms – blinding maintained by giving placebo matching the 25 micrograms dose; these patients will have a further check TSH after 6–8 weeks; if TSH remains <0.4 mU/L patient will be withdrawn from randomised treatment.
TSH ≥0.4 and <4.6 mU/L: no change to the treatment dose; patient to be reviewed at 12 months.
TSH remains elevated (≥4.6 mU/L): additional 25 micrograms levothyroxine, giving a total daily dose of 75 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 50 micrograms, or a total daily dose of 50 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 25 micrograms.

Titration of dose of levothyroxine (25 micrograms increments) against serum TSH is repeated up to a maximum of two occasions, at 6–8 week intervals, with a check of serum TSH performed at 6–8 weeks after all dose titrations. The investigators remained masked to the results of TSH measurements throughout the course of the study.

The above process (but with only a single up-titration) is repeated at 12 months (plus or minus 1 month) then annually (at 24 and 36 months plus or minus 1 month). The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine that is prescribed is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration (by computer algorithm) is performed in the placebo group aiming for approximately the same frequency as that likely to be required in the levothyroxine-treated group. We have adopted an adaptive schedule, in which the data centre allocates the same proportion of placebo patients to have dose adjustment (up and down) as are required in the levothyroxine group. This ensures that the burden of assessment, and number of tablets to be taken, is the same in both the levothyroxine and placebo groups. The computer generated allocation also ensures that the clinical investigators remain blind to treatment allocation.

### Levothyroxine sodium (levothroid) [^bac3eadf]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

General

The goal of treatment in pediatric patients with hypothyroidism is to achieve and maintain normal intellectual and physical growth and development.

The initial dose of levothyroxine varies with age and body weight (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Table 3). Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).

In children in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, it is recommended that levothyroxine administration be discontinued for a 30-day trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Serum T4and TSH levels should then be obtained. If the T4is low and the TSH high, the diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism is established, and levothyroxine therapy should be reinstituted. If the T4and TSH levels are normal, euthyroidism may be assumed and, therefore, the hypothyroidism can be considered to have been transient. In this instance, however, the physician should carefully monitor the child and repeat the thyroid function tests if any signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism develop. In this setting, the clinician should have a high index of suspicion of relapse. If the results of the levothyroxine withdrawal test are inconclusive, careful follow-up and subsequent testing will be necessary.

Since some more severely affected children may become clinically hypothyroid when treatment is discontinued for 30 days, an alternate approach is to reduce the replacement dose of levothyroxine by half during the 30-day trial period. If, after 30 days, the serum TSH is elevated above 20mU/L, the diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism is confirmed, and full replacement therapy should be resumed. However, if the serum TSH has not risen to greater than 20mU/L, levothyroxine treatment should be discontinued for another 30-day trial period followed by repeat serum T4and TSH testing.

The presence of concomitant medical conditions should be considered in certain clinical circumstances and, if present, appropriately treated (see PRECAUTIONS).

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^45d6e99e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Conduct of Review

The present systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (ID 1061048). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in reporting this study (Supplemental Material 1).

Search Strategy

A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase databases. The search aimed to identify studies reporting the proportion of “euthyroid” patients at their first follow-up after thyroidectomy and the strategy employed to estimate the LT4 starting dose. Euthyroid patients were defined as those with TSH levels within the target range specified in each article. For benign diseases, a higher TSH range was used, whereas for malignant conditions, risk-stratified TSH targets were applied. The search was restricted to articles published in English from January 1, 2000, to October 30, 2024. The online search was conducted by the following algorithm: [(levothyroxine) or (L-thyroxine) or (LT4)] and [(thyroidectomy) or (athyreotic)] and (dose). In the attempt to expand the search, references in the retrieved articles were also screened to identify additional studies.

Study Selection

The inclusion criteria were original studies reporting the number of patients achieving euthyroidism at the first postthyroidectomy evaluation and the criteria used to prescribe the initial LT4 dose. Exclusion criteria were studies lacking data on postthyroidectomy follow-up or underlying thyroid pathology, review articles, and outdated publications. Two independent researchers (I.C. P.C.) screened titles and abstracts based on these criteria. Subsequently, all authors independently reviewed the full text of eligible articles to confirm their inclusion in the final analysis.

Data Extraction

For each included study, the following information was extracted independently by 2 investigators (I.C. P.C.) in a piloted form: (1) study details (authors, publication year, and country of origin); (2) patient demographics [median age, body mass index (BMI), and sex]; (3) underlying thyroid pathology (benign or malignant); (4) LT4 dosing method; (5) follow-up data for the first and second postthyroidectomy controls. Extracted data were cross-checked for accuracy, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. When studies included 2 (or more) different populations according to the LT4 dosing strategy employed, they were reported as separate series.

Warnings

WARNING: Thyroid hormones, including Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP, either alone or with other therapeutic agents, should not be used for the treatment of obesity for weight loss. In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. Larger doses may produce serious or even life threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects.

Levothyroxine sodium should not be used in the treatment of male or female infertility unless this condition is associated with hypothyroidism.

In patients with nontoxic diffuse goiter or nodular thyroid disease, particularly the elderly or those with underlying cardiovascular disease, levothyroxine sodium therapy is contraindicated if the serum TSH level is already suppressed due to the risk of precipitating overt thyrotoxicosis (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). If the serum TSH level is not suppressed, Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP should be used with caution in conjunction with careful monitoring of thyroid function for evidence of hyperthyroidism and clinical monitoring for potential associated adverse cardiovascular signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

Levothyroxine (LT4) potency, substitution, and monitoring—recommendations and cautions: Since 2007 the FDA has required that LT4 preparations maintain 95%–105% of their stated potency, revised from a prior requirement of 90%–110%, throughout their shelf life, and has required that all LT4 products be reassessed as though they were new drugs. When a generic or branded LT4 meets these criteria, the FDA has determined that preparations can be substituted by the pharmacy unless dispensed as written. The three endocrine societies recommend repeat thyroid function testing when a patient is switched from one LT4 preparation to another to ensure that the goal TSH and FT4 and T3 concentrations are achieved, and it is recommended that, once the therapeutic target is reached, the patient should remain on the same medication and, if possible, on the same dose and preparation of medication to the extent possible. It seems reasonable to keep a patient on a given product and, if a change is necessary, TSH levels should be rechecked; in patients with thyroid cancer, it is important to maintain LT4 product stability when a desired goal TSH is relevant for possible disease recurrence or progression.

Levothyroxine dosing frequency and adherence—once-weekly and twice-weekly regimens: A randomized cross-over trial of once weekly oral administration of 7 times the usual daily levothyroxine (LT4) dose versus daily dosing found weekly therapy produced supratherapeutic T4 for about 24 hours while T3 remained within the reference range, and over 6 weeks other biochemical and clinical markers, including patient symptoms, did not differ from daily therapy. A second similar 6-week cross-over trial showed greater increases in T4 after weekly dosing than daily dosing without symptoms or echocardiographic evidence of hyperthyroidism. For patients in whom daily LT4 intake is unsuccessful, options include observed therapy or reducing the frequency of LT4 ingestion to twice weekly or weekly with a starting dose equal to the weight‑adjusted daily regimen (i.e., 7 times the daily dose); parenteral LT4 is also possible, although no trials were identified.

### Thyroid hormone therapy for older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism [^75e630b7]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

The use of levothyroxine to treat subclinical hypothyroidism is controversial. We aimed to determine whether levothyroxine provided clinical benefits in older persons with this condition.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial involving 737 adults who were at least 65 years of age and who had persisting subclinical hypothyroidism (thyrotropin level, 4.60 to 19.99 mIU per liter; free thyroxine level within the reference range). A total of 368 patients were assigned to receive levothyroxine (at a starting dose of 50 μg daily, or 25 μg if the body weight was <50 kg or the patient had coronary heart disease), with dose adjustment according to the thyrotropin level; 369 patients were assigned to receive placebo with mock dose adjustment. The two primary outcomes were the change in the Hypothyroid Symptoms score and Tiredness score on a thyroid-related quality-of-life questionnaire at 1 year (range of each scale is 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more symptoms or tiredness, respectively; minimum clinically important difference, 9 points).

Results

The mean age of the patients was 74.4 years, and 396 patients (53.7%) were women. The mean (±SD) thyrotropin level was 6.40±2.01 mIU per liter at baseline; at 1 year, this level had decreased to 5.48 mIU per liter in the placebo group, as compared with 3.63 mIU per liter in the levothyroxine group (P<0.001), at a median dose of 50 μg. We found no differences in the mean change at 1 year in the Hypothyroid Symptoms score (0.2±15.3 in the placebo group and 0.2±14.4 in the levothyroxine group; between-group difference, 0.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.0 to 2.1) or the Tiredness score (3.2±17.7 and 3.8±18.4, respectively; between-group difference, 0.4; 95% CI, -2.1 to 2.9). No beneficial effects of levothyroxine were seen on secondary-outcome measures. There was no significant excess of serious adverse events prespecified as being of special interest.

Conclusions

Levothyroxine provided no apparent benefits in older persons with subclinical hypothyroidism. (Funded by European Union FP7 and others; TRUST ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01660126 .).

### Levothyroxine sodium (tirosint) [^3aaead6e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete

Start TIROSINT at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months).The average full replacement dose of TIROSINT is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100-125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed, until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of TIROSINT may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start TIROSINT at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of TIROSINT dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism, and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate TIROSINT dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^a03cf760]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Total thyroidectomy requires lifelong replacement therapy with levothyroxine (LT4). Achieving optimal thyroid hormones replacement promptly after surgery is important but somehow challenging. Indeed, previous studies addressing this topic clearly indicate that a significant proportion of patients who are started on LT4 therapy for postthyroidectomy hypothyroidism require multiple dose adjustments over time. The clinical scenario is thus how we should choose the starting LT4 dose in patients just after total thyroidectomy to warrant the highest rate of euthyroidism at the first postsurgery evaluation. While initial investigations used fixed LT4 doses, revised and eventually adjusted at early follow-up, more recent studies propose potential tailored approaches to more precisely estimate the optimal LT4 dose. Current clinical guidelines on the treatment of primary hypothyroidism recommend that when choosing a starting dose of LT4, several factors including patient's weight, lean body mass, etiology of hypothyroidism, degree of thyrotropin elevation, age, and comorbidities (ie, particularly cardiac diseases) should all be taken into account. Most papers suggest that in athyreotic patients, a starting LT4 dose of 1.6 to 1.8 mcg/kg of body weight would be adequate, even though other authors have advocated for a higher starting dose of 2.0 to 2.1 mcg/kg, at least in selected settings.

There is general agreement that the etiology sustaining hypothyroidism impacts on the optimal LT4 dose, making athyreotic patients, owing to the lack of residual functional thyroid tissue, more likely to require a higher LT4 dose as compared to patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Furthermore, the therapeutic target of TSH may vary in relation to the underlying condition, such as in patients with thyroid cancer who may require higher LT4 doses (ie, TSH-suppressive therapy). In addition, from the patient’s standpoint, promptly achieving euthyroidism can provide clinical benefits in terms of both well-being and reduction of further clinical consultations. Although the number of studies in this field is significant, no clear and solid information is available about the optimal LT4 starting dose to be used in athyreotic subjects with no (or at least minor) need for further adjustment over time.

2.3	Recommended Dosage and Titration

Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Adults

The recommended starting daily dosage of ERMEZA in adults with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on age and comorbid cardiac conditions, as described in Table 1. For patients at risk of atrial fibrillation or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a lower dosage and titrate the dosage more slowly to avoid exacerbation of cardiac symptoms. Dosage titration is based on serum TSH or free-T4 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] .

Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients

The recommended starting daily dosage of ERMEZA in pediatric patients with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 2. Titrate the dosage (every 2 weeks) as needed based on serum TSH or free-T4 until the patient is euthyroid [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] .

Pediatric Patients from Birth to 3 Months of Age at Risk for Cardiac Failure

Start at a lower starting dosage and increase the dosage every 4 to 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response.

Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity

To minimize the risk of hyperactivity, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dosage, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dosage until the full recommended replacement dosage is reached.

Hypothyroidism in Pregnant Patients

For pregnant patients with pre-existing hypothyroidism, measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In pregnant patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. The recommended daily dosage of ERMEZA in pregnant patients is described in Table 3.

### Treatment of hypothyroidism-AAFP (...) [^ec85bf05]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

INITIATING TREATMENT Most otherwise healthy adult patients with hypothyroidism require thyroid hormone replacement in a dosage of 1. 7 μg per kg per day, with requirements falling to 1 μg per kg per day in the elderly. Thus, levothyroxine in a dosage of 0. 10 to
0. 15 mg per day is needed to achieve euthyroid status. For full replacement, children may require up to 4 μg per kg per day. 9 In young patients without risk factors for cardiovascular disease, thyroid hormone replacement can start close to the target goal. In most healthy young adults, replacement is initiated using levothyroxine in a dosage of 0. 075 mg per day, with the dosage increased slowly as indicated by continued elevation of the TSH level. Levothyroxine should be initiated in a low dosage in older patients and those at risk for the cardiovascular compromise that could occur with a rapid increase in resting heart rate and blood pressure. 9 In these patients, the usual starting dosage is 0.

025 mg per day. This dosage can be increased in increments of 0. 025 to
0. 050 mg every four to six weeks until the TSH level returns to normal. Thyroid hormone is usually given once daily, but some evidence suggests that weekly dosing may also be effective. In a small study 10 of 12 patients with hypothyroidism, a bolus dose of thyroid hormone equal to seven times the usual daily dose was well tolerated. Before weekly replacement can be recommended, however, more investigation is required, including definitions of the populations in which this approach is indicated. 4 levels are monitored annually in most patients with hypothyroidism, although no data support this practice. Generally, once a stable maintenance dosage of levothyroxine is achieved, that dosage will remain adequate until patients are 60 to 70 years of age. With age, thyroid binding may decrease, and the serum albumin level may decline. In this setting, the levothyroxine dosage may need to be reduced by up to 20 percent.

13, 14 Although less frequent than annual monitoring could be justified in younger adult patients whose weight is stable, annual monitoring in older patients is necessary to avoid overreplacement.

### How do you approach the problem of TSH elevation in a patient on high-dose thyroid hormone replacement? [^80fb55bf]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple aetiologies are possible and a methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will uniformly identify a cause, or at least a resolution.

Where a proposed up-titration of levothyroxine (or placebo) is thought to be clinically inappropriate (e.g. known non-adherence to IMP, recent major illness) the algorithm is manually ‘over-ridden’ and the patient is not up-titrated.

Criteria for withdrawal of participants on safety grounds:
If overt biochemical hypothyroidism is identified (TSH ≥20 mU/L), the data centre requires a second TSH measurement with fT4 within two weeks; if overt biochemical hypothyroidism is confirmed (fT4 below reference range), the patient is required to stop the trial medication and recommended to attend GP for consideration of open treatment with levothyroxine.
If biochemical hyperthyroidism (TSH < 0.4 mU/L) develops in the placebo group, or occurs at two consecutive follow-up visits in a patient in the levothyroxine group; i.e. persisting despite down-titration of the levothyroxine dose, the patient will stop the trial medication and attend their GP for consideration of further assessment and treatment of hyperthyroidism.

Blinding

The study is double blinded. Subject blinding to treatment allocation is ensured through use of matched tablets for levothyroxine and placebo, with a mock titration in the placebo group (see above under intervention for details). Clinician and study centre blinding to treatment allocation is ensured by remote laboratory analysis of blood samples for TSH and dose titration as per computer algorithm.

All blood tests for in-study TSH and fT4 levels are performed by the research team without knowledge of the results; all results from the follow-up phase of the study are forwarded directly to the data centres who advise the clinical research team on any dose titration. The clinical research team are not informed of the results of thyroid function testing. The same process of blinding is followed for measurement of haemoglobin on a full blood count.

If the clinical investigator or attending physician deems that unblinding is necessary they will have 24-hr access to telephone unblinding through the data-centre. In the event of a SUSAR, the sponsor (but not the investigators) will be unblinded to facilitate reporting to the relevant regulatory authorities including the MHRA.

Pregnancy- Pregnancy may increase levothyroxine requirements (see PREGNANCY).

Subclinical Hypothyroidism- If this condition is treated, a lower levothyroxine sodium dose (e.g., 1 mcg/kg/day) than that used for full replacement may be adequate to normalize the serum TSH level. Patients who are not treated should be monitored yearly for changes in clinical status and thyroid laboratory parameters.

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer and Thyroid Nodules- The target level for TSH suppression in these conditions has not been established with controlled studies. In addition, the efficacy of TSH suppression for benign nodular disease is controversial. Therefore, the dose of Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP used for TSH suppression should be individualized based on the specific disease and the patient being treated.

In the treatment of well differentiated (papillary and follicular) thyroid cancer, levothyroxine is used as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy. Generally, TSH is suppressed to <0.1 mU/L, and this usually requires a levothyroxine sodium dose of greater than 2 mcg/kg/day. However, in patients with high-risk tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be <0.01 mU/L.

Discussion of the clinical literature—elderly hypothyroidism management indicates that in elderly persons (those older than 65–70 years) who are without known heart disease or without major risk factors for heart disease, LT4 therapy can be initiated at the full dose, although the method of starting with a low dose and increasing it slowly is still preferred by some experts. The final LT4 dose that normalizes the serum TSH is generally lower in the elderly compared to younger persons. In addition to the lower dose requirements related to T4 metabolism, the target serum TSH should likely be raised in older persons, especially the oldest old (patients > 80 years), and, based on current evidence, it is reasonable to raise the target serum TSH to 4–6 mIU/L in persons greater than age 70–80 years. If maintaining a regular daily schedule of LT4 therapy is problematic in an elderly individual, consideration could be given to a guardian or visiting nurse giving all the LT4 pills once weekly (or half the pills twice weekly), if appropriate.

### Study protocol ; thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism-a randomised placebo controlled trial (TRUST) [^29902bde]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a common condition in elderly people, defined as elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with normal circulating free thyroxine (fT4). Evidence is lacking about the effect of thyroid hormone treatment. We describe the protocol of a large randomised controlled trial (RCT) of Levothyroxine treatment for SCH.

Methods

Participants are community-dwelling subjects aged ≥65 years with SCH, diagnosed by elevated TSH levels (≥4.6 and ≤19.9 mU/L) on a minimum of two measures ≥ three months apart, with fT4 levels within laboratory reference range. The study is a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group trial, starting with levothyroxine 50 micrograms daily (25 micrograms in subjects <50Kg body weight or known coronary heart disease) with titration of dose in the active treatment group according to TSH level, and a mock titration in the placebo group. The primary outcomes are changes in two domains (hypothyroid symptoms and fatigue / vitality) on the thyroid-related quality of life questionnaire (ThyPRO) at one year. The study has 80% power (at p = 0.025, 2-tailed) to detect a change with levothyroxine treatment of 3.0% on the hypothyroid scale and 4.1% on the fatigue / vitality scale with a total target sample size of 750 patients.

Secondary outcomes include general health-related quality of life (EuroQol), fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, handgrip strength, executive cognitive function (Letter Digit Coding Test), basic and instrumental activities of daily living, haemoglobin, blood pressure, weight, body mass index and waist circumference. Patients are monitored for specific adverse events of interest including incident atrial fibrillation, heart failure and bone fracture.

Discussion

This large multicentre RCT of levothyroxine treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is powered to detect clinically relevant change in symptoms / quality of life and is likely to be highly influential in guiding treatment of this common condition.

### Incidence and determinants of spontaneous normalization of subclinical hypothyroidism in older adults [^d73cdc4e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, we have demonstrated that in a large proportion of older adults with mild subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH levels spontaneously normalized in a median follow-up of 1 year, even after 2 consecutive measurements (≥3 months apart) of elevated TSH levels. These results have clinical relevance. Current guidelines recommend that a single measurement of elevated serum TSH, with fT4 within reference range, should be confirmed by a repeat measurement of both serum TSH and fT4, along with thyroid peroxidase antibodies, after a 2- to 3-month interval. However, international guidelines differ in their recommendations on the TSH threshold at which treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism should be considered in older adults. Once levothyroxine treatment is initiated, it is often continued lifelong. Based on the observation that with age, the TSH distribution shifts toward a higher level, it has been proposed to extend the upper limit of the TSH reference to 7 mU/L for people aged 80 years or older. Although increasing the upper reference limit will likely reduce unnecessary levothyroxine prescribing for older people, instead of a binary approach, our results support applying more continuous age-related reference ranges, which may be modified by other factors such as sex and season. Moreover, based on the high incidence of spontaneous normalization of TSH levels in a large proportion of older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (also after confirmation by repeat measurement), a third measurement may be recommended before considering initiation of treatment. Based on such an approach, the frequency of the diagnosis subclinical hypothyroidism can likely be reduced in older adults. This could potentially contribute to a reduction in health care costs, treatment burden, and risk of overtreatment. These results may also have implications for follow-up studies. Levothyroxine is among the most frequently prescribed drugs. Although general practitioner prescription practices vary widely between countries, many older adults have initiated levothyroxine treatment based on a mildly elevated TSH. Moreover, in clinical practice, treatment has often been started after a single measurement of TSH. A recent meta-analysis indicated that deprescribing levothyroxine could be successful for carefully selected patients, although the quality of available evidence was considered low. This underscores the need for future high-quality studies to assess the effects of safely withholding levothyroxine treatment in older adults who initiated levothyroxine treatment based on a diagnosis of mild subclinical hypothyroidism on relevant patient outcomes.

For estimation of individual TSH/fT4 relationships a Bayesian regression model was used instead of OLS to compensate for the low number of samples and for censoring. Center: A patient without detectable TSH, naive OLS would give flat/no response. The Bayesian model gives more plausible estimate with response extending below censoring limit, slope is informed by population data. Right: Bayesian slope is less steep than naive patient specific OLS as informed by population data. fT4, free thyroxine; OLS, ordinary least squares; RCT, randomized controlled trial; TSH, thyrotropin.

FIG. 2. 
Study design for randomized controlled validation trial. After total thyroidectomy, the surgeon chose an LT4 starting dosage based on diagnose and clinical routine. TSH and fT4 was measured four times the next two weeks to allow early dosage adjustment. The patients were randomized to the application of a DAT or not (control) for dosage adjustments that were supervised by an experienced endocrine surgeon in either case. Eight weeks after surgery, successful dosage adjustment was evaluated based on TSH measurements. If the TSH target was not achieved, the patient continued six-week dosage adjustment cycles. DAT, decision aid tool.

FIG. 3. 
Output from the DAT guided the clinician to increase LT4 dosage 20 days after thyroidectomy, when the DAT was applied in this example patient (same as in Fig. 1, right). A near twofold increase in dosage is suggested to reach the target of TSH <0.10 mIU/L. The plots show the actual measurements of fT4 (A) and TSH (B) alongside the model estimates. The suggested dosages and the projected responses are also shown to facilitate evaluation from the clinician before deciding on the final dosage.

Eight weeks after surgery (i.e. 5–6 weeks after the first follow-up), blood tests were again evaluated. If the TSH target was reached, they left the study and continued follow-ups by surgeons, endocrinologists, or general practitioners, according to local routines. If the TSH target was not reached, the participants entered loops of follow-up every six weeks until the TSH target was reached (Fig. 2). On each follow-up, the DAT was applied only to the DAT group.

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer and Thyroid Nodules

The target level for TSH suppression in these conditions has not been established with controlled studies. In addition, the efficacy of TSH suppression for benign nodular disease is controversial. Therefore, the dose of LEVOTHROID®used for TSH suppression should be individualized based on the specific disease and the patient being treated.

In the treatment of well-differentiated (papillary and follicular) thyroid cancer, levothyroxine is used as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy. Generally, TSH is suppressed to <0.1 mU/L, and this usually requires a levothyroxine sodium dose of greater than 2 mcg/kg/day . However, in patients with high-risk tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be <0.01 mU/L.

In the treatment of benign nodules and nontoxic multinodular goiter, TSH is generally suppressed to a higher target (e.g., 0.1 to either 0.5 or 1.0 mU/L) than that used for the treatment of thyroid cancer. Levothyroxine sodium is contraindicated if the serum TSH is already suppressed due to the risk of precipitating overt thyrotoxicosis (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

Myxedema Coma

Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of levothyroxine sodium from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, oral thyroid hormone drug products are not recommended to treat this condition. Thyroid hormone drug products formulated for intravenous administration should be administered.

### Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over... [^c619d846]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

To help resolve this clinical uncertainty of levothyroxine replacement treatment for SCH in older persons, we have performed an randomized controlled trial including participants over 80 years old in the presence of comorbid conditions; the Institute for Evidence-Based Medicine in Old Age (IEMO)80-plus thyroid trial. The TRUST trial was not designed specifically to investigate the effects in 80-plus participants and was consequently inadequately powered for a subgroup analysis in participants aged 80 and over. The IEMO 80-plus thyroid trial was designed jointly with the TRUST trial as an ancillary trial using the same trial infrastructure and protocol to allow a pre-planned, joint analysis of all participants aged 80 and over. This combined endeavour will provide experimental evidence on potential multimodal effects of levothyroxine treatment from the largest sample of 80-plus persons with SCH to date.

Among the specific study objectives are:
Does levothyroxine treatment for SCH provide benefits for 80-plus persons with SCH?
Are benefits seen across a wide range of outcomes, including health-related quality of life, muscle function, cognition and prevention of cardiovascular disease?
Are benefits seen in specific subgroups of people with SCH, including women, and those with mild degrees of SCH (TSH 4.6–10 mU/L)?
Are any benefits offset by adverse effects, such as atrial fibrillation or heart failure?

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism—initial L‑thyroxine dosing: With initial thyroid hormone replacement, replacement therapy requires approximately 1.6 μg/kg of L‑thyroxine daily; patients who are athyreotic and those with central hypothyroidism may require higher doses, while patients with subclinical hypothyroidism or after treatment for Graves’ disease may require less. In subclinical hypothyroidism, doses of 25–75 μg daily are usually sufficient for achieving euthyroid levels. One randomized controlled trial assigned starting doses by baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as 25 μg for TSH 4.0–8.0 mIU/L, 50 μg for TSH 8–12 mIU/L, and 75 μg for TSH >12 mIU/L, and after 2 months only minimal further adjustments were required to achieve euthyroidism.

Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: UNITHROID dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of UNITHROID by 12.5 mcg daily to 25 mcg daily and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable UNITHROID dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce UNITHROID dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure UNITHROID dose is appropriate.

New Onset Hypothyroidism: Normalize thyroid function as rapidly as possible. In patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, start UNITHROID at the full replacement dose (1.6 mcg per kg body weight per day). In patients with mild hypothyroidism (TSH less than 10 mIU per liter) start UNITHROID at 1 mcg per kg body weight per day. Evaluate serum TSH every 4 weeks and adjust UNITHROID dosage until a serum TSH is within the normal trimester specific range [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] .

Methods

The current preplanned combined analysis uses data from the TRUST (Thyroid hormone Replacement for Untreated older adults with Subclinical hypothyroidism Trial) trial and the IEMO 80-plus Thyroid trial. Both trials were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trials investigating the potential multimodal effects of levothyroxine treatment for persons with subclinical hypothyroidism aged 65 years and older, and aged 80 years and older, respectively. The identical design, study processes, and infrastructure allowed for a preplanned combined analysis. Consequently, the combined cohorts are presented and analyzed as a single study group throughout the manuscript.

The full study protocols and statistical analysis plans for the TRUST Thyroid trial and the IEMO 80-plus Thyroid trial have been published previously. In short, persons aged 65 years and older (TRUST Thyroid trial) or 80 years and older (IEMO 80-plus Thyroid trial) with a diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as elevated thyrotropin (thyroid stimulating hormone; TSH) levels (≥ 4.6 and ≤ 19.9 mIU/L), measured on at least 2 occasions with an interval between >3 months and 3 years apart, and free thyroxine (fT4) within normal local laboratory ranges, were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included, but were not limited to, the use of levothyroxine, antithyroid medication, clinical diagnosis of dementia, recent hospitalization for major illness, and terminal illness. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to levothyroxine or placebo.

The study medication consisted of levothyroxine sodium tablets and matching placebo tablets taken orally daily. The intervention group started with 50 micrograms daily (or 25 micrograms for participants with body weight < 50 kg or a history of coronary heart disease) and the control group with a matching placebo for 6 to 8 weeks. Two optional up- or down-titrations after 6- to 8-week intervals, and one at 12 months of follow-up ensured adequate treatment while avoiding potential overtreatment, mirroring routine clinical practice. An adaptive mock titration schedule was applied for the placebo group. Participants, general practitioners (GPs) and study personnel remained blinded to treatment allocation and thyroid function test results throughout the study. Ethics approval was obtained from the medical ethics committees and competent authorities in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Ireland. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Newborns

The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in newborn infants is 10-15 mcg/kg/day. A lower starting dose (e.g., 25 mcg/day) should be considered in infants at risk for cardiac failure, and the dose should be increased in 4-6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response to treatment. In infants with very low (< 5 mcg/dL) or undetectable serum T4 concentrations, the recommended initial starting dose is 50 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium.

Infants and Children

Levothyroxine therapy is usually initiated at full replacement doses, with the recommended dose per body weight decreasing with age (see TABLE 3). However, in children with chronic or severe hypothyroidism, an initial dose of 25 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended with increments of 25 mcg every 2-4 weeks until the desired effect is achieved.

Hyperactivity in an older child can be minimized if the starting dose is one-fourth of the recommended full replacement dose, and the dose is then increased on a weekly basis by an amount equal to one-fourth the full-recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached.

General Principles

In general, levothyroxine therapy should be instituted at full replacement doses as soon as possible. Delays in diagnosis and institution of therapy may have deleterious effects on the child's intellectual and physical growth and development.

Undertreatment and overtreatment should be avoided (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use).

LEVOTHROID®may be administered to infants and children who cannot swallow intact tablets by crushing the tablet and suspending the freshly crushed tablet in a small amount (5-10 mL or 1-2 teaspoons) of water. This suspension can be administered by spoon or dropper. DO NOT STORE THE SUSPENSION . Foods that decrease absorption of levothyroxine, such as soybean infant formula, should not be used for administering levothyroxine sodium tablets (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug-Food Interactions).

Newborns

The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in newborn infants is 10-15 mcg/kg/day . A lower starting dose (e.g., 25 mcg/day) should be considered in infants at risk for cardiac failure, and the dose should be increased in 4-6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response to treatment. In infants with very low (< 5 mcg/dL) or undetectable serum T4concentrations, the recommended initial starting dose is 50 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium.

Infants and Children

Levothyroxine therapy is usually initiated at full replacement doses, with the recommended dose per body weight decreasing with age (see Table 3). However, in children with chronic or severe hypothyroidism, an initial dose of 25 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended with increments of 25 mcg every 2-4 weeks until the desired effect is achieved.

Hyperactivity in an older child can be minimized if the starting dose is one-fourth of the recommended full replacement dose, and the dose is then increased on a weekly basis by an amount equal to one-fourth the full-recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached.

Pregnancy

Pregnancy may increase levothyroxine requirements (see Pregnancy).

Subclinical Hypothyroidism

If this condition is treated, a lower levothyroxine sodium dose (e.g., 1 mcg/kg/day) than that used for full replacement may be adequate to normalize the serum TSH level. Patients who are not treated should be monitored yearly for changes in clinical status and thyroid laboratory parameters.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^32fb980c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As millions of people around the world take LT4 daily and a huge number of patients with goiter or cancer undergo thyroidectomy, achieving robust data about the optimal starting LT4 dose should be important for helping the clinical practice of thyroidologists. The main goal of the present meta-analysis was to assess whether different approaches for a LT4 dose-choosing strategy would translate into a higher number of euthyroid patients at the first follow-up visit after total thyroidectomy.

The results of the present analysis show a mean percentage of euthyroid patients receiving LT4 at the first follow-up after thyroidectomy of ∼34%. This indicates that, in most patients, independently from the LT4 dose-choosing method used, TSH level was either below or above the normal range. The high heterogeneity in terms of euthyroidism rates observed across studies (ranging from 19% to 68%) using different dose-choosing strategies highlights the complexity of choosing an adequate starting LT4 replacement dose in thyroidectomized patients. We aimed to identify the primary contributors to this variability, considering methodological differences in LT4 dosing and patient characteristics by assessing whether different methods for estimating LT4 dose would lead to different results in terms of rates of euthyroidism achieved.

The studies included in our analysis employed different dosing approaches, including fixed-dose regimens, weight-based dosing (dose/kg), and individualized algorithms incorporating factors such as BMI, lean body mass (LBM), or age. We conducted mainly 2 comparative analyses: (1) dose/kg studies vs all other approaches and (2) weight-based, BMI-based, LBM-based dosing vs fixed-dose and other particular algorithm-based methods. In both analyses, the second group exhibited higher rates of euthyroidism; however, this was accompanied by greater heterogeneity and wider confidence intervals, primarily due to 1 study belonging to the second group reporting a 68% achievement rate among 31 patients. When considering how these factors were incorporated into dose-choosing algorithms, we found that only 1 study included LBM in its algorithm, yet it achieved a euthyroidism rate of just 26%, indicating no clear advantage over other methods. No study accounted for sex in the dose-choosing algorithm. Two studies included age as a variable, reporting euthyroidism rates of 67% and 58%. Three studies incorporated BMI into their algorithms. Two studies considered age and BMI, while 1 used a BMI-based approach, achieving a euthyroidism rate of 38%.

### How should we manage patients with mildly increased serum thyrotrophin concentrations? [^61739e45]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

A mildly increased serum thyrotrophin (TSH) is usually because of mild thyroid failure, and the most common aetiology in iodine-replete communities is chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. It is more common in women, and the prevalence increases with age in both men and women and is associated with the presence of antithyroid antibodies. The majority will have serum TSH levels between 5-10 mIU/l, normal free thyroxine (T4) levels and relatively few symptoms. In 2004, US evidence-based consensus guidelines concluded that there were no adverse outcomes of a mildly increased serum TSH other than a risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism and few data to justify levothyroxine therapy. There is still debate as to what constitutes an increased serum TSH, particularly in older subjects. Although some subjects will progress to overt hypothyroidism, recent data suggest a significant proportion revert to a serum TSH within the reference range without treatment. Two recent meta-analyses have suggested that the possible cardiovascular risks may be more significant in younger adults. Other data suggest that mild thyroid failure may be the only reversible cause of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. No appropriately powered prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded interventional trial of levothyroxine therapy for a mildly increased serum TSH exists. However, treatment in subjects who are symptomatic, pregnant or preconception, aged less than 65 years and older subjects with evidence of heart failure appear justified.

### Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over... [^71e80bd1]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical hypothyroidism is common in older people and its contribution to health and disease needs to be elucidated further. Observational and clinical trial data on the clinical effects of subclinical hypothyroidism in persons aged 80 years and over is inconclusive, with some studies suggesting harm and some suggesting benefits, translating into equipoise whether levothyroxine therapy provides clinical benefits. This manuscript describes the study protocol for the Institute for Evidence-Based Medicine in Old Age (IEMO) 80-plus thyroid trial to generate the necessary evidence base.

Methods

The IEMO 80-plus thyroid trial was explicitly designed as an ancillary experiment to the Thyroid hormone Replacement for Untreated older adults with Subclinical hypothyroidism randomised placebo controlled Trial (TRUST) with a near identical protocol and shared research infrastructure. Outcomes will be presented separately for the IEMO and TRUST 80-plus groups, as well as a pre-planned combined analysis of the 145 participants included in the IEMO trial and the 146 participants from the TRUST thyroid trial aged 80 years and over.

The IEMO 80-plus thyroid trial is a multi-centre randomised double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group trial of levothyroxine treatment in community-dwelling participants aged 80 years and over with persistent subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH ≥4.6 and ≤ 19.9 mU/L and fT4 within laboratory reference ranges). Participants are randomised to levothyroxine 25 or 50 micrograms daily or matching placebo with dose titrations according to TSH levels, for a minimum follow-up of one and a maximum of three years.

Primary study endpoints: hypothyroid physical symptoms and tiredness on the thyroid-related quality of life patient-reported outcome (ThyPRO) at one year. Secondary endpoints: generic quality of life, executive cognitive function, handgrip strength, functional ability, blood pressure, weight, body mass index, and mortality. Adverse events will be recorded with specific interest on cardiovascular endpoints such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure.

Discussion

The combined analysis of participants in the IEMO 80-plus thyroid trial with the participants aged over 80 in the TRUST trial will provide the largest experimental evidence base on multimodal effects of levothyroxine treatment in 80-plus persons to date.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^b72754b5]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association—congenital hypothyroidism dosing and monitoring use weight-based levothyroxine (LT4) with age-specific needs, definitions of starting doses, treatment targets, and follow-up. Newborn requirements are higher, with “newborns typically requiring 10 μg/kg/d, 1-year-old children 4–6 μg/kg/d, adolescents 2–4 μg/kg/d, with transition to the average adult dose of 1.6 μg/kg/d once endocrine maturation is complete.” In CH, “standard or low-dose therapy is defined by a range of 5–10 μg/kg/d, while high-dose regimens are defined as a range of 10–15 μg/kg/d,” and “Starting doses of 10–15 μg/kg/d have been reported to normalize T4 levels within 2–3 weeks, while doses <8 μg/kg/d result in normalization within 6–8 weeks.” Targets are to “keep the T4 level in the mid to upper half of the reference range and the TSH in the mid to lower half of the reference range, optimally between 0.5 and 2.0 mIU/L.” For follow-up, “surveillance testing with a TSH and T4 should be performed every 1–2 months during the first year of life,” and “For patients with severe CH, monthly surveillance during the first 6–12 months may be indicated.” For possible transient CH, “For patients with mild CH and no change in the LT4 dose over the first 3 years of life, a trial off LT4 therapy is reasonable,” and permanence is confirmed if on “repeat testing 4–6 weeks after stopping LT4 therapy” the “TSH rises and the T4 decreases.” Formulation and interactions are important: “Within the United States, there are no liquid formulations and there are no compounding processes that produce a stable concentration of LT4 in suspension. Efforts to create suspensions should be avoided,” and “Soy, iron, calcium, and infant colic drops (simethicone) can decrease the absorption of LT4, and concurrent ingestion should be avoided.” In selected cases with persistent TSH elevation despite adequate LT4 levels, “the addition of LT3 may result in normalization of TSH.”
