## Question

When should beta-blocker therapy be initiated in a post-myocardial infarction patient with an ejection fraction of less than 35% but without symptomatic heart failure, and how does the timing of initiation interact with revascularization procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to start beta-blocker therapy in a post-myocardial infarction patient with an ejection fraction less than 35% but without symptoms of heart failure, and how the timing of initiation should be coordinated with revascularization procedures like PCI or CABG. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's risk category and whether asymptomatic reduced LVEF changes the indication. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines say about timing and agent selection. Next, I will examine how PCI versus CABG timing interacts with beta-blocker initiation. After that, I need to review the evidence base supporting early versus delayed initiation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with monitoring and follow-up considerations, making sure I double-check for any contraindications and special scenarios like bradycardia or cardiogenic shock risk.

> Let me first confirm the risk category. An LVEF less than 35% after MI places the patient in a high-risk group for progression to heart failure, recurrent MI, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death, even without overt heart failure symptoms, so this is not a "preserved EF" scenario and warrants disease-modifying therapy including a beta-blocker unless contraindicated [^114o8xWv] [^115KtUYC].

> I should confirm the guideline stance on beta-blockers in this exact population. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA heart failure guideline recommends evidence-based beta-blockers for patients with recent MI and LVEF 40% or less to reduce mortality, and this extends to asymptomatic patients with reduced EF after MI, which clearly covers LVEF less than 35% even without symptoms, so the indication is strong here [^114o8xWv] [^1175CZA9]. The ESC 2023 ACS guidance similarly recommends initiating beta-blockers in ACS patients with LVEF 40% or less regardless of heart failure symptoms, reinforcing the indication in reduced EF post-MI [^115s7oqJ].

> Now, timing. Wait, let me verify the acute-phase cautions. Early oral beta-blockade within 24 hours of ACS is recommended if there is no contraindication, but I need to ensure hemodynamic stability and screen for cardiogenic shock risk, acute HF, bradycardia, or conduction disease before starting, because early intravenous beta-blockade has not shown consistent benefit and may be harmful in unstable patients; if there is instability, I should delay initiation and reassess within 24 hours [^112TzJJ1] [^112oCre1]. Hold on, I should verify the specific risk of early beta-blockade in shock-prone physiology; yes, early beta-blockade in Killip class II–IV or low output states increases risk, so I should avoid early initiation in those contexts and start once the patient is stabilized on GDMT with adequate perfusion and no signs of shock [^112TzJJ1] [^112oCre1].

> Next, I will examine how revascularization modality affects timing. If the patient underwent primary PCI, I should confirm that hemodynamics are stable before starting the beta-blocker. If unstable, I will delay and start oral therapy as soon as blood pressure and heart rate permit, typically within 24–48 hours once euvolemic and without signs of shock, with slow titration thereafter [^112TzJJ1] [^112oCre1]. If the patient is awaiting CABG, I need to check perioperative planning. Beta-blockers are often continued or initiated preoperatively in appropriate candidates, but I should coordinate with surgery and avoid starting high-dose beta-blockade de novo immediately pre-op in naïve patients. Instead, a modest oral dose begun when stable pre-op with planned continuation post-op is reasonable, with dose titration after recovery from surgery [^116pPNDK]. But wait, what if the patient is still in the early high-risk window with very low EF and tenuous hemodynamics? In that case, I should prioritize stabilization, inotrope weaning, and GDMT optimization before initiating beta-blockade to avoid precipitating low output or shock [^112oCre1].

> I will now review the evidence supporting early initiation in reduced EF. The CAPRICORN trial in post-MI patients with LVEF 40% or less showed a 23% reduction in all-cause mortality with carvedilol, with benefits emerging early and accruing over time, supporting timely initiation once stabilized; this is the clearest randomized evidence in the reperfusion era for reduced EF post-MI [^111xhrrh]. Let me double-check the early hazard signal; the first 30 days in CAPRICORN actually showed early benefit without excess early harm in stabilized patients, which reassures me that early initiation after stabilization is safe and beneficial in this phenotype [^1111jeBT]. Mechanistically, beta-blockers reduce myocardial oxygen demand, blunt maladaptive remodeling, and lower arrhythmic risk, all of which are salient in reduced EF post-MI even without overt HF symptoms [^1146unbu].

> Hold on, I should verify agent selection and titration. Carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, and bisoprolol are the evidence-based beta-blockers with mortality benefit in HFrEF and are appropriate choices post-MI with reduced EF; I should start low, for example carvedilol 3.125–6.25 mg twice daily or metoprolol succinate 12.5–25 mg daily, and titrate every 2–4 weeks toward target doses as tolerated, recognizing that even partial doses confer benefit and that abrupt withdrawal is harmful [^113roJAv] [^111xhrrh]. I need to ensure concurrent GDMT is in place, including ACE inhibitor or ARB and statin, and consider aldosterone antagonist if EF remains 35% or less with symptoms or diabetes, because combined neurohormonal blockade improves remodeling and outcomes in this stage B HF population [^114o8xWv] [^1135cAJa].

> Let me consider special scenarios. If the patient develops bradycardia or conduction abnormalities that limit up-titration, I should confirm whether pacing is indicated. In selected patients with bradycardia-related contraindications, pacemaker-enabled beta-blockade has been explored, but this is investigational and not routine, so I should individualize and prioritize safety and tolerability first [^112TzJJ1]. If there is any concern for early cardiogenic shock or ongoing ischemia with instability, I should delay beta-blocker initiation until after hemodynamic stabilization and reassess daily for eligibility [^112TzJJ1].

> Next, I should review duration and follow-up. I need to ensure continued beta-blocker therapy long term in this reduced EF phenotype because the indication is mortality reduction and disease modification. Even if symptoms improve and EF recovers modestly, continuation is appropriate unless adverse effects or new contraindications arise, with periodic reassessment of heart rate, blood pressure, volume status, and EF trajectory [^114o8xWv] [^1175CZA9]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said to stop after 1 year if EF normalizes; that would be a mistake for someone with prior LVEF less than 35%, as the risk remains elevated and guideline-directed continuation is advised unless a compelling reason to stop emerges [^113roJAv].

> Putting this together, my practical recommendation is as follows. If hemodynamically stable without contraindications, initiate oral beta-blocker within 24–48 hours after PCI once euvolemic and off inotropes, or as soon as feasible post-CABG recovery, using carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol and titrating toward target doses over weeks to months alongside ACE inhibitor or ARB and high-intensity statin. If unstable, stabilize first and start as soon as feasible thereafter, reassessing daily for readiness [^112TzJJ1] [^113roJAv]. I should double-check for bradycardia, hypotension, PR prolongation, asthma, or signs of low output before each uptitration and adjust accordingly, maintaining therapy long term given the robust indication in reduced EF post-MI even without symptoms [^112oCre1] [^111xhrrh].

Beta-blockers should be started in post-MI patients with LVEF < 35% and no heart failure symptoms **as soon as they are hemodynamically stable** (typically within 24–48 hours) [^112TzJJ1] [^112oCre1], after PCI or CABG, unless contraindicated [^112oCre1]. Early initiation reduces mortality, reinfarction, and ventricular arrhythmias [^112TzJJ1] [^111xhrrh], and is supported by guidelines for ACS with reduced LVEF [^115s7oqJ] [^114o8xWv]. If contraindications are present, start once resolved; if not tolerated, consider a pacemaker to enable therapy [^116pPNDK].

## Clinical evidence supporting beta-blocker therapy

Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses demonstrate **significant benefits** of beta-blocker therapy in post-MI patients with reduced LVEF:

- **CAPRICORN trial**: Carvedilol reduced all-cause mortality by 23% and recurrent MI by 41% in post-MI patients with LVEF ≤ 40% [^116LXBXB].

- **MERIT-HF**: Metoprolol CR/XL reduced total mortality by 40% and sudden death by 50% in post-MI patients with chronic heart failure [^112YPg63].

- **Meta-analyses**: Consistently show reductions in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and recurrent MI in post-MI patients without heart failure [^112Vp7kt].

---

## Timing of beta-blocker initiation

The timing of beta-blocker initiation is **critical**:

- **Early initiation (within 24–48 hours)**: Recommended for hemodynamically stable patients after MI, including those undergoing PCI or CABG, unless contraindicated [^117BU3GU] [^112oCre1].

- **Delayed initiation**: Considered if contraindications such as cardiogenic shock, severe bradycardia, or significant conduction abnormalities are present [^112oCre1].

---

## Interaction with revascularization procedures

Revascularization by PCI or CABG **does not negate the need** for beta-blocker therapy in patients with reduced LVEF. Beta-blockers provide additional benefits beyond revascularization, including:

- **Reduction in mortality and recurrent MI**: Demonstrated in CAPRICORN and other trials, even in patients receiving contemporary medical therapy and revascularization [^1119DULg].

- **Prevention of ventricular arrhythmias**: Beta-blockers significantly reduce the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, a common complication in patients with reduced LVEF [^116gfcic].

- **Improvement in left ventricular function**: Beta-blockers have been shown to improve LVEF and reduce adverse remodeling [^113xoxtr].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Current guidelines provide **clear recommendations** on beta-blocker therapy in this patient population:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ESC 2023 | Initiate beta-blockers in patients with ACS and LVEF ≤ 40%, regardless of heart failure symptoms [^115s7oqJ] |
| AHA/ACC 2022 | Beta-blockers recommended for patients with recent MI and LVEF ≤ 40% to reduce mortality and heart failure hospitalizations [^notfound] |
| NHFA/CSANZ 2016 | Initiate beta-blockers in patients with reduced LVEF (≤ 40%) unless contraindicated [^111n2ER3] |

---

## Practical considerations and contraindications

While beta-blocker therapy is beneficial, clinicians must consider **potential contraindications** and patient-specific factors:

- **Contraindications**: Cardiogenic shock, severe bradycardia, significant conduction abnormalities, and active bronchospastic disease [^112oCre1].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, and medication tolerance should be considered when initiating and titrating beta-blocker therapy [^113roJAv].

- **Alternative therapies**: If beta-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated, consider alternative therapies such as calcium channel blockers or device therapy (e.g. pacemaker) to enable beta-blocker use [^116pPNDK].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Beta-blocker therapy should be initiated in post-MI patients with LVEF < 35% and no heart failure symptoms **as soon as they are hemodynamically stable**, typically within 24–48 hours after PCI or CABG. Early initiation provides significant benefits in reducing mortality, recurrent MI, and ventricular arrhythmias. Clinicians should consider patient-specific factors and contraindications when initiating therapy and explore alternative options if beta-blockers are not tolerated [^111xhrrh] [^112TzJJ1].

Implications on guidelines

Current evidence on beta-blocker therapy, largely derived from observational studies, is conflicting, leading to variability in clinical guidelines. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends beta-blockers for patients with STEMI or NSTEMI and reduced LVEF (< 40%), and suggests long-term treatment for those with a history of prior MI, though without specifying duration. Its current guideline for ACS management recommends beta-blocker use in patients with LVEF ≤ 40% but does not distinguish between STEMI and NSTEMI or provide guidance on long-term therapy (Figure 2). Similarly, the current AHA/ACC guideline for chronic coronary disease management recommends beta-blocker therapy for patients with LVEF < 50% but advises reassessing the indication of treatment at 1-year post-MI for patients without reduced LVEF. They do not recommend long-term therapy for those with LVEF > 50%. The National Heart Foundation of Australia & Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (NHFA/CSANZ) Guidelines for ACS management (Figure 3) recommends beta-blocker therapy for patients with LVEF < 40%, without differentiating between STEMI and NSTEMI, and lacks clear guidance for those with LVEF > 40%.

Classification of beta-blocker therapy

Outpatient drug prescription data prior to and following the index hospitalization were determined using the Pharmaceutical Information Network database. Dispensations for all commercially available BBs from 1 year prior to admission to 6 years after discharge from the index hospitalization were determined for all patients. BB prescriptions dispensed between 7 days before to 30 days after discharge were considered as new if they did not have a dispensation in the 1 year prior to admission. BB dosing was assessed at index discharge, 180 days, and 365 days, and classified as low, medium, or high according to equivalent mean metoprolol SR daily dose (low = < 50 mg, med = −50 to ≤ 125 mg, and high = ≥ 125 mg). Patients were classified as early BB discontinuation if their last BB prescription ended within 180 days of discharge and as standard BB treatment if treatment persisted beyond 180 days. Since early BB prescription post-MI was universally recommended in the absence of contraindications during the study period, the 180-day threshold was used for our landmark analysis to ensure that all patients were deemed BB-eligible by their attending cardiologists during the index AMI hospitalization and most would have had the opportunity for post-AMI cardiology follow-up, with the assumption that prescriptions extending beyond that time were intended to continue long-term. This design strives to emulate a clinical trial of short- vs long-duration BB use post-MI similar in design to the ABYSS trial and avoids some pitfalls of observational research including immortal time bias and failure to align start of follow-up, specification of eligibility, and treatment assignment.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was a composite of mortality, recurrent AMI, or repeat coronary revascularization. Recurrent AMI was defined as a hospital discharge for STEMI, NSTEMI, or AMI unspecified based on a validated approach using the most-responsible diagnosis from the Discharge Abstract Database (Supplemental Table 1). Repeat coronary revascularization was defined as any percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting procedures, identified from APPROACH. Secondary outcomes were the individual components of this composite.

Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

European and American guidelines regarding BB use post‐MI are conflicting, especially regarding the duration of the treatment. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology 2013 guidelines for STEMI recommend that BB should be used in the long term in patients without HF, unless contraindicated. 29 The 2014 NTEMI suggest that it might be reasonable to prescribe BB in non‐HF patients indefinitely (Class IIa). 30 However, in both scenarios, the long term is limited to 3 years according to the 2011 AHA/American College of Cardiology secondary prevention update (Class I), and any therapy beyond 3 years might be reasonable (Class IIa). 31 In the absence of trials in the postreperfusion era, the European Society of Cardiology 2012 STEMI guidelines have switched the level of recommendation of long‐term BB therapy from class I to IIa in 2012, 32 and kept the same class in the recently published 2017 guidelines. 33 Interestingly, no specific guidance for the use of BB in patients without HF was published in the 2015 European Society of Cardiology non‐ST‐elevation MI guidelines. 34 In the light of our results, it might be reasonable to consider BB in primary prevention for high‐risk patients — such as those with hypertension and diabetes mellitus — in order to improve mortality when those patients develop an ACS. Nevertheless, replication of our data in other registries and doing a randomized clinical trial are mandatory before any formal recommendation.

### Pharmacologic therapies across the continuum of left ventricular dysfunction [^113xoxtr]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Neurohormonal activation and increased sympathetic stimulation are among the factors that have been linked to the development and progression of left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and heart failure (HF) in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Various available pharmacologic therapies can target these factors and improve many aspects of the disease, depending on the degree of LVD. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists because of their proven favorable effects on symptoms, left ventricular function, cardiac remodeling, hospitalization rates, and survival. However, they are not being used in over two thirds of patients with post-MI LVD. This review illustrates the impact of these therapies on post-MI LVD patients using evidence from multiple clinical trials. In addition, current and emerging treatments for acute decompensated HF will be outlined.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, more specifically with respect to beta-blockers, ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to initiate β-blockers to reduce SCD and all-cause mortality in patients with HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 40%).

### Β-blockers in hypertension, diabetes, heart failure and acute myocardial infarction: a review of the literature [^116gfcic]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

The Carvedilol Post Infarction Survival Control in Left Ventricular Dysfunction (CAPRICORN) trial enrolled 1959 patients in this multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. Patients with a LVEF < 40% and who had an AMI were randomised to carvedilol 6.25 mg twice daily or placebo. The primary end point was all-cause mortality or CV readmissions. All-cause mortality was lower in the carvedilol group compared with placebo (116 (12%) vs 151 (15%), 0.77 (0.60 to 0.98), p = 0.03). Additionally, carvedilol caused a 76% reduction in arrhythmias (VT and VF/flutter, p < 0.0001), a 52% reduction in supraventricular arrhythmias (p = 0.0015) and a 26% reduction in SCD (p = 0.098) compared with placebo.

The Carvedilol Acute Myocardial Infarction Study (CAMIS) trial enlisted 232 patients with post-MI to receive carvedilol or atenolol for a 12-month period. Patients received therapy within 24 h of onset of chest pain. There was no difference in the LVEF between the two groups and no significant reduction in the occurrence of a first serious CV event with carvedilol versus atenolol (RR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.30, p = 0.524). However, compared with atenolol, carvedilol was better tolerated (20% vs 33%; p = 0.025) and there were numerically fewer deaths (2 vs 5, RR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.95, p = 0.25). This trial highlights the fact that carvedilol might be better tolerated than atenolol, but a larger trial is required to know if carvedilol is superior to atenolol in patients with post-AMI with normal LVEF.

### Β-blocker therapy after myocardial infarction: a little goes a long way [^116W8Nf9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Over 40 years have passed since the first randomized placebo‐controlled trials demonstrated a mortality benefit of β‐blockers (BBLs) after acute myocardial infarction (MI). Since that time, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has become the mainstay of reperfusion in ST‐segment–elevation MI (STEMI), and an early invasive strategy is routine in non–ST‐segment–elevation MI. Current generation drug‐eluting stents are standard in PCI and have low rates of restenosis and thrombosis. Statin and dual‐antiplatelet therapy are near universal; and in patients with heart failure, renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors and ultimately implantable cardioverters‐defibrillators reduce mortality. Despite extensive research on the efficacy of BBLs in acute MI, there remain several unanswered questions. A 2019 Cochrane systematic review that included 63 randomized trials (n = 85 550) of BBLs versus placebo or no BBLs concluded that BBLs reduced the risk of reinfarction in the short‐term, defined as within 3 months, and all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality after that time point. However, the duration of the mortality benefit was not specified. Despite the power of the analysis, the effect of BBLs on major adverse cardiovascular events, nonfatal MI, and angina was uncertain. Remarkably, no trials reported adverse events related to BBL therapy. In an era where polypharmacy is common, adherence is a concern, and deescalation strategies are being considered to reduce untoward drug effects and cost, the optimal duration of BBLs after MI is highly relevant.

Left ventricular dysfunction due to prior myocardial infarction — Class IIa recommendations specify that implantation of an ICD is reasonable in patients with LV dysfunction due to prior MI who are at least 40 d post-MI, have an LVEF of less than or equal to 30% to 35%, are NYHA functional class I on chronic optimal medical therapy, and who have reasonable expectation of survival with a good functional status for more than 1 y. Amiodarone, often in combination with beta blockers, can be useful for patients with LV dysfunction due to prior MI and symptoms due to VT unresponsive to beta-adrenergic–blocking agents. Sotalol is reasonable therapy to reduce symptoms resulting from VT for patients with LV dysfunction due to prior MI unresponsive to beta-blocking agents. Adjunctive therapies to the ICD, including catheter ablation or surgical resection, and pharmacological therapy with agents such as amiodarone or sotalol are reasonable to improve symptoms due to frequent episodes of sustained VT or VF in patients with LV dysfunction due to prior MI. Amiodarone is reasonable therapy to reduce symptoms due to recurrent hemodynamically stable VT for patients with LV dysfunction due to prior MI who cannot or refuse to have an ICD implanted. Implantation is reasonable for treatment of recurrent ventricular tachycardia in patients post-MI with normal or near normal ventricular function who are receiving chronic optimal medical therapy and who have reasonable expectation of survival with a good functional status for more than 1 y.

### Management of post-myocardial infarction patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction [^111drabm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

After a myocardial infarction (MI), patients are at risk for reinfarction, heart failure (HF), and sudden death. This risk is much higher in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Although post-MI patients with LVSD have an even greater risk of mortality and morbidity, they had been generally excluded from clinical trials. This article reviews recent clinical trials that included post-MI patients with LVSD with or without signs and symptoms of HF. These trials have defined the benefits of pharmacologic management and device therapy in patients who survive an MI in the presence of LVSD.

Ivabradine — trial context and patient selection details: Ivabradine "selectively inhibits the I f current in the sinoatrial node, providing heart rate reduction". "One RCT demonstrated the efficacy of ivabradine in reducing the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization". "The benefit of ivabradine was driven by a reduction in HF hospitalization". The study population included HFrEF with "NYHA class II-IV" and "left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, in sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate of ≥ 70 bpm", excluded "a myocardial infarction within the preceding 2 months", required prior HF hospitalization "in the preceding 12 months" and "stable GDMT for 4 weeks", and noted that "only 25% of patients studied were on optimal doses of beta-blocker therapy"; therefore, "it is important to initiate and up titrate these agents to target doses, as tolerated, before assessing the resting heart rate for consideration of ivabradine initiation".

### Effect of long-term β-blocker treatment following myocardial infarction among stable, optimally treated patients without heart failure in the reperfusion era: a Danish, nationwide cohort study [^114Qajfq]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

We aimed to investigate the long-term cardio-protective effect associated with beta-blocker (BB) treatment in stable, optimally treated myocardial infarction (MI) patients without heart failure (HF).

Methods and Results

Using nationwide registries, we included patients with first-time MI undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during admission and treated with both acetyl-salicylic acid and statins post-discharge between 2003 and 2018. Patients with prior history of MI, prior BB use, or any alternative indication or contraindication for BB treatment were excluded. Follow-up began 3 months following discharge in patients alive, free of cardiovascular (CV) events or procedures. Primary outcomes were CV death, recurrent MI, and a composite outcome of CV events. We used adjusted logistic regression and reported standardized absolute risks and differences (ARD) 3 years after MI. Overall, 30 177 stable, optimally treated MI patients were included (58% acute PCI, 26% sub-acute PCI, 16% CAG without intervention). At baseline, 82% of patients were on BB treatment (median age 61years, 75% male) and 18% were not (median age 62years, 68% male). BB treatment was associated with a similar risk of CV death, recurrent MI, and the composite outcome of CV events compared with no BB treatment [ARD (95% confidence intervals)] correspondingly; 0.1% (-0.3% to 0.5%), 0.2% (-0.7% to 1.2%), and 1.2% (-0.2% to 2.7%).

Conclusions

In this nationwide cohort study of stable, optimally treated MI patients without HF, we found no long-term effect of BB treatment on CV prognosis following the patients from 3 months to 3 years after MI admission.

### Clinical events after discontinuation of β-blockers in patients without heart failure optimally treated after acute myocardial infarction: a cohort study on the French healthcare databases [^115sf8Be]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2018). Low credibility.

Background

β-blockers have been among the first medications shown to improve outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). With the advent of reperfusion therapy and other secondary-prevention medications, their role has become uncertain, and large-scale experience after AMI in the contemporary era is lacking. In particular, the effect of stopping β-blockers in patients initially treated after AMI is unknown.

Methods and Results

Using the French healthcare databases, 73450 patients (< 80 years of age), admitted for AMI in 2007 to 2012, without acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the previous 2 years and no evidence of heart failure, having received optimal treatment with myocardial revascularization and all recommended medications in the 4 months after index admission, and not having discontinued β-blockers before 1 year, were followed for 3.8 years on average. β-Blocker discontinuation was defined as 4 consecutive months without exposure. If β-blocker treatment was resumed later on, follow-up was stopped. Both the risk of the composite outcome of death or admission for ACS and the risk of all-cause mortality were assessed in relation with β-blocker discontinuation during follow-up. Adjusted hazard ratios were estimated using marginal structural models accounting for time-varying confounders affected by previous exposure. A similar analysis was performed with statins. Of 204592 patient-years, 12002 (5.9%) corresponded to discontinued β-blocker treatment. For β-blocker discontinuation, the adjusted hazard ratio for death or ACS was 1.17 (95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.35); for all-cause death, the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.13 (95% confidence interval, 0.94–1.36). In contrast, for statin discontinuation, the adjusted hazard ratios for death or ACS and for all-cause death were 2.31 (95% confidence interval, 2.01–2.65) and 2.57 (95% confidence interval, 2.19–3.02), respectively.

Conclusions

In routine care of patients without heart failure, revascularized and optimally treated after AMI, discontinuation of β-blockers beyond 1 year after AMI was associated with an increased risk of death or readmission for ACS, while statistical significance was not reached for the association with all-cause mortality. A contemporary randomized clinical trial is needed to precise the role of β-blockers in the long-term treatment after AMI.

Time-dependent risk after clinical events shows that the risk of SCD is not linear over time, with the most rapid attrition during the first 6 to 18 mo after the index event. Curves of this type have been generated in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, new onset of heart failure, unstable angina, and high-risk patients with recent myocardial infarction (MI), and benefits from controlled trials may diverge early with post-MI beta-blockers and clopidogrel in ACSs or later with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins. Mortality is highest in the first month after acute MI in patients with ejection fraction (EF) of less than 30%.

### Β-blockers and mortality after acute myocardial infarction in patients without heart failure or ventricular dysfunction [^1132gVGd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

No randomized trials have tested the efficacy of β-blockers on long-term mortality among patients with AMI without HF or LVSD. Until now, the largest study, which comprised 6,758 propensity score–matched patients with AMI, found no reduction in mortality according to use of β-blockers. Notably, this study censored data in 2009 and did not investigate the impact of β-blockers on mortality among patients without HF or according to diagnosis of STEMI and NSTEMI. A smaller, but more recent study found that the discontinuation of β-blockers at 1 year was not associated with higher 5-year mortality. This finding is important because guidelines recommend that β-blockers be prescribed long term for patients after AMI who have HF, and it is uncertain as to whether β-blockers are beneficial for patients without HF but who have presented to the hospital with STEMI or NSTEMI.

In an era of coronary revascularization for AMI, whether it is primary PCI for acute STEMI or a risk-dependent early invasive strategy for NSTEMI, the likelihood of preserving more viable and therefore less arrhythmogenic myocardium is potentially greater than that of the noninterventional era. Arguably, in the absence of HF or LVSD, our study revealed that such patients who do not use β-blockers are at equal risk of death as those who do. Moreover, we found that the lack of effect of β-blockers on survival was evident for both STEMI and NSTEMI, and at early and later time points. Because β-blockers are not without potential harm, and given that many patients report side effects and that incremental numbers of medications are associated with reduced drug adherence, secondary prevention medications at hospital discharge for patients with AMI and without HF may not need to include β-blockers. Indeed, the European Society of Cardiology STEMI guidelines suggest that β-blockers be commenced in-hospital and continued long term after AMI but only with a Class IIa, Level of Evidence: B recommendation. For NSTEMI, a Class I, Level of Evidence: A recommendation is provided for the use of β-blockers but only in the context of HF. This recommendation contrasts with the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, which recommend oral β-blockers as a Class I indication for all patients with AMI who do not have a contraindication.

### One-year landmark analysis of the effect of beta-blocker dose on survival after acute myocardial infarction [^114SUM8t]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Given the tremendous advances that have been made in the management of acute MI and post‐MI treatments, it is necessary to reconsider the role of beta‐blocker therapy. However, the relevant question is no longer whether all patients with acute MI should be treated with beta‐blockers. The OBTAIN studyand this substudy support the need for a new paradigm that addresses which patients should be treated, for how long, and at what dose. An important role for personalized medicine in the management of this diverse patient population must be incorporated. Further randomized clinical trials are required to prospectively test dosing and treatment durations for beta‐blocker therapy following acute MI.

### Β-blocker therapy after myocardial infarction: a little goes a long way [^113bqgHy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The optimal dosing of BBL therapy after MI in the contemporary era is another unanswered question. The dosing of BBL was not collected in the Cardiovascular Risk and Identification of Potential High‐Risk Population in Acute Myocardial Infarction registry, and the interaction of dose and duration on outcomes after MI is unknown. The only contemporary randomized controlled trial of BBL versus placebo that investigated outcomes past 3 years was in a selected group of patients with MI, those with STEMI undergoing primary PCI who had normal ejection fraction. In the study, 801 patients were enrolled and the BBL was carvedilol. The intended dose titration was to 20 mg/d; however, dosing was at the discretion of the physician and averaged only 6.3 mg/d at 1 year. The trial failed to show a benefit of BBL on the primary outcome, which was a composite of all‐cause death, MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and acute coronary syndrome. Although the low dose of BBLs may have influenced the potential therapeutic effect, several national registries suggest that patients after MI are treated with BBL doses well below the target range of earlier randomized trials. In addition, several nonrandomized studies supported the use of BBL over no BBL but failed to demonstrate a greater effect of high‐ compared with low‐dose therapy, with low dose defined as either < 25% or 50% of the target dose, depending on the study. In the OBTAIN registry, in fact, the lowest mortality was found with 25% of the target dose.

Circling back to the optimal duration of BBL therapy after MI, this rigorously adjusted analysis adds evidence that maintenance therapy beyond 36 months is associated with lower mortality. A review of landmark analyses from large national registries evaluating benefits of long‐term use of BBLs after acute MI, however, shows conflicting results, with several showing no difference in mortality or composite outcomes (Table). So, how can the results be so divergent? Although these observational trials provide a window into real‐world practices and outcomes, differences in patient populations, BBL cardioselectivity and dosing, analytic techniques, and unmeasured confounders exist. Ultimately, evidence from ongoing adequately powered randomized trials is required to make definitive recommendations.

### Practical guidelines to optimize effectiveness of β-blockade in patients postinfarction and in those with chronic heart failure [^114UL57Z]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Antiadrenergic therapy reduces the risks of death and major morbidity in patients postinfarction and in those with chronic heart failure. Despite the common perception, these benefits are not attributable to a class effect, and clinical trials reveal evidence of specific agents that provide clinical advantages. To optimize patient outcome in the postinfarction setting, propranolol or timolol should be used in the setting of preserved ventricular function, and carvedilol should be used in patients with impaired ventricular function, with or without clinical evidence of heart failure. Patients with chronic heart failure are at lower risk of death when treated with carvedilol, which is also associated with a lower incidence of developing diabetes mellitus-related adverse events. This article reviews the scientific evidence for the hierarchy of antiadrenergic agents and addresses practical issues associated with initiation of therapy and long-term management.

### Long-term use of beta-blockers after myocardial infarction in the United States [^116WCsLi]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, we find overall low use of beta-blocker therapy post-MI and evidence of treatment inertia with minimal de-escalation among those on beta-blockers in contemporary U.S. practice. Our findings suggest that a substantial proportion of post-MI patients may be affected by the results of recently completed and ongoing clinical trials as well as CCD guideline changes.

### Comparative effectiveness of β-blocker use beyond 3 years after myocardial infarction and long-term outcomes among elderly patients [^112gpyXU]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The benefit of β-blocker use beyond 3 years after a myocardial infarction (MI) has not been clearly determined.

Methods and Results

Using data from the CRUSADE Registry (Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes With Early Implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines) linked with Medicare claims, we studied patients ≥ 65 years of age with MI, discharged on β-blocker therapy and alive 3 years later without a recurrent MI to evaluate β-blocker use and dose (none, < 50%, and ≥ 50% of the recommended target) at 3 years. Using inverse probability of treatment weighting, we then examined the adjusted association between β-blocker use (and dose) at 3 years and the cardiovascular composite of all-cause mortality, hospitalization for recurrent MI, ischemic stroke, or heart failure over the subsequent 5 years. Of the 6893 patients ≥ 65 years age, β-blocker use at 3 years was 72.2% (n = 4980); 43% (n = 2162) of these were treated with ≥ 50% of the target β-blocker dose. β-blocker use was not associated with a significant difference on the composite outcome (52.4% versus 55.4%, adjusted hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.88–1.03; P = 0.23). Neither low dose (< 50% target dose) nor high dose (≥ 50% target dose) β-blocker use was associated with a significant difference in risk when compared with no β-blocker use. Results were also consistent in patients with and without heart failure or systolic dysfunction (P interaction = 0.30).

Conclusions

In this observational analysis, β-blocker use beyond 3 years post-MI, regardless of the dose achieved, was not associated with improved outcomes. The role of prolonged β-blocker use, particularly in older adults, needs further investigation.

### Effects of carvedilol early after myocardial infarction: analysis of the first 30 days in carvedilol post-infarct survival control in left ventricular dysfunction (CAPRICORN) [^1111jeBT]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

In the CAPRICORN trial, carvedilol reduced all-cause mortality by 23% over a mean follow-up of 1.3 years in clinically stabilized post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) with or without signs of heart failure. This analysis sought to assess the impact of carvedilol within the first 30 days of randomization.

Methods

The effect of carvedilol initiated after acute MI with LVD (n = 975) was compared with the effect of placebo (n = 984) added to other standard-of-care therapies on mortality, fatal or nonfatal infarction, cardiac arrest, and their composite as well as withdrawals for adverse events during the first 30 days of therapy.

Results

The carvedilol group experienced a reduction in mortality in the first 30 days (19 vs 33, hazard ratio [HR] 0.58, 95% CI 0.33–1.02); fatal or nonfatal MI (13 vs 23, HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.29–1.12); the composite end point of death, nonfatal MI, or cardiac arrest (31 vs 53, HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38–0.91); and the composite of all-cause mortality or nonfatal MI (29 vs 51, HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36–0.90). These effects were similar in direction and magnitude to those observed during the entire trial. The rates of adverse events leading to withdrawal were similar in the carvedilol and placebo groups, except for hypotension.

Conclusions

In clinically stabilized post-MI patients with LVD, there is an early benefit with carvedilol treatment that is similar to that seen during long-term therapy.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112oCre1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes — beta-blocker therapy: In patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) without contraindications, early (< 24 hours) initiation of oral beta-blocker therapy is recommended to reduce risk of reinfarction and ventricular arrhythmias, and a low dose should be started early after diagnosis of ACS (< 24 hours) with slow dose escalation as blood pressure and heart rate permit; examples of contraindications include acute heart failure (HF) [Killip class II–IV], low cardiac output or risk for cardiogenic shock, PR interval > 0.24 milliseconds, second- or third-degree heart block without a pacemaker, severe bradycardia, and active bronchospasm. Use should be discontinued in those with new or worsening HF symptoms or signs of cardiogenic shock. In hemodynamically stable patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who do not have acute HF, intravenous beta blockers can be administered prior to reperfusion if there are ongoing symptoms or a clinical indication, but routine use prior to PPCI is not supported because of inconsistent results regarding infarct size or clinical outcomes. Patients with an initial contraindication can be reassessed after 24 hours for initiation if the contraindication has resolved, although the optimal duration of beta-blocker use remains unclear in patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and a randomized trial did not confirm long-term benefit after hospital discharge in lower risk patients with preserved LV function who had undergone coronary revascularization.

### Beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction [^112Vp7kt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 7.4 million people died from ischaemic heart disease in 2012, constituting 15% of all deaths. Beta-blockers are recommended and are often used in patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. However, it is currently unclear whether beta-blockers should be used in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. Previous meta-analyses on the topic have shown conflicting results. No previous systematic review using Cochrane methods has assessed the effects of beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of beta-blockers compared with placebo or no treatment in patients without heart failure and with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 40% in the non-acute phase after myocardial infarction.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index - Expanded, BIOSIS Citation Index, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, European Medicines Agency, Food and Drug Administration, Turning Research Into Practice, Google Scholar, and SciSearch from their inception to February 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials assessing effects of beta-blockers versus control (placebo or no treatment) in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction, irrespective of publication type and status, date, and language. We excluded trials randomising participants with diagnosed heart failure at the time of randomisation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed our published protocol, with a few changes made, and methodological recommendations provided by Cochrane and Jakobsen and colleagues. Two review authors independently extracted data. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and major cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial reinfarction). Our secondary outcomes were quality of life, angina, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction during follow-up. We assessed all outcomes at maximum follow-up. We systematically assessed risks of bias using seven bias domains and we assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 25 trials randomising a total of 22,423 participants (mean age 56.9 years). All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias. In all, 24 of 25 trials included a mixed group of participants with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST myocardial infarction, and no trials provided separate results for each type of infarction. One trial included participants with only ST-elevation myocardial infarction. All trials except one included participants younger than 75 years of age. Methods used to exclude heart failure were various and were likely insufficient. A total of 21 trials used placebo, and four trials used no intervention, as the comparator. All patients received usual care; 24 of 25 trials were from the pre-reperfusion era (published from 1974 to 1999), and only one trial was from the reperfusion era (published in 2018). The certainty of evidence was moderate to low for all outcomes. Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 97.5% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.90; I² = 15%; 22,085 participants, 21 trials; moderate-certainty evidence) and myocardial reinfarction (RR 0.76, 98% CI 0.69 to 0.88; I² = 0%; 19,606 participants, 19 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events (RR 0.72, 97.5% CI 0.69 to 0.84; 14,994 participants, 15 trials; low-certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.73, 98% CI 0.68 to 0.85; I² = 47%; 21,763 participants, 19 trials; low-certainty evidence). Hence, evidence seems to suggest that beta-blockers versus placebo or no treatment may result in a minimum reduction of 10% in RR for risks of all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction. However, beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may not affect the risk of angina (RR 1.04, 98% CI 0.93 to 1.13; I² = 0%; 7115 participants, 5 trials; low-certainty evidence). No trials provided data on serious adverse events according to good clinical practice from the International Committee for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH-GCP), nor on quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Beta-blockers probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality and myocardial reinfarction in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. Beta-blockers may further reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality compared with placebo or no intervention in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. These effects could, however, be driven by patients with unrecognised heart failure. The effects of beta-blockers on serious adverse events, angina, and quality of life are unclear due to sparse data or no data at all. All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias, and incomplete outcome data bias alone could account for the effect seen when major cardiovascular events, angina, and myocardial infarction are assessed. The evidence in this review is of moderate to low certainty, and the true result may depart substantially from the results presented here. Future trials should particularly focus on patients 75 years of age and older, and on assessment of serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP and quality of life. Newer randomised clinical trials at low risk of bias and at low risk of random errors are needed if the benefits and harms of beta-blockers in contemporary patients without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction are to be assessed properly. Such trials ought to be designed according to the SPIRIT statement and reported according to the CONSORT statement.

Stage B structural heart disease without heart failure symptoms — Class I care includes the following. All Class I recommendations for Stage A should apply to patients with cardiac structural abnormalities who have not developed HF (Levels of Evidence: A, B, and C as appropriate). Beta-blockers and ACEIs should be used in all patients with a recent or remote history of MI regardless of EF or presence of HF (see Table 3) (Level of Evidence: A). Beta-blockers are indicated in all patients without a history of MI who have a reduced LVEF with no HF symptoms (see Table 3 and text) (Level of Evidence: C). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors should be used in patients with a reduced EF and no symptoms of HF, even if they have not experienced MI (Level of Evidence: A). An ARB should be administered to post-MI patients without HF who are intolerant of ACEIs and have a low LVEF (Level of Evidence: B). Patients who have not developed HF symptoms should be treated according to contemporary guidelines after an acute MI (Level of Evidence: C). Coronary revascularization should be recommended in appropriate patients without symptoms of HF in accordance with contemporary guidelines (Level of Evidence: A). Valve replacement or repair should be recommended for patients with hemodynamically significant valvular stenosis or regurgitation and no symptoms of HF in accordance with contemporary guidelines (Level of Evidence: B).

### Beta-blockers after myocardial infarction without reduced ejection fraction [^115kqJnp]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Current guideline recommendations for the use of beta-blockers after myocardial infarction without reduced ejection fraction are based on trials conducted before routine reperfusion, invasive care, complete revascularization, and contemporary pharmacologic therapies became standard practice.

Methods

We conducted an open-label, randomized trial in Spain and Italy to evaluate the effect of beta-blocker therapy, as compared with no beta-blocker therapy, in patients with acute myocardial infarction (with or without ST-segment elevation) and a left ventricular ejection fraction above 40%. The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause, reinfarction, or hospitalization for heart failure.

Results

In total, 4243 patients were randomly assigned to receive beta-blocker therapy and 4262 to receive no beta-blocker therapy; after exclusions, 8438 patients were included in the main analysis. During a median follow-up of 3.7 years, a primary-outcome event occurred in 316 patients (22.5 events per 1000 patient-years) in the beta-blocker group and in 307 patients (21.7 events per 1000 patient-years) in the no-beta-blocker group (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89 to 1.22; P = 0.63). Death from any cause occurred in 161 patients and 153 patients, respectively (11.2 vs. 10.5 events per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.33); reinfarction in 143 patients and 143 patients (10.2 vs. 10.1 events per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.27); and hospitalization for heart failure in 39 patients and 44 patients (2.7 vs. 3.0 events per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.38). No apparent between-group differences in safety outcomes were noted.

Conclusions

Among patients discharged after invasive care for a myocardial infarction with a left ventricular ejection fraction above 40%, beta-blocker therapy appeared to have no effect on the incidence of death from any cause, reinfarction, or hospitalization for heart failure.

### Post-myocardial infarction β-blocker therapy: the bradycardia conundrum. rationale and design for the pacemaker&β-blocker therapy post-MI (PACE-MI) trial [^116pPNDK]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated beta-blockers improving survival after myocardial infarction (MI). Patients with "bradycardia-related" contraindications to beta-blockers, such as those with asymptomatic bradycardia or AV conduction abnormalities, have been excluded from clinical trials of beta-blockers and continue to be excluded from post-MI beta-blocker therapy in routine clinical practice. These patients tend to be elderly and have a high 1-year mortality. If beta-blockers provide benefit to the post-MI patient independent of their heart rate-lowering effect, then these patients could benefit substantially from initiation of beta-blocker therapy. However, in this particular group of patients, beta-blockers can be safely initiated only if more severe or significant bradycardia can be prevented by pacemaker implantation. It is unclear whether adverse effects related to pacemaker implantation could also negate some or all of the hypothesized benefit of beta-blocker therapy. Although beta-blockers are particularly effective in the elderly, the benefit of beta-blocker therapy in patients with bradycardia-related contraindications to beta-blockers has not been established. The PACE-MI trial is a randomized controlled trial that will address whether beta-blocker therapy enabled by pacemaker implantation is superior to no beta-blocker and no pacemaker therapy after MI in patients with rhythm contraindications to beta-blockers or in those who have developed symptomatic bradycardia due to beta-blockers. The trial will randomize 1124 patients to standard therapy (not to include beta-blockers as patients must have a contraindication to be enrolled) or standard therapy plus pacemaker implantation and beta-blocker. The primary end point is the composite end point of total mortality plus nonfatal reinfarction.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114bddB8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Post–myocardial infarction (MI) ventricular arrhythmias and early ICD timing — risk is highest early after MI, but routine early ICD implantation for primary prevention has not improved survival; in DINAMIT, ICD implantation led to a 58% reduction in arrhythmic deaths within 6 to 40 days post MI with ejection fraction ≤ 35%, offset by increased nonarrhythmic deaths. Sustained VT/VF occurring > 48 hours after reperfusion is associated with increased risk of death, and patients with ventricular arrhythmias should first be managed with beta blockers and/or antiarrhythmic therapy. The benefit of ICD implantation when < 40 days post MI remains unclear; in a single-center series post–ST-elevation MI (median, 9 days), those with LVEF ≤ 40% underwent electrophysiologic testing, and 22% of implanted patients had VT terminated by the device during the first 12 months. Radiofrequency catheter ablation should be considered for recurrent VT/VF followed by ICD implantation, and earlier ICD implantation can be considered when a permanent pacemaker is indicated and LVEF is not expected to recover, though safety has not been definitively demonstrated.

### Comparative effectiveness of long-term maintenance beta-blocker therapy after acute myocardial infarction in stable, optimally treated patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^111vhuaa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

For decades, BB therapy has long been a cornerstone of pharmacotherapy for all patients with AMI. However, its role in secondary prevention following MI has been questioned in the contemporary reperfusion era. Moreover, current guidelines also did not clearly address the role of chronic BB therapy and its optimal duration in stabilized patients after AMI. The 2011 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guideline for secondary cardiovascular preventionencouraged BB therapy beyond 3 years as chronic therapy in all patients, including patients with preserved LVEF who have had MI, as a class IIa recommendation. More recently, the 2013 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology STEMIand 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology non–ST‐segment–elevation MI–acute coronary syndromeguidelines recommended BB therapy for all patients without contraindications regardless of LVEF or HF with class I indication. However, long‐term BB therapy in patients with normal LVEF after non–ST‐segment–elevation MI–acute coronary syndrome served as a class IIa recommendation. European Society of Cardiology guidelines acknowledged the lack of evidence for long‐term BB therapy, advocating initiation of BB treatment without mentioning the optimal duration of BB therapy. The 2017 European Society of Cardiology STEMIand 2020 non–ST‐segment–elevation MI–acute coronary syndromeguidelines conferred a class IIa recommendation in patients without HF and preserved LVEF for the use of routine BB therapy in both the acute and chronic phases. Furthermore, evidence of BB therapy of current guidelines was primarily based on old trials when reperfusion therapy (eg, stent implantation) was not widespread, and GDMT, such as dual antiplatelets and high‐intensity statins, was unavailable.

### Risk stratification post-myocardial infarction: is early coronary angiography the more effective strategy? [^111HJbeV]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The primary management strategy for the post-myocardial infarction patient continues to be controversial despite published guidelines. In part, this is the consequence of study designs that are not directly applicable to individual patients, but also to the rapidly changing pharmacological and mechanical device armamentarium that rapidly renders clinical trial results obsolete within a few years. This review attempts to highlight those areas where there is consensus as well as to explicate those situations where common clinical practice appears to be in conflict with accepted guidelines.

### Predictors of sudden cardiac arrest among patients with post-myocardial infarction ejection fraction greater than 35 [^114zxoGk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) risk increases after myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with a reduced ejection fraction (EF). However, the risk factors for SCA among patients with a post-MI EF > 35% remain poorly understood. Methods and Results Using the Optum de-identified electronic health record data set from 2008 to 2017, we identified patients with an incident MI diagnosis and troponin elevation who had a post-MI EF > 35% and underwent coronary angiography. Primary outcome was SCA within 1 year post-MI. The database was divided into derivation (70%) and validation (30%) cohorts by random selection. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to generate and validate a risk prediction model. Among 31 286 patients with an MI (median age 64.1; 39% female; 87% White), 499 experienced SCA within 1 year post-MI (estimated probability 1.8%). Lack of revascularization at MI, post-MI EF < 50%, Black race, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, antiarrhythmic therapy, and absence of beta blocker therapy were independent predictors of SCA. A multivariable model consisting of these variables predicted SCA risk (C-statistic 0.73). Based on this model, the estimated annual probability of SCA was 4.4% (95% CI, 3.9–4.9) in the highest quartile of risk versus 0.6% (95% CI, 0.4–0.8) in the lowest quartile. Conclusions Patients with a post-MI EF > 35% have a substantial annual risk of SCA. A risk model consisting of acute coronary revascularization, EF, race, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, antiarrhythmic therapy, and beta blocker therapy can identify patients with higher risk of SCA, who may benefit from further risk stratification and closer monitoring.

### Metoprolol CR / XL in postmyocardial infarction patients with chronic heart failure: experiences from MERIT-HF [^112YPg63]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The benefit of beta-blockers post-myocardial infarction (MI) was established in the late 1970s. Major advances in the treatment of MI have since occurred. However, patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) were excluded from those trials. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of beta-blockers in post-MI patients with CHF receiving contemporary management.

Methods

This was a prespecified subgroup analysis of a double-blind, randomized trial: the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Heart Failure (MERIT-HF). Patients with CHF in New York Heart Association class II to IV with an ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 0.40 and a history of being hospitalized for an acute MI (n = 1926) were randomized to metoprolol succinate controlled release/extended release (CR/XL) versus placebo. Mean EF was 0.28, and the mean follow-up was 1 year.

Results

Metoprolol CR/XL reduced total mortality by 40% (95% CI 0.20–0.55, P = 0.0004), and sudden death by 50% (95% CI 0.26–0.66, P = 0.0004). The combined end point of all-cause mortality/hospitalization for worsening CHF was reduced by 31% (95% CI 0.16–0.44, P < .0001), and cardiac death/nonfatal acute MI by 45% (95% CI 0.26–0.58, P < .0001). A post-hoc analysis showed that the outcome in patients with earlier revascularization (44%) and outcome in those with more severe CHF (20%) was similar to the entire post-MI population.

Conclusions

In post-MI patients with symptomatic CHF, beta-blockade continues to exert a profound reduction in mortality and morbidity in the presence of contemporary management that includes early and late revascularization, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and statins.

### Rapid evidence-based sequencing of foundational drugs for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction [^117QEwnM]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

One trial (CIBIS III) was specifically designed to determine if initiation of treatment with a beta‐blocker differed meaningfully from initiation of treatment with an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor. A total of 1010 patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction were randomized to bisoprolol 10 mg daily or enalapril 20 mg daily for 6 months, followed by combined therapy thereafter; the primary endpoint was all‐cause mortality and all‐cause hospitalization. There were 65 deaths and 151 hospitalizations for any reason in the bisoprolol‐first group, and 73 deaths and 159 hospitalizations for any reason in the enalapril‐first group. Patients treated with a beta‐blocker were less likely to die suddenly, but were more likely to experience early non‐fatal worsening of heart failure early following initiation of treatment. At 1 year, mortality was approximately 30% lower in the patients who had been first started on bisoprolol (P = 0.065). The results of the trial provide direct support for the premise that a beta‐blocker can be used successfully as the first neurohormonal antagonist for the treatment of heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, a situation akin to the use of beta‐blockers before angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors in the post‐infarction setting.

### The duration of β-blocker therapy and outcomes in patients without heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction: a multicenter prospective cohort study [^111y83Ki]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Some milestone studies such as the BHAT (The Beta‐blocker Heart Attack Trial), and the ISIS‐I (First International Study of Infarct Survival) had established that beta‐blockers can significantly reduce mortality in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) was published in the 1980s. The beta‐blockers then become a central component of pharmacological treatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Subsequently, progress has been made in the treatment of MI and mortality has decreased remarkably thanks to the application of treatments such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), antiplatelet drugs, and statins. Because of this, it is questionable whether beta‐blockers can still benefit AMI patients at a time when reperfusion treatment and secondary prevention therapy are widely available.

There are difficulties in the precise application of beta‐blockers in patients with AMI. Guidelines are inconsistent regarding the indication population for beta‐blocker therapy. Evidence demonstrates that beta‐blocker therapy is essential as a cornerstone in the treatment of AMI patients with reduced left ventricular systolic function (LVEF < 40%). However, the efficacy of beta‐blockers in AMI patients with midrange/preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≥ 40%) is unclear. Also, Guidelines or consensus, with fewer recommendations for the duration of beta‐blocker therapy after AMI. 2012 ACCF recommends that beta‐blocker therapy be continued for 3 years in patients with the acute coronary syndrome who have a normal left ventricular function (LVEF > 40%). The latest ESC Guidelines for the management of AMI in patients presenting with ST‐segment elevation do not give any recommendations in this respect. The Canadian Heart Research Centre recommends, based on consensus, patients with a mild‐moderate reduction of left ventricular function (LVEF ≥ 40%) who have undergone successful reperfusion, treatment discontinuation could be considered after 6 months. The benefits of early beta‐blocker therapy have been demonstrated, whereas few studies have been conducted on the duration of beta‐blocker therapy, with more attention focused on the impact of long‐term beta‐blocker therapy on outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to learn the effect of continuous beta‐blockers therapy (lasted ≥ 6 months) on AMI patients without heart failure (HF) or left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

### Predictors of sudden cardiac arrest among patients with post-myocardial infarction ejection fraction greater than 35 [^111DtpFu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large, contemporary, real‐world data set of patients with a post‐MI EF > 35% who underwent a coronary angiography, we found that lack of coronary revascularization, post‐MI EF 35% to 50%, Black race, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of renal failure, antiarrhythmic therapy, and absence of beta blocker therapy were independent predictors of SCA within 1 year. A multivariable model consisting of these variables predicted SCA with a C‐statistic of 0.73. Patients who score high on this risk model may benefit from further risk stratification, and closer monitoring, to prevent SCA.

Approximately, 1.5 million MIs occur in the United States annually and SCD is one of the most prevalent, and devastating, causes of post‐MI mortality. The risk of SCD increases by 10‐fold within the first month after MI (1.2%–1.4%/month) but gradually decreases to baseline over the next 12 to 24 months. The patients with post‐MI EF < 30% have the highest risk of SCD. Although the annual incidence of SCD in patients post‐MI with EF > 40% is relatively low (0.6%–1%/year), the population burden of SCD cast by this subgroup is high, considering the large number of patients with a preserved post‐MI EF in the current era of rapid revascularization and advanced medical therapy.

Prior studies have identified noninvasive arrhythmic risk markers, such as nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, QRS duration, late potentials on signal‐averaged electrocardiogram, reduced heart rate variability, and abnormal microvolt T‐wave alternans, which are associated with SCD after MI. However, individually these markers have low sensitivity and positive predictive value. Further, markers such as heart rate variability, signal averaged electrocardiogram, and microvolt T‐wave alternans require longer‐term monitoring, special software, or exercise testing that have not been routinely adapted in clinical practice. In contrast, the clinical risk factors identified in this report are readily available in medical records and can be used as a screening tool in a multistep process of risk stratification where patients screened to be in the higher risk categories (eg, quartiles 3 and 4) according to this risk model could be further risk stratified. However, there are few data on such risk stratification approaches among patients with EF > 35%.

14.3 Post-Myocardial Infarction

The VALsartan In Acute myocardial iNfarcTion trial (VALIANT) was a randomized, controlled, multinational, double-blind study in 14,703 patients with acute myocardial infarction and either heart failure (signs, symptoms or radiological evidence) or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤ 40% by radionuclide ventriculography or ≤ 35% by echocardiography or ventricular contrast angiography). Patients were randomized within 12 hours to 10 days after the onset of myocardial infarction symptoms to one of three treatment groups: valsartan (titrated from 20 or 40 mg twice daily to the highest tolerated dose up to a maximum of 160 mg twice daily), the ACE inhibitor, captopril (titrated from 6.25 mg three times daily to the highest tolerated dose up to a maximum of 50 mg three times daily), or the combination of valsartan plus captopril. In the combination group, the dose of valsartan was titrated from 20 mg twice daily to the highest tolerated dose up to a maximum of 80 mg twice daily; the dose of captopril was the same as for monotherapy. The population studied was 69% male, 94% Caucasian, and 53% were 65 years of age or older. Baseline therapy included aspirin (91%), beta-blockers (70%), ACE inhibitors (40%), thrombolytics (35%) and statins (34%). The mean treatment duration was 2 years. The mean daily dose of valsartan in the monotherapy group was 217 mg.

### Continuation vs withdrawal of beta-blockers and outcomes after myocardial infarction with preserved left ventricular function [^113WN5fs]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Guideline-recommended therapy for patients who have suffered an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) includes antiplatelet therapy, statins, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and beta-blockers (BBs). BBs are a cornerstone of treatment for ischemic heart disease in the acute phase because they inhibit the physiological sympathetic activation, reduce myocardial workload, reduce infarct size, and have antiarrhythmic and antiremodeling effects. BB also have a well-defined role in long-term therapy of patients with persistent reduction in left ventricular (LV) systolic function. However, the role of longer-term BB treatment when AMI course is not complicated by heart failure, LV systolic dysfunction, recurrent ischemia, or arrhythmia is not well established. Most guidelines recommend BB use in the absence of contraindications with grade 1B evidence in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and grade 2A in non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The recommendation for BB use after AMI predominately comes from studies that predate routine implementation of a contemporary strategy of early reperfusion and medical therapy. Recent guidelines report uncertainty in the strength of the evidence for long-term use of BB post revascularization with preserved LV ejection fraction (LVEF).

Observational studies that have evaluated the duration of BB use and outcomes after AMI have several limitations, including incomplete ascertainment or heterogeneous definitions of post-myocardial infarction (MI) LV dysfunction, inclusion of patients with independent indications or contraindications to BB, lack of longitudinal prescription data, and relatively short durations of follow-up. Two recently published open-label randomized clinical trials have added to this literature but have not completely resolved the dilemma. The REDUCE AMI (Randomized Evaluation of Decreased Usage of Beta-Blockers after Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial found that initiating BBs in MI survivors with preserved LVEF at the time of discharge did not reduce the incidence of death from any cause or recurrent AMI, whereas the ABYSS (Assessment of Beta-Blocker Interruption 1 Year after an Uncomplicated Myocardial Infarction on Safety and Symptomatic Cardiac Events Requiring Hospitalization) trial failed to find that interrupting BBs a mean of 2.9 years after MI was noninferior to continuing them, for a composite primary endpoint of death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons. We sought to assess the association between discontinuation of newly prescribed BB within 180 days after AMI and long-term cardiovascular outcomes among a well-characterized, population-based cohort of AMI survivors without definite indications for long-term BB therapy.

### Beta-blockers after myocardial infarction in patients without heart failure [^1125XUnk]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

The evidence supporting beta-blocker therapy after myocardial infarction was established before the introduction of modern coronary reperfusion therapy and secondary prevention strategies.

Methods

In an open-label, randomized trial with blinded end-point evaluation, conducted in Denmark and Norway, we assigned patients who had had a myocardial infarction and who had a left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 40%, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive long-term beta-blocker therapy within 14 days after the event or no beta-blocker therapy. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause or major adverse cardiovascular events (new myocardial infarction, unplanned coronary revascularization, ischemic stroke, heart failure, or malignant ventricular arrhythmias).

Results

A total of 5574 patients underwent randomization and were included in the main analyses - 2783 in the beta-blocker group and 2791 in the no-beta-blocker group. After a median follow-up of 3.5 years (interquartile range, 2.2 to 4.6), a primary end-point event had occurred in 394 patients (14.2%) in the beta-blocker group and in 454 patients (16.3%) in the no-beta-blocker group (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75 to 0.98; P = 0.03). Death from any cause occurred in 4.2% of the patients in the beta-blocker group and in 4.4% of those in the no-beta-blocker group; myocardial infarction occurred in 5.0% and 6.7%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.92), unplanned coronary revascularization in 3.9% and 3.9%, ischemic stroke in 1.6% and 1.3%, heart failure in 1.5% and 1.9%, and malignant ventricular arrhythmias in 0.5% and 0.6%. No apparent differences in safety outcomes were observed between the groups.

Conclusions

Among patients with a myocardial infarction and a left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 40%, beta-blocker therapy led to a lower risk of death or major adverse cardiovascular events than no beta-blocker therapy.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction — ICD implantation recommendations state that consideration of ICD implantation is recommended in patients with EF less than or equal to 30% with mild to moderate symptoms and anticipated survival with good functional capacity beyond 1 year; documentation of sustained EF reduction despite beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should precede consideration. ICDs are not warranted in refractory HF symptoms (Stage D) or when comorbid illnesses would independently limit life expectancy. Management of patients with EF between 30% and 35% remains controversial; for coronary artery disease, risk stratification may include programmed electrical stimulation to demonstrate inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT). In idiopathic cardiomyopathy with EF of 30% to 35%, the physician might want to continue intensive medical therapy before giving consideration to ICD implantation.

### Landmark study: the carvedilol post-infarct survival control in left ventricular dysfunction study (CAPRICORN) [^1119DULg]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The benefit of beta-blockers for secondary prevention of death and reinfarction after myocardial infarction (MI) has been conclusively demonstrated in randomized clinical trials. Before the Carvedilol Post-Infarct Survival Control in Left Ventricular Dysfunction Study (CAPRICORN)-a multicenter, multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 1,959 patients who had an acute MI and a left ventricular ejection fraction of ≤ = 0.40-it was not known whether beta-blockers confer additional benefit when used in the context of modern post-MI management (eg, fibrinolytic therapy and primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, aspirin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). Patients in CAPRICORN were treated with a maximum dose of 25 mg bid and observed until 633 validated primary end points had occurred. Because the overall mortality was lower than had been predicted, a co-primary end point was adopted that included the original primary end point (all-cause mortality) plus the first of the prespecified secondary end points (all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalizations). A significant 23% reduction in the original primary end point of all-cause mortality was observed. A total of 340 (35%) patients died or had a cardiovascular hospitalization in the carvedilol group versus 367 (37%) in the placebo group. Therefore, the revised primary end point of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization was reduced by 8%, which was not statistically significant. Significant reductions in cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal MI, and the combination of all-cause mortality or nonfatal MI were observed. Although statistical significance for the revised primary end point was not reached, CAPRICORN has an important role in guiding future use of beta-blockers in the early post-MI period.

### Effects of long-term carvedilol therapy in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [^116WG7gQ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The benefits of long-term oral β-blocker therapy in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; ≥ 40%) are still unknown. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of β-blocker therapy in patients with STEMI with mildly reduced LVEF. In the CAPITAL-RCT (Carvedilol Post-Intervention Long-Term Administration in Large-Scale Randomized Controlled Trial), patients with STEMI with successful percutaneous coronary intervention with an LVEF of ≥ 40% were randomly assigned to carvedilol or no β-blocker therapy. Among 794 patients, 280 patients had an LVEF of < 55% at baseline (mildly reduced LVEF stratum), whereas 514 patients had an LVEF of ≥ 55% at baseline (normal LVEF stratum). The primary end point was a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, and hospitalization for heart failure, and the secondary end point was a cardiac composite outcome: a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for heart failure. The median follow-up period was 3.7 years. The lower risk of carvedilol therapy relative to no β-blocker therapy was not significant for the primary end point in either the mildly reduced or normal LVEF strata. However, it was significant for the cardiac composite end point in the mildly reduced LVEF stratum (0.82/100 person-years vs 2.59/100 person-years, hazard ratio 0.32 [0.10 to 0.99], p = 0.047) but not in the normal LVEF stratum (1.48/100 person-years vs 1.06/100 person-years, hazard ratio 1.39 [0.62 to 3.13], p = 0.43, p for interaction = 0.04). In conclusion, long-term carvedilol therapy in patients with STEMI with primary percutaneous coronary intervention might be beneficial for preventing cardiac-related events in those with a mildly reduced LVEF.

### Real-world algorithms for the optimal use of drugs and devices in the patient post myocardial infarction and the future of post myocardial infarction management [^117HKDdg]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) are at increased risk for dying suddenly of cardiac causes. The most common causes of LVD are coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI). Aggressive intervention following MI is essential for minimizing the myocardial damage that leads to LVD and the subsequent risk for heart failure and sudden cardiac death. This article describes practical algorithms for managing the patient post MI to minimize such risks. The degree of LVD is a key factor for determining clinical management strategies in the patient post MI. Risk factor reduction and selective neurohormonal blockade, especially with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, are usually recommended in the presence or absence of LVD, along with early use of a beta blocker. In patients with LVD, more aggressive intervention includes extended use of a beta blocker. In cases of LVD progressed to heart failure, the mixed beta and alpha blocker carvedilol has improved outcomes significantly. In clinical trials, carvedilol has been demonstrated to have antiarrhythmic activity, a property that offers protection against sudden arrhythmic death in high-risk patients with LVD. Addition of an aldosterone antagonist is also advised in patients with heart failure. In selected patients with reduced ejection fractions, use of surgical/catheter treatment and device therapy offers further benefits.

Asymptomatic post-MI or LV remodeling — risk and aldosterone antagonist: Patients without HF symptoms but who have had an MI or who have evidence of LV remodeling are at considerable risk of developing HF, and in such patients the incidence of HF can be decreased by reducing additional injury and by retarding LV remodeling. In this setting, the aldosterone antagonist eplerenone has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with low EF and no HF after MI already treated with ACEIs and beta-blockers.

### One-year landmark analysis of the effect of beta-blocker dose on survival after acute myocardial infarction [^115awrc2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Although beta-blockers are recommended following myocardial infarction (MI), the benefits of long-term treatment have not been established. The study's aim was to evaluate beta-blocker efficacy by dose in 1-year post-MI survivors. Methods and Results The OBTAIN (Outcomes of Beta-Blocker Therapy After Myocardial Infarction) registry included 7057 patients with acute MI, with 6077 one-year survivors. For this landmark analysis, beta-blocker dose status was available in 3004 patients and analyzed by use (binary) and dose at 1 year after MI. Doses were classified as no beta-blocker and > 0% to 12.5%, > 12.5% to 25%, > 25% to 50%, and > 50% of target doses used in randomized clinical trials. Age was 63 to 64 years, and approximately two thirds were men. Median follow-up duration was 1.05 years (interquartile range, 0.98–1.22). When analyzed dichotomously, beta-blocker therapy was not associated with improved survival. When analyzed by dose, propensity score analysis showed significantly increased mortality in the no-beta-blocker group (hazard ratio,1.997; 95% CI, 1.118–3.568; P < 0.02), the > 0% to 12.5% group (hazard ratio, 1.817; 95% CI, 1.094–3.016; P < 0.02), and the > 25% to 50% group (hazard ratio, 1.764; 95% CI, 1.105–2.815; P < 0.02), compared with the > 12.5% to 25% dose group. The mortality in the full-dose group was not significantly higher (hazard ratio, 1.196; 95% CI, 0.687–2.083). In subgroup analyses, only history of congestive heart failure demonstrated significant interaction with beta-blocker effects on survival. Conclusions This analysis suggests that patients treated with > 12.5% to 25% of the target dose used in prior randomized clinical trials beyond 1 year after MI may have enhanced survival compared with no beta-blocker and other beta-blocker doses. A new paradigm for post-MI beta-blocker therapy is needed that addresses which patients should be treated, for how long, and at what dose.

Stage B (patients with pre-HF) — preventing clinical heart failure (HF) recommendations include: In patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality (Class 1, Level A). In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction (MI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS), statins should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events (Class 1, Level A). In patients with a recent MI and LVEF ≤ 40% who are intolerant to ACEI, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients with a recent or remote history of MI or ACS and LVEF ≤ 40%, evidence-based beta blockers should be used to reduce mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients who are at least 40 days post-MI with LVEF ≤ 30% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while receiving guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for > 1 year, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) to reduce total mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, beta blockers should be used to prevent symptomatic HF (Class 1, Level C-LD). In patients with LVEF ≤ 50%, thiazolidinediones should not be used because they increase the risk of HF, including hospitalizations (Class 3: Harm, Level B-R). In patients with LVEF < 50%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful (Class 3: Harm, Level C-LD).

### Β-blocker use following myocardial infarction: low prevalence of evidence-based dosing [^115qDEyt]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Quality improvement programs have shown increased use of beta-blockers post-myocardial infarction (MI), but there are no data on whether appropriate doses are administered.

Methods

In a prospective registry that enrolled consecutive patients with MI, we evaluated beta-blocker dosing at discharge after MI and 3 weeks later and assessed clinical predictors for treatment with very low doses. We studied 1,971 patients (70.8% male) with a mean age of 63.9 ± 13.7 years, of whom 48.2% had an ST-elevation MI.

Results

beta-Blocker utilization rates following MI were 93.2% at discharge: 20.1% received < 25% of target dose, 36.5% received 25% of target dose, 26.4% received 26% to 50% of target dose, and 17.0% received > 50% of target dose. Between discharge and 3 weeks, 76.4% had no change in beta-blocker dose, with 11.9% and 11.6% having their dose reduced and increased, respectively. Absence of hypertension, acute percutaneous coronary intervention, older age, and no angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy were consistent predictors of treatment with very low beta-blocker doses.

Conclusions

Underdosing of beta-blockers is highly prevalent among patients post-MI. This represents an important opportunity in quality improvement for the care of patients who have suffered an MI.

Background

Although beta‐blockers are recommended following myocardial infarction (MI), the benefits of long‐term treatment have not been established. The study's aim was to evaluate beta‐blocker efficacy by dose in 1‐year post‐MI survivors.

Methods and Results

The OBTAIN (Outcomes of Beta‐Blocker Therapy After Myocardial Infarction) registry included 7057 patients with acute MI, with 6077 one‐year survivors. For this landmark analysis, beta‐blocker dose status was available in 3004 patients and analyzed by use (binary) and dose at 1 year after MI. Doses were classified as no beta‐blocker and > 0% to 12.5%, > 12.5% to 25%, > 25% to 50%, and > 50% of target doses used in randomized clinical trials. Age was 63 to 64 years, and approximately two thirds were men. Median follow‐up duration was 1.05 years (interquartile range, 0.98–1.22). When analyzed dichotomously, beta‐blocker therapy was not associated with improved survival. When analyzed by dose, propensity score analysis showed significantly increased mortality in the no–beta‐blocker group (hazard ratio,1.997; 95% CI, 1.118–3.568; P < 0.02), the > 0% to 12.5% group (hazard ratio, 1.817; 95% CI, 1.094–3.016; P < 0.02), and the > 25% to 50% group (hazard ratio, 1.764; 95% CI, 1.105–2.815; P < 0.02), compared with the > 12.5% to 25% dose group. The mortality in the full‐dose group was not significantly higher (hazard ratio, 1.196; 95% CI, 0.687–2.083). In subgroup analyses, only history of congestive heart failure demonstrated significant interaction with beta‐blocker effects on survival.

Conclusions

This analysis suggests that patients treated with > 12.5% to 25% of the target dose used in prior randomized clinical trials beyond 1 year after MI may have enhanced survival compared with no beta‐blocker and other beta‐blocker doses. A new paradigm for post‐MI beta‐blocker therapy is needed that addresses which patients should be treated, for how long, and at what dose.

Beta blockers — synopsis for CCD notes mechanisms, populations, and indications: Beta blockers exhibit their clinical effects by decreasing myocardial oxygen demand, improving ischemic threshold, and impeding maladaptive LV remodeling. Patients with CCD comprise patients with or without previous MI, LV systolic dysfunction, or both, and these distinctions should be considered in determining indications for beta‑blocker therapy. The strongest data for the benefit of beta‑blockers in CCD is for patients with LV systolic dysfunction, but benefit is less clear without LV dysfunction. Several ongoing RCTs aim to elucidate the need for and duration of beta‑blocker therapy for MACE reduction among post‑MI patients with preserved LV systolic function. Other primary indications may include angina, uncontrolled hypertension, or arrhythmias, and comprehensive screening is recommended because therapy may still be indicated for antianginal, antihypertensive, or negative chronotropic effects among patients with rhythm disturbance disorders.

14.3 Post-Myocardial Infarction

The VALsartan In Acute myocardial iNfarcTion trial (VALIANT) was a randomized, controlled, multinational, double-blind study in 14,703 patients with acute myocardial infarction and either heart failure (signs, symptoms or radiological evidence) or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤ 40% by radionuclide ventriculography or ≤ 35% by echocardiography or ventricular contrast angiography). The VALIANT study was conducted with a formulation of valsartan that is not therapeutically equivalent to PREXXARTAN [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients were randomized within 12 hours to 10 days after the onset of myocardial infarction symptoms to one of three treatment groups: valsartan (titrated from 20 or 40 mg twice daily to the highest tolerated dose up to a maximum of 160 mg twice daily), the ACE inhibitor, captopril (titrated from 6.25 mg three times daily to the highest tolerated dose up to a maximum of 50 mg three times daily), or the combination of valsartan plus captopril. In the combination group, the dose of valsartan was titrated from 20 mg twice daily to the highest tolerated dose up to a maximum of 80 mg twice daily; the dose of captopril was the same as for monotherapy. The population studied was 69% male, 94% Caucasian, and 53% were 65 years of age or older. Baseline therapy included aspirin (91%), beta-blockers (70%), ACE inhibitors (40%), thrombolytics (35%) and statins (34%). The mean treatment duration was 2 years. The mean daily dose of valsartan in the monotherapy group was 217 mg.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to beta-blockers, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate β-blocker therapy to reduce the risk of future major adverse cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death. in patients with chronic coronary disease and LVEF ≤ 40% with or without previous myocardial infarction.

### Beta-blocker therapy after myocardial Infarction [^112KbtXM]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Historical data strongly supported the benefits of beta-blocker therapy following a myocardial infarction (MI) for its efficacy in reducing mortality and morbidity. However, in the context of the progressive evolution of treatment strategies for MI patients, the apparent benefit of beta-blocker therapy is becoming less clear. In particular, its effectiveness in patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction is currently being challenged. Consequently, contemporary guidelines are now varying in their recommendations regarding the role of beta-blocker therapy in post-MI patients. This review aims to summarize and compare the largest and most influential studies from the prereperfusion era to modern practice regarding different health outcomes while highlighting the need for further research to clarify beta-blocker therapy's place in contemporary post-MI management.

### Comparative effectiveness of long-term maintenance beta-blocker therapy after acute myocardial infarction in stable, optimally treated patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^111Ea7g9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

One noteworthy finding of this study was that long‐term maintenance BB therapy was more beneficial in improving cardiovascular outcomes in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (< 40%) in the absence of HF (asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction). Despite the advancement of successful revascularization and GDMT, many patients following MI continued to have asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, which poses a considerable risk for future cardiovascular events such as symptomatic HF. Although few data are available to support the efficacy of BB therapy in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, BBs are generally recommended and continued unless patients have no contraindication or side effects because they improve survival and reduce the rate of both HF and recurrent MI, especially those with ischemic pathogenesis. In 1 prospective randomized trial, the CAPRICORN (Carvedilol Post‐Infarct Survival Control in Left Ventricular Dysfunction) trial, which enrolled patients with AMI with an LVEF ≤ 40% (the majority of whom were asymptomatic), carvedilol was associated with significant reductions in all‐cause death, cardiovascular death, and nonfatal MI. In a retrospective analysis of the SAVE (Survival and Ventricular Enlargement) trial, concomitant use of BB therapy was associated with a significant additional reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death and progression to HF among asymptomatic patients following MI with an LVEF ≤ 40%. Our findings provide additional evidence to support continuing BBs for the long term in patients who had high‐risk features at presentation, such as patients following MI with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, to improve long‐term cardiovascular outcomes.

It shows evolving recommendations, class of recommendation, and level of evidence, including various patient populations such as those with left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, and CAD. The figure also highlights changes in treatment duration, patient selection, and specific beta-blocker medications.

Beta-blocker therapy in the reperfusion era

The observed clinical benefits of beta-blocker therapy during the prereperfusion era are attributed to complex mechanisms of the beta-adrenoceptor blockade, including a reduction in myocardial work and thus myocardial oxygen consumption, reduced wall stress leading to less remodeling and anti-arrhythmic actions. However, its benefits appear less significant within the framework of modern practice. This is mainly due to the introduction of early reperfusion therapies with newer thrombolytic agents and invasive strategies, such as the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the late 1970s. The emergence of this reperfusion therapy increased rates of myocardial salvage and decreased ischemic times, leading to reduced mortality rates for MI patients. Furthermore, new progressive pharmacotherapies, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors facilitated the improvement of LVEF by mitigating ventricular remodeling, while statins enhanced survival by stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques and reducing the risk of recurrent CV events post-MI. In addition, these therapies have also enhanced patients' quality of life while avoiding the multiple side effects commonly associated with beta-blocker therapy.

NHFA/CSANZ = National Heart Foundation of Australia & Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand; other abbreviations as in Figure 1.

These variations in guidelines contribute to differing prescription rates globally. For instance, 93% of eligible patients in Europe receive beta-blockers, compared to just 56.5% in South-East Asia. In Italy, more than one-half of MI patients were prescribed beta-blocker therapy, though prescription rates have declined over time. In Australia, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 33% of adults with CVD used beta-blockers in 2017 to 2018, though adherence rates are suboptimal, with only 73% continuing therapy after 12 months.

Several ongoing trials are expected to provide greater clarity on the optimal use of beta-blocker therapy in the context of modern reperfusion therapies. The following RCTs are assessing the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy in post-MI patients with preserved LVEF (≥ 40%): the DANBLOCK (Danish trial of beta-blocker treatment after myocardial infarction without reduced ejection fraction), the BETAMI (BEtablocker Treatment After acute Myocardial Infarction in revascularized patients without reduced left ventricular ejection fraction), and the REBOOT (tREatment with Beta-blockers after myOcardial infarction withOut reduced ejection fracTion) trial. The results from these studies are anticipated to inform and potentially improve current clinical guidelines.

### Predictors of sudden cardiac arrest among patients with post-myocardial infarction ejection fraction greater than 35 [^112cmGUy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) risk increases after myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with a reduced ejection fraction (EF). However, the risk factors for SCA among patients with a post‐MI EF > 35% remain poorly understood.

Methods and Results

Using the Optum de‐identified electronic health record data set from 2008 to 2017, we identified patients with an incident MI diagnosis and troponin elevation who had a post‐MI EF > 35% and underwent coronary angiography. Primary outcome was SCA within 1 year post‐MI. The database was divided into derivation (70%) and validation (30%) cohorts by random selection. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to generate and validate a risk prediction model. Among 31 286 patients with an MI (median age 64.1; 39% female; 87% White), 499 experienced SCA within 1 year post‐MI (estimated probability 1.8%). Lack of revascularization at MI, post‐MI EF < 50%, Black race, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, antiarrhythmic therapy, and absence of beta blocker therapy were independent predictors of SCA. A multivariable model consisting of these variables predicted SCA risk (C‐statistic 0.73). Based on this model, the estimated annual probability of SCA was 4.4% (95% CI, 3.9–4.9) in the highest quartile of risk versus 0.6% (95% CI, 0.4–0.8) in the lowest quartile.

Conclusions

Patients with a post‐MI EF > 35% have a substantial annual risk of SCA. A risk model consisting of acute coronary revascularization, EF, race, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, antiarrhythmic therapy, and beta blocker therapy can identify patients with higher risk of SCA, who may benefit from further risk stratification and closer monitoring.

### One-year landmark analysis of the effect of beta-blocker dose on survival after acute myocardial infarction [^115SbVUq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This landmark analysis of the OBTAIN study was designed to evaluate whether there is benefit to beta‐blocker therapy beyond 1 year after MI. When analyzed dichotomously, beta‐blocker therapy beyond 1 year after an MI was not associated with improved survival. However, on the basis of the primary OBTAIN studyresults, we hypothesized there would be a dose‐dependent effect of beta‐blocker dosing in 1‐year survivors after an acute MI. Both multivariate and propensity score analyses of survival by dose suggested that patients treated with > 12.5% to 25% of the target dose have enhanced survival compared with no beta‐blocker therapy and other beta‐blocker doses. The present study provides important data on the role of beta‐blocker dose and therapy in 1‐year survivors after MI.

CAPRICORN (Carvedilol Post‐Infarct Survival Control in LV Dysfunction)is the only reperfusion‐era randomized clinical trial to demonstrate a survival benefit of beta‐blocker therapy; in this trial of carvedilol versus placebo in patients after MI with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%, the survival curves continued to diverge for 2.5 years, suggesting long‐term benefit for this low ejection fraction group. Our findings in the subgroup of patients with a history of congestive heart failure support the continued benefit of beta‐blocker therapy in patients after MI with left ventricular dysfunction and/or heart failure. Two recent landmark analyses at 1 year after MI have been reported. In these observational studies of 1383and 1946patients, there was no benefit to beta‐blocker therapy when analyzed as a dichotomous variable. In a report from the French national health insurance database including 73 450 patients after MI who had been treated with beta‐blockers for at least 1 year, there was no significant increase in mortality associated with beta‐blocker discontinuation (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.94–1.36). The dichotomous analysis in this OBTAIN report is consistent with these findings. However, beta‐blocker dose may be an important modulator of beta‐blocker benefit. It is notable that the same dose (25% of the target dose used in randomized clinical trials) was found to be the optimal dose in this report as in the original OBTAIN report. Furthermore, in this subsample of the OBTAIN study, ≈40% of patients had a change in dose from the discharge dose used in the analysis of the original OBTAIN cohort. The only inconsistent finding in the current analysis is the lack of benefit of the > 12.5% to 25% dose relative to the > 50% dose. This may relate to this latter group being the smallest of the beta‐blocker treatment groups. In a report from the CRUSADE (Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes With Early Implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines) registry, a landmark analysis was performed at 3 years after MI in patients aged ≥ 65 years old (mean age, 75 years), stratified by no beta‐blocker, < 50% of target dose, and ≥ 50% of target dose. No difference in outcomes was noted. However, there was no delineation between the 12.5% and 25% dose. Furthermore, the authors note that the findings were consistent in patients with and without heart failure or systolic dysfunction, questioning the generalizability of these findings. Therefore, the present report provides further support that the medical discussion around the use of beta‐blockers after MI, even long‐term use, must center on dose and not simply use. This is a major paradigm change, because the vast majority of studies in this field do not address dose. It is important to note that there has not been a single randomized clinical trial of beta‐blockers after acute MI that tested multiple doses.

### Improving outcomes in post-acute myocardial infarction heart failure: incorporation of aldosterone blockade into combination therapy to optimize neurohormonal blockade [^113X5Pjb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and beta-blockers have been proved to reduce mortality in patients with heart failure post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI), studies show that these agents are consistently underused in this population. Further, morbidity and mortality remain high even when standard-of-care therapies are applied. Thus, new strategies have been sought to better counteract the maladaptive effects of neurohormonal stimulation in post-AMI heart failure. The Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS) demonstrated that the selective aldosterone blocker eplerenone, when used in addition to standard therapy, results in significant incremental improvements in survival and morbidity and is safe and well tolerated in this setting. Based on this, major therapeutic guidelines in the United States and Europe now strongly recommend that all eligible patients with concomitant heart failure post-AMI be treated with an aldosterone blocker in addition to an ACE inhibitor (or an ARB) and a beta-blocker. To achieve needed improvements in outcomes in this population, early and consistent initiation of these evidence-based, guideline-recommended therapies in all eligible patients is crucial.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113roJAv]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Beta blockers for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF, with current or previous symptoms, use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended to reduce mortality and hospitalizations, and beta-blocker therapy provides high economic value. Treatment with beta blockers reduces the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization in patients with HFrEF. Beta blockers should be initiated at low doses with efforts to achieve target doses as tolerated, and they can be safely started before hospital discharge when patients are clinically stabilized and do not require intravenous inotropic therapy for HF. Even if symptoms or LVEF improve, long-term treatment with target doses should be maintained to reduce risk of progression, and abrupt withdrawal should be avoided unless indicated.

### Beta-blockers after myocardial infarction: effects according to sex in the REBOOT trial [^112zNqj5]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Recent trials have challenged the guideline recommendation of beta-blockers for post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients without reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Whether these recent findings apply equally to women and men remains unknown.

Methods

Using data from REBOOT (tREatment with Beta-blockers after myOcardial infarction withOut reduced ejection fracTion), the largest randomized trial evaluating the effect of beta-blockers after acute MI with LVEF > 40%, a pre-specified sex-specific subgroup analysis was performed. A total of 8438 out of the 8505 randomized patients comprised the intention-to-treat population.

Results

Among 8438 patients, 1627 were women, who were older, had more comorbidities, and received fewer guideline-based therapies than men. Over a median follow-up of 3.7 years, women had overall higher rates of the primary composite outcome (death, MI, or heart failure hospitalization) than men. The incidence rate of the primary endpoint in women was 30.4 and 21.0/1000 patient-years in the beta-blocker group and no beta-blocker group, respectively (hazard ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval 1.04–2.03). No significant differences were observed in men (hazard ratio .94, 95% confidence interval .79–1.13; P for interaction = .026). The excess risk in women was mainly driven by increased mortality and was most evident among those with preserved LVEF (P for interaction = .030) and those receiving higher beta-blocker doses (P for interaction = .045).

Conclusions

In the REBOOT trial of MI patients managed according to contemporary standards, beta-blocker therapy was associated with evidence of harm in women-particularly those with preserved LVEF and receiving higher doses-an effect not observed in men.

### Ramipril (Altace) [^111T2BkC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.3 Heart Failure Post-Myocardial Infarction

ALTACE was studied in the AIRE trial. This was a multinational (mainly European) 161-center, 2006-patient, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study comparing ALTACE to placebo in stable patients, 2–9 days after an acute myocardial infarction, who had shown clinical signs of congestive heart failure at any time after the myocardial infarction. Patients in severe (NYHA class IV) heart failure, patients with unstable angina, patients with heart failure of congenital or valvular etiology, and patients with contraindications to ACE inhibitors were all excluded. The majority of patients had received thrombolytic therapy at the time of the index infarction, and the average time between infarction and initiation of treatment was 5 days.

Patients randomized to ALTACE treatment were given an initial dose of 2.5 mg twice daily. If the initial regimen caused undue hypotension, the dose was reduced to 1.25 mg, but in either event doses were titrated upward (as tolerated) to a target regimen (achieved in 77% of patients randomized to ALTACE) of 5 mg twice daily. Patients were then followed for an average of 15 months, with the range of follow-up between 6 and 46 months.

The use of ALTACE was associated with a 27% reduction (p = 0.002) in the risk of death from any cause; about 90% of the deaths that occurred were cardiovascular, mainly sudden death. The risks of progression to severe heart failure and of congestive heart failure-related hospitalization were also reduced, by 23% (p = 0.017) and 26% (p = 0.011), respectively. The benefits of ALTACE therapy were seen in both genders, and they were not affected by the exact timing of the initiation of therapy, but older patients may have had a greater benefit than those under 65. The benefits were seen in patients on (and not on) various concomitant medications. At the time of randomization these included aspirin (about 80% of patients), diuretics (about 60%), organic nitrates (about 55%), beta-blockers (about 20%), calcium channel blockers (about 15%), and digoxin (about 12%).

Cardiovascular mortality

RCT results show no association between beta-blocker therapy and CV mortality risk (Table 1). For instance, post hoc analyses of the CHARISMA trial found no link between beta-blocker therapy and reduced CV mortality risk (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.52–1.40). Similarly, results from the REDUCE-AMI trial showed no differences in death from CV causes among revascularized patients with LVEF ≥ 50% (HR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.72–1.84).

Evidence from observational data is conflicting (Table 3). The French CORONOR registry reported a 36% risk reduction in CV mortality at 2-year follow-up for post-MI patients, with or without revascularization, using beta-blocker therapy (HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.42–0.98). Similarly, results from the COREA-AMI registry showed a significant risk reduction at 3 years of follow-up for post-MI patients with LVEF ≥ 50% who underwent PCI (HR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.32–0.70). Analyses using the KAMIR-NIH registry reported reduced risk in patients with LVEF < 50% (HR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.21–0.94and HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.57–0.96)but not in those with LVEF ≥ 50% at 1-year follow-up (HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 0.56 to 2.62and HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.91–1.48). Most observational studies reported no association between beta-blocker therapy and reduced CV mortality risk in revascularized patients, without heart failure, preserved LVEF, and optimally treated with other secondary CV prevention drugs.

### Practical considerations of β-blockade in the management of the post-myocardial infarction patient [^113agA6b]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a major cause of death and disability in the United States that affects an estimated total of 1.5 million men and women each year. Despite significant advances in pharmacologic and interventional therapies, 25% of men and 38% of women still die within 1 year of the acute event. Beta-blockers have been shown to significantly decrease the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients after an AMI. National guidelines recommend that all patients with AMI may be started on beta-blocker therapy and continued indefinitely, unless absolutely contraindicated or not tolerated. However, a substantial portion of eligible AMI survivors are not prescribed beta-blockers in the hospital after an acute event or upon hospital discharge. In addition, patients with AMI are often treated with agents whose long-term use has not been shown effective and for which optimal dosing has not been defined. This paper will discuss the background of beta-blocker use for the treatment of AMI, discuss the rationale for choosing specific agents, and present protocols for initiating or switching to evidence-based therapies.

### Beta-blocker therapy after myocardial Infarction [^111NkYEz]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite these limitations, prereperfusion evidence on beta-blocker therapy strongly influenced the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation (AHA/ACCF) clinical guidelines until 2013 (Figure 1). For example, the 2011 Secondary Prevention and Risk Reduction Therapy for Patients With Coronary and Other Atherosclerotic Vascular Diseases guideline recommended beta-blocker therapy for all patients with LVEF < 40% and post-MI patients regardless of LVEF, even beyond 3 years. Similarly, the 2013 AHA/ACCF Management of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) guidelines suggested beta-blocker therapy for all hospital discharged patients without contraindications. However, a 2014 meta-analysis by Bangalore et al, which included over 60 RCTs and 102,003 patients, revealed a significant interaction between beta-blocker therapy and reperfusion status (Table 2). Beta-blocker therapy reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (incident rate ratio [IRR]: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.79–0.94) and recurrence of MI (IRR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.62–0.97) in the prereperfusion era. Yet, in the reperfusion era, where over 50% of patients received thrombolytics or underwent revascularization, beta-blocker therapy did not significantly reduce mortality (IRR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.92–1.05). As a result, the 2014 AHA/ACCF Management of Patients with Non–ST-Elevation (NSTEMI) Acute Coronary Syndromes guidelines strongly recommended beta-blocker therapy in patients with reduced LVEFand suggested continuing therapy beyond 3 years for patients with normal LVEF and no angina, given the unclear evidence for long-term benefits in this group. The Bangalore et alfindings highlighted that up until 2014, most evidence regarding the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy pertained to patients with reduced LVEF, prompting questions regarding the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy in more stable patients with preserved LVEF and the optimal duration of its use.

Beta-blocker therapy in the pre-reperfusion era

All-cause mortality

Several RCTs from the 1980s consistently demonstrated that beta-blocker therapy significantly reduces all-cause mortality in post-MI patients, with reductions ranging from 26% to 42.5% (Table 1). For example, the NMSG (Norwegian Multicentre Study Group), which involved 1,884 patients, reported a 42.5% reduction in all-cause mortality at 33 months in the beta-blocker group compared to the placebo (P = 0.03). Similarly, an RCT comparing intravenous metoprolol to placebo in acute MI patients showed a 36% reduction in all-cause mortality in the beta-blocker group (P < 0.03).

Table 1
Randomized Controlled Trials Assessing Long-Term Use of Beta-Blocker Therapy and Health Outcomes

BHAT (β-Blocker Heart Attack Trial), reported a 7.2% mortality rate in the propranolol group, compared to 9.8% in the placebo group, reflecting a significant reduction in mortality (P < 0.005). Additionally, the CAPRICORN (Carvedilol Post-Infarct Survival Control in LV Dysfunction) trial, which included nearly 2,000 patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, showed a 23% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.60–0.98). Lastly, Freemantle et al's meta-analysis of 31 RCTs and over 24,000 participants, reported a 23% reduction in long-term mortality risk (OR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.69–0.85) and concluded that beta-blocker therapy reduced 1.2 events of all-cause mortality. Moreover, the authors reported that the number needed to treat with beta-blocker therapy to prevent one death was substantially lower than with antiplatelet therapy (42 vs 292), suggesting that beta-blocker therapy was more effective.

### The effect of carvedilol in patients with impaired left ventricular systolic function following an acute myocardial infarction. how do the treatment effects on total mortality and recurrent myocardial infarction in CAPRICORN compare with previous β-blocker trials? [^116LXBXB]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2002). Low credibility.

In previous beta-blocker trials, post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients were essentially treated with a beta-blocker or placebo. In the CAPRICORN trial, patients were selected on the basis of a left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) < 40% following the index MI and randomised to carvedilol or placebo, in addition to modern secondary prophylaxis with ACE inhibitors, aspirin and statins. In 1959 patients with a mean LVEF of 33%, treatment with carvedilol over a mean follow-up period of 15 months reduced total mortality from 15.3% with placebo to 11.9% with carvedilol [relative risk reduction (RRR) = 23%, absolute risk reduction (ARR) = 3.4%]. The incidence of recurrent MI was reduced from 5.8 to 2.3% (RRR 41%, ARR 2.3%). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one death was 28 for the entire study period and 43 for 1 year of treatment. The results of the CAPRICORN trial are compared with three previous beta-blocker post-MI trials: the Gothenburg metoprolol trial (GMT), the Norwegian timolol trial (NTT) and the beta-blocker heart attack trial (BHAT). The RRRs for total mortality were 36% in the GMT and NTT, and 27% in BHAT. The respective NNTs for total mortality were 32, 18 and 38. NNT for 1 year of treatment was 25 in NTT and 80 in BHAT. The RRR for recurrent MIs were 28% in NTT and 16% in BHAT. The reduction of mortality and recurrent MIs in CAPRICORN is within the range of previous post-MI beta-blocker studies. In post-MI patients with LVEF < 40%, add-on treatment with a beta-blocker should be given > 48 h after initiation with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and then with a slow dose escalation as applied in CAPRICORN.

### Reducing the risks of sudden death and heart failure post myocardial infarction: utility of optimized pharmacotherapy [^1177Nmfz]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Current guidelines define the standard of care for patients after myocardial infarction (MI), with particular focus on patients with significant ventricular dysfunction. Inherent in these recommendations are assumptions about the relative risks and benefits, as well as the costs, of the available options. This review will consider strategies to prevent sudden death and heart failure post-MI by utilization of pharmacologic therapies — angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), aldosterone antagonists, statins, and beta-blockers — in parallel with the approaches reviewed elsewhere in this supplement. A patient-centric approach necessitates that drugs in each class be compared for efficacy within this patient population. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of several drugs, such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, in patients post-MI, yet these benefits do not seem to be reflected in the epidemiologic data. This may reflect underutilization of these therapies or, alternatively, support the notion that efficacy in clinical trials does not assure effectiveness in clinical practice. The latter point is a subject of ongoing investigation, while the former is being addressed through quality-of-care initiatives. In clinical practice, aggressiveness is key, starting with patient education. If patients understand their risks better, compliance and adoption of a more ideal lifestyle seem more likely. However, even with educational programs, human nature teaches us that marked change in behavior is difficult and therefore, to minimize risks, particularly of sudden death and heart failure post infarction, an optimized pharmacologic regimen serves as a powerful tool.

### Β blockers and mortality after myocardial infarction in patients without heart failure: multicentre prospective cohort study [^117BU3GU]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the association between early and prolonged β blocker treatment and mortality after acute myocardial infarction.

Design

Multicentre prospective cohort study.

Setting

Nationwide French registry of Acute ST- and non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (FAST-MI) (at 223 centres) at the end of 2005.

Participants

2679 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction and without heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction.

Main Outcome Measures

Mortality was assessed at 30 days in relation to early use of β blockers (≤ 48 hours of admission), at one year in relation to discharge prescription, and at five years in relation to one year use.

Results

β blockers were used early in 77% (2050/2679) of patients, were prescribed at discharge in 80% (1783/2217), and were still being used in 89% (1230/1383) of those alive at one year. Thirty day mortality was lower in patients taking early β blockers (adjusted hazard ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.26 to 0.82), whereas the hazard ratio for one year mortality associated with β blockers at discharge was 0.77 (0.46 to 1.30). Persistence of β blockers at one year was not associated with lower five year mortality (hazard ratio 1.19, 0.65 to 2.18). In contrast, five year mortality was lower in patients continuing statins at one year (hazard ratio 0.42, 0.25 to 0.72) compared with those discontinuing statins. Propensity score and sensitivity analyses showed consistent results.

Conclusions

Early β blocker use was associated with reduced 30 day mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction, and discontinuation of β blockers at one year was not associated with higher five year mortality. These findings question the utility of prolonged β blocker treatment after acute myocardial infarction in patients without heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction. Trial registration Clinical trials NCT00673036.

### Does β-blocker therapy improve clinical outcomes of acute myocardial infarction after successful primary angioplasty? [^116FxS4r]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to determine if beta-blocker therapy improves clinical outcomes of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) after successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Background

We have shown that pre-treatment with beta-blockers has a beneficial effect on short-term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing primary PCI for AMI. It is unknown if beta-blocker therapy after successful primary PCI improves prognosis of AMI.

Methods

We analyzed clinical, angiographic, and outcomes data in 2442 patients who underwent successful primary PCI in the Primary Angioplasty in Acute Myocardial Infarction-2 (PAMI-2), PAMI No Surgery-on-Site (PAMI noSOS), Stent PAMI, and Air PAMI trials. We classified patients into beta group (those who received beta-blockers after successful PCI, n = 1661) and no-beta group (n = 781). We compared death and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (death, reinfarction, and ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization) at six months between groups receiving and not receiving beta-blockers.

Results

At six months, beta patients were less likely to die (2.2% vs. 6.6%, p < 0.0001) or experience MACE (14 vs. 17%, p = 0.036). In multivariate analysis, beta-blockers were independently associated with lower six-month mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26 to 0.73, p = 0.0016). Beta-blocker therapy was an independent predictor of lower six-month events in high-risk subgroups: ejection fraction ≤ 50% (death: OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.60, p = 0.0002) or multi-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) (death: OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.48, p < 0.0001; MACE: OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.80, p = 0.0011).

Conclusions

Treatment with beta-blockers after successful primary PCI is associated with reduced six-month mortality, with the greatest benefit in patients with a low ejection fraction or multi-vessel CAD.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112TzJJ1]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Beta-blocker therapy in acute coronary syndromes — In patients with ACS without contraindications, early (< 24 hours) initiation of oral beta-blocker therapy is recommended to reduce risk of reinfarction and ventricular arrhythmias. A low dose of oral beta blocker should be initiated in patients without contraindication early after diagnosis of ACS (< 24 hours) with slow dose escalation as blood pressure and heart rate permit, and use should be discontinued in those with new or worsening HF symptoms or signs of cardiogenic shock. In hemodynamically stable patients with STEMI who do not have acute HF, intravenous beta blockers can be administered prior to reperfusion if there are ongoing symptoms or a clinical indication for administration, but the weight of the evidence does not support the routine use of intravenous beta blockers prior to PPCI because of inconsistent results as to whether it has any favorable effect on infarct size or clinical outcomes. Patients with an initial contraindication to beta-blocker therapy on presentation can be reassessed after 24 hours and initiated on oral beta-blocker therapy if the initial contraindication has resolved, and the optimal duration of beta-blocker use remains unclear in patients with preserved LVEF.

### Effect of β-blockers beyond 3 Years after acute myocardial infarction [^112fZaQ9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are a high‐risk group with increased mortality even after successful revascularization; thus, the current practice guidelines emphasize the importance of intensive risk factor modification, including hypertension in patients with AMI. 1

β‐Blockers have improved survival and are one of the cornerstones in the treatment of ischemic heart disease; they exert an antianginal effect by reducing the myocardial workload and oxygen demand. 2 Besides, they also have antiarrhythmic and antiremodeling effects. 3 The effects of β‐blockers have been extensively investigated in patients with AMI, 4, 5, 6, 7 and the current practice guidelines also recommend the use of β‐blockers in all patients after AMI unless contraindicated. 1, 8

Although the effects of β‐blockers on short‐term outcomes are well established, data on their long‐term effects are scarce, especially beyond 1 year after AMI. In addition, the β‐blocker prescription may change during follow‐up, so recent studies that examined long‐term survival effect according to β‐blocker prescription at discharge might have grave limitations. 9, 10 Therefore, whether β‐blocker use beyond 1 year after AMI truly reduces mortality in the current era of AMI and post‐AMI care remains inconclusive, particularly in patients with preserved left ventricular (LV) systolic function. In low‐risk patients (preserved ejection fraction, young age, absence of arrhythmias, or residual ischemia), prolonged use of β‐blockers is unlikely to confer any mortality benefit. 11 These findings continuously raise a question to clinicians on whether to discontinue β‐blockers in low‐risk patients or to switch β‐blockers to other classes of antihypertensive agents with stronger evidence for secondary prevention of cardiovascular adverse outcomes.

In this study, we aimed to examine the late effect of β‐blockers in patients with AMI. For this purpose, the β‐blocker status and clinical characteristics of each patient were reevaluated at discharge, 1 year after AMI, and 3 years after AMI.

### BEtablocker treatment after acute myocardial infarction in revascularized patients without reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (BETAMI): rationale and design of a prospective, randomized, open, blinded end point study [^1124WDGf]. American Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines on the use of β-blockers in post-acute myocardial infarction (MI) patients without reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) are based on studies before the implementation of modern reperfusion and secondary prevention therapies. It remains unknown whether β-blockers will reduce mortality and recurrent MI in contemporary revascularized post-MI patients without reduced LVEF.

Design

BETAMI is a prospective, randomized, open, blinded end point multicenter study in 10,000 MI patients designed to test the superiority of oral β-blocker therapy compared to no β-blocker therapy. Patients with LVEF ≥ 40% following treatment with percutaneous coronary intervention or thrombolysis and/or no clinical signs of heart failure are eligible to participate. The primary end point is a composite of all-cause mortality or recurrent MI obtained from national registries over a mean follow-up period of 3 years. Safety end points include rates of nonfatal MI, all-cause mortality, ventricular arrhythmias, and hospitalizations for heart failure obtained from hospital medical records 30 days after randomization, and from national registries after 6 and 18 months. Key secondary end points include recurrent MI, heart failure, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and clinical outcomes linked to β-blocker therapy including drug adherence, adverse effects, cardiovascular risk factors, psychosocial factors, and health economy. Statistical analyses will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle. A prespecified per-protocol analysis (patients truly on β-blockers or not) will also be conducted.

Conclusions

The results from the BETAMI trial may have the potential of changing current clinical practice for treatment with β-blockers following MI in patients without reduced LVEF. EudraCT number 2018–000590–75.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117NFyp8]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Post–myocardial infarction (MI) ventricular arrhythmias and ICD timing — early ICD after MI did not improve overall survival despite arrhythmic death reduction; in DINAMIT, ICD implantation led to a 58% reduction in arrhythmic deaths within 6 to 40 days post MI with ejection fraction ≤ 35%, offset by increased nonarrhythmic deaths. Sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation occurring > 48 hours after reperfusion is associated with increased risk of death, and sudden cardiac death risk is highest in the first month. Patients with ventricular arrhythmias should first be managed with beta blockers and/or antiarrhythmic therapy, and the benefit of ICD implantation when < 40 days post MI remains unclear. In an observational post–STEMI cohort (median, 9 days) with LVEF ≤ 40% triaged by electrophysiologic testing, 22% of those who underwent ICD implantation had ventricular tachycardia terminated by the device during the first 12 months. Radiofrequency catheter ablation should be considered for recurrent ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation followed by ICD implantation, and earlier ICD implantation can be considered when a permanent pacemaker is indicated prior to discharge and LVEF is not expected to recover, though no evidence was observed to definitively demonstrate the safety of this approach.

### The duration of β-blocker therapy and outcomes in patients without heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction: a multicenter prospective cohort study [^111TCkqq]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

2.4 Definitions

The primary outcomes were cardiac death and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, composite endpoint event of cardiac death, rehospitalization for HF, recurrent MI). The secondary outcomes were all‐cause death, stroke, unstable angina, rehospitalization for HF, recurrent MI. Cardiac death was defined as death due to fatal MI, HF, and death that cannot be attributed to noncardiac causes. HF was defined as a previous history of HF or the presence of signs or symptoms associated with HF predischarge. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction was defined as LVEF below 40%. Continuous beta‐blocker therapy was defined as persistent treatment with beta‐blockers that lasted > 6 months. Beta‐blocker therapy < 6 months was defined as discharge prescription of beta‐blockers but lasting less than 6 months. No‐beta‐blocker therapy was described as never treated with beta‐blockers. Others were described as discharged without beta‐blocker therapy, restarted beta‐blocker therapy during the follow‐up. AMI is defined by the elevation of serum markers of myocardial injury at least twice their upper limit of normal (creatine kinase isoenzyme or troponin I), ST‐segment elevation or decrease in at least two contiguous leads greater than 0.1 mv, and pathological Q waves. LVEF is measured by the Simpson method of cardiac ultrasound, which is determined by the last measurement taken during hospitalization. Other PCI includes delayed PCI and rescue PCI. Timely reperfusion therapy was considered < 12 h from symptom onset to PCI therapy, < 90 min from door‐to‐balloon, and < 30 min from first medical contact to thrombolytic therapy.

### Beta-blockers after PCI for stable coronary artery disease and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction [^113R4ndx]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers have been a cornerstone in managing coronary artery disease (CAD) since early randomized controlled trials demonstrated their survival benefits after acute myocardial infarction (MI). Current American Heart Association/American College of Cardiologyguidelines recommend beta-blocker use in patients with MI, those with left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] of ≤ 50%) or systolic heart failure (HF) to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular events.

Given the limited data, the current professional guidelines do not encourage the use of beta-blocker therapy after revascularization for stable CAD patients who do not have left ventricular dysfunction. However, a recent study revealed a reduction in primary composite endpoint (all-cause death and hospitalization for HF or MI; HR: 0.92 [95% CI: 0.86–0.98]), primarily driven by hospitalization for MI (0.87 [95% CI: 0.77–0.99]). Subgroup analysis for the primary endpoint showed no significant interaction based on percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 90 days postindex (P for interaction = 0.49) and LVEF (P for interaction = 0.21).

Prior observational studies were affected by several potential biases, such as confounding by indication, where the clinical indication for the treatment may be inherently linked to the outcome; survivor treatment selection bias, which occurs when patients who live longer have more opportunities to receive treatment, leading to a fundamental difference between them and those who die earlier may remain untreated by default, immortal time bias; and prevalent user bias, significantly distorting the potential treatment effects of the therapy. Furthermore, skepticism exists in the scientific community regarding the likelihood of conducting a randomized trial to assess beta-blockade in stable CAD after PCI, considering the vast scale required for such a trial and the generic status of beta-blockers, which may diminish financial incentives for funding. In this context, we conducted a target trial emulation study to assess whether a strategy of early initiation of oral beta-blockade in patients with stable CAD and preserved LVEF after PCI influences all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes and to evaluate the safety profile of this therapeutic strategy within this cohort.

### Effect of carvedilol on outcome after myocardial infarction in patients with left-ventricular dysfunction: the CAPRICORN randomised trial [^111xhrrh]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

The beneficial effects of beta-blockers on long-term outcome after acute myocardial infarction were shown before the introduction of thrombolysis and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Generally, the patients recruited to these trials were at low risk: few had heart failure, and none had measurements of left-ventricular function taken. We investigated the long-term efficacy of carvedilol on morbidity and mortality in patients with left-ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction treated according to current evidence-based practice.

Methods

In a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, 1959 patients with a proven acute myocardial infarction and a left-ventricular ejection fraction of ≤ 40% were randomly assigned 6.25 mg carvedilol (n = 975) or placebo (n = 984). Study medication was progressively increased to a maximum of 25 mg twice daily during the next 4–6 weeks, and patients were followed up until the requisite number of primary endpoints had occurred. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality or hospital admission for cardiovascular problems. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Findings

Although there was no difference between the carvedilol and placebo groups in the number of patients with the primary endpoint (340 [35%] vs 367 [37%], hazard ratio 0.92 [95% CI 0.80–1.07]), all-cause mortality alone was lower in the carvedilol group than in the placebo group (116 [12%] vs 151 [15%], 0.77 [0.60–0.98], p = 0.03). Cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and all-cause mortality or non-fatal myocardial infarction were also lower on carvedilol than on placebo.

Interpretation

In patients treated long-term after an acute myocardial infarction complicated by left-ventricular systolic dysfunction, carvedilol reduced the frequency of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and recurrent, non-fatal myocardial infarctions. These beneficial effects are additional to those of evidence-based treatments for acute myocardial infarction including ACE inhibitors.

### Long-term use of beta-blockers after myocardial infarction in the United States [^1174Jevm]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The long-term impact of beta-blocker use after myocardial infarction (MI) is unknown. Although there are robust data supporting post-MI beta-blocker use in the prereperfusion era and in the setting of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), data on long-term beta-blocker use among contemporary populations or those with preserved LVEF are conflicting. The REDUCE-AMI (Randomized Evaluation of Decreased Usage of Beta-Blockers After Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial showed no benefit of long-term beta-blocker use among patients with MI with preserved LVEF. In contrast, interruption of beta-blocker use among patients with prior MI was not noninferior to continuation in the ABYSS (Assessment of Beta blocker interruption one Year after uncomplicated myocardial infarction on Safety and Symptomatic cardiac events requiring hospitalization) trial, with patients in the interruption group having greater cardiovascular hospitalizations. There are 5 other ongoing randomized controlled trials investigating this question (, and).

What is the clinical question being addressed?

What is the real-world long-term use of beta-blockers after myocardial infarction?

What is the main finding?

Overall use of beta-blockers postmyocardial infarction was low, but there was evidence of treatment inertia with minimal de-escalation beyond 10 years among those on beta-blockers.

As our understanding of post-MI beta-blocker efficacy increases, guidelines on the use of beta-blockers after MI have consequently evolved. Use of beta-blockers was recommended for at least 3 years after MI for secondary prevention in 2012 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology chronic coronary disease (CCD) guidelines. The 2023 CCD guideline update no longer recommends the use of long-term beta-blocker therapy beyond 1 year after MI unless patients exhibit a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 50%, angina, or another primary indication for beta-blockers.

In light of ongoing clinical trials and changes in guidelines, evaluation of real-world patterns in the long-term use of beta-blocker therapy among patients with prior MI has not yet been performed. Therefore, we used large, nationally representative survey data to assess long-term use of beta-blockers after MI in the United States.

### Practical algorithms for pharmacologic management of the post myocardial infarction patient [^111q19so]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

The pharmacologic management of the patient post myocardial infarction (MI) aims to achieve several goals. Chief among these is to prevent subsequent events, which include death, reinfarction, and rehospitalization. Secondary goals include preventing arrhythmias, minimizing left ventricular (LV) remodeling, and preventing progression to heart failure. This review describes practical algorithms for use in the pharmacologic management of the patient post MI based on American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines. The intensity of drug treatment is determined guided by the degree of LV dysfunction and the presence or absence of ischemia and arrhythmic risk markers. All patients post MI require an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and antiplatelet therapy, usually with aspirin. In individuals who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is an adequate substitute. Numerous studies document the efficacy of ACE inhibitors, which decrease mortality and the risk of heart failure and stroke. Aldosterone blockade is recommended long-term for patients post MI with an LV ejection fraction ≤ 40% and either symptomatic heart failure or diabetes. Use of a beta blocker is an important addition to most post-MI drug regimens. Beta blockers decrease mortality and are especially effective in patients with impaired LV function. Among the beta blockers, carvedilol, which also has alpha-adrenergic receptor blocking activity, was found to decrease mortality significantly in patients with low ejection fractions and heart failure. Another drug therapy of value in post-MI treatment is use of calcium-channel blockers. These are restricted to patients with conserved LV function in whom congestion is absent and in whom beta blockers are contraindicated. Current guidelines also recommend that patients post MI with elevated cholesterol levels should be prescribed lipid therapy with a statin at hospital discharge.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114o8xWv]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Pre–heart failure (stage B) management to prevent clinical heart failure focuses on disease-modifying therapies and device prevention at specific left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) thresholds. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, statins should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events. In patients with a recent myocardial infarction and LVEF ≤ 40% who are intolerant to ACEI, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome and LVEF ≤ 40%, evidence-based beta blockers should be used to reduce mortality. In patients who are at least 40 days post–myocardial infarction with LVEF ≤ 30% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while receiving GDMT and have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for > 1 year, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death to reduce total mortality. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, beta blockers should be used to prevent symptomatic HF. In patients with LVEF < 50%, thiazolidinediones should not be used because they increase the risk of HF, including hospitalizations. In patients with LVEF < 50%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful.

### Post-myocardial infarction heart failure [^1139ZUHw]. JACC: Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) complicating myocardial infarction (MI) is common and may be present at admission or develop during the hospitalization. Among patients with MI, there is a strong relationship between degree of HF and mortality. The optimal management of the patient with HF complicating MI varies according to time since the onset of infarction. Medical therapy for HF after MI includes early (within 24 h) initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and early (within 7 days) use of aldosterone antagonists. Alternatively, in patients with MI and ongoing HF, early use (< 24 h) of beta-blockers is associated with an increased risk of cardiogenic shock and death. Long-term beta-blocker use after MI is associated with a reduced risk of reinfarction and death. Thus, it is critical to frequently re-evaluate beta-blocker eligibility among patients after MI with HF. Cardiogenic shock is an extreme presentation of HF after MI and is a leading cause of death in the MI setting. The only therapy proven to reduce mortality for patients with cardiogenic shock is early revascularization. Several studies are examining new approaches to mitigate the occurrence and adverse impact of post-MI HF. These studies are testing drugs for HF and diabetes and are evaluating mechanical support devices to bridge patients to recovery or transplantation.

### Hospital protocols and evidence-based therapies: the importance of integrating aldosterone blockade into the management of patients with post-acute myocardial infarction heart failure [^115d5Bmw]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and clinical heart failure are common complications of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and result in substantially increased mortality and morbidity. Evidence-based cardiovascular protective therapies, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, antiplatelet agents, and lipid-lowering medications, improve outcomes for these patients. However, this population is significantly undertreated with these guideline-recommended agents. Critical pathways have been demonstrated to improve the quality and consistency of treatment; as such, the new American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for the management of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) recommend that critical pathways be implemented for the management of these patients. The recent Eplerenone Post-acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS) demonstrates that eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, has incremental benefit in decreasing mortality and morbidity when used with standard care therapies in patients post AMI with heart failure and LVSD. The clinical trial evidence coupled with the national guidelines provides a strong rationale for routine incorporation of aldosterone blockade into new or already established critical pathways for AMI complicated by LVSD and heart failure.

Table 3
Observational Studies Assessing Long-Term Use of Beta-Blocker Therapy and Health Outcomes

Evidence from the Convergent Registry of Catholic and Chonnam University for Acute MI (COREA-AMI) showed a 36.7% reduction in 3-year all-cause mortality risk for post-MI patients who underwent PCI, had preserved systolic function (LVEF ≥ 50%), and were treated with beta-blocker therapy (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.46–0.86). In contrast, analysis of the Korean Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry-National Institutes of Health (KAMIR-NIH) registry reported that the use of beta-blocker therapy at 1-year follow-up after an electrocardiogram (ECG) following an acute MI reduced the 2-year all-cause mortality risk by 51% in patients with a 1-year LVEF < 50% (HR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.26–0.89)but not in patients with LVEF ≥ 50% (HR: 1.35; 95% CI: 0.74–2.46). Similarly, evidence from the Melbourne Interventional Group registry (MIG) involving 17,562 patients with a mean follow-up period of 5.3 years, demonstrated that beta-blocker therapy after PCI significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality by 37% in patients with LVEF < 35% (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.44–0.91) and by 20% in those with LVEF between 35% and 50% (HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.68–0.95) but had no effect in those with LVEF > 50% (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.87–1.21).

### Long-term use of beta-blockers after myocardial infarction in the United States [^112hipVm]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study is the first to investigate long-term use of beta-blockers after MI in the United States using a large, nationally representative dataset. This question cannot be answered using existing U.S. clinical trial or registry data due to limited long-term follow-up or lack of generalizability.

Overall rates of beta-blocker use in the first year after MI were low, similar to prior studies, suggesting a failure to initiate or continue guideline-recommended treatment in the early post-MI period, though uncertainty on the utility of beta-blockers in the contemporary early post-MI period exists.

We also found that use of beta-blockers beyond the first year after MI remained stable. Rates of beta-blocker use increased in years 2 to 3 compared to the first year after MI among patients without HF or angina. This group of patients would likely be targeted for de-escalation based on the updated CCD guidelines, yet currently have the highest beta-blocker use. Moreover, we found high rates of beta-blocker use beyond 3 years among patients without HF or angina, despite a lack of class I indication beyond 3 years in prior guidelines. Although it is possible that some of these patients had another indication for beta-blocker use, these patients would likely be most affected by the results of recently completed and ongoing clinical trials of post-MI beta-blocker use.

Our results highlight the importance of re-evaluating long-term post-MI beta-blocker use as results of ongoing clinical trials become known. Persistent use of beta-blockers among angina-free patients with preserved LVEF beyond 10 years after MI is suggestive of therapeutic inertia. Therapeutic inertia is typically considered as a failure to initiate or intensify recommended therapy, but it also encompasses failure to deintensify therapy when no longer necessary. Regardless of whether the consensus emerging from contemporary trials favors continuation or interruption of beta-blocker therapy long-term, approximately half of all U.S. angina-free patients with preserved LVEF post-MI will warrant consideration of therapy modification.

A limitation of this study is that it does not account for cohort effects, as patients who are 5 years from MI had MI at a different period than those of 0 to 1 year from MI. However, there have been no major changes in recommendations regarding beta-blockers and minimal changes in overall therapeutic strategy for MI during this period.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic reduction of LVEF but no symptoms — pharmacologic prevention: Long-term treatment with an ACEI has been shown to delay the onset of HF symptoms and decrease the risk of death and hospitalization for HF in asymptomatic patients with reduced LVEF, whether due to a remote ischemic injury or to a nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Although there are no studies that specifically addressed use of ARBs in asymptomatic patients with reduced LVEF, ARBs may be an appropriate alternative, particularly in patients who cannot tolerate an ACEI. Furthermore, although controlled clinical trials are lacking, the use of beta-blockers in patients with a low EF and no symptoms (especially those with coronary artery disease) is also recommended, and the same beta-blockers should be used that were employed in the large HF trials.

### Beta-blocker therapy after myocardial Infarction [^117VTnAL]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cardiovascular disease (CVD) and a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide. In 2022, ischemic heart disease, which includes CAD, accounted for the highest global cardiovascular mortality, with an age-standardized rate of 108.8 deaths per 100,000 people, underscoring its public health burden. Characterized by reduced or blocked oxygen flow to the heart, ischemic heart disease is chronic and dynamic in nature. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), such as acute myocardial infarction (MI), arises from atherosclerotic plaque rupture or erosion.CAD and MI incur significant health care costs, projected to surpass US$1 trillion globally by 2030.

Despite significant advancements in MI treatment, several gaps remain, particularly regarding the optimal use and effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy following MI in patients with normal versus reduced heart function (ie, those with left ventricular dysfunction). While beta-blocker therapy has been a cornerstone in managing MI due to its ability to reduce myocardial oxygen demand, prevent arrhythmias, and improve survival rates, its effectiveness for patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or without heart failure remains unclear. Recent reviews have reported mixed findings regarding the long-term effects of beta-blocker therapy, and have unveiled the fact that most of the evidence suggesting its significant CV mortality and morbidity benefits was derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in the prereperfusion era (Central Illustration). This presents a critical gap, as current clinical guidelines are based on outdated evidence and lack data from comprehensive RCTs and real-world evidence (RWE) that accurately reflect today's diverse patient populations seen in clinical practice. There is a need for up-to-date, broader and more representative studies that provide insights into the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapyin the context of modern revascularization procedures and newer pharmacotherapies that have improved post-MI outcomes.

Prevention of cardiovascular events — acute MI and history of MI with normal LVEF: In patients with an acute MI, the infusion of a fibrinolytic agent or the use of percutaneous coronary intervention can decrease the risk of developing HF, and patients also benefit from both a beta-blocker and either an ACEI or ARB, which can decrease the risk of reinfarction or death when initiated within days after the ischemic event; combined neurohormonal blockade produces additive benefits. In patients with a history of MI but normal LVEF, both hypertension and hyperlipidemia should be treated vigorously, patients with a recent MI should also receive ACEIs and beta-blockers to reduce death risk, and evidence from 2 large-scale studies indicates that prolonged ACEI therapy can reduce major cardiovascular events even when started months or years after MI.

The timeline illustrates included randomized controlled trials during the prereperfusion and reperfusion eras, with a traffic light color coding indicating the type of association between beta-blocker therapy and patient outcomes. The timeline highlights how evidence has evolved over time with the introduction of new treatments and shifts in patient populations, offering insights into the changing clinical context and treatment efficacy. RCTs = randomized controlled trials.

In summary, although beta-blocker therapy has long been a mainstay in post-MI management, several gaps remain in both evidence and practice. Variability in results from studies conducted during the reperfusion era underscores the need for further research. This review aims to summarize the evidence on the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy across both the prereperfusion and reperfusion eras, highlighting the conflicting results reported in studies from the reperfusion era and appraising possible reasons behind these variations. This state-of-the-art review was informed by a comprehensive search of current literaturefor clinical guidelines on post-MI management in the United States, Europe, and Australia, as well as the largest and most influential RCTs from both eras that have played a fundamental role in shaping and revising clinical guidelines. Additionally, the review includes RWE studies from 2014 onward to represent the current clinical setting. Given the controversial and rapidly growing nature of this field, a limited number of observational studies are included in this review.

### Association of β-blockers beyond 1 year after myocardial infarction and cardiovascular outcomes [^117KeqFk]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this nationwide cohort study of patients who survived MI beyond 1 year, we included 43 618 patients without heart failure or LVSD 1 year after first MI and found that long-term BB therapy was not associated with improved CV outcomes during median follow-up of 4.5 years. These findings were consistent across individual secondary endpoints and across patient subgroups.

The results of our study address an existing gap in the current evidence and provide an insight into long-term optimal secondary prevention strategies for a large proportion of MI survivors, namely patients with no heart failure or LVSD who may have longer survival compared with those who develop such complications after an MI. As such, understanding the association between long-term BB use and CV outcomes in this group of patients has important implications in determining health policies and developing Clinical Practice Guidelines, but also has an impact on patients' health-related quality of life and compliance with other CV preventive therapies.

Following MI, heart failure is a major determinant of long-term morbidity and mortality for which several prognostic therapies including BB have been shown to improve outcomes. While Clinical Practice Guidelines state that it is reasonable to initiate and continue BB therapy following MI in patients without heart failure or LVSD, these recommendations are based on RCTs that predate the reperfusion and potent antiplatelets era. The current clinical practice of routine long-term use of BB is based on historical data which might not be extrapolated to patients with MI without heart failure or LVSD. As such, recent Clinical Practice Guidelines for myocardial revascularisation have questioned the routine use of chronic BB in patients with chronic coronary syndrome.

Here we present the largest study evaluating BB therapy in patients without heart failure or LVSD following MI. Among 43 618 patients, long-term BB therapy was not associated with improved CV outcomes. Until recently, no RCT had tested the efficacy of BB on long-term CV outcomes among patients with MI without heart failure or LVSD. In a contemporary small RCT, patients with STEMI without heart failure or LVSD were randomised to long-term carvedilol therapy or placebo. The trial reported that BB had no beneficial effect on CV outcomes. However, this RCT was underpowered and employed an open-label approach. In addition, the study included only a subset of MI patients thus limiting the generalisability of the results.

Asymptomatic low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and post–myocardial infarction (MI) risk — key evidence and cautions are as follows: The Framingham studies have shown a 60% increased risk of death in patients with asymptomatic low LVEF compared with those with normal LVEF. MADIT-II showed a 31% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality in patients with post-MI with LVEF ≤ 30% receiving a prophylactic ICD compared with standard of care. For prevention of progression, beta-blocker therapy is recommended to prevent symptomatic HF in patients with reduced LVEF. Regarding comorbid therapy, thiazolidinediones should be avoided in patients with reduced LVEF. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers diltiazem and verapamil are myocardial depressants and generally not tolerated in HF, and although not specifically tested in asymptomatic patients with low LVEF, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may be harmful in this population because of their negative inotropic effects.

### Improving the management of patients after myocardial infarction, from admission to discharge [^117Bnqim]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Recent developments in pharmacologic and device therapy, as well as initiatives to increase the use of standard orders and promote in-hospital communication, have improved the care of patients with myocardial infarction (MI). The increased presence of hospitalists, physicians who provide in-hospital care as a specialty, promises to provide further improvements.

Objective

This article reviews current information on evidence-based care of the hospitalized MI patient, with a particular emphasis on identifying left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and appropriate treatments.

Methods

MEDLINE was searched for all large-scale clinical trials providing information on the care of post-MI patients with or without LVD and/or heart failure (HF), with no limit on time period. The search terms were post-myocardial infarction, large-scale, randomized, clinical trial, left ventricular dysfunction, and/or heart failure. All trials investigating therapies currently recommended in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ST-elevation MI (ACC/AHA STEMI) guidelines and including post-MI patients with or without LVD and/or HF, as indicated by signs and symptoms of HF or Killip class, were included.

Results

In the acute setting, the ACC/AHA STEMI guidelines recommend the use of aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, heparin (low molecular weight or unfractionated), and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (if the patient is undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention). The guidelines recommend use of aldosterone antagonists and statins at discharge, in addition to continuation of all acute therapies. The ACC/AHA guidelines apply to all patients after MI and do not specify whether the recommended therapies are effective in post-MI patients with LVD or HE Reviewing the trials that included post-MI patients with LVD and/or HF, it appears that in some cases, only certain agents within a class have been evaluated (eg, post-MI beta-blocker trials often excluded patients with LVD, and the efficacy of atenolol has not been evaluated in post-MI patients with LVD or HF), and some agents have not shown as much efficacy as others in this high-risk patient population (eg, metoprolol appeared to be associated with poorer outcomes in this population than carvedilol). Rather than recommending an entire class, hospital care maps and critical-care pathway tools should incorporate the use of evidence-based agents.

Conclusions

The use of evidence-based care in the hospital has the potential to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality in post-MI patients with LVD and/or HE The hospitalist can facilitate the best practices and best care of the post-MI patient through the use of in-hospital critical-care pathway tools.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — trial populations and outcomes with beta-blockers: Beta-blockers have been evaluated in more than 20 000 patients across more than 20 published placebo-controlled trials, enrolling patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) defined as EF less than 35% to 45% who were already treated with diuretics and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), with or without digitalis. Trials generally excluded or underrepresented patients with preserved systolic function, low heart rates (less than 65 beats per min), low systolic blood pressure (less than 85 mm Hg), hospitalization, or class IV HF; one carvedilol trial enrolled clinically stable NYHA class III and IV patients free of edema and showed a mortality reduction similar to less advanced disease. Collectively, long-term beta-blocker therapy can lessen HF symptoms, improve clinical status and well-being, and reduce the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization, with benefits seen regardless of coronary artery disease or diabetes status and in women and black patients; favorable effects were also observed in patients already taking ACEIs, suggesting additive effects from combined blockade of the 2 neurohormonal systems.
