## Question

Freest meant for bilateral leg swelling from CHF

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best first-line management for bilateral leg swelling due to congestive heart failure, with explicit step-by-step thinking and self-verification language preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the presence and distribution of edema and its severity. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and avoid premature closure. Next, I will review the initial diagnostic workup, including labs and imaging. After that, I need to assess volume status and hemodynamics. Then, I will outline disease-directed therapy for HFrEF and HFpEF, followed by edema-specific management including diuretics, sodium restriction, and adjuncts. Finally, I should consider special populations, monitoring, and when to escalate care, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the edema characteristics and severity, because bilateral pitting edema that is symmetric and dependent, often extending from ankles to knees or higher, is typical of systemic volume overload in heart failure, whereas unilateral edema should prompt concern for DVT and lymphedema tends to be non-pitting with skin thickening; I should also grade pitting, measure the edema's vertical extent, and document weight and jugular venous pressure at baseline since these anchor subsequent response assessment [^116Xj8qw] [^112haf2y] [^113VbQJu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check for mimics and contributors such as chronic venous insufficiency, nephrotic syndrome or cirrhosis causing hypoalbuminemia, hypothyroidism, medication-induced edema (for example, calcium channel blockers, NSAIDs, pioglitazone), and primary lymphedema, because these can coexist with or masquerade as heart failure edema and will alter management if unrecognized [^111tew52] [^112haf2y] [^112ohXaG].

> Next, I should review the initial diagnostic workup; let me obtain natriuretic peptides to objectively support a heart failure diagnosis and gauge congestion, and if positive or clinical suspicion remains high, proceed to transthoracic echocardiography to define EF, assess diastolic function, valves, and right heart, while also ordering a basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and urinalysis with protein-to-creatinine ratio to screen for renal, hepatic, endocrine, and protein-losing etiologies; a chest radiograph can support pulmonary congestion but has limited sensitivity and should not be used in isolation to confirm or exclude heart failure [^116Xj8qw] [^111TS1VV] [^112haf2y].

> I will now examine volume status and hemodynamics; jugular venous distension is the most reliable bedside sign of elevated filling pressures, and daily weights are the most sensitive marker of short-term fluid shifts, so I should document JVP, orthopnea, and daily weights, and correlate with symptoms such as bendopnea and early satiety; wait, let me verify that I'm not overinterpreting edema alone — edema can lag and may be less specific than JVP and weight changes, so serial assessments are essential to avoid underestimating or overestimating congestion [^113VbQJu] [^116Xj8qw].

> For disease-directed therapy in HFrEF, I need to ensure guideline-directed medical therapy is initiated or optimized once the patient is euvolemic or at least not in overt shock; that includes a RAS inhibitor, beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and SGLT2 inhibitor, with careful titration and attention to blood pressure, renal function, and potassium, and I should remember that in overt congestion, beta-blocker up-titration may need to wait until after decongestion to avoid worsening symptoms [^111ZwFvM] [^113sUJWZ].

> For HFpEF, let me consider that evidence is strongest for blood pressure control, atrial fibrillation rate control, and treatment of comorbidities; diuretics remain appropriate for congestion, and while SGLT2 inhibitors have emerging benefit, I should confirm candidacy and align expectations with current guidance, recognizing that many patients will still require careful diuretic management for edema relief [^111BxKY3].

> Now, edema-specific management: I should confirm that loop diuretics are indicated to relieve congestion and improve symptoms, and I need to choose the agent and route thoughtfully; furosemide is standard, with oral dosing typically 20–80 mg once with repeat in 6–8 hours as needed and IV dosing 20–40 mg bolus with escalation if needed, but wait, I should double-check comparative effectiveness — torsemide may reduce hospitalizations and mortality compared with furosemide in diuretic-resistant cases, so switching or prioritizing torsemide is reasonable when response is suboptimal [^115A5MYS] [^113rUzzd] [^112NrQ6u].

> I need to ensure sodium restriction is addressed; avoiding excessive sodium intake is reasonable to reduce congestive symptoms, and a practical target of less than 2.3 g/day is commonly used, but hold on, I should verify that overly aggressive restriction can impair nutrition — yes, routine aggressive sodium restriction has not consistently improved hard outcomes and may compromise dietary quality, so individualized counseling with a dietitian is prudent, and fluid restriction is reserved for hyponatremia in advanced HF rather than routine use [^1171FyQQ] [^111dSeUs].

> Let me consider adjuncts for refractory edema; combining a loop diuretic with a thiazide-type agent such as metolazone can overcome diuretic resistance, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists both treat HFrEF and provide additional natriuresis; I should confirm electrolytes and renal function closely when using combination regimens to avoid hypokalemia and azotemia, and in select cases, IV vasodilators or inotropes may be needed for persistent congestion with low output, guided by hemodynamics and specialist input [^113sUJWZ].

> But wait, what if the edema is not purely cardiogenic; I should double-check for chronic venous insufficiency and consider compression therapy once the skin is intact, and I must remember that cilostazol for PAD-related claudication is contraindicated in heart failure of any severity due to fluid retention risk, so I should avoid it in this population; if lymphedema is suspected, I need to pivot to lymphatic-focused strategies rather than escalating diuretics indefinitely [^112haf2y] [^115uHKCj] [^115LybPT].

> I should confirm medication reconciliation to remove or replace edema-promoting drugs when feasible, including NSAIDs, some calcium channel blockers, pioglitazone, and agents like itraconazole or bosentan that can worsen heart failure or fluid retention; this step is easy to overlook but can meaningfully reduce diuretic requirements and improve decongestion [^112ohXaG] [^114BSmZQ] [^112f7Hz7].

> Next, I should review special populations; in advanced or end-stage heart failure, palliative strategies may be appropriate when decompensation is recurrent and refractory, and in renal or hepatic disease, I need to adjust diuretic dosing and monitor closely for electrolyte disturbances; in obesity, I should be cautious not to misattribute all edema to venous stasis and ensure heart failure is adequately treated; in older adults, I must balance aggressive diuresis against risks of prerenal azotemia and falls, and in pregnancy or postpartum states, I should tailor therapy to maternal-fetal safety considerations [^117DsniT] [^112VU6Aw].

> I will now examine monitoring and follow-up; daily weights, strict I/Os during active decongestion, and frequent labs for electrolytes, renal function, and natriuretic peptides help track response, and I should set a practical early follow-up within 3–7 days after initiation or intensification of therapy to reassess congestion and tolerability; if diuretic resistance emerges, I should verify adherence, sodium intake, and consider pharmacokinetic issues such as bioavailability or absorption, and if still refractory, escalate to combination diuretic therapy or specialty referral [^113VbQJu] [^111ZwFvM] [^113sUJWZ].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have a plan for escalation; persistent or worsening edema despite optimized oral therapy, rising creatinine, hypotension, or signs of low output should prompt hospitalization for IV diuretics, hemodynamic monitoring, and consideration of inotropes or mechanical circulatory support in selected cases, and I should remember that marked leg edema, ascites, or perineal edema are recognized markers of marked congestion that warrant urgent inpatient management rather than outpatient titration [^115mQzwM].

The most effective treatment for bilateral leg swelling from CHF is **loop diuretics** (furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide) to relieve congestion and improve symptoms [^113ReMqF]. Use **torsemide** if available, as it offers superior bioavailability and outcomes compared with furosemide [^112NrQ6u]. Add a thiazide-type diuretic (e.g. metolazone) for diuretic resistance, and titrate to effect while monitoring renal function and electrolytes [^notfound]. Nonpharmacologic measures include sodium restriction (< 2 g/day), leg elevation, and compression stockings. Address the underlying CHF with guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and treat exacerbating factors (e.g. medication nonadherence, dietary indiscretion, infection) to prevent recurrence [^111ZwFvM].

---

## Pharmacological management

### Loop diuretics

- **First-line therapy**: Loop diuretics are the cornerstone for managing peripheral edema in CHF, promoting sodium and water excretion and reducing intravascular volume [^116o6ZBR].

- **Commonly used agents**: Furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide.

- **Furosemide dosing**: Oral 20–80 mg once, repeat in 6–8 hours if needed; maximum 600 mg/day [^115A5MYS]. IV 20–40 mg bolus over 1–2 minutes, repeat in 2 hours if needed; maximum 200 mg/day [^113rUzzd].

- **Torsemide**: Preferred for its higher bioavailability and consistent absorption; 10–20 mg orally once daily, titrate to effect.

- **Bumetanide**: 0.5–2 mg orally once daily, titrate to effect.

---

### Combination diuretic therapy

For **diuretic resistance**, add a thiazide-type diuretic (e.g. metolazone 2.5–10 mg orally once daily) to loop therapy to enhance natriuresis [^113ReMqF]. Monitor closely for electrolyte disturbances and renal dysfunction.

---

### Adjunctive pharmacological therapy

- **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)**: Spironolactone or eplerenone reduce fluid retention and improve outcomes in HFrEF [^notfound].

- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Empagliflozin or dapagliflozin reduce fluid overload and improve symptoms in HFrEF and HFpEF [^notfound].

- **ACE inhibitors/ARBs**: Reduce afterload, improve cardiac output, and lessen fluid retention [^notfound].

- **Beta-blockers**: Improve cardiac function and reduce sympathetic activity, indirectly reducing fluid retention [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

### Dietary sodium restriction

Limit sodium to **< 2 g/day** to reduce fluid retention and edema [^notfound].

---

### Limb elevation and compression therapy

Elevate the legs above heart level to reduce dependent edema, and use **graduated compression stockings** to reduce swelling and improve lymphatic drainage.

---

### Weight monitoring

Track **daily weight** to detect early fluid accumulation and guide diuretic adjustments [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of therapy

- **Regular follow-up**: Monitor weight, blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes.

- **Adjust diuretic dosing**: Titrate based on clinical response and laboratory parameters.

- **Patient education**: Teach self-monitoring and adherence to dietary and medication regimens [^1171FyQQ].

---

## Addressing underlying causes and exacerbating factors

Identify and treat **exacerbating factors** — medication nonadherence, dietary indiscretion, infection, or arrhythmias — to prevent recurrence [^1148KFCJ].

---

## Potential complications of untreated or poorly managed edema

- **Skin changes**: Chronic edema can lead to skin thickening, hyperpigmentation, and ulceration [^113tWtmf].

- **Infection**: Increased risk of cellulitis and secondary infections [^notfound].

- **Impaired mobility**: Reduced quality of life and functional impairment [^1156Rpuw].

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Loop diuretics (furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide) | First-line therapy for fluid removal |
| 2 | Combination therapy (loop + thiazide) | For diuretic resistance |
| 3 | Adjunctive therapy (MRAs, SGLT2 inhibitors, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, beta-blockers) | Address underlying CHF pathophysiology |
| 4 | Non-pharmacological measures (sodium restriction, limb elevation, compression stockings) | Supportive care to reduce edema |
| 5 | Monitoring and adjustment of therapy | Ensure effective and safe management |
| 6 | Address underlying causes and exacerbating factors | Prevent recurrence |

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) uncommonly metastasises to the heart. We present a case of new onset bilateral leg swelling and suspected right heart failure in a previously fit and healthy man, which on further investigation revealed a new diagnosis of HCC with extension into the inferior vena cava and right atrium. This case highlights the importance of considering alternative possibilities when physical examination does not match the initial clinical diagnosis. The management approach was for best supportive care in view of extensive metastatic disease.

### Clinical characteristics of lower-extremity edema in stage A cardiovascular disease status defined by the ACC / AHA 2001 chronic heart failure guidelines [^1145c5kt]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Checking for lower-extremity edema is important for diagnosing, monitoring, and managing heart failure (HF). However, the characteristics of this sign in the early stages of cardiovascular disease (stage A, as defined by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2001 chronic HF guidelines) have not been adequately explored.

Hypothesis

We hypothesized that stage A HF patients (at risk for HF) are free from leg edema.

Methods

After the exclusion of patients with high serum creatinine levels (≥ 1.2 mg/dL), abnormal electrocardiogram rhythm, and/or comorbid critical disease(s), we studied the prevalence and predictors for leg edema in 274 subjects at risk for heart failure but without structural heart disease or symptoms of HF.

Results

The overall prevalence of lower-extremity edema was 33 of 274 patients (12.0%; 95% confidence interval: 8.2%-15.9%). In most patients (29/33, 88%), the leg edema involved only the ankle and foot. Compared with patients without leg edema (n = 241), those with leg edema (n = 33) were older (age, 74 ± 11 7 vs 69 ± 12 years, P = 0.006), more likely to present with pulmonary crackles (52% vs 31%, P < 0.03), and more likely to have varicose veins (55% vs 15%, P < 0.001). Leg edema and varicose veins coexisted in 19 (58%) patients, of whom 16 patients were women. On multivariate analysis, the presence of varicose veins was the only independent predictor of the appearance of bilateral leg edema (odds ratio: 8.18, 95% confidence interval: 3.92–17.1, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

A mild degree of leg edema is not uncommon in patients at risk for HF. Recognition of this phenomenon might be important for evaluation, monitoring, and self-care of HF patients.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Risk stratification of acute heart failure (HF) in the emergency department outlines sequential triage: "Critically ill at presentation?" leads to "Admit for critical care", and if not, "New diagnosis of HF?" leads to "Admit for evaluation of new HF". Subsequent assessment includes "Marked degree of congestion?", "Medical risk/complexity?", and "Need for more information about history/regimen/comorbidities?" followed by "Review of triggers Focused re-education Limited diagnostic workup". Disposition options shown include "Home with recheck < 7 days", "Potential for observation unit", and "Possible Hospital at Home". The figure notes that signs of marked congestion may include "Marked leg edema, ascites, or scrotal or perineal edema", and that radiographic and biochemical abnormalities may also indicate congestion.

### Developing drugs for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: what have we learned from clinical trials? [^115mJSvZ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Pathophysiologically, HF is defined as the inability of the heart to provide adequate perfusion to the body and its tissues. Clinically, HF is defined as a syndrome with typical signs (pulmonary congestion, peripheral edema, and elevated jugular venous pressure) and symptoms (dyspnea, ankle swelling, and fatigue), which result from abnormal cardiac structure or function. 1, 2 HF is a highly prevalent disease, affecting 5.8 million people in the United States and nearly 15 million in Europe. 3, 4 The symptoms and the need for frequent hospitalizations in HF cause a significant burden on individual patients. At the same time, HF is a major public health concern due to the need for frequent and intense healthcare resource utilization. 1, 2, 4, 5 Further, despite the use of currently available therapies, the prognosis of patients with HF is considerably poor, with 5‐year survival rates of 50%, a prognosis even worse than that of patients with advanced cancer or stroke. 6

### Peripheral edema: evaluation and management in primary care [^112haf2y]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Edema is a common clinical sign that may indicate numerous pathologies. As a sequela of imbalanced capillary hemodynamics, edema is an accumulation of fluid in the interstitial compartment. The chronicity and laterality of the edema guide evaluation. Medications (e.g., antihypertensives, anti-inflammatory drugs, hormones) can contribute to edema. Evaluation should begin with obtaining a basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, thyroid function testing, brain natriuretic peptide levels, and a urine protein/creatinine ratio. Validated decision rules, such as the Wells and STOP-Bang (snoring, tired, observed, pressure, body mass index, age, neck size, gender) criteria, can guide decision-making regarding the possibility of venous thromboembolic disease and obstructive sleep apnea, respectively. Acute unilateral lower-extremity edema warrants immediate evaluation for deep venous thrombosis with a d-dimer test or compression ultrasonography. For patients with chronic bilateral lower-extremity edema, duplex ultrasonography with reflux can help diagnose chronic venous insufficiency. Patients with pulmonary edema or elevated brain natriuretic peptide levels should undergo echocardiography to assess for heart failure. Lymphedema is often a clinical diagnosis; lymphoscintigraphy can be performed if the diagnosis is unclear. Treatment of edema is specific to the etiology. Diuretics are effective but should be used only for systemic causes of edema. Ruscus extract and horse chestnut seed demonstrate moderate-quality evidence to improve edema from chronic venous insufficiency. Compression therapy is effective for most causes of edema.

### Congestive lower extremity failure: an educational model for improved understanding of phlebolymphedema [^113tWtmf]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig
Comparison of congestive heart failure (CHF) and congestive leg failure cascades. CLEF, Congestive lower extremity failure.

Similarly, in the novel CLEF model, inflammation leads to chronic venous insufficiency and resultant lower extremity venous hypertension. This process, in turn, causes lymphatic system overload, culminating in dual system dysfunction and progressive soft tissue edema. Phlebolymphedema develops with secondary dysfunction of the lymphatic pump and dermal lymphatic backflow. This pathological phenomenon then engorges the interstitium and causes increased subcutaneous edema that retards microvascular arterial perfusion. These complications result in venous and lymphatic stasis in CLEF and manifest as leg fatigue, heaviness, leg pain, leg cramps, and progressive swelling. Venous edema and inflammatory processes lead to hemosiderin deposition, lipodermatosclerosis, cellular apoptosis, tissue fibrosis, and ultimately soft tissue ulceration in the final stage. Hence, the CLEF model emphasizes the need to treat both venous and lymphatic pathophysiology to restore tissue homeostasis (Fig). This philosophy mirrors the clinical management of CHF, which addresses both volume overload of the lung (ie, diuretics) as well as dysfunction of the left ventricle (ie, inotropic agents). The pertinent Clinical, Etiologic, Anatomic and Pathophysiologic (CEAP) classification of CLEF would include stages C2 to C6. Similarly, CHF is described in four progressive stages from A to D. The concept of CLEF, a new teaching model for venous pathophysiology, if incorporated into educational curricula, may improve students' understanding, recognition, and treatment of phlebolymphedema.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for treatment of heart Failure with reduced ejection Fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^111ZwFvM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — scope and general assumptions emphasize that this pathway primarily addresses chronic HFrEF with LVEF ≤ 40% in the ambulatory setting without clinical instability, and that patients presenting with orthopnea or uncomfortable peripheral edema should first receive diuretic agent therapy with early follow-up to ensure progress toward decongestion before applying subsequent steps. The Writing Committee endorses evidence-based approaches enumerated in the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA HF guideline, the algorithms assume multidisciplinary input as needed to guide clinical management, and patient preferences and values, in addition to evidence-based clinical judgment, should guide clinical decision-making; these suggestions and algorithms may be superseded by new data.

### Strange case of biventricular heart failure [^116Kv7Vf]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Acute heart failure (HF) is commonly caused by a cardiomyopathy with one or more precipitating factor. Here, a case in which a cardiomyopathy is precipitated by pulmonary embolism (PE). A 77-year-old man is admitted for breathlessness and leg swelling. A mild reduction of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction is found, with moderately increased LV wall thickness and pulmonary hypertension; clinical examination revealed signs of congestion with bilateral leg swelling, and mild signs of left HF with the absence of pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray. The ECG showed Mobitz I second-degree atrioventricular block. The clinical scenario led us to the diagnosis of infiltrative cardiomyopathy due to cardiac amyloidosis (CA) precipitated by PE. Pulmonary embolism is an overlooked precipitant of HF and can be the first manifestation of an underlying misdiagnosed cardiomyopathy, especially CA. 3,3-Diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid scan is a cornerstone in the diagnosis of Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) cardiac amyloidosis.

### Approach to leg edema of unclear etiology [^113fbkTh]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

A common challenge for primary care physicians is to determine the cause and find an effective treatment for leg edema of unclear etiology. We were unable to find existing practice guidelines that address this problem in a comprehensive manner. This article provides clinically oriented recommendations for the management of leg edema in adults. We searched on-line resources, textbooks, and MEDLINE (using the MeSH term, "edema") to find clinically relevant articles on leg edema. We then expanded the search by reviewing articles cited in the initial sources. Our goal was to write a brief, focused review that would answer questions about the management of leg edema. We organized the information to make it rapidly accessible to busy clinicians. The most common cause of leg edema in older adults is venous insufficiency. The most common cause in women between menarche and menopause is idiopathic edema, formerly known as "cyclic" edema. A common but under-recognized cause of edema is pulmonary hypertension, which is often associated with sleep apnea. Venous insufficiency is treated with leg elevation, compressive stockings, and sometimes diuretics. The initial treatment of idiopathic edema is spironolactone. Patients who have findings consistent with sleep apnea, such as daytime somnolence, loud snoring, or neck circumference > 17 inches, should be evaluated for pulmonary hypertension with an echocardiogram. If time is limited, the physician must decide whether the evaluation can be delayed until a later appointment (eg, an asymptomatic patient with chronic bilateral edema) or must be completed at the current visit (eg, a patient with dyspnea or a patient with acute edema [< 72 hours]). If the evaluation should be conducted at the current visit, the algorithm shown in Figure 1 could be used as a guide. If the full evaluation could wait for a subsequent visit, the patient should be examined briefly to rule out an obvious systemic cause and basic laboratory tests should be ordered for later review (complete blood count, urinalysis, electrolytes, creatinine, blood sugar, thyroid stimulating hormone, and albumin).

### Effects of a transitional palliative care model on patients with end-stage heart failure: a randomised controlled trial [^117DsniT]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is a worldwide health issueresulting in high mortality rates of 40% and 75%, respectively, within the first yearand at 5 yearsafter diagnosis. The treatment of chronic HF has improved in the last decade, with updated national guidelines for diagnosis and disease management. Palliative care (PC) can be initiated when end-stage HF (ESHF) is diagnosed, with the ratio of PC to life-prolonging care gradually increasing when patients are refractory to treatment.

Patients with advanced HF experience marked reductions in health-related quality of life (QOL). The three most prevalent physical symptoms reported by these patients are fatigue, dyspnoea and swelling of arms and legs. Psychologically, patients with HF experience feelings of uncertainty and fear since their conditions can change rapidly and the feeling of death is imminent. Socially, patients with HF feel isolated and lonely, and regard themselves as a burden to their carers since they often require assistance in daily living. These patients, with complicated issues in refractory symptoms, psychological distress and difficult decision-making involving families, would benefit from a specialist PC team trained in these skills. However, PC is reported to be underused among patients with HF.

### Bosentan [^112f7Hz7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Lack of Benefit in Congestive Heart Failure

Bosentan is not effective in the treatment of congestive heart failure with left ventricular dysfunction. In a pair of studies, 1613 subjects with NYHA Class III-IV heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%, on diuretics, ACE inhibitor, and other therapies, were randomized to placebo or bosentan (62.5 mg twice daily titrated as tolerated to 125 mg twice daily) and followed for up to 70 weeks. Use of bosentan was associated with no benefit on patient global assessment (the primary end point) or mortality. However, hospitalizations for heart failure were more common during the first 4 to 8 weeks after bosentan was initiated. In a placebo-controlled trial of patients with severe chronic heart failure, there was an increased incidence of hospitalization for CHF associated with weight gain and increased leg edema during the first 4 to 8 weeks of treatment with bosentan. Patients required intervention with a diuretic, fluid management, or hospitalization for decompensating heart failure.

### Serial assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction for the management of heart failure: unnecessary and unrealistic? [^113sUJWZ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Sir Thomas Lewis, one of the doyens of 20th century cardiology said that 'the very essence of cardiovascular medicine is the recognition of early heart failure'. By heart failure, Lewis meant clinical evidence of congestion. Compared to LVEF, congestion is a much stronger driver of symptoms, prognosis and unmet therapeutic need. Worsening congestion can be assessed in many ways. A patient may report increasing exertional breathlessness or ankle swelling, but these are late manifestations of worsening congestion, and their interpretation might be confounded by comorbidities such as respiratory disease, venous insufficiency and obesity. A health professional might detect raised venous pressure or a third heart sound, but again it is a late manifestation of congestion with low sensitivity and specificity even amongst cardiologists, which novel technologies are attempting to address. Natriuretic peptides are a quick, efficient, low‐cost method of detecting congestion, disease progression or regression and changes in prognosis. They should be added to the list of blood tests that are part of routine follow‐up for electrolyte disturbances, renal function and anaemia.

When worsening congestion is suspected, cardiac function should be re‐assessed, with a focus on identifying or excluding problems that inform management, such as atrial fibrillation, conduction disturbances and valve dysfunction. Persistent or worsening congestion indicates that the disease has not been adequately controlled, or has relapsed, and that other therapeutic options should be considered. A patient with heart failure and congestion should receive an MRA and SGLT2i and have diuretic dose optimized, regardless of LVEF; many will also need a RASi. Beta‐blockers should be titrated with care in the presence of overt congestion. Patients should generally not receive an ICD until congestion is controlled.

However, cardiovascular ultrasound is evolving. Hand‐held devices, using artificial intelligence to guide and analyse images, are revolutionizing bedside assessment of tissue and vascular congestion as well as cardiac function, including accurate, automated measurement of LVEF, even in the hands of non‐experts. This could democratize cardiac imaging, putting it in the hands of doctors and nurses who make the clinical decisions about individual patient care. There should be a huge advantage in getting real‐time, 'bedside' information about congestion control, rather than waiting for the results of blood tests. However, although routine ultrasound assessment for congestion might be of value, this awaits further evidence. Repeated measurements of LVEF could be a by‐product of such a strategy, but with little practical value (Figure 1).

Read this Medication Guide carefully before you start taking pioglitazone tablets and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. If you have any questions about pioglitazone tablets, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

What is the most important information I should know about pioglitazone tablets?

Pioglitazone tablets can cause serious side effects, including new or worse heart failure.

Pioglitazone tablets can cause your body to keep extra fluid (fluid retention), which leads to swelling (edema) and weight gain. Extra body fluid can make some heart problems worse or lead to heart failure. Heart failure means your heart does not pump blood well enough
Do not take pioglitazone tablets if you have severe heart failure
If you have heart failure with symptoms (such as shortness of breath or swelling), even if these symptoms are not severe, pioglitazone tablets may not be right for you

Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following:

swelling or fluid retention, especially in the ankles or legs
shortness of breath or trouble breathing, especially when you lie down
an unusually fast increase in weight
unusual tiredness

Pioglitazone tablets can cause your body to keep extra fluid (fluid retention), which leads to swelling (edema) and weight gain. Extra body fluid can make some heart problems worse or lead to heart failure. Heart failure means your heart does not pump blood well enough
Do not take pioglitazone tablets if you have severe heart failure
If you have heart failure with symptoms (such as shortness of breath or swelling), even if these symptoms are not severe, pioglitazone tablets may not be right for you

Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following:

swelling or fluid retention, especially in the ankles or legs
shortness of breath or trouble breathing, especially when you lie down
an unusually fast increase in weight
unusual tiredness

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111dSeUs]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Nonpharmacological management — fluid restriction for hyponatremia in advanced heart failure carries a Class of Recommendation 2b and Level of Evidence C-LD: For patients with advanced HF and hyponatremia, the benefit of fluid restriction to reduce congestive symptoms is uncertain. Supportive text notes that in a registry study of hyponatremia in acute decompensated HF, fluid restriction only improved hyponatremia marginally; a registered dietitian–guided fluid and sodium restriction intervention improved New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification and leg edema in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who were not in stage D HF, and fluid restriction improved quality of life (QOL) in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with HFrEF and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (NYHA class I to IV); however, in a meta-analysis of RCTs, restricted fluid intake compared with free fluid consumption did not result in reduced hospitalization or mortality rates, changes in thirst, the duration of intravenous diuretic use, serum creatinine, or serum sodium levels, and the validity of a prior trial supporting clinical benefits of fluid restriction is in serious question.

Description of the condition

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart does not pump enough blood to meet all the needs of the body. It is caused by dysfunction of the heart due to muscle damage (systolic or diastolic dysfunction), valvular dysfunction, arrhythmias or other rare causes (NICE 2014). Clinically, it is a syndrome in which patients have typical symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue) and signs (e.g. elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and displaced apex beat). The diagnosis can be difficult as many of the symptoms of heart failure are non‐discriminating so the demonstration of an underlying cardiac cause is central to the diagnosis. Identification of the underlying cardiac problem is also crucial for therapeutic reasons, as the precise pathology determines the specific treatment used (e.g. valve surgery for valvular disease, specific pharmacological therapy for left ventricular systolic dysfunction, etc.) (McMurray 2012).

Heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) is caused by impaired left ventricular contraction, and is usually characterised by a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) is usually associated with impaired left ventricular relaxation, rather than left ventricular contraction, and is characterised by a normal or preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (NICE 2010).

Approximately 1% to 2% of the adult population in developed countries has heart failure, with the prevalence rising to ≥ 10% among persons 70 years of age or older (McMurray 2012). The prevalence is expected to rise in future as a result of an ageing population, improved survival of people with ischaemic heart disease and more effective treatments for heart failure (Owan 2006).

Heart failure has a poor prognosis: 30% to 40% of patients diagnosed with heart failure die within a year – but thereafter the mortality is less than 10% per year. There is evidence of a trend of improved prognosis in the past 10 years. The six‐month mortality rate decreased from 26% in 1995 to 14% in 2005. Within the NHS, heart failure accounts for a total of 1 million inpatient bed‑days – 2% of all NHS inpatient bed‐days – and 5% of all emergency medical admissions to hospital. Hospital admissions because of heart failure are projected to rise by 50% over the next 25 years, largely as a result of the ageing population. This is despite a progressive decline of the age‐adjusted hospitalisation rate at 1% to 1.5% per annum since 1992/1993 (NICE 2010).

General Mechanisms of Heart Failure (Preserved and Reduced)

Heart failure (HF) has recently been defined by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) as a clinical syndrome, not a single pathological diagnosis, consisting of cardinal symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, fatigue, and ankle swelling) that may be accompanied by signs (e.g. pulmonary crackles, elevated jugular venous pressure, and peripheral edema). HF is due to a structural and/or functional abnormality of the heart that results in elevated intracardiac pressures and/or inadequate cardiac output at rest and/or during exercise.

It is considered a chronic, progressive condition that arises secondary to complex changes in the molecular and cellular composition of the heart that produce an initial decline in its pumping capacity. The molecular and cellular changes may arise from different factors such as sustained hemodynamic overload following a myocardial infarction or exposure to toxic chemotherapies, or may develop secondary to inherited genetic mutations that affect sarcomere function. Following this initial deterioration in heart-pumping capacity, various compensatory mechanisms are activated, including the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), the adrenergic nervous system, and the cytokine system. These systems can restore cardiovascular function to a normal homeostatic range in the short term, resulting in the patient remaining asymptomatic. However, over time, the sustained activation of these systems can lead to secondary end-organ damage within the ventricle, with worsening left ventricle (LV) remodeling and subsequent cardiac decompensation. As a result of worsening LV remodeling and cardiac decompensation, patients transition from asymptomatic to symptomatic HF.

HF is categorized into distinct phenotypes based on the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements. HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is considered in patients with an LVEF ≤ 40%, with or without signs of clinical HF. Those patients with an LVEF between 41% and 49% have HF with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF), and those with an LVEF ≥ 50% and symptoms and signs of HF, with evidence of structural and/or functional cardiac abnormalities and/or raised natriuretic peptides (NPs), have HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). For the diagnosis of HFmrEF, the presence of other evidence of structural heart disease (e.g. increased left atrial size, LV hypertrophy, or echocardiographic measures of impaired LV filling) makes the diagnosis more likely. For the diagnosis of HFpEF, the greater the number of abnormalities present, the higher the likelihood of HFpEF.

### Real-world presentation with heart failure in primary care: do patients selected to follow diagnostic and management guidelines have better outcomes? [^114H2CfC]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe associations between initial management of people presenting with heart failure (HF) symptoms in primary care, including compliance with the recommendations of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and subsequent unplanned hospitalisation for HF and death.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study using data from general practices submitting records to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. The cohort comprised patients diagnosed with HF during 2010–2013 and presenting to their general practitioners with breathlessness, fatigue or ankle swelling.

Results

13897 patients were included in the study. Within the first 6 months, only 7% had completed the NICE-recommended pathway; another 18.6% had followed part of it (B-type natriuretic peptide testing and/or echocardiography, or specialist referral). Significant differences in hazards were seen in unadjusted analysis in favour of full or partial completion of the NICE-recommended pathway. Covariate adjustment attenuated the relations with death much more than those for HF admission. Compared with patients placed on the NICE pathway, treatment with HF medications had an HR of 1.16 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.28, p = 0.003) for HF admission and 1.03 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.17, p = 0.674) for death. Patients who partially followed the NICE pathway had similar hazards to those who completed it. Patients on no pathway had the highest hazard for HF admission at 1.30 (95% 1.18 to 1.43, p < 0.001) but similar hazard for death.

Conclusions

Patients not put on at least some elements of the NICE-recommended pathway had significantly higher risk of HF admission but non-significant higher risk of death than other patients had.

### Patient-reported goals in tricuspid regurgitation: a qualitative analysis of patient and care partner perspectives [^112LNGgD]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common valvular heart condition that is often a result of concurrent heart disease such as left-sided heart failure or atrial fibrillation leading to atrial enlargement. When symptomatic, the natural history of TR includes earlier mortality and significant detriments in quality of life. Optimization of a patient's health status (ie, symptoms, functional status, and quality of life) is a central goal in the treatment of heart disease and plays a pivotal role in the determination of efficacy of therapeutic approaches in multiple heart failure trials. More recently, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) have been incorporated into the assessment of transcatheter devices to treat valvular heart disease, particularly those to treat TR.

Until recently, treatment options for severe symptomatic TR were limited to diuretic therapy to manage the common physical signs of right-sided congestion, most commonly lower leg swelling. The more insidious symptoms of fatigue and overall debility due to low energy are often attributed to aging or inactivity rather than severe TR, complicating diagnosis. In the context of previously limited treatment options, patients were less likely to be appropriately diagnosed or educated about the disease or its natural history by their clinicians as there was little research supporting new developments.

Surgical therapy for severe TR is offered rarely and typically only in the context of concomitant procedures (ie, mitral valve repair), albeit with some risk. Isolated tricuspid valve (TV) surgery is associated with high in-hospital mortality among older patients presenting with heart failure symptoms, in part, because of the late presentation and multiple comorbidities of this population.

With the development of novel transcatheter repair and replacement devices, the literature on diagnosis and treatment of TR has skyrocketed. No longer forgotten, research on the TV is flourishing, including topics such as disease prevalence and natural history, intersections with heart failure, role of atrial fibrillation, concomitant valvular heart disease, mortality risk scores for surgery and transcatheter device therapies, and PROs. However, data on the patient experience are lacking.

### Clinical implications of the universal definition for the prevention and treatment of heart failure [^112nD3h4]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

2 MERITS AND STRENGTHS

The universal definition serves as a necessary consensus definition of HF to standardize the recognition of HF across clinical care and clinical trials. Key merits associated with the universal definition and the new staging are elaborated further in this section.

2.1 Utilization of biomarkers for an objective diagnosis of HF

Biomarker‐based diagnosis is becoming increasingly common for disease diagnostic and definition purposes, including the universal diagnosis of MI. Estimated glomerulation filtration rate in chronic kidney disease and hemoglobin A1c in diabetes have, respectively, served similar purposes. In the context of the ongoing conundrum around how best to prevent the syndrome, in the 2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA focused update, biomarker NT‐proBNP‐based screening in those at risk of developing HF received a Class IIa recommendation (level of evidence: B–R). Those with elevated NT‐proBNP levels are strongly recommended to be managed by team‐based care including a cardiovascular specialist and GDMT to prevent the development of LV dysfunction (systolic or diastolic) or new‐onset HF. Yet, the diagnosis of HF to date primarily relies on vague, nonspecific signs and symptoms (e.g. fatigue, breathlessness, and ankle swelling, etc.). Consequently, patients who dismiss these nonspecific symptoms only present at emergency care or to specialists at a much‐advanced stage of HF, leaving little or no room for early interventions. Natriuretic peptides are early and robust markers of congestion, even in the absence of symptoms of HF. The inclusion of natriuretic peptides as part of the new definition establishes an objective diagnostic standard for HF because they are (1) myocardium‐specific, (2) dependent on intracardiac volumes and filling pressures, (3) elevated before symptoms/signs of HF surface, and (4) relevant to a range of cardiac abnormalities, including and not limited to the systolic function, diastolic function, valvular heart disease, right HF, and atrial fibrillation.

2.2 Adjudication of hospitalization for HF

HF or related symptoms were reported in TRA 2°P‐TIMI 50 by local site investigators as serious adverse events (SAEs). Of reported SAEs, 1,102 were identified by a blinded reviewer as candidates for HHF adjudication using verbatim terms (Supporting Information: Figure S1). Selected event terms included those that referenced HF directly (e.g. "congestive heart failure", "worsening heart failure") or captured potential signs or symptoms of HF (e.g. "acute pulmonary edema", "bilateral leg edema", "dyspnea", "respiratory failure"). Events identified based on these terms were then adjudicated using the definitions below.

We designed a hierarchical definition of HHF with five mutually exclusive categories. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology report on Key Data Elements and Definitions for Cardiovascular Endpoint Events in Clinical Trialswere adapted to define a category of "definite HHF", and these criteria were broadened to define categories with decreasing specificity: "probable HHF", "possible HHF", "HHF not excluded", and "HHF excluded" (Supporting Information: Methods). SAE reports including event terms, narratives, concomitant medications, and other associated AEs were adjudicated in parallel by two independent reviewers, by applying the hierarchical HHF definition. To maximize clinical information, additional source documents (e.g. those associated with previously adjudicated non‐HHF endpoints) were also reviewed for patients initially categorized as probable HHF, possible HHF, or HHF not excluded. Discrepancies in adjudication results between the two independent reviewers were resolved by group review, including a senior cardiovascular specialist.

Case presentation

A case of C.X.Z, male aged 39-year old, and farmer by profession was wheeled into our department with severe symptoms of subacute RHF. His spouse narrated that in January,2018, he had experienced mild bilateral swelling of lower limbs (in form of stockings), and was managed on diuretics for about 7 days, after which symptoms disappeared completely. She denied him having had any cardiac surgery, chest radiation, tuberculosis or significant chest trauma. 8 months after initial symptoms, thus in October,2018, he suddenly developed chest pain, which he thought was due to long working hours in the field. On-counter remedies (pain killers) offered temporal relief. After 2-days of progressive chest pain, patient begun experiencing abdominal discomfort and observed swelling of feet after bed. On the 4th day in his illness, he developed shortness, a development that prompted him seek medical attention.

On presentation the patient through his spouse complained of breathing difficulties, abdominal fullness and swelling of lower limbs. She further narrated that, during bed time, shortness of breath worsened upon lying flat. During physical examination, patient exhibited incoherent talk, responded to various questions with same answer repeatedly. Both the neck veins (JVD~ > 15mmH2O) and abdomen were highly distended. Chest auscultation demonstrated a 'cardiac knock', and both S 1 and S 2 were muffled. Abdominal palpation revealed gross ascites. The lower extremities were cold to touch with bilateral pitting edema from knee and below. Prior and post procedure vitals are tabulated in Table. 1.

### Pathophysiology of lower extremity edema in acute heart failure revisited [^114PppRG]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The pathophysiology and key determinants of lower extremity edema in patients with acute heart failure are poorly investigated.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled 279 unselected patients presenting to the Emergency Department with acute heart failure. Lower extremity edema was quantified at predefined locations. Left ventricular ejection fraction, central venous pressure quantifying right ventricular failure, biomarkers to quantify hemodynamic cardiac stress (B-type natriuretic peptide), and the activity of the arginine-vasopressin system (copeptin) also were recorded.

Results

Lower extremity edema was present in 218 (78%) patients and limited to the ankle in 22%, reaching the lower leg in 40%, reaching the upper leg in 11%, and was generalized (anasarca) in 3% of patients. Patients in the 4 strata according to the presence and extent of lower leg edema had comparable systolic blood pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction, central venous pressure, and B-type natriuretic peptide levels, as well as copeptin and glomerular filtration rate (P = NS for all). The duration of dyspnea preceding the presentation was longer in patients with more extensive edema (P = .006), while serum sodium (P = .02) and serum albumin (P = .03) was lower.

Conclusion

Central venous pressure, hemodynamic cardiac stress, left ventricular ejection fraction, and the activity of the arginine-vasopressin system do not seem to be key determinants of the presence or extent of lower extremity edema in acute heart failure.

### Sacubitril / valsartan in patients with heart failure and concomitant end-stage kidney disease [^116CxHxd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Congestive heart failure affects 40 million people worldwide, accounting for 2% of the global adult population. The diagnosis is usually based on clinical symptoms, including shortness of breath, leg swelling, excessive tiredness, and pulmonary congestion. Reduced cardiac output is generally accompanied by structural and functional abnormality of the heart, which disrupts its ejection of blood in systolic phase or refilling during the diastolic phase. Based on whether the ability of the left ventricle to contract or to relax is affected, heart failure is divided into 2 types: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Patients with HFrEF, defined as ejection fraction < 40%, carry a very high morbidity and mortality rate. Large‐scale epidemiology studies showed the survival rates of patients with HFrEF are even worse than those of common cancers.

Patients with heart failure are traditionally treated with oxygen supply, salt/water restriction, hypertension control, and medications including nitrates, diuretics, β‐blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Novel therapies have emerged from an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure and cardiac remodeling. Among these new drugs, angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor, and sodium‐glucose cotransporter inhibitors, are now considered the "game changers". The pathophysiology of heart failure involves a maladaptive response during which the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system is activated. The natriuretic peptide system is simultaneously activated to work antagonistically to the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system. Neprilysin inhibitor prevents the breakdown of natriuretic peptides and therefore prolongs the favorable effects of these natriuretic peptides.

Edema differential and pathophysiology — Once lymphedema has been excluded, edema is attributed to increased hydrostatic pressure or decreased oncotic pressure. Increased hydrostatic pressure encompasses cardiac (cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, pericardial disease), cirrhosis with portal hypertension, renal failure, and other causes such as venous insufficiency, obstruction, thrombosis, pregnancy, and medications (CCB, NSAIDs, steroids), whereas decreased oncotic pressure reflects reduced protein intake (malnutrition), reduced protein production (cirrhosis), or protein loss (malabsorption, nephrotic syndrome).

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of ACE inhibitors — selection, co-therapy, and cautions: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors should be prescribed to all patients with HF due to LV systolic dysfunction with reduced LVEF unless they have a contraindication or have been shown to be unable to tolerate these drugs, and treatment with an ACEI should not be delayed until resistance to other drugs is demonstrated. In general, ACEIs are used together with a beta-blocker, and ACEIs should not be prescribed without diuretics in patients with a current or recent history of fluid retention. ACEIs are often preferred over ARBs or direct-acting vasodilators because of the greater experience and weight of evidence in support of their effectiveness. Patients should not be given an ACEI if they have experienced life-threatening adverse reactions (angioedema or anuric renal failure) during previous exposure or if they are pregnant. ACEIs should be taken with caution when very low systemic blood pressure is present (systolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg), when serum creatinine is markedly increased (greater than 3 mg per dL), with bilateral renal artery stenosis, or when serum potassium is elevated (greater than 5.5 mmol per liter). Treatment with an ACEI should not be initiated in hypotensive patients who are at immediate risk of cardiogenic shock; such patients should first receive other forms of treatment for HF and then be re-evaluated for ACE inhibition once stability has been achieved.

A 66-year-old woman was admitted to an outside facility with leg swelling and dyspnea on exertion. Initial workup revealed severe aortic stenosis and congestive heart failure (CHF) thought to be the culprit; however, a CT performed in the emergency department revealed massive uterine mass resulting in significant inferior vena cava (IVC) compression. Her cardiac status precluded hysterectomy, due to concerns regarding intraoperative fluid shifts decreasing preload in the setting of preload dependence in severe aortic stenosis. Similarly, her degree of IVC compression was thought to make valve replacement unacceptably dangerous, so she was referred to interventional radiology for consideration of uterine artery embolisation (UAE) to relieve IVC compression. She underwent UAE without complication, and her leg swelling nearly completely resolved at follow-up.

### Epidemiology and aetiology of heart failure [^115a5Zyv]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on heart failure:

- Definition: HF is a clinical syndrome that results from structural or functional impairment of filling or ejection of blood from the heart. HF can be associated with either reduced ejection fraction (≤ 40%), preserved ejection fraction (≥ 50%), or borderline ejection fraction (41–50%).
- Pathophysiology: The most common causes of HF include ischemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, valvular and rheumatic heart disease, genetic cardiomyopathies, and congenital heart disease.
- Epidemiology: In the US, the age and sex-adjusted incidence of HF is estimated at 219.3 cases per 100,000 person-years. Its prevalence is estimated at 1915 persons per 100,000 population.
- Disease course: Clinical manifestations relate to pulmonary edema (dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), peripheral edema (ankle swelling, abdominal bloating), and activation of inflammatory pathways (early satiety, cachexia). Severe HF leads to manifestations related to hypoperfusion, spanning from mild fatigue and exertional intolerance to cardiogenic shock.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The 1-year and 5-year mortality associated with HF are estimated at 20.2% and 56.2%, respectively. Death is due to non-cardiovascular events in over 50% of patients.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1171FyQQ]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022 heart failure guideline — dietary sodium restriction: Recommendation (COR 2a; LOE C-LD): For patients with stage C heart failure (HF), avoiding excessive sodium intake is reasonable to reduce congestive symptoms. Restricting dietary sodium is a common nonpharmacological treatment for patients with HF symptomatic with congestion, but specific recommendations have been based on low-quality evidence. The AHA currently recommends a reduction of sodium intake to < 2300 mg/d for general cardiovascular health promotion; however, there are no trials to support this level of restriction in patients with HF. Sodium restriction can result in poor dietary quality with inadequate macronutrient and micronutrient intake, and nutritional inadequacies have been associated with clinical instability, while routine supplementation of oral iron, thiamine, zinc, vitamin D, or multivitamins has not proven beneficial. The DASH diet can achieve sodium restriction without compromising nutritional adequacy when accompanied by dietary counseling and may be associated with reduced hospitalizations for HF. Supportive data include that a registered dietitian– or nurse-coached intervention with 2 to 3 g/d sodium restriction improved New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and leg edema in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); in a nonrandomized study (> 2.5 g/d versus < 2.5 g/d), lower dietary sodium was associated with worse all-cause mortality in HFrEF; and in small randomized controlled trials, aggressive sodium restriction (0.8 g/d) during decompensated HF has not reduced weight, congestion, diuretic use, rehospitalization, or all-cause mortality in HFrEF or in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure (HF) clinical syndrome and etiologies — The cardinal manifestations are dyspnea and fatigue that may limit exercise tolerance and fluid retention leading to pulmonary congestion and peripheral edema, and the term heart failure is preferred over congestive heart failure because not all patients have volume overload at evaluation. The syndrome may result from pericardial, myocardial, endocardial, or great vessel disorders, with most symptoms due to impairment of left ventricular (LV) myocardial function, and HF may range from normal LV size with preserved ejection fraction (EF) to severe dilatation and/or markedly reduced EF. Coronary artery disease, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, and valvular heart disease are substantial causes, and as many as 30% of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy may have a genetic cause. HF is not equivalent to cardiomyopathy or LV dysfunction; it is defined as a clinical syndrome with specific symptoms and signs, and there is no single diagnostic test because diagnosis is based on careful history and physical examination.

### Heart failure decompensation alerts in a patient's home using an automated, AI-driven, point-of-care device [^1179tG9b]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

First hospitalisation

For the next few days, the patient's condition did not improve and the GP was called for a home visit again. Peripheral oedema was noted as thigh-high and ascites, and the patient also suffered severe shortness of breath after five steps. The GP and patient agreed that the best course of action would be to get IV diuretic to help reduce congestion. In the patient's area, this can only be done through an admission. Therefore the GP planned for the patient to be admitted on 16 January 2020. The patient was admitted as a non-urgent admission to a cardiology ward and HF decompensation was subsequently confirmed. The patient remained hospitalised and was discharged on 7 February 2020 with further treatment of high-dose diuretics.

Second alert

The system logged measurements following discharge, which indicated the patient was not euvolaemic and her feet were still swollen. The patient was then bedbound for several days, and on 12 February 2020 a further measurement with > 300 mL increase was made, and the patient was informed.

Second hospitalisation

After the second alert, the condition of the patient deteriorated rapidly. New diuretics were prescribed by her GP, 5 mg amiloride and 2.5 mg metolazone and furosemide was reduced to 160 mg/day. She was then admitted to hospital again on 15 February 2020 as a non-urgent admission. The patient remained in hospital until the 23 February 2020 and began to receive palliative care from 24 February 2020 onwards. The patient subsequently died on 8 March 2020.

Follow-up and outcomes

The volume trends and alerts generated throughout the 15 months for the patient are shown in figure 2D. Alerts were generated both times in a timely fashion to prevent the need for an emergency hospital admission. The device has successfully provided volume data on 97.7% of days (over fifteen months) and the volume capture did not drop off over time (figure 2A).

### Adherence to guidelines in management of symptoms suggestive of heart failure in primary care [^1121wVLA]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Clinical guidelines on heart failure (HF) suggest timings for investigation and referral in primary care. We calculated the time for patients to achieve key elements in the recommended pathway to diagnosis of HF.

Methods

In this observational study, we used linked primary and secondary care data (Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a database of anonymised electronic records from UK general practices) between 2010 and 2013. Records were examined for presenting symptoms (breathlessness, fatigue, ankle swelling) and key elements of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence-recommended pathway to diagnosis (serum natriuretic peptide (NP) test, echocardiography, specialist referral).

Results

42 403 patients were diagnosed with HF, of whom 16597 presented in primary care with suggestive symptoms. 6464 (39%) had recorded NP or echocardiography, and 6043 (36%) specialist referral. Median time from recorded symptom(s) to investigation (NP or echocardiography) was 292days (IQR 34–844) and to referral 236days (IQR 42–721). Median time from symptom(s) to diagnosis was 972days (IQR 337–1468) and to treatment with HF-relevant medication 803days (IQR 230–1364). Factors significantly affecting timing of referral, treatment and diagnosis included patients' sex (p = 0.001), age (p < 0.001), deprivation score (p = 0.001), comorbidities (p < 0.001) and presenting symptom type (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Median times to investigation or referral of patients presenting in primary care with symptoms suggestive of HF considerably exceeded recommendations. There is a need to support clinicians in the diagnosis of HF in primary care, with improved access to investigation and specialist assessment to support timely management.

### The death of balzac (1799–1850) and the treatment of heart failure during the nineteenth century [^112SFHq6]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Overweight, workaholic, and a caffeine abuser, Honoré de Balzac lived a life of excess. He prematurely died at the age of 51 owing to gangrene associated with congestive heart failure. Textual sources allow us to take a glimpse into his last 3 months of life. Because of ventricular hypertrophy, Balzac's respiratory conditions were appalling and he developed severe leg edemas and possibly stasis dermatitis. Here we report on Balzac's demise and provide first evidence of a pioneering medical treatment applied to save his life: the use of a trocar to drain leg edema. Based on the empirical observation of the benefits derived from an accidental leg drainage, Balzac's physicians anticipated the invention of the "Southey tube", whose use evolved in the following century to treat obstinate edema in heart failure patients. Unfortunately, following the daily maneuvers for trocar insertion and in the absence of adequate disinfection measures and antibiotics, bacteria infected the open wound and gave rise to the gangrene, which caused the writer to die within 24 hours of its onset.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Assessment of volume status in heart failure (HF) is described as critically important at the initial and each follow-up visit; at each visit clinicians should record body weight and sitting and standing blood pressures and determine jugular venous distension, organ congestion, and peripheral edema. The most reliable sign of volume overload is jugular venous distension, and right-sided filling pressures are elevated in the basal state or with abdominal compression in many patients with chronically elevated left-sided filling pressures. Most patients with peripheral edema should be considered to have volume overload, whereas most patients with chronic HF do not have rales; studies using 131I-tagged albumin showed plasma volume expansion in more than 50% of patients in whom clinical volume overload was not recognized. Short-term changes in fluid status are best assessed by measuring changes in body weight. The majority with clinical evidence of volume overload do not exhibit hypoperfusion, but when cardiac output declines markedly or abruptly, clues include narrow pulse pressure, cool extremities, altered mentation, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, resting tachycardia, and disproportionate elevation of blood urea nitrogen relative to serum creatinine.

### Changes in heart failure management and long-term mortality over 10 years: observational study [^112V3Y9y]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of some HF-related medications at diagnosis rose in the 10 years, particularly for BB (from 24.3% to 39.1%, p < 0.001) and RAS (from 31.8% to 54.3%, p < 0.001), with little change for loop diuretics (39.3%–42.9%). Twelve months after diagnosis, BB use rose further in the 10 years (from 24.1% to 50.8%), loop diuretics were much higher than at diagnosis in both cohorts (61.5% and 55.9%), aldosterone antagonists and RAS drugs were also higher than at diagnosis in both cohorts (online supplemental appendix table A1).

Of the diagnosed patients, 9963 (2790 diagnosed in 2001/2002 and 7173 diagnosed in 2011/2012) presented with HF-specific symptoms (breathlessness, fatigue or swollen ankles) in the 5 years at or before diagnosis. We calculated Kaplan-Meier response rates for time to each of three national guideline (NICE) recommended primary care 'responses' (echocardiogram, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) blood test and referral to cardiologist), starting at first presentation with symptoms in the 5 years at or before diagnosis. Table 4 shows the cumulative numbers of patients, and Kaplan-Meier response rates (allowing for censorship by exit from CPRD), in the presenting patients at 6 weeks and 6 months after presentation with symptoms. BNP tests were not performed on 2001/2002 patients (not mandated by NICE at that time), but the other two NICE-recommended responses have become more frequent, after both 6 weeks or 6 months, in 2011/2012 than they were in 2001/2002.

### Thinking outside the box: a middle-aged man with new-onset dyspnoea on exertion and pedal oedema [^113gdz2B]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

We describe a diagnostic dilemma in a middle-aged man presenting with dyspnoea and bilateral pedal oedema who had been diagnosed with right heart failure based on clinical evidence. The evaluation for aetiology eventually led to discovery of an unusual extrathoracic cause, a left-to-right communication in the renal vasculature. Renal arteriovenous fistulae are rare and can be congenital, acquired or idiopathic. A left-to-right shunt typically presents with high-output cardiac failure involving the left and right sides of the heart. An atypical feature of this case was the finding of overt right heart failure in the setting of a normal left heart. Such a presentation has only been described in a few isolated case reports. Diagnostic approaches include CT angiography and cardiac catheterisation for haemodynamic measurements. The primary treatment options for arteriovenous fistulae are medical management, arterial embolisation and surgical repair.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) indications for revascularization vary by clinical context: for asymptomatic stenosis, percutaneous revascularization may be considered for an asymptomatic bilateral or solitary viable kidney with a hemodynamically significant RAS, while the usefulness for asymptomatic unilateral hemodynamically significant RAS in a viable kidney is not well established and is presently clinically unproven; for hypertension, percutaneous revascularization is reasonable for hemodynamically significant RAS with accelerated, resistant, or malignant hypertension, an unexplained unilateral small kidney, or intolerance to medication; for preservation of renal function, percutaneous revascularization is reasonable for RAS with progressive chronic kidney disease with bilateral RAS or a RAS to a solitary functioning kidney, and may be considered for RAS with chronic renal insufficiency with unilateral RAS; for heart failure or ischemia syndromes, percutaneous revascularization is indicated for hemodynamically significant RAS with recurrent, unexplained congestive heart failure or sudden, unexplained pulmonary edema and is reasonable for hemodynamically significant RAS with unstable angina.

Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use after angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) intolerance — patients who are intolerant to ACEi because of cough or angioedema should be started on an ARB, and ARB should be started at low doses and titrated upward with caution in low systemic blood pressure, renal insufficiency, or elevated serum potassium (≥ 5.0 mEq/L); although ARB are alternatives for ACEi‑induced angioedema, some patients have also developed angioedema with ARB, and ARB are associated with a much lower incidence of cough and angioedema than ACEi.

### Conservative management of iatrogenic superior vena cava (SVC) perforation after attempted dialysis catheter placement: case report and literature review [^114nNSf5]. Clinical Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

A 68-year-old male with end-stage renal disease, congestive heart failure, and facial and bilateral arm swelling was referred for placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter. Distal left subclavian vein access was obtained. The procedure was complicated by iatrogenic perforation of the superior vena cava (SVC). This resulted in rapid development of a right-sided hemothorax and hemodynamic instability. A right-sided thoracostomy tube was placed to drain the pleural cavity. Extrapericardial perforation of the SVC can be managed conservatively in select cases without endovascular balloon dilatation and/stent graft deployment or surgical repair provided the antegrade blood flow is maintained via patent collateral circulation.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1148KFCJ]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic right heart failure (CRHF) — peripheral edema is often the most prominent clinical feature; early stages may have mild symptoms, but as RV function worsens reduction in cardiac output leads to progressive exercise intolerance and fatigue; atrial tachyarrhythmias are common with elevated RAP and can lead to hemodynamic deterioration, and ventricular tachycardia and heart block are additional electrophysiological complications; in patients with pulmonary hypertension, CRHF closely correlates with increased morbidity and mortality; compared with primary left heart failure, CRHF involves increased central venous pressure and reduced LV filling from ventricular interdependence as a consequence of RV dilation; in later stages with reduced systemic output, impaired end-organ function may result from both elevated central venous filling pressures and reduced cardiac output, with increased systemic venous pressure impeding lung lymphatic drainage and exacerbating pulmonary edema and pleural effusions; the organs most affected are the kidneys and liver, with the gastrointestinal tract implicated.

### The worst symptom as defined by patients during heart failure hospitalization: implications for response to therapy [^116MZoYb]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Patients perceive different symptoms of heart failure decompensation. It is not known whether the nature of the worst symptom relates to hemodynamic profile, response to therapy, or improvement in clinical trials.

Methods and Results

Patients in the Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness trial were hospitalized with advanced heart failure, ejection fraction ≤ 30%, and at least 1 sign and 1 symptom of elevated filling pressures. Visual analog scales (VAS) for symptoms were completed by 371 patients, who selected their worst symptom as difficulty breathing, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, or body swelling and also scored breathing and global condition at baseline and discharge. The dominant symptom identified was difficulty breathing by 193 (52%) patients, fatigue by 118 (32%), and abdominal discomfort and swelling each by 30 (8%) patients, combined as right-sided congestion for analysis. Clinical and hemodynamic assessments were not different between groups except that right-sided congestion was associated with more hepatomegaly, ascites, third heart sounds, and jugular venous distention. This group also had greater reduction in jugular venous distention and trend toward higher blood urea nitrogen after therapy. By discharge, average improvements in worst symptom and global score were 28 points and 24 points. For those with ≥ 10 points in improvement in worst symptom, 84% also improved global assessment ≥ 10 points. Initial fatigue was associated with less improvement (P = .002) during and after hospitalization, but improvements in symptom scores were sustained when re-measured during 6 months after discharge.

Conclusion

In most patients hospitalized with clinical congestion, therapy will improve symptoms regardless of the worst symptom perceived, with more evidence of baseline fluid retention and reduction during therapy for worst symptoms of abdominal discomfort or edema. Improvement in trials should be similar when tracking worst symptom, dyspnea, or global assessment.

### Association of undifferentiated dyspnea in late life with cardiovascular and noncardiovascular dysfunction: a cross-sectional analysis from the ARIC study [^111oiB2B]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Clinical Characteristics

Prevalence of HF in the ARIC study at visit 5 was based on physician committee–adjudicated HF hospitalizations occurring since 2005 (as previously published); International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 428 for hospitalizations prior to 2005; or HF self-report at visits 3 through 5 or on annual follow-up telephone calls. For adjudicated hospitalizations, centrally trained and certified physicians adjudicated the HF diagnosis as definite, possible, or chronic HF. History of COPD was ascertained based on participants responding affirmatively to either of the following standardized questions: "Has a doctor ever told you that you had emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (also called COPD)?" or "Has a doctor ever told you that you had chronic bronchitis?" Questions were administered at study visits and annual follow-up telephone calls.

Hypertension, diabetes, and smoking status were defined as previously described. Coronary disease (ie, myocardial infarction or coronary intervention) and stroke were ascertained through ongoing ARIC study surveillance of deaths and hospitalizations and through annual telephone interviews and were centrally adjudicated as previously described. Edema was defined as the presence of bilateral pitting leg edema when the participant was lying flat. Body mass index was calculated from measured weight and standing height, with obesity defined as BMI of 30 or more. Participants who reported dyspnea were classified as potentially having HFpEF based on the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelinesif the following were present: (1) a sign of HF (ie, edema); (2) N-terminal fragment of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) higher than 125 pg/mL; and (3) an abnormal echocardiographic marker of structure (ie, LV hypertrophy or left atrial [LA] enlargement) or function (ie, abnormal Doppler diastolic function indices of early diastolic myocardial velocity [e′] or ratio of early mitral inflow velocity [E] to e′).

Methods and Materials

Approval for the study was obtained from the Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center Scientific Review Committee prior to participant enrollment. Study activities were conducted under the guidelines set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki. This randomized study compared post-treatment surveillance with both circumference measurements (TM volume assessment) and BIS. Presurgical inclusion criteria included women ≥ 18 years of age with histologically confirmed breast cancer (invasive or ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]) with planned surgery, while postsurgical inclusion criteria included stage I–III invasive breast cancer or DCIS with at least one of the following: mastectomy, axillary treatment (ALND, SLNB with greater than 6 nodes, axillary radiation), and taxane-based chemotherapy. Additional postsurgical exclusion criteria included bilateral breast surgery. Exclusion criteria included a prior history of breast cancer; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; previous radiation to the breast, chest wall, or axilla; implanted medical device; conditions known to cause swelling (excluding pregnancy, congestive heart failure, chronic/acute renal disease, cor pulmonale, nephrotic syndrome, nephrosis, liver failure or cirrhosis, pulmonary edema, and thrombophlebitis or deep vein thrombosis in the arms); previous lymphedema treatment in either arm; uncontrolled intercurrent illness; psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with the study; and known allergy to electrode adhesives or compression fabrics.

### Weeping wounds and sepsis: a complication of elephantiasis nostras verrucosa [^116KucaM]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Description

A 68-year-old man with atrial fibrillation, morbid obesity, heart failure and venous stasis dermatitis presented to the emergency department after a presyncopal episode. On arrival he was febrile, hypotensive, tachycardic and found to have leucocytosis, which led to concerns for septic shock. Blood cultures grew group C Streptococcus, prompting treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone. Physical examnation showed extensive bilateral leg swelling with extreme hyperpigmented skin accompanied by multiple keratotic papules and plaques draining white malodorous discharge (figure 1). The patient reported the discharge started 6 months prior, while the nodules developed over the course of 2 years and extended from the malleolus to a few centimetres below the knee. These findings were suggestive of the diagnosis of elephantiasis nostras verrucosa (ENV) superimposed on chronic venous stasis dermatitis. The patient received aggressive diuresis to address the heart failure exacerbation, which led to reduced swelling of his bilateral lower extremities and flattening of the papules and plaques (figure 2).

Figure 1
Characteristic 'tree-bark' appearance of ENV showing multiple keratotic papules and plaques. ENV, elephantiasis nostras verrucosa.

Figure 2
Lower right extremity after diuresis.

ENV is a rare complication of non-filarial chronic secondary lymphoedema that can be caused by conditions impairing lymphatic drainage including recurring erysipelas and cellulitis, congestive heart failure, obesity and chronic venous stasis. Additionally, ENV can be caused by malignancies such as lymphoma, which can impede lymphatic drainage, and soft-tissue trauma which can introduce bacteria to cause infections. In particular, obesity and congestive heart failure are two causes of secondary lymphoedema which have increasing prevalence in the United States and can be expected to accompany ENV more frequently in the future.ENV is a progressive condition that can lead to irreversible disfiguring skin changes and interfere with ambulation. This case reports sepsis as a consequence of streptococcus skin infection in a patient with ENV, further highlighting the importance of early identification and intervention.

### Development of a clinical prediction score for congestive heart failure diagnosis in the emergency care setting: the brest score [^113nRvEC]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To derive and validate a clinical prediction rule of acute congestive heart failure obtainable in the emergency care setting.

Design

Derivation of the score was performed on a retrospective 927 patients cohort admitted to our Emergency Department for dyspnea. The prediction model was externally validated on an independent 206-patient prospective cohort.

Interventions and Measures

During the derivation phase, variables associated with acute congestive heart failure were included in a multivariate regression model. Logistic regression coefficients were used to assign scoring points to each variable. During the validation phase, every diagnosis was confirmed by an independent adjudication committee.

Results

The score comprised 11 variables: age ≥ 65 years (1 point), seizure dyspnea (2 points), night outbreak (1 point), orthopnea (1 point), history of pulmonary edema (2 points), chronic pulmonary disease (-2 points), myocardial infarction (1 point), crackles (2 points), leg edema (1 point), ST-segment abnormality (1 point), atrial fibrillation/flutter (1 point) on electrocardiography. In the validation step, 30 patients (14.6%) had a low clinical probability of acute congestive heart failure (score ≤ 3), of which only 2 (6.7%) had a proven acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The prevalence of acute congestive heart failure was 58.5% in the 94 patients with an intermediate probability (score of 4–8) and 91.5% in the 82 patients (39.8%) with a high probability (score ≥ 9).

Conclusion

This score of acute congestive heart failure based on easily available and objective variables is entirely standardized. Applying the score to dyspneic adult emergency patients may enable a more rapid and efficient diagnostic process.

### Hydrochlorothiazide (Inzirqo) [^115JXF4Z]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

INZIRQO is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adult and pediatric patients, to lower blood pressure.

Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes., including the class to which this drug principally belongs.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

INZIRQO can be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

### Heart failure in patients seeking medical help at outpatients clinics. part I. general characteristics [^114Ufqs6]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2000). Low credibility.

Background

During the last decade, the beneficial changes in lifestyle and in medical care increased average life expectancy, particularly in patients with chronic diseases such as hypertension and coronary heart disease. Unfortunately this also increased the number of patients, particularly among the elderly, who are susceptible to complications of these conditions such as heart failure. Uncontrolled hypertension is known to be a primary cause of heart failure and is also known to be very prevalent and frequently uncontrolled in the Polish population.

Aim

To estimate the prevalence and characteristics of heart failure among patients of 65 years and older seeking medical care in outpatient clinics in Poland.

Methods

The study is a cross-country epidemiological project in which 417 physicians from outpatient clinics were asked to register 50 consecutive patients aged 65 years and above seeking medical care for any cause. Information on case history, physical examination (diagnosis of heart failure, NYHA class, heart failure symptoms), laboratory tests (resting ECG, chest X-ray, echocardiogram) and data concerning pharmacology management during the 2 weeks prior to the index visit was obtained.

Results

Over 5 months, 19877 eligible patients (7324 men and 12553 women) presented to the 417 participating physicians (90% physicians registered 46–50 patients). Among the patients, 53% were diagnosed with heart failure (3901 men and 6678 women), prevalence did not differ by gender. Among patients with heart failure there were 38% of men in NYHA class III or IV and 34% of women. Coronary heart disease was a predominant cause of heart failure in 87% of men (26% of cases with isolated coronary heart disease, 53% with concomitant hypertension and 8% with other diseases), while percentages for women were 80% (15%, 61% and 4%, respectively). Isolated hypertension was a further cause of heart failure in 8% of men and 13% of women. Cardiac arrhythmia was found in approximately 20% of patients, enlargement of heart size in 32% of patients and peripheral leg edema in 54% of men and 64% of women. These symptoms increased with age. Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly in 68% of men and women and increased cardiothoracic ratio (> 50%) in approximately 40% of patients. From resting ECGs, cardiac arrhythmia was recorded in 21% of patients with heart failure, with atrial fibrillation as a predominant disorder (19%). Left ventricular hypertrophy on resting ECG was noted in 42% of men and women and old myocardial infarction or cardiac ischemia was diagnosed in 71% of men and 66% of women.

Conclusions

### Outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure undergoing non-cardiac surgery: a secondary analysis of the METREPAIR international cohort study [^111kiHab]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary endpoint of this analysis was the incidence of MACE measured 30 days after surgery; MACE was defined as a composite of intra‐ or postoperative cardiovascular mortality; non‐fatal cardiac arrest; acute myocardial infarction (according to the third universal definition of myocardial infarction); stroke or transient ischaemic attack; and/or worsening of congestive heart failure requiring transfer to a higher unit of care or prolonged stay in the intensive care unit or intermediate care (lasting ≥ 24 h). Secondary endpoints were 30‐day all‐cause mortality and in‐hospital severe postoperative complications defined by a Clavien‐Dindo classification ≥ 3. Local investigators adjudicated the events based on the criteria defined in the parent study.

The main explanatory variable was pre‐operative stable chronic heart failure as defined according to current guidelines by either: previous episodes of congestive heart failure; left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%; or an elevated NT‐proBNP concentration > 125 pg/ml ‐1 in the presence of heart failure symptoms (breathlessness, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, ankle swelling, fatigue). This definition is in keeping with current guidelines and was employed to include as many patients with heart failure as possible. Using this definition, prevalence and characteristics in patients with heart failure were analysed and compared with patients without heart failure. Of note, the parent study excluded patients with uncontrolled heart failure in the last 30 days before non‐cardiac surgery.

Serum albumin and congestion assessment in HF — serum albumin levels should be checked routinely at HF admission, and peripheral edema should be interpreted with caution in the presence of hypoalbuminemia, which has been associated with up to 6-fold higher in-hospital mortality; reduced plasma oncotic pressure from hypoalbuminemia enhances extravascular fluid accumulation, for which overzealous diuresis may deplete intravascular volume and decrease renal function and blood pressure, particularly with nephrotic syndrome or chronic malnutrition.

Methods

Study protocol and subjects

Subjects with stable HFpEF, identified from outpatient HF clinics in Glasgow, United Kingdom (n = 16), and volunteers of similar age and sex distributions, with no history of cardiovascular or renal disease, hypertension, or diabetes (healthy control [HC] subjects; n = 16), were recruited between August 2017 and December 2018. HFpEF diagnosis was per the 2016 European Society of Cardiology guideline definition: 1) signs or symptoms of HF; 2) elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) > 35 pg/ml; 3) ejection fraction ≥ 50%; and 4) evidence of structural heart disease (left atrial enlargement or left ventricular hypertrophy) or diastolic dysfunction. Exclusion criteria were a history of recent (< 3 months) cerebrovascular event, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization; significant valve disease; unstable coronary artery disease; hypertrophic or infiltrative cardiomyopathy or constrictive pericarditis; chronic kidney disease stage > 3; idiopathic edema or capillary leak syndrome, myxedema, or lymphatic obstruction; systemic inflammation at the time of study visit; active malignancy; any major hypercoagulable state or history of venous thrombosis or embolism on no ongoing anticoagulation; and incapacity.

Eligibility and main visits were conducted in the morning, in a temperature-controlled room. Subjects did not consume caffeine, alcohol, or food; did not smoke; and avoided vasoactive or diuretic medications for > 4 h prior to assessments. The study procedures included history and physical examination; full blood count, BNP, hemoglobin A1c, and renal, liver, and thyroid function; urinary albumin-to creatinine ratio (morning spot sample); simultaneous bilateral brachial and calf blood pressure (BP) measurement; pulsed wave velocity; echocardiography; flow-mediated dilatation; venous occlusion strain gauge plethysmography; and a gluteal skin punch biopsy. Participants who were not on anticoagulants and who had no history of severe obstructive iliac artery disease were offered to participate in an optional substudy, involving a larger surgical excision of skin and subcutaneous fat tissue around the site of the punch biopsy, for dissection of resistance arteries and molecular biology. This study conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki and the protocol was approved by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee 3 (ref. 17/WS/0091) and Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Research and Development (ref. GN17CA152).

### Cardiovascular function and treatment in β-thalassemia major: a consensus statement from the American Heart Association [^1177e4iz]. Circulation (2013). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) definition and diagnostic features in thalassemia major (TM) specify that, for the purposes of these guidelines, HF is defined clinically as a syndrome with typical symptoms (eg, breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue) and signs (eg, elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and displaced apex beat) resulting from an abnormality of cardiac structure or function. In TM, many symptoms typically present in HF are common in anemia, so more reliable clinical markers for developing HF are changes in symptoms such as increased exertional dyspnea; additional symptoms prevalent in TM relate to liver congestion (abdominal or back pain and nausea) and dizziness/presyncope (arrhythmias), with other symptoms including failure to tolerate standard transfusions and orthopnea and peripheral edema as late symptoms. The absence of clinical features such as hepatomegaly, peripheral edema, raised jugular venous pressure, and lung crackles does not exclude severe cardiac impairment, classic signs may appear late and delay diagnosis, and blood tests are frequently abnormal with liver function tests and serum ferritin possibly raised because of congestion and elevated BNP expected but as a late sign.

### High-grade spindle cell sarcoma of the heart: a case report and review of literature [^114Rd81H]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Primary cardiac spindle cell sarcomas are extremely rare and have poor prognosis. Complete surgical resection represents the only treatment option proven to work. We report a case of a 28-year-old man who was referred to our cardiothoracic unit with a right ventricular mass extending to the main pulmonary artery with a provisional diagnosis of a thrombus or a right ventricular myxoma. He sought medical attention after experiencing shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain and bilateral leg swelling for about 6 weeks. Two dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram showed a mass arising from the right ventricle and extending into the main pulmonary artery; findings that were confirmed with contrast chest CT scan. He underwent extensive resection of the mass and had uneventful postoperative period with immediate symptomatic relieve. He is on adjuvant chemotherapy using vincristine, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (VAC). Right ventricular sarcoma is a very rare cause of right sided heart failure, a very aggressive tumour whose only chance of successful treatment is complete surgical excision.

### Artificial intelligence for the diagnosis of heart failure [^113UcuAw]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In the hybridization of the both knowledge types, we validated the PM from the ML-driven approach against the mind map of CKM from the expert-driven approach to produce the final hybrid knowledge in form of R-CKM.

Finally, we developed a web-based application in the form of cardiovascular AI-CDSS for use of physicians in real clinical practice. For this purpose, the R-CKM knowledge was transformed into MLM for knowledge shareability and computer-executable format using I-KAT, which had been developed by our team. The resultant knowledge can be easily shared and integrated into various formats of HF diagnosis systems, because the resultant knowledge was built with consolidation of the standard data model vMR (Virtual Medical Record) and the standard terminology SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine — Clinical Terms).

Because HF is a syndrome with various clinical features, its diagnosis can be very challenging even for HF specialists. In patients with HF, pulmonary congestion can develop because of congestion in the left heart, causing dyspnea. However, dyspnea as a symptom can also arise from lung disease, anemia, and mental disorders. Leg swelling is a typical sign of congestion in the right heart. However, it also has many differential diagnoses, including kidney disease, adverse effect of drugs, and chronic venous insufficiency, among others. In clinical practice, many patients are diagnosed as having HF even if they do not have HF, and vice versa. A correct diagnosis of HF is crucial because patients with HF have a grave prognosis that is comparable to that of oncologic malignancies, and there exist therapy that can improve survival in patients with HF. Consequently, misdiagnosis of HF can hinder the chance of improving the outcomes. AI-CDSS is a tool that helps in making better medical decisions, thereby reducing clinical errors and improving the quality of life. It has the potential to generate alerts and reminders, diagnostic assistance, therapy critiquing and planning, and image recognition and interpretation.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — alternatives when MRA not tolerated — When spironolactone or eplerenone are not tolerated due to side effects or cost, amiloride (10–20 mg) has been shown to be as effective as spironolactone in adults with resistant hypertension. Other alternative fourth- and fifth-line drug therapies include BBs, alpha blockers, central sympatholytic drugs, and direct vasodilators; however, direct vasodilators such as hydralazine and minoxidil should be used in combination with a BB and a loop diuretic given their effects on sympathetic tone, sodium reabsorption, and fluid retention. Aprocitentan, a dual endothelin A and B receptor antagonist, was shown to reduce 24-hour ambulatory SBP by 4 to 6 mm Hg compared with placebo in adults with resistant hypertension when added to a CCB, RAS inhibitor, and HCTZ, but it has not been directly compared with spironolactone and the side effects of leg edema and fluid retention (9%-18%) may be prohibitive in some patients.

### An unusual case of swelling – clarkson's syndrome [^1165ZNHP]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Clarkson's syndrome, also called idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome is a rare condition characterised by vascular hyper permeability resulting in extreme intravascular volume depletion. The syndrome is unique and almost paradoxical in its presentation, with findings initially suggesting overwhelming heart failure, but in reality the extra vascular fluid represents overt capillary leak, with ultimate intravascular volume depletion, a low output state and hypovolemic shock. Previously described characteristics have classically included severe oedema and anasarca with rapid, profound shock, typically accompanied by haemoconcentration. The authors describe a patient, initially seeming benign in presentation, who rapidly progressed with confusing findings of fluid overload by examination and imaging, ultimately manifesting these findings by severe capillary leak rather than hydrostatic oedema, with ultimate hypovolaemic shock, multisystem organ failure and death. Our aim is that by describing clinical, haemodynamic and pathologic descriptors of the disease, the authors can aid in increasing physician awareness of this unusual syndrome.

4.4 Hospital referral and admission

Appendix S1 provides detailed information about patient referral to the hospital, according to type of symptom and time of appearance. The emergency medical assistance service (SAMU) was the most common type of referral (41.6%). Only 19.5% of the patients were referred by their cardiologist. SAMU‐referred patients were older and more likely to suffer from acute coronary symptoms and chest pain, as well as dyspnea. Patients referred by a general physician (GP) or a cardiologist were more likely to suffer from lower limb edema. Other symptoms and recent weight gain in particular were less frequently reported by patients. Most patients referred by their GP or cardiologist had symptoms for over 15 days, including 76.8% of those referred by a cardiologist. Very few patients had consulted a cardiologist within 48 hours prior to hospitalization.

Patients were admitted to the hospital by different pathways, according to the type of referral and patient characteristics (Table 3). Non intensive care unit (ICU) was the most common way of recruitment (76.2%, including admission from ER department [48.0%], traditional cardiology units [19.6%] and consulting as out‐patients [8.6%]), whereas only 23.8% were recruited from ICU.

TABLE 3
Hospital admission by type of referral

Most SAMU‐referred patients were admitted to ER or to ICU. Patients referred by their GP or attending the hospital on their own attended most often ER. The majority of cardiologist‐referred patients (59.1%) was directly admitted to a non‐intensive care unit and bypassed ER.

On average, patients admitted to ER or an ICU were aged 74.3 years and those admitted to a non‐intensive care unit 70.7 years. Patients admitted to an ICU were more often those with coronary heart disease (CHD) (46.8%) and were more likely to have chest pain, while those admitted to a non‐intensive care unit were more likely to have edemas. Appendix S1 specifies the unit of hospitalization according to symptoms. Other prior medical problems, risk factors or comorbidities did not appear to influence the type of hospital admission.

4.5 Care after admission

In total, 69.2% of the patients admitted to ER were transferred to a non‐intensive care unit. Those remaining were transferred to a department other than cardiology (Table 4).

The patient did not tolerate guideline‐directed medical therapy because of low systemic blood pressure and postural symptoms (dizziness and fatigue). His oral pharmacotherapy by that time included a low dose of beta‐blocker (metoprolol succinate 12.5 mg daily), digoxin 0.0625 mg daily, spironolactone 25 mg daily, furosemide 125 mg daily, and dabigatran 110 mg twice daily. The patient did not tolerate any physical activity, he was only able to take one or two steps. He had a nocturnal dyspnea almost every other night. Other symptoms included postural weakness, dizziness, palpitations, bendopnea, and nycturia. The patient had elevated jugular venous pressure (+11 cm), third heart sound, systolic murmur at the apex, basal rales on lung auscultation, hepatomegaly and hepatojugular reflux, and ankle swellings.

### The association between chronic venous disease and measures of physical performance in older people: a population-based study [^1156Rpuw]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Elderly subjects have many risk factors for CVD: multimorbidity, immobility, poor nutrition and weakened healing processes all increase the risk of varicose veins, skin changes and other venous alterations which further predisposes individuals for chronic leg ulcers. Thus it is understandable that not only the prevalence but also the severity of CVD increases with age, as also seen in the present study. The socioeconomic impact of CVD in older subjects is substantial because of reduced quality of life. Heaviness of legs, itching, a feeling of swelling and cramps are common symptoms in CVD patients and complicate daily activities.

Venous ulcers are the most unwanted endpoint of CVD. Ulcers are often painful and keep sufferers from engaging in social activities, leading, in the worst cases, to depression. Quality of life in patients with venous ulceration has been reported to be poor and comparable to that of patients with congestive heart failure or chronic lung disease. CVD also imposes a significant burden on health care systems. Currently CVD consumes 2% of health care budgets in the US. With an ageing population, it is unavoidable that the number of serious CVD events is going to increase.

A 36-year-old Hispanic woman with a history of systemic lupus erythaematosus (SLE) in remission presented with progressive dyspnoea, bilateral leg swelling and increasing fatigue with rapid weight gain over the past few months. Her physical examination showed mildly tender thyromegaly and pericardial rub. Investigations showed new onset marked hypothyroidism as well as an active lupus serology with echocardiogram confirming severe pericardial effusion and a tamponade phenomenon. Urgent pericardiocentesis relieved her acute symptoms, and prompt treatment with thyroxine replacement and immunosuppression for lupus disease was initiated. Pericardial fluid analysis remained negative for any malignancy and/or infection/s. The patient had a gradual and consistent improvement with this treatment. She was discharged and appeared to be clinically stable at subsequent follow-up visits. However, the case remained a diagnostic dilemma over whether the tamponade was being driven by hypothyroidism versus lupus, leaving us with an opportunity to explore further.

Aortic coarctation — definition, associated lesions, presentation, and outcomes: discrete coarctation of the aorta consists of short-segment narrowing in the region of the ligamentum arteriosum adjacent to the origin of the left subclavian artery, and abundant collaterals may reduce the gradient across the coarctation and mask the severity of the obstruction. Associated lesions include BAV, SubAS, mitral valve abnormalities such as parachute mitral stenosis, VSD, and circle of Willis cerebral artery aneurysm. In adults, coarctation may be recognized because of systemic arterial hypertension and discrepant upper- and lower-extremity pulses, with exertional headaches, leg fatigue, or claudication. Unoperated survival averages 35 years of age, with 75% mortality by 46 years of age, and systemic hypertension, accelerated coronary heart disease, stroke, aortic dissection, and congestive heart failure are common complications.

### Management of hypertensive crisis: British and Irish hypertension society position document [^116o6ZBR]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary oedema

Heart failure associated with raised BP may present as hypertensive crisis. Typically, shortness of breath, cough, orthopnoea, with compatible signs on CXR points towards heart failure. Underlying conditions like ischaemic heart disease or bilateral renal artery stenosis may predispose to heart failure.

Treatment should be directed toward the underlying cause and the associated pathophysiology. Patient may not always present with florid symptoms of pulmonary oedema. Flash pulmonary oedema, which occurs with elevated left ventricular filling pressures may be the first presentation albeit rarely.

Patients with acute hypertensive heart failure have been under-represented in acute heart failure trials. The best available evidence for treatment of heart failure is for use of diuretics particularly loop diuretics such as furosemide or bumetanide. Treatment aiming for a decrease in BP (fall in MAP by 20–25%) over a few hours has been mentioned in most guidelines. AHA guidelines recommend treatment of pulmonary oedema with clevidipine, nitro-glycerine, nitroprusside or enalaprilat. ESC guidelines, recommend treating BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg in patients with heart failure, to SBP < 140 mmHg.

GTN is the most commonly used therapy in hypertensive heart failure, administered by continuous infusion. However, the evidence comes from small, retrospective, and non-randomised clinical trials. The advantage is a quick reduction in preload and afterload. The use of higher doses of nitrates in patients with pulmonary oedema associated with myocardial infarction is supported by a few older studies. Small doses of opioids for vasodilatory and anxiolytic effect must be considered. Use of parenteral ACEi such as enalaprilat is supported by two studies particularly, one relatively large (n = 103) retrospective study of IV enalaprilat prescribed in the setting of acute heart failure and another small (n = 20) double blinded RCT comparing IV enalaprilat versus placebo in patients with congestive heart failure. However, IV enalaprilat is not routinely available. Nitroprusside may be an acceptable treatment strategy, while being cautious in patients with concomitant renal and liver failure. Clevidipine has been used safely in small studies. β blockers are contraindicated in acute pulmonary oedema (Table 11).

Both pulmonary oedema and ACS can be accompanied by an acute rise in BP with multiple confounding factors including pain and anxiety. Clinical discretion is required to differentiate if HTN is the causative factor, or a mere bystander similar to AIS and SAH.

### Amyloid cardiomyopathy in the emergency department [^113NKExf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiac amyloidosis is an underdiagnosed cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy resulting from the infiltration of the myocardium by amyloid proteins.

Case Report

We report the case of an 83-year-old woman who presented with increasing dyspnea and lower-extremity swelling. She reported a medical history of unspecified heart failure. Evaluation in the Emergency Department (ED) revealed evidence of heart failure on physical examination, low-voltage electrocardiogram, chest x-ray study with mild pulmonary edema, and laboratory evaluation with elevated brain natriuretic peptide and troponin. Bedside cardiac ultrasound illustrated severe concentric ventricular hypertrophy and interventricular septal wall thickening with "sparkling" hyperechoic appearance of the myocardium, mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and small pericardial effusion. Inpatient comprehensive echocardiogram and follow-up nuclear medicine cardiac amyloid pyrophosphate study were suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians commonly treat acute on chronic systolic heart failure with diuresis and reductions in preload and afterload with nitrates. Identifying amyloid cardiomyopathy in the ED is of clinical significance because treatment should include loop diuretics but should avoid β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin. Atrioventricular nodal blocking agents may have detrimental effects in cardiac amyloidosis because the cardiac output in this patient population is dependent on heart rate due to a significantly reduced stroke volume from the concentric hypertrophy minimizing diastolic filling. Also, caution should be taken when initiating nitrates in amyloid cardiomyopathy because further reducing preload in an already preload-depleted state can result in hypotension.

Consensus recommendations for management of CVD in patients with T2DM

Although CVD is an umbrella term, this section of the document mainly summarizes the prevalence and pathophysiology of the underlying intersection between T2DM and HF; along with the contemporary treatment options.

A population-based study conducted by Shah et al. in patients with T2DM without overt CVD demonstrated that incident HF was observed more frequently (14.1%) than the vascular events, including MI or stroke. The T2DM is hence recognised as an independent risk factor for the development of HF. In the Kaiser Permanente study, patients with T2DM aged < 75 years had an approximately threefold higher prevalence of HF than those without T2DM. The T2DM patients between 75 and 84 years of age were associated with doubling of risk for HF.

The clinical symptoms of HF are characterised as very typical (breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue) that could be accompanied by signs (elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and peripheral oedema) due to a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality (left ventricular systolic dysfunction [HFrEF] or diastolic dysfunction [HFpEF]), which in turn fails to deliver oxygen to the metabolising tissues.

Based on the measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) function, the HF patients are divided into two groups: (a) those with normal LVEF (≥ 50%; in case of HFpEF) and (b) those with reduced LVEF (< 40%; in case of HFrEF). The diagnosis of HFpEF is observed to be more challenging than the diagnosis of HFrEF. Patients with HFpEF generally do not have a dilated LV, but instead often have increased LV wall thickness and/or left atrial size as a sign of increased filling pressures. Most of the patients additionally have impaired LV filling or suction capacity, categorised as diastolic dysfunction, which is generally accepted as the likely cause of HF in these patients.

As observed in a study reported elsewhere, a significant proportion of patients with HFrEF and HFpEF have unrecognised diabetes mellitus, and in patients diagnosed with HF, the pre-diabetes or diabetes mellitus is often missed. It is therefore important to screen patients with HF for undiagnosed glucose intolerance or T2DM since the novel therapies offer opportunities to improve the clinical outcomes. Table 2 depicts the AHAs that significantly reduce the CV mortality and HHF in T2DM patients.

### Abiraterone acetate (abiraterone) [^111D9pCr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

What are the possible side effects of abiraterone acetate tablets?

Abiraterone acetate tablets may cause serious side effects including:

- High blood pressure (hypertension), low blood potassium levels (hypokalemia), fluid retention (edema), and irregular heartbeats can happen during treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets. This can be life threatening. To decrease the chance of this happening, you must take prednisone with abiraterone acetate tablets exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. Your healthcare provider will check your blood pressure, do blood tests to check your potassium levels, and check for any signs and symptoms of fluid retention every month during treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets.

Tell your healthcare provider if you get any of the following symptoms:

o dizziness o confusion

o fast or irregular heartbeats o muscle weakness

o feet faint or lightheaded o pain in your legs

o headache o swelling in your legs or feet

- Adrenal problems may happen if you stop taking prednisone, get an infection, or are under stress.

- Severe l iver problems. You may develop changes in liver function blood tests. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to check your liver before treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets and during treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets. Liver failure may occur, which can lead to death. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you notice any of the following changes:

### Intravenous furosemide for acute decompensated congestive heart failure: what is the evidence? [^116HT6Vo]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Use of intravenous furosemide rather than oral administration in acute decompensated congestive cardiac failure is universally recommended in international guidelines. We argue that this recommendation is not supported by the existing evidence, and suggest that trials should be performed to determine whether larger doses of oral furosemide should be prescribed prior to an IV switch. This could reduce length of hospital admissions and allow for more patients to be managed in the primary care setting.

### Universal definition and classification of heart failure: a report of the Heart Failure Society of America, heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Japanese heart failure society and writing committee of the universal definition of heart failure [^116Xj8qw]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Universal definition of heart failure (HF) — common symptoms and signs are enumerated and an objective marker is proposed to complement symptom-based diagnosis. Common symptoms and signs of HF are listed in Table 6, with typical symptoms including breathlessness, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, fatigue (tiredness with increased time to recover after exercise), and ankle swelling; less typical symptoms include nocturnal cough, wheezing, bloated feeling, postprandial satiety, loss of appetite, decline in cognitive function or confusion (especially in the elderly), depression, and dizziness or syncope. Signs more specific for HF include elevated jugular venous pressure, third heart sound, summation gallop with third and fourth heart sounds, cardiomegaly with a laterally displaced apical impulse, hepatojugular reflux, and Cheyne Stokes respiration in advanced HF, whereas less specific signs include peripheral edema, pulmonary rales, unintentional weight gain (> 2 kg/week), weight loss in advanced HF with muscle wasting and cachexia, cardiac murmur, reduced air entry and dullness to percussion at lung bases suggestive of pleural effusion, tachycardia or irregular pulse, tachypnea, hepatomegaly/ascites, cold extremities, oliguria, and narrow pulse pressure. The current ACCF/AHA Classification of HF includes 2 presymptomatic stages, A and B; although the definition of the syndrome of HF is restricted to being a symptomatic clinical condition, a new categorization of Stages A and B into "at risk" and "pre-HF" is proposed. To strengthen diagnostic consistency, the incorporation of an objective measurement in addition to the symptoms in the HF definition is proposed.

### Don't routinely use antibiotics to treat bilateral swelling and… [^116dR9n3]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Research has suggested that bilateral lower leg cellulitis is very rare. Patients with swelling and redness of both legs most likely have another condition, such as dermatitis resulting from leg swelling, varicose veins, or contact allergies. To ensure appropriate treatment, doctors must consider the likelihood of diagnoses other than cellulitis when evaluating swelling and redness of the lower legs. Misdiagnosis of bilateral cellulitis can lead to overuse of antibiotics and subject patients to potentially unnecessary hospital stays.

### Symptoms of lymphatic filariasis | Filarial worms… [^115fVGWK]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Most people with lymphatic filariasis never show symptoms.
- If you do show symptoms, they may not appear for several years.
- These late-appearing symptoms can include chronic, severe swelling of the legs, arms, breasts, and genitals. Symptoms The parasite that causes lymphatic filariasis attacks an infected person's lymph system. This system maintains the body's fluid balance and fights infections. Most people with lymphatic filariasis never develop any symptoms of the disease. However, in about one out of three people, the disease can cause visible signs of infection, sometimes months and even years after the infection occurs. These longer-term signs and symptoms may include
- Lymphedema, a swelling of the legs, arms, breasts, or genitalia.
- Hydrocele, or swelling in the scrotum in men.
- Hardening or thickening skin.
- Persistent coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath.

Secondary bacterial infections of the skin or lymph system. These secondary infections occur in people with chronic swelling and poor function of the lymph system, making it difficult for their bodies to fight germs and infections.
