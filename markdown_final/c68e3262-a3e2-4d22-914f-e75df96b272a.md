## Question

Peptic ulcer

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about peptic ulcer disease management, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the condition and its epidemiology. Then, I should verify the etiologies and pathophysiology. Next, I will review clinical presentation and risk stratification. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach, including when to test for H. pylori and when to endoscope. Then, I will examine management of uncomplicated disease, followed by management of complications, especially bleeding and perforation. Finally, I should consider special populations, prevention, and follow-up, and close with a concise algorithm that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and burden of disease. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a mucosal break ≥ 5 mm in the stomach or duodenum, with annual prevalence estimates around 0.12–1.5% and substantial morbidity and mortality, including approximately 54,000 hospitalizations annually in the US for bleeding ulcers and about 10,000 deaths per year, which underscores the need for timely diagnosis and treatment [^113ymyha] [^111ouN86].

> I need to verify the principal etiologies. The two dominant causes are Helicobacter pylori infection and aspirin/NSAID exposure; H. pylori accounts for roughly 42% of cases and NSAIDs for about 36%, with a synergistic effect that markedly increases bleeding risk when both are present, and stress-related ulcers occur in critically ill patients; importantly, a significant fraction of ulcers are idiopathic or H. pylori-negative/NSAID-negative, which complicates management and mandates careful evaluation for alternative causes such as gastrinoma or malignancy [^111ouN86] [^113ymyha] [^112REd7m].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about symptoms. I initially thought most patients are symptomatic, but wait, let me verify that; approximately two-thirds of patients with PUD are asymptomatic, and when symptomatic, epigastric pain is most common, often meal-related and nocturnal, with dyspepsia, bloating, nausea, early satiety, and weight loss also reported; alarm features such as bleeding, anemia, early satiety, weight loss, dysphagia, or persistent vomiting mandate urgent endoscopy [^1155v7xq] [^117Afufh].

> Next, I should review risk stratification and the diagnostic approach. For uninvestigated dyspepsia without alarm features, a test-and-treat strategy for H. pylori is appropriate in patients under about 60 years, whereas those 60 years or older or with alarm features should proceed to upper endoscopy; noninvasive testing with urea breath test or stool antigen is preferred, and serology should be avoided for active infection because it cannot confirm cure; importantly, in populations with high H. pylori prevalence, relying on reflux symptoms alone risks missing concomitant PUD, so test-and-treat or endoscopy should be favored over empiric PPI for GERD-like symptoms [^116v4nbG] [^116SJaD9] [^114LspAZ].

> I will now examine the management of uncomplicated PUD. If H. pylori is present, eradication is essential and reduces recurrence dramatically from roughly 50–60% to 0–2%; preferred first-line regimens are bismuth quadruple therapy or concomitant (non-bismuth quadruple) therapy given rising clarithromycin resistance; if NSAIDs are implicated, discontinuation heals most ulcers and reduces recurrence, and if NSAIDs must be continued, gastroprotection with a PPI and, when feasible, substitution with a COX-2 inhibitor is recommended; PPI therapy heals most ulcers within 4–8 weeks, with larger gastric ulcers sometimes requiring 8 weeks [^111ouN86] [^112REd7m] [^113ymyha].

> But wait, what if the patient presents with bleeding? I should confirm the acute management steps. Immediate resuscitation with IV access, fluids, blood typing, CBC, electrolytes, and coagulation studies is foundational; pre-endoscopic erythromycin can be considered to improve visualization; urgent endoscopy within 24 hours is recommended, with endoscopic hemostasis for high-risk stigmata; post-endoscopic high-dose PPI therapy, either continuous infusion or intermittent high-dose, for 72 hours reduces rebleeding, surgery, and mortality; PPIs should be continued for 6–8 weeks after hemostasis, and long-term PPI is reserved for ongoing NSAID use or other high-risk states; H. pylori should be tested and treated if positive, with test-of-cure to prevent recurrence [^112AFrTY] [^113o7A4p] [^112KEvGK] [^114JXSNx] [^115aNx4N] [^1139Lwma].

> Let me consider refractory or recurrent bleeding scenarios. If rebleeding occurs after initial endoscopic therapy, repeat endoscopy is preferred before surgery or angiographic embolization; transcatheter arterial embolization is a reasonable salvage option when endoscopy fails, with lower complication rates than surgery though higher rebleeding, and surgery remains indicated when endoscopic and radiologic measures fail or the patient is unstable; intraoperative endoscopy can aid localization when needed [^114JXZqZ] [^115BFPJM] [^1153YUtx].

> I should double-check the approach to perforation. Perforated peptic ulcer is a surgical emergency with high morbidity and mortality; early resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and prompt source control are critical; imaging with upright chest radiograph can show free air, but CT is the diagnostic modality of choice when available; operative management with omental patch closure is standard, with laparoscopic approaches increasingly used in stable patients; short-course antibiotics are recommended, and in select high-risk patients, minimally invasive or even endoscopic approaches may be considered in specialized centers [^114iUeGV] [^114bBbrz] [^1112uCvY] [^114ZxrVG] [^111YiR9Z].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In children, PUD is less common and H. pylori testing should be guided by endoscopic findings rather than pursued noninvasively in the absence of ulcers; in the elderly, polypharmacy and antithrombotic use increase bleeding risk and complicate management; in patients who require ongoing antiplatelet therapy, aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention should generally be resumed within 1–3 days after hemostasis, balancing bleeding and thrombotic risks; for NSAID-associated ulcers, avoid NSAIDs if possible, and if necessary, use the lowest effective dose of a COX-2 inhibitor plus PPI [^114HcVCC] [^113UifXL] [^111Ppvvh] [^115MBYyr].

> I need to ensure prevention and follow-up are addressed. Primary prophylaxis with PPIs is reasonable for high-risk NSAID users, and H. pylori should be eradicated before initiating long-term NSAID therapy; after successful eradication or ulcer healing, routine surveillance endoscopy is not required unless symptoms persist or complications arise; in refractory cases, repeat endoscopy is warranted to reassess healing and exclude alternative etiologies such as malignancy or Zollinger–Ellison syndrome [^116whgjT] [^113ymyha] [^111H4BsG].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm to close the loop. Uncomplicated dyspepsia without alarms in a patient under 60 years warrants noninvasive H. pylori testing with test-and-treat; if positive, eradicate and provide PPI therapy, if negative, offer a PPI trial; patients 60 years or older or with alarm features should undergo prompt upper endoscopy; any bleeding presentation triggers resuscitation, early endoscopy with hemostasis, high-dose PPI for 72 hours, H. pylori testing and eradication, and PPI continuation for 6–8 weeks; suspected perforation mandates resuscitation, antibiotics, and urgent surgical consultation with CT imaging; throughout, address NSAID use, antithrombotic management, and patient-specific risk factors to individualize care and prevent recurrence [^116v4nbG] [^112KEvGK] [^114bBbrz] [^111ouN86].

---

Peptic ulcer disease is most often caused by **H. pylori infection** [^111ouN86] or **NSAID use** [^113ymyha], with smoking and alcohol increasing risk. Typical symptoms are epigastric pain relieved by food or antacids [^117Afufh]; alarm features (bleeding, weight loss, anemia) require urgent endoscopy [^112REd7m]. Diagnosis relies on **upper endoscopy** for direct visualization and biopsy [^111ouN86], with noninvasive H. pylori testing (urea breath or stool antigen) for dyspepsia without alarms [^116v4nbG]. Management centers on **eradicating H. pylori** [^114pEgbr] and stopping NSAIDs, plus PPI therapy [^111ouN86]; bleeding ulcers need urgent endoscopic hemostasis and high-dose PPI [^112KEvGK], while perforation requires immediate surgery [^1116xjhD]. Recurrence is common without H. pylori eradication or ongoing NSAID use, so test-of-cure and risk modification are essential [^111ouN86] [^116v4nbG].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Peptic ulcers result from an imbalance between aggressive factors (gastric acid, pepsin, H. pylori, NSAIDs) and mucosal defenses [^111fZfrD]. The **primary causes** are H. pylori infection and NSAID use [^111ouN86]; other contributors include smoking, alcohol, corticosteroids, stress, and rare acid hypersecretory states (e.g. Zollinger-Ellison) [^113ymyha].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical symptoms include epigastric pain relieved by food or antacids, bloating, nausea, early satiety, and nocturnal pain [^1155v7xq]. Alarm features — gastrointestinal bleeding, unintentional weight loss, anemia, or persistent vomiting — indicate complications and require **urgent evaluation** [^114PPCuM].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Upper endoscopy**: gold standard for diagnosis, allowing direct visualization, biopsy, and H. pylori testing [^111ouN86].
- **Noninvasive H. pylori testing**: urea breath test or stool antigen for dyspepsia without alarm features [^112REd7m].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, liver function, and coagulation profile to assess bleeding risk and complications [^112AFrTY].

---

## Medical management

- **H. pylori eradication**: bismuth quadruple or concomitant therapy for 10–14 days; confirm cure with urea breath or stool antigen [^112REd7m] [^115doTkd].
- **Acid suppression**: PPIs are first-line; heal most ulcers in 4–8 weeks [^111ouN86].
- **NSAID management**: stop NSAIDs; if continued, use lowest dose plus PPI or switch to COX-2 inhibitor [^115MBYyr].

---

## Management of complications

- **Bleeding**: urgent endoscopic hemostasis and high-dose PPI reduce rebleeding, surgery, and mortality [^114RLBW3].
- **Perforation**: surgical emergency; early intervention reduces morbidity and mortality [^114iUeGV].
- **Gastric outlet obstruction**: endoscopic dilation or surgery as indicated [^notfound].

---

## Prevention and recurrence

Prevention focuses on **H. pylori eradication**, avoiding NSAIDs, and lifestyle modification (smoking cessation, alcohol moderation) [^111ouN86]. Recurrence is common without eradication or with ongoing NSAID use, so test-of-cure and risk modification are essential [^116v4nbG].

---

Peptic ulcer disease is a common, treatable condition driven by H. pylori and NSAIDs; **accurate diagnosis and targeted therapy** — especially H. pylori eradication and acid suppression — are key to healing and preventing complications [^113ymyha].

### Diagnosis and treatment of peptic ulcer disease [^1155v7xq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Peptic ulcer disease continues to be a source of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Approximately two-thirds of patients found to have peptic ulcer disease are asymptomatic. In symptomatic patients, the most common presenting symptom of peptic ulcer disease is epigastric pain, which may be associated with dyspepsia, bloating, abdominal fullness, nausea, or early satiety. Most cases of peptic ulcer disease are associated with Helicobacter pylori infection or the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or both. In this review, we discuss the role of proton pump inhibitors in the management of peptic ulcer disease, highlight the latest guidelines about the diagnosis and management of H. pylori, and discuss the latest evidence in the management of complications related to peptic ulcer disease, including endoscopic intervention for peptic ulcer-related bleeding. Timely diagnosis and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and its sequelae are crucial in order to minimize associated morbidity and mortality, as is prevention of peptic ulcer disease among patients at high risk, including those infected with H. pylori and users of NSAIDs.

### Current management of peptic ulcer bleeding [^112hoFXm]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Peptic ulcer bleeding is a common and potentially fatal condition. It is best managed using a multidisciplinary approach by a team with medical, endoscopic and surgical expertise. The management of peptic ulcer bleeding has been revolutionized in the past two decades with the advent of effective endoscopic hemostasis and potent acid-suppressing agents. A prompt initial clinical and endoscopic assessment should allow patients to be triaged effectively into those who require active therapy, versus those who require monitoring and preventative therapy. A combination of pharmacologic and endoscopic therapy (using a combination of injection and thermal coagulation) offers the best chance of hemostasis for those with active bleeding ulcers. Surgery, being the most effective way to control bleeding, should be considered for treatment failures. The choice between surgery and repeat endoscopic therapy should be based on the pre-existing comorbidities of the patient and the characteristics of the ulcer.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^114vvUj4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Notes on the use of the guidelines: aims, targets, and limitations

The Guidelines are aimed to present the state-of-the-art regarding diagnosis and therapeutic options for an optimal management of complicated peptic ulcer. These guidelines are thus intended to improve the knowledge and the awareness of physicians around the world on the specific topic of complicated peptic ulcer, providing an up-to-date tool that can help during the decision-making process. For this reason, the Guidelines are evidence-based and the grade of recommendation is provided to summarize the evidences present in literature. The population considered in these guidelines is adult patients with suspected complicated peptic ulcer disease. The practice Guidelines promulgated in this work do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and the consensus of experts but they do not exclude other approaches as being within the standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which method should be finally determined after taking account of the conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. However, responsibility for the results of treatment rests with those who are directly engaged therein, and not with the consensus group.

Conclusions and future directions

The paucity in clinical progress and basic understanding of perforated peptic ulcers begs for increased attention in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. Compared to the toll on human health worldwide, there is poor understanding of the pathophysiology underlying perforation, the ability to self-heal and the development of the sepsis syndrome in these patients.

Identification of prognostic factors and pathways of care that may enhance recovery, reduce morbidity and potentially also reduce mortality should be further investigated. Novel techniques may be further explored to seek alternatives to invasive surgical repair. Similarly, some patients with minimal symptoms may also benefit from less invasive therapeutic approaches. However, groups should be investigated in prospective protocols and trials dedicated to find the safest and most efficacious management strategies and the appropriate criteria for selection. Long-term follow up studies with evaluation of quality of life are needed.

### Peptic ulcer disease [^113ymyha]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Annual prevalence estimates of peptic ulcer disease range between 0.12% and 1.5%. Peptic ulcer disease is usually attributable to Helicobacter pylori infection, intake of some medications (such as aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications), or being critically ill (stress-related), or it can be idiopathic. The clinical presentation is usually uncomplicated, with peptic ulcer disease management based on eradicating H pylori if present, the use of acid-suppressing medications-most often proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)-or addressing complications, such as with early endoscopy and high-dose PPIs for peptic ulcer bleeding. Special considerations apply to patients on antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents. H pylori treatment has evolved, with the choice of regimen dictated by local antibiotic resistance patterns. Indications for primary and secondary prophylaxis vary across societies; most suggest PPIs for patients at highest risk of developing a peptic ulcer, its complications, or its recurrence. Additional research areas include the use of potassium-competitive acid blockers and H pylori vaccination; the optimal approach for patients at risk of stress ulcer bleeding requires more robust determinations of optimal patient selection and treatment selection, if any. Appropriate continuation of PPI use outweighs most possible side-effects if given for approved indications, while de-prescribing should be trialled when a definitive indication is no longer present.

### Empirical treatment based on "typical" reflux symptoms is inappropriate in a population with a high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection [^114LspAZ]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Empirical therapy or early endoscopy have been recommended as acceptable management options for GERD. The objective of this study was to determine whether diagnosis and empirical treatment based on reflux symptoms alone are appropriate as initial management for patients with gastroesophageal reflux.

Method

Consecutive patients presenting with weekly reflux symptoms were evaluated with a structured questionnaire followed by endoscopy. Patients with dyspepsia as the predominant symptom, "alarm" symptoms (weight loss, dysphagia, or bleeding), history of peptic ulcer or gastric surgery, or recent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs intake were excluded.

Results

Four hundred sixty patients were studied: 82 (18%) were found to have peptic ulcer disease and 78 (95%) were infected with Helicobacter pylori. Concomitant erosive esophagitis was found in 26 (32%) of these patients with peptic ulcer disease. In the remaining 378 patients, 218 (58%) had erosive esophagitis and 1 had esophageal cancer. Among the 159 patients with no endoscopic lesion, 148 (93%) had relief of symptoms when treated with a proton pump inhibitor. Multivariate analysis showed that male gender (OR: 1.8, p = 0.03), age greater than 60 years (OR: 2.2, p = 0.01) and H pylori infection (OR: 3.6, p = 0.008) were significantly associated with a diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease. Coexisting dyspeptic symptom was not a predictor (p = 0.13) for peptic ulcer disease.

Conclusions

In populations with a high prevalence of H pylori infection, a significant proportion of patients with GERD have concomitant peptic ulcer disease. Empirical treatment based on "typical" GERD symptoms alone may not be appropriate.

### Peptic ulcer disease and H. pylori infection: common questions and answers [^112REd7m]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Peptic ulcer disease is common, affecting 1 out of 12 people in the United States. Approximately 1 in 5 peptic ulcers is associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, with most of the rest due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. The combination of H. pylori infection and NSAID use synergistically increases the risk of bleeding ulcers more than sixfold. The H. pylori test-and-treat strategy is the mainstay of outpatient management. Patients younger than 60 years who have dyspepsia without alarm symptoms should be tested and, if positive, treated to eradicate the infection. If negative, they should be treated empirically with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is recommended for patients 60 years and older with new symptoms and for anyone with alarm symptoms. Noninvasive testing for H. pylori using a urea breath test or stool antigen test is preferred. Bismuth quadruple therapy or concomitant therapy (nonbismuth quadruple therapy) is the preferred first-line treatment for eradication because of increasing clarithromycin resistance. To lower the risk of ulcers associated with long-term NSAID use, clinicians should consider coadministering a PPI or substituting an NSAID with less effect on gastric mucosa, such as celecoxib. Eradicating H. pylori in NSAID users reduces the likelihood of peptic ulcers by one-half. Potential risks of long-term PPI use include fractures, interaction with antiplatelet medications, chronic kidney disease, Clostridioides difficile infection, dementia, and magnesium, calcium, and vitamin B12 micronutrient deficiencies.

### Peptic ulcer disease [^117Afufh]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Peptic ulcer disease usually occurs in the stomach and proximal duodenum. The predominant causes in the United States are infection with Helicobacter pylori and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Symptoms of peptic ulcer disease include epigastric discomfort (specifically, pain relieved by food intake or antacids and pain that causes awakening at night or that occurs between meals), loss of appetite, and weight loss. Older patients and patients with alarm symptoms indicating a complication or malignancy should have prompt endoscopy. Patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should discontinue their use. For younger patients with no alarm symptoms, a test-and-treat strategy based on the results of H. pylori testing is recommended. If H. pylori infection is diagnosed, the infection should be eradicated and antisecretory therapy (preferably with a proton pump inhibitor) given for four weeks. Patients with persistent symptoms should be referred for endoscopy. Surgery is indicated if complications develop or if the ulcer is unresponsive to medications. Bleeding is the most common indication for surgery. Administration of proton pump inhibitors and endoscopic therapy control most bleeds. Perforation and gastric outlet obstruction are rare but serious complications. Peritonitis is a surgical emergency requiring patient resuscitation; laparotomy and peritoneal toilet; omental patch placement; and, in selected patients, surgery for ulcer control.

### Peptic ulcer disease: a review [^111ouN86]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In the US, peptic ulcer disease affects 1% of the population and approximately 54 000 patients are admitted to the hospital annually for bleeding peptic ulcers.

Observations

Approximately 10% of patients presenting with upper abdominal pain in a primary care setting have a peptic ulcer as the cause of their symptoms. The principal causes of peptic ulcer disease are Helicobacter pylori infection, which affects approximately 42% of patients with peptic ulcer disease, and aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, which are etiologic factors in approximately 36% of people with peptic ulcer disease. Complications of peptic ulcer include bleeding (73% of patients), perforation (9% of patients), and pyloric obstruction (3% of patients). Annually, 10 000 people die of peptic ulcer disease in the US. Endoscopy definitively diagnoses peptic ulcer disease. Acid blockers, such as omeprazole, can heal peptic ulcers in approximately 80% to 100% of patients within 4 weeks, but gastric ulcers larger than 2 cm may require 8 weeks of treatment. Eradication of H pylori decreases peptic ulcer recurrence rates from approximately 50% to 60% to 0% to 2%. Discontinuing NSAIDs heals 95% of ulcers identified on endoscopy and reduces recurrence from 40% to 9%. When discontinuing an NSAID is not desirable, changing the NSAID (eg, from ketorolac to ibuprofen), adding a proton pump inhibitor such as omeprazole or lansoprazole, and eradicating H pylori with treatment such as bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline combined with omeprazole can reduce recurrence rates.

Conclusions and Relevance

Peptic ulcer disease is associated with increased hospitalization rates and mortality. Acid blocking with proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole or lansoprazole, is the primary treatment. Recurrence of ulcers can be prevented by eradicating H pylori if present and discontinuing aspirin or NSAIDs if applicable.

### Diagnosis and treatment of peptic ulcer disease and H. pylori infection [^115doTkd]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The most common causes of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) are Helicobacter pylori infection and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The test-and-treat strategy for detecting H. pylori is appropriate in situations where the risk of gastric cancer is low based on age younger than 55 years and the absence of alarm symptoms. Most other patients should undergo upper endoscopy to rule out malignancy and other serious causes of dyspepsia. Urea breath tests and stool antigen tests are most accurate for identifying H. pylori infection and can be used to confirm cure; serologic tests are a convenient but less accurate alternative and cannot be used to confirm cure. Treatment choices include standard triple therapy, sequential therapy, quadruple therapy, and levofloxacin-based triple therapy. Standard triple therapy is only recommended when resistance to clarithromycin is low. Chronic use of NSAIDs in patients with H. pylori infection increases the risk of PUD. Recommended therapies for preventing PUD in these patients include misoprostol and proton pump inhibitors. Complications of PUD include bleeding, perforation, gastric outlet obstruction, and gastric cancer. Older persons are at higher risk of PUD because of high-risk medication use, including antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and bisphosphonates.

### Dyspepsia: challenges in diagnosis and selection of treatment [^113KFE2B]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Despite considerable study, the pathophysiology of dyspepsia remains obscure. This and other factors have impeded development of precise and effective treatment strategies.

Objective

This paper provides a brief review of the clinical syndrome of dyspepsia and its pathophysiology, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment.

Methods

To identify articles for inclusion in this review, a search of MEDLINE was conducted using the key word dyspepsia. Because the literature on this topic is voluminous and duplicative, the search was limited primarily to literature from the last decade and to articles concerning dyspepsia in adults.

Results

The symptoms of dyspepsia, which may include epigastric pain, heartburn. bloating, and early satiety, defy diagnosis in as many as 50% of patients, even after endoscopy and other appropriate studies. In the other half of patients, such causative disorders as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and gastric cancer may be diagnosed. Despite controversy regarding the selection of therapy, empiric treatment is common for apparent idiopathic dyspepsia. Histamine2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), promotility agents, and coating agents have all been used as empiric therapy for dyspeptic symptoms. With empiric treatment, subsequent management is directed by the therapeutic response. In the absence of a definitive diagnosis, treatment is usually selected on the basis of the type and severity of symptoms, a thorough history and physical examination, and factors such as age and the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection. Five PPIs are currently available — lansoprazole, omeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole — all with established efficacy in GERD and other acid-mediated disorders. The PPIs can be expected to be useful in certain patients with dyspepsia, and may be prescribed for patients who are found to re- spond to potent antisecretory therapy. Patients' concern about their symptoms, practical considerations, and restrictions imposed by managed care organizations may all affect the choice between empiric therapy and early endoscopy in patients with dyspepsia.

Conclusions

Despite the variety of therapeutic options available for the symptoms of dyspepsia, the many presentations of this condition and the uncertainty of the response to the currently available therapeutic options continue to pose a substantial clinical challenge.

### Clinicians' management strategies for patients with dyspepsia: a qualitative approach [^1131iWuF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Results

The varied answers of the clinicians are presented in Table 2, 3, 4. Different categories of problems existed that could explain the variation in the decision-making process. When answering the question "Do you think there is a problem to decide whether there is a need for treatment in a case like this?", five different categories of answers were given. For example, the basis for deciding whether or not to treat and what would be optimal treatment was ambiguous and, further, the evidence for treatment was poor. Clinicians also felt that they lacked competence in evaluating test results when making treatment decisions and that patient expectations and requirements were problems with patients 1–3. In these cases, the patients sometimes requested investigations and treatment, even though the clinician informed them that there was no reported evidence of effect in the literature for the requested treatment or investigation.

For the same patient, the management strategies considered by the different clinicians varied widely, including extensive examinations, non-pharmacological treatment, drug treatment, and surgery (Table 3). For patients 2 and 3, who had tested positive for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), some clinicians stated that they would suggest eradication treatment only if the patient had an ulcer, whereas other clinicians said they would suggest this treatment irrespective of the presence of ulcers. For patient 4, who had a duodenal ulcer, some clinicians suggested eradication treatment only if the patient tested positive for H. pylori, whereas others recommended that treatment irrespective of such test results. This variation was also observed among clinicians in the same speciality. Variation was more pronounced if the case history noted symptoms but no organic findings, as in patients 1 and 2, than if the case history noted unambiguous findings and symptoms, as in patients 3 and 4.

When asked "Which factors are most important to consider in your decision?" (Table 4), the clinicians defined three categories of information. For patients 1 and 2, whose symptoms were diffuse, several clinicians answered that the medical history was the most important piece of information to consider. They also claimed to need a more comprehensive medical history for patients 1 and 2 than for patients 3 and 4, whose symptoms were more obviously related to an organic diagnosis.

A majority of the clinicians believed that their treatment decisions would be similar to those of most of their colleagues in their speciality. Some gastroenterologists believed that surgeons would prefer surgery to medication, given the same test results. Several gastroenterologists and surgeons believed that family clinicians investigated less, informed more, and prescribed acid inhibitors on wider indications than gastroenterologists and surgeons.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^114PPCuM]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Domain 1: diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection in symptomatic adults

Statement 1: all patients with symptoms related to the upper gastrointestinal tract should be tested for Helicobacter pylori

Recommendation: strong; Quality of evidence: high.

H. pylori eradication cures peptic ulcers in most patients whose ulcers are not associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and reduces gastric cancer risk. Eradication also leads to the regression of most localised gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas. In addition, European guidelines recommend H. pylori eradication for patients with unexplained iron-deficient anaemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and vitamin B 12 deficiency.

For a number of years, European guidelines have recommended the test-and-treat strategy for the management of H. pylori by performing noninvasive testing of individuals with uninvestigated dyspepsia, followed by treatment in cases where H. pylori is detected. The test-and-treat strategy is recommended in younger dyspeptic patients (< 50 years) without alarm symptoms, such as weight loss, dysphagia, overt gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal mass or iron-deficient anaemia. Options for noninvasive H. pylori testing include the urea breath test (UBT), the stool antigen test and serology. Endoscopy is recommended for those with dyspepsia symptom onset > 50 years, those of any age with alarm symptoms or a family history of gastric cancer and all patients where the test-and-treat strategy fails. H. pylori can be detected in biopsy samples taken during endoscopy using the rapid urease test (RUT), histology, culture and molecular methods such as the PCR.

### Refractory peptic ulcer disease [^1147HHEa]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Refractory PUD is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Optimal management of severe or refractory PUD requires a multidisciplinary team approach, using primary care providers, gastroenterologists, and general surgeons. Medical management has become the cornerstone of therapy. Identification and eradication of H pylori infection combined with acid reduction regimens can heal ulceration and also prevent recurrence. Severe, intractable or recurrent PUD and associated complications mandates a careful and methodical evaluation and management strategy to determine the potential etiologies and necessary treatment (medical or surgical) required.

### Management of perforated peptic ulcer: what you need to know [^1116xjhD]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Despite therapeutic advancements and the significant efficacy of medical management, peptic ulcer disease still affects millions of people. Elective surgical treatment, once a common intervention in General Surgery departments, is now nearly obsolete. Surgical treatment is reserved solely for complications, which occur in approximately 10% to 20% of cases. Perforation is the most common indication for surgery in peptic ulcer disease and accounts for nearly 40% of deaths from the disease. Treatment success depends on various factors, with early diagnosis and immediate surgical intervention being highlighted. Perforation is associated with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality. This article aims to analyze the different aspects related to the treatment of perforated peptic ulcers and define the best therapeutic approaches.

### First-line therapies foreradication: a critical reappraisal of updated guidelines [^115wTran]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Since the 1990s, different national and international guidelines for the management of patients with H. pylori infection have been introduced and periodically updated. Undeniably, recommendations on some issues are universally applicable to different geographic areas, such as those concerning the indications for treatment, or diagnostic procedures. For instance, H. pylori infection should be searched for in all patients with a peptic ulcer, irrespectively of the country where they are living. Likewise, the accuracy of noninvasive or invasive tests does not change among patients of different geographic areas. Therefore, guidelines on diagnosis and clinical issues may be applicable in all countries. In contrast, the efficacy of a therapy regimen may be affected by local or regional host/bacterial peculiarities. Consequently, recommendations on therapeutic approaches are more appropriately addressed in national rather than international guidelines, provided that data from national studies are considered.

Based on all these considerations, we aimed to examine the most recently updated guidelines worldwide, focusing our attention on first-line therapy recommendations for H. pylori eradication. Specifically, we considered European, NICE, Italian, Spanish American and Canadian guidelines for Western countries, and Asian, Australian, Japanese, and Chinese guidelines for Eastern countries.

### Approaches to healing and prophylaxis of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated ulcers [^112YnftF]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Treating and preventing peptic ulcers associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) calls for clinical judgment. Physicians must weigh their patients' need for anti-inflammatory therapy against their individual risks for ulcer development; their likelihood of coping with an ulcer complication if it should develop; and the economics, efficacy, and tolerability of various treatment and prevention options. This article considers some general strategies common to both treatment and prevention. Data from randomized trials that can guide clinicians and their patients as they attempt to heal an established NSAID ulcer or prevent one occurring in the future are also reviewed.

### Helicobacter pylori world gastroenterology organization global guideline [^112huKk5]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Helicobacter pylori remains a major health problem worldwide, causing considerable morbidity and mortality due to peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. The burden of disease falls disproportionally on less well-resourced populations. As with most infectious diseases, the largest impact on reducing this burden comes from improvement in socioeconomic status, which interrupts transmission. This has been observed in many regions of the world, but the prevalence of infection remains high in many regions where improvements in living standards are slow to occur. Meanwhile, the optimal clinical management and treatment pathways remain unsettled and are evolving with changing antimicrobial resistance patterns. Despite decades of research and clinical practice, major challenges remain. The quest for the most effective, safe, and simple therapy remains the major issue for clinicians. The search for an effective vaccine appears to be elusive still. Clinical guidelines do not infrequently proffer discordant advice. A major challenge for guidelines is for relevance across a variety of populations with a varying spectrum of disease, antimicrobial resistance rates, and vastly different resources. As local factors are central to determining the impact and management strategies for H. pylori infection, it is important that pathways are based on the best available local knowledge rather than solely extrapolating from guidelines formulated in other regions, which may be less applicable. To this end, this revision of the World Gastroenterology Organisation (WGO) H. pylori guideline uses a "Cascades" approach that seeks to summarize the principles of management and offer advice for pragmatic, relevant and achievable diagnostic and treatment pathways based on established key treatment principles and using local knowledge and available resources to guide regional practice.

### Peptic ulcer and Helicobacter pylori [^114uWSpF]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

Although there has been an explosion of data not only since the discovery of H. pylori in 1982, but also since the first comprehensive review of H. pylori in the Gastroenterology Clinics in 1993, much remains to be learned. In 1993, there were many skeptics doubting the importance of H. pylori in ulcer disease. Although this skepticism has dissipated, many ulcer patients infected with H. pylori still do not receive appropriate therapy. This situation possibly relates to the safety, efficacy, and simplicity of prescribing acid-suppressive therapy in contrast to the confusion regarding anti-H. pylori treatment regimens. Among the many continuing unanswered questions regarding the role of H. pylori and PUD are the still enigmatic nature of host, environmental, and H. pylori-related factors that determine outcome. Why do only some infected individuals (and why do more men than women) develop PUD, and what determines whether gastric ulcers or duodenal ulcers develop? What is the explanation for the seasonal variation in ulcer disease? Although PUD is an infectious disease, are other environmental factors critical for the manifestation of ulcers in association with infection? What factors govern the outcome of the combination of H. pylori infection and NSAID use? Has attention been too focused first on the pathophysiology of acid secretion and now on H. pylori? In curing H. pylori in association with PUD, are clinicians going to displace disease northward, substituting erosions, inflammation, and neoplasia (and associated symptoms) in the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction for an ulcer crater (and its associated symptoms) in the duodenum or stomach? The epidemiology of PUD is changing — in more recent reports of ulcer patients, H. pylori and NSAID use are less prevalent than in earlier reports. These questions and comments should not be misinterpreted as advocating a lack of aggressiveness in diagnosis and treatment of H. pylori in the setting of PUD, however. Nevertheless, the pendulum is swinging.

### Perforated peptic ulcer [^114iUeGV]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) is a surgical emergency and is associated with short-term mortality and morbidity in up to 30 and 50% of patients, respectively. Worldwide variation in demography, socioeconomic status, Helicobacter pylori prevalence and prescription drugs make investigation into risk factors for PPU difficult. PPU presents as an acute abdominal condition, with localized or generalized peritonitis and a high risk for developing sepsis and death. Early diagnosis is essential but clinical signs can be obscured in the elderly, or the immunocompromised and thus delay diagnosis. Imaging has an important role in diagnosis, as does early resuscitation including administration of antibiotics. Appropriate risk-assessment and selection of therapeutic alternatives becomes important to address the risk for morbidity and mortality. This review will present an update on the current understanding and management of perforated peptic ulcer.

### Controversies regarding management of Helicobacter pylori infections [^116Uh3CM]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The recognition that Helicobacter pylori should be considered and treated as an infectious disease has yet to fundamentally change diagnostic and treatment practices and has resulted in many controversies.

Recent Findings

We discuss the following controversies: whether the current 'per-patient' approach to H. pylori testing based on symptoms should be expanded to include achieving population-level H. pylori eradication, whether H. pylori should be approached as an infectious gastrointestinal disease similar to that of other infectious diseases of similar severity and outcome, whether treatment of H. pylori should be primarily empiric or based on antibiotic susceptibility and locally proven successful therapies as are other infectious diseases, whether it is necessary to obtain confirmation of treatment success in every patient treated for H. pylori, and whether potassium-competitive acid blockers should replace proton pump inhibitors in H. pylori therapy.

Summary

Available guidelines and meta-analyses do not yet address H. pylori as an infectious disease. The diagnosis and management and treatment success of H. pylori infections trails behind that of other important infectious diseases. We provide new insights and propose changes in the traditional understanding required to modernize the management of H. pylori infections.

### Which test for Helicobacter pylori in primary care? [^1153aZz2]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2004). Low credibility.

Around 4% of primary care consultations are for dyspepsia, a term used for a specific group of upper gastrointestinal symptoms that includes abdominal discomfort, recurrent epigastric pain, bloating and heartburn. National guidelines recommend testing patients with uncomplicated dyspepsia for Helicobacter pylori infection, giving eradication therapy to those found to be infected and re-testing those who remain symptomatic after such treatment. Non-invasive tests for H. pylori avoid the need for endoscopy and biopsy to confirm infection, and several are now available for use in primary care. Here we review these tests and consider their role in the management of adults with dyspepsia.

### Challenges in the management of acute peptic ulcer bleeding [^113UifXL]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common medical emergency worldwide, a major cause of which are bleeding peptic ulcers. Endoscopic treatment and acid suppression with proton-pump inhibitors are cornerstones in the management of the disease, and both treatments have been shown to reduce mortality. The role of emergency surgery continues to diminish. In specialised centres, radiological intervention is increasingly used in patients with severe and recurrent bleeding who do not respond to endoscopic treatment. Despite these advances, mortality from the disorder has remained at around 10%. The disease often occurs in elderly patients with frequent comorbidities who use antiplatelet agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and anticoagulants. The management of such patients, especially those at high cardiothrombotic risk who are on anticoagulants, is a challenge for clinicians. We summarise the published scientific literature about the management of patients with bleeding peptic ulcers, identify directions for future clinical research, and suggest how mortality can be reduced.

### Alternative treatments to treat perforated peptic ulcer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111YiR9Z]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Minimally invasive techniques, including laparoscopic and endoscopic interventions, represent viable alternatives to open surgery for PPU. While laparoscopic repair offers distinct advantages in reducing surgical site infections and postoperative pain, endoscopic approaches may be particularly beneficial for high-risk patients. Individualized treatment plans considering patient characteristics and perforation features are crucial to optimizing outcomes and reducing the burden of PPU. Randomized trials with larger sample sizes and multicenter collaborations are essential to validate the findings of this analysis and provide further robust evidence for clinical guidelines.

### How to manage the difficult-to-treat dyspeptic patient [^114DjZ4Q]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Medium credibility.

The main causes of dyspepsia are unexplained gastroduodenal symptoms (i.e. functional dyspepsia), peptic ulcer disease, reflux disease and, rarely, malignancy. A careful clinical evaluation and upper endoscopy will exclude most of the major causes of dyspepsia. The absence of alarm features is reassuring. The yield of other diagnostic tests in this clinical situation is low, and repeat endoscopy is unlikely to be cost-effective. By definition, the difficult-to-treat patient with functional dyspepsia has already had Helicobacter pylori infection excluded or eradicated, has failed to respond to an adequate trial of acid-suppression therapy that used appropriate doses and, therefore, seeks other solutions. It is likely that patients who have failed to respond to previous trials of a PPI will not experience therapeutic gains with high-dose PPI therapy. A major gastroduodenal motor disorder should be suspected if there is severe early satiation (inability to finish a normal-sized meal), postprandial fullness, or persistent nausea and vomiting; here, an assessment of gastric emptying or gastric accommodation can be considered, to tailor therapy. Antidepressants (especially low-dose tricyclic agents) and psychological therapies can be useful. Creation of a logical management plan that includes patient education and support remains key.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^114ZJw7s]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

ACG Practice Guidelines — Scope, evidence review, and grading — focus on ulcer-related UGIB and use GRADE for recommendations. Ulcers are the most common cause of hospitalization for UGIB, and this guideline addresses the management of patients with overt UGIB due to gastric or duodenal ulcers, where "overt" indicates hematemesis, melena, and/or hematochezia. The document covers initial assessment and risk stratification, pre-endoscopic use of medications and gastric lavage, timing of endoscopy, endoscopic and medical management, post-endoscopic medical therapy and disposition, and prevention of recurrent bleeding. Evidence review included a MEDLINE search using the MeSH term "gastrointestinal hemorrhage" limited to "all clinical trials" and "meta-analysis" for years 1966–2010 without language restriction. The GRADE system was used; the quality of evidence ranges from "high" to "very low" with stated definitions, and the strength of a recommendation is graded as strong when desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects and conditional when uncertainty exists about the trade-offs; additional factors include variability in patient values and preferences and whether an intervention represents a wise use of resources.

### Management of Helicobacter pylori [^1164LnDP]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gastroenterologists and many general internists and primary care physicians confront questions regarding the management of Helicobacter pylori on a daily basis. The subject remains of global interest and continue to generate debate and research. Using the search terms 'pylori and treatment' or 'pylori and management' we identified over 1000 relevant articles in PubMed published over the time period 1 January 2019 to 30 April 2020. We have selected the most highly clinically relevant of these to review here.

Recent Findings

Clinical evidence grows regarding the benefits of H. pylori eradication on gastric cancer prevention. High rates of resistance to clarithromycin and levofloxacin, correlating with treatment failure in regimens utilizing these drugs, has stimulated interest in alternative regimens as well as the need for susceptibility testing of individual patients and populations. Although many aspects of H. pylori management are well established, implementation of appropriate testing and treatment pathways remains suboptimal throughout healthcare settings.

Summary

Increased emphasis on measuring H. pylori-related clinical outcomes in practice is needed to identify implementation gaps, and to suggest means to best apply the knowledge gained on H. pylori for the prevention of gastric symptoms and disease.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^114PFmEK]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Peptic ulcer disease is common with a lifetime prevalence in the general population of 5–10% and an incidence of 0.1–0.3% per year. Despite a sharp reduction in incidence and rates of hospital admission and mortality over the past 30 years, complications are still encountered in 10–20% of these patients. Peptic ulcer disease remains a significant healthcare problem, which can consume considerable financial resources. Management may involve various subspecialties including surgeons, gastroenterologists, and radiologists. Successful management of patients with complicated peptic ulcer (CPU) involves prompt recognition, resuscitation when required, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and timely surgical/radiological treatment.

Methods

The present guidelines have been developed according to the GRADE methodology. To create these guidelines, a panel of experts was designed and charged by the board of the WSES to perform a systematic review of the available literature and to provide evidence-based statements with immediate practical application. All the statements were presented and discussed during the 5th WSES Congress, and for each statement, a consensus among the WSES panel of experts was reached.

Conclusions

The population considered in these guidelines is adult patients with suspected complicated peptic ulcer disease. These guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of complicated peptic ulcer from a collaboration of a panel of experts and are intended to improve the knowledge and the awareness of physicians around the world on this specific topic. We divided our work into the two main topics, bleeding and perforated peptic ulcer, and structured it into six main topics that cover the entire management process of patients with complicated peptic ulcer, from diagnosis at ED arrival to post-discharge antimicrobial therapy, to provide an up-to-date, easy-to-use tool that can help physicians and surgeons during the decision-making process.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^111ttzYz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Peptic ulcer disease is still common among the world population and its incidence pattern is evolving in relation to the rise of new risk factors, i.e. the increasing incidence of the Helicobacter pylori infection, the extensive use of NSAIDs and the increase in alcohol and smoking abuse. Despite the tremendous improvement in preventive therapies, the rate of complication of this disease is still high and is burdened by high morbidity and mortality. Prompt recognition and treatment of the complications lead invariably to a better outcome, especially in elderly and frail patients. For this reason, these guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of complicated peptic ulcer from a collaboration of a panel of experts and are intended to improve the knowledge and the awareness of physicians around the world on this specific topic. We divided our work into two main topics, bleeding and perforated peptic ulcer, and structured it into six main topics that cover the entire management process of patients with complicated peptic ulcer, from diagnosis at ED arrival to post-discharge antimicrobial therapy, to provide an up-to-date and easy-to-use tool that can help physicians and surgeons during the decision-making process.

### Medical versus surgical treatment for refractory or recurrent peptic ulcer [^111Dou2i]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Refractory peptic ulcers are ulcers in the stomach or duodenum that do not heal after eight to 12 weeks of medical treatment or those that are associated with complications despite medical treatment. Recurrent peptic ulcers are peptic ulcers that recur after healing of the ulcer. Given the number of deaths due to peptic ulcer-related complications and the long-term complications of medical treatment (increased incidence of fracture), it is unclear whether medical or surgical intervention is the better treatment option in people with recurrent or refractory peptic ulcers.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of medical versus surgical treatment for people with recurrent or refractory peptic ulcer.

Search Methods

We searched the specialised register of the Cochrane Upper GI and Pancreatic Diseases group, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and trials registers until September 2015 to identify randomised trials and non-randomised studies, using search strategies. We also searched the references of included studies to identify further studies.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies comparing medical treatment with surgical treatment in people with refractory or recurrent peptic ulcer, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status for inclusion in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified trials and extracted data. We planned to calculate the risk ratio, mean difference, standardised mean difference, or hazard ratio with 95% confidence intervals using both fixed-effect and random-effects models with Review Manager 5 based on intention-to-treat analysis.

Main Results

We included only one non-randomised study published 30 years ago in the review. This study included 77 participants who had gastric ulcer and in whom medical therapy (histamine H2 receptor blockers, antacids, and diet) had failed after an average duration of treatment of 29 months. The authors do not state whether these were recurrent or refractory ulcers. It appears that the participants did not have previous complications such as bleeding or perforation. Of the 77 included participants, 37 participants continued to have medical therapy while 40 participants received surgical therapy (antrectomy with or without vagotomy; subtotal gastrectomy with or without vagotomy; vagotomy; pyloroplasty and suture of the ulcer; suture or closure of ulcer without vagotomy or excision of the ulcer; proximal gastric or parietal cell vagotomy alone; suture or closure of the ulcer with proximal gastric or parietal cell vagotomy). Whether to use medical or surgical treatment was determined by participant's or treating physician's preference. The study authors reported that two participants in the medical treatment group (2 out of 37; 5.4%) had gastric cancer, which was identified by repeated biopsy. They did not report the proportion of participants who had gastric cancer in the surgical treatment group. They also did not report the implications of the delayed diagnosis of gastric cancer in the medical treatment group. They did not report any other outcomes of interest for this review (that is health-related quality of life (using any validated scale), adverse events and serious adverse events, peptic ulcer bleeding, peptic ulcer perforation, abdominal pain, and long-term mortality).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no studies that provide the relative benefits and harms of medical versus surgical treatment for recurrent or refractory peptic ulcers. Studies that evaluate the natural history of recurrent and refractory peptic ulcers are urgently required to determine whether randomised controlled trials comparing medical versus surgical management in patients with recurrent or refractory peptic ulcers or both are necessary. Such studies will also provide information for the design of such randomised controlled trials. A minimum follow-up of two to three years will allow the calculation of the incidence of complications and gastric cancer (in gastric ulcers only) in recurrent and refractory peptic ulcers. In addition to complications related to treatment and disease, health-related quality of life and loss of productivity should also be measured.

ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN pediatric Helicobacter pylori — clinical evaluation and symptom management: We recommend that the primary goal of clinical investigation of gastrointestinal symptoms should be to determine the underlying cause of the symptoms and not solely the presence of H pylori infection; in the absence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) defined as gastric or duodenal ulceration or erosions, eradication of H pylori infection is not expected to result in improvement of symptoms. In cases of abdominal pain in which an organic cause is considered, a diagnostic upper endoscopy rather than noninvasive testing for H pylori should be performed, and based on current evidence, treatment to eliminate H pylori infection is not expected to improve symptoms in children, except in cases of PUD, therefore if peptic lesions are not clinically suspected or identified by endoscopy, invasive diagnostic testing for the sole purpose of detecting H pylori infection should not be undertaken.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^111M5n49]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Peptic ulcer disease is common with a lifetime prevalence in the general population of 5–10% and an incidence of 0.1–0.3% per year. Despite a sharp reduction in incidence and rates of hospital admission and mortality over the past 30years, complications are still encountered in 10–20% of these patients. Peptic ulcer disease remains a significant healthcare problem, which can consume considerable financial resources. Management may involve various subspecialties including surgeons, gastroenterologists, and radiologists. Successful management of patients with complicated peptic ulcer (CPU) involves prompt recognition, resuscitation when required, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and timely surgical/radiological treatment.

Methods

The present guidelines have been developed according to the GRADE methodology. To create these guidelines, a panel of experts was designed and charged by the board of the WSES to perform a systematic review of the available literature and to provide evidence-based statements with immediate practical application. All the statements were presented and discussed during the 5th WSES Congress, and for each statement, a consensus among the WSES panel of experts was reached.

Conclusions

The population considered in these guidelines is adult patients with suspected complicated peptic ulcer disease. These guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of complicated peptic ulcer from a collaboration of a panel of experts and are intended to improve the knowledge and the awareness of physicians around the world on this specific topic. We divided our work into the two main topics, bleeding and perforated peptic ulcer, and structured it into six main topics that cover the entire management process of patients with complicated peptic ulcer, from diagnosis at ED arrival to post-discharge antimicrobial therapy, to provide an up-to-date, easy-to-use tool that can help physicians and surgeons during the decision-making process.

### Dumping syndrome: update on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management [^1179j64B]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Dumping syndrome is a complex of gastrointestinal symptoms originally studied in peptic ulcer surgery patients. At present, it is most prevalent in patients who underwent bariatric, upper gastrointestinal cancer or anti-reflux surgery. The symptom pattern comprises early and late dumping symptoms. Several management options have been reported including nutritional, pharmacological and surgical approaches.

Aims and Methods

In this study, we aimed to review the current evidence on dumping syndrome definition, diagnosis and treatment, including preliminary data from newer pharmacological studies.

Results

Current pathophysiological concepts and analyses of provocative tests has led to a clear definition of dumping syndrome, including both early and late dumping symptoms. The term postbariatric hypoglycemia represents a limited focus on late dumping only. The diagnosis relies on recognition of symptoms and signs in a patient with appropriate surgical history; and can be confirmed by provocative testing or registration of spontaneous hypoglycemia. The initial treatment focuses on dietary intervention, to which meal viscosity enhancers and/or the glycosidase inhibitor acarbose can be added. The most effective therapy is the use of short- or long-acting somatostatin analogues, which is however expensive and entails side effect issues. In case of refractory hypoglycemia, diazoxide or SGLT2 inhibitors can be considered, based on limited evidence. In refractory patients, continuous enteral feeding or (rarely) surgical reinterventions have been advocated, although not supported by solid evidence. Therapies under current evaluation include the broad-spectrum somatostatin analogue pasireotide, GLP-1 receptor antagonists, GLP-1 receptor agonists and administration of stable forms of glucagon are currently under study.

Conclusions

Dumping syndrome is a well-defined but probably under-diagnosed complication of upper gastrointestinal, especially bariatric, and surgeries. Diagnosis is confirmed by a provocative test and incremental therapies starting with diet, adding meal viscosity enhancers or glycosidase inhibitors and adding somatostatin analogues in refractory cases. A number of emerging therapies targeting intestinal propulsion, peptide hormone effects and hypoglycemic events are under evaluation.

### Key points from the revised maastricht consensus report: the impact on general practice [^115d831M]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

The Maastricht 2 Consensus Report features evidence-based recommendations for the management of Helicobacter pylori infection. Strongly recommended indications for H. pylori eradication include duodenal and gastric ulcer, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, atrophic gastritis, post gastric cancer resection, first-degree relation to gastric cancer patients, and patient's wishes. Advisable indications include functional dyspepsia, with the statement that eradication can lead to long-term improvement of symptoms in a subset of patients. Because H. pylori eradication does not cause gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in most patients, or exacerbate existing GORD, H. pylori should be eradicated in patients requiring long-term acid suppression. Also advisable is H. pylori eradication before administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), although this alone may be insufficient to reduce recurrent bleeding or enhance ulcer healing in patients receiving antisecretory therapy who continue to take NSAIDs. Maastricht 2 also introduced the concept of the 'treatment package' that considers first- and second-line eradication therapies together. A 'search and treat' strategy should be considered in patients with peptic ulcers; for patients with uncomplicated duodenal ulcer, administration of proton pump inhibitors can be limited to the period of antibiotic treatment.

Introduction

A peptic ulcer is a mucosal break with a size over 5 mm that forms in the lining of the stomach or the duodenum. Many kinds of etiologies can result in peptic ulcer disease. Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the two major causes of peptic ulcers. Other uncommon etiologies for peptic ulcers are named Hp-negative, NSAID-negative ulcers, including gastrinoma (Zollinger–Ellison syndrome), gastric malignancy (adenocarcinoma and lymphoma), Crohn disease, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, viral infections, Behcet disease, acute stress, and mucosal ischemia.

Gastric acid, bicarbonate, and digestive enzymes compose the gastric environment with a dynamic pH value between 1.5 and 3. In normal conditions, protective mechanisms of the stomach can protect and repair the gastric mucosa. When an imbalance between gastric acid and mucosal protection occurs, such as gastric acid hypersecretion and impaired duodenal bicarbonate secretion, it may result in peptic ulcer disease. Hp infection can disrupt the protective mucous layer, causing gastritis and impair the mucosa healing. Hp-induced antral inflammation can also increase basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion.NSAIDs inhibit mucosal prostaglandin synthesis, which can reduce the mucosa blood flow, the integrity of the mucosal barrier, and the amount of bicarbonate.

Common symptoms of peptic ulcers include epigastric pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and in severe cases, bleeding or perforation of the stomach or duodenum. The most common complication of peptic ulcers in emergency departments is bleeding, approximately 100–170 per 100,000 worldwide. Peptic ulcer bleeding is a serious medical condition causing hematemesis, melena (tarry stool), or hematochezia. Patients without timely treatment can progress into anemia, hypovolemic shock, multiorgan failure, or even death. The mortality rate of peptic ulcer bleeding is approximately 5%–12%. Therefore, clinicians have been dedicated to developing the most effective treatment for peptic ulcer bleeding for decades.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^116v4nbG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Indications for Helicobacter pylori testing and treatment — test-and-treat strategy and follow-up are outlined. Testing for, and treatment of, H. pylori infection should be viewed as dependent rather than independent actions, and therefore all patients with an indication for testing should be offered effective treatment if confirmed to have active infection — and should subsequently undergo a test-of-cure after treatment. The "test-and-treat" approach for uninvestigated dyspepsia is reasonable in patients under the age of 60 years, without alarm features and without other indications for endoscopy. In patients with functional dyspepsia, eradication of H. pylori infection only provides modest benefit.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® epigastric pain [^1173NJqD]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Epigastric pain can have multiple etiologies including myocardial infarction, pancreatitis, acute aortic syndromes, gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, duodenal ulcer disease, gastric cancer, and hiatal hernia. This document focuses on the scenarios in which epigastric pain is accompanied by symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, and hematemesis, which raise suspicion for gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, duodenal ulcer disease, gastric cancer, or hiatal hernia. Although endoscopy may be the test of choice for diagnosing these entities, patients may present with nonspecific or overlapping symptoms, necessitating the use of imaging prior to or instead of endoscopy. The utility of fluoroscopic imaging, CT, MRI, and FDG-PET for these indications are discussed. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### How would you manage this patient with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^1176xQkE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding is common, morbid, and potentially fatal. Cornerstones of inpatient management include fluid resuscitation; blood transfusion; endoscopy; and initiation of proton-pump inhibitor therapy, which continues in an individualized manner based on risk factors for recurrent bleeding in the outpatient setting. The International Consensus Group released guidelines on the management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding in 2019. These guidelines provide a helpful, evidence-based roadmap for management of gastrointestinal bleeding but leave certain management details to the discretion of the treating physician. Here, 2 gastroenterologists consider the care of a patient with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding from a peptic ulcer, specifically debating approaches to blood transfusion and endoscopy timing in the hospital, as well as the recommended duration of proton-pump inhibitor therapy after discharge.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^115ZiAvn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

These consensus guidelines are an update of the 2013 WSES position paper on this topic. To create these guidelines, a panel of experts was designed and charged by the board of the WSES to develop questions on six main topics that thoroughly cover the field of this pathology (diagnosis, resuscitation, nonoperative management, surgery, angiography-angioembolization, antimicrobial therapy). Then, leading specialists in the field were asked to perform a thorough search on each of these topics in different databanks (MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE) for relevant papers between 1985 and June 2018 and a systematic review of the available literature. They were asked to focus their search in order to provide evidence-based answers to every question with immediate practical application and to summarize them in statements. All the statements were presented and discussed during the 5 th WSES Congress held in Bertinoro, Italy in June 28th, 2018. For each statement, a consensus among the WSES panel of experts was reached. All the members contributed to the development of the manuscript; the manuscript was reviewed and approved by all the authors.

The present guidelines have been developed according to the GRADE methodology.

Topics and questions

For clarity, we report the six topics together with the questions dividend into each of them.

Diagnosis

In patients with a suspected perforated peptic ulcer, which are the appropriate biochemical and imaging investigations that should be requested?
In patients with perforated peptic ulcer, what is the clinical value of risk scores such as Boey Score and Pulp score?
In patients with suspected bleeding peptic ulcer, which biochemical and imaging investigations should be requested?
In patients with suspected bleeding peptic ulcer, what is the diagnostic role of endoscopy?
In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, are the endoscopic findings useful to determine the risk for rebleeding and how do they affect the clinical management?

Resuscitation

In patients with perforated peptic ulcer, which parameters should be evaluated ad ED referral?
In patients with perforated peptic ulcer, which are the appropriate targets for resuscitation (hemoglobin level, blood pressure/heart rate, lactates level, others)?
In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, which parameters should be evaluated at ED referral and which criteria should be adopted to define an unstable patient?
In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, which are the appropriate targets for resuscitation (hemoglobin level, blood pressure/heart rate, lactates level, others)?

### Guidelines for the management of dyspepsia [^116HMGkn]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia is a chronic or recurrent pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen; patients with predominant or frequent (more than once a week) heartburn or acid regurgitation, should be considered to have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) until proven otherwise. Dyspeptic patients over 55 yr of age, or those with alarm features should undergo prompt esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). In all other patients, there are two approximately equivalent options: (i) test and treat for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) using a validated noninvasive test and a trial of acid suppression if eradication is successful but symptoms do not resolve or (ii) an empiric trial of acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for 4–8 wk. The test-and-treat option is preferable in populations with a moderate to high prevalence of H. pylori infection (≥ 10%); empirical PPI is an initial option in low prevalence situations. If initial acid suppression fails after 2–4 wk, it is reasonable to consider changing drug class or dosing. If the patient fails to respond or relapses rapidly on stopping antisecretory therapy, then the test-and-treat strategy is best applied before consideration of referral for EGD. Prokinetics are not currently recommended as first-line therapy for uninvestigated dyspepsia. EGD is not mandatory in those who remain symptomatic as the yield is low; the decision to endoscope or not must be based on clinical judgement. In patients who do respond to initial therapy, stop treatment after 4–8 wk; if symptoms recur, another course of the same treatment is justified. The management of functional dyspepsia is challenging when initial antisecretory therapy and H. pylori eradication fails. There are very limited data to support the use of low-dose tricyclic antidepressants or psychological treatments in functional dyspepsia.

### Peptic ulcer disease today [^111H4BsG]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Over the past few decades, since the introduction of histamine H(2)-receptor antagonists, proton-pump inhibitors, cyclo-oxygenase-2-selective anti-inflammatory drugs (coxibs), and eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection, the incidence of peptic ulcer disease and ulcer complications has decreased. There has, however, been an increase in ulcer bleeding, especially in elderly patients. At present, there are several management issues that need to be solved: how to manage H. pylori infection when eradication failure rates are high; how best to prevent ulcers developing and recurring in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and aspirin users; and how to treat non-NSAID, non-H. pylori-associated peptic ulcers. Looking for H. pylori infection, the overt or surreptitious use of NSAIDs and/or aspirin, and the possibility of an acid hypersecretory state are important diagnostic considerations that determine the therapeutic approach. Combined treatment with antisecretory therapy and antibiotics for 1–2 weeks is the first-line choice for H. pylori eradication therapy. For patients at risk of developing an ulcer or ulcer complications, it is important to choose carefully which anti-inflammatory drugs, nonselective NSAIDs or coxibs to use, based on a risk assessment of the patient, especially if the high-risk patient also requires aspirin. Testing for and eradicating H. pylori infection in patients is recommended before starting NSAID therapy, and for those currently taking NSAIDs, when there is a history of ulcers or ulcer complications. Understanding the pathophysiology and best treatment strategies for non-NSAID, non-H. pylori-associated peptic ulcers presents a challenge.

### Turn over the new leaf of the treatment in peptic ulcer bleeding: a review of the literature [^115BFPJM]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Challenging ulcer bleeding and salvage treatments

Despite advancements in endoscopic and pharmacological therapies, still a minority of patients (8%–15%) experience refractory peptic ulcer bleeding. Predictors of rebleeding include initial hemodynamic instability, low hemoglobin levels upon presentation, greater blood transfusion requirements, high-risk endoscopic stigmata, large ulcer size, and specific ulcer locations like posterior duodenal or high lesser gastric curvature ulcers. For patients with peptic ulcers who experience recurrent bleeding despite initial endoscopic treatment, a second-look endoscopy has shown long-term bleeding control with reduced complications, no increased mortality risk, and lower costs compared to surgery. Therefore, guidelines recommend a second-look endoscopy in such cases.

Malignancy-related ulcer bleeding is another challenge to manage. Due to local vessel invasion and friable neovascularization of tumors, malignant ulcers can rebleed even after initial hemostasis was achieved. Although surgery and endoscopic resection can remove the tumor, not all patients are appropriate candidates. Standard combination therapy with injection and thermal or mechanical treatment can reach 80%–90% initial hemostasis. However, the overall rebleeding rate of malignant ulcers is 40%, and the rebleeding rate within 30 days is 30%. Until now, there is no strongly recommended therapy for malignant bleeding in treatment guidelines.

If bleeding cannot be controlled through endoscopy, options such as transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) or surgical intervention should be considered. Although TAE has higher rebleeding rates compared with surgery, it is associated with significantly lower complication risks, shorter hospital stays, and no difference in mortality. Hence, TAE is the preferred salvage therapy for patients with failed endoscopic therapy, while surgery is considered when TAE is unavailable locally or after failed TAE attempts.

### Prevalence and patterns of peptic ulcer disease in Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115iXDud]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis reveals a significant burden of PUD and H. pylori infection in Africa, along with notable regional variations and a persistently high prevalence over the past two decades among patients undergoing endoscopic examination. These findings emphasize the importance of implementing effective screening and treatment strategies for PUD. Given this substantial burden, future research should focus on understanding the prevalence of both symptomatic and asymptomatic PUD in the general population, identifying risk factors (including H. pylori and other contributors), and gathering sex-specific data to explore potential differences in PUD prevalence, patterns, and treatment outcomes between males and females. Such efforts will be crucial to inform public health strategies and clinical practices aimed at reducing the PUD burden and improving patient management in African healthcare settings.

### Perforated peptic ulcers in children: a systematic review [^115rPQpx]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a relatively rare but clinically significant condition in the pediatric population, characterized by mucosal injury of the stomach or duodenum resulting from an imbalance between aggressive luminal factors and mucosal defense mechanisms. Although peptic ulcers are more commonly diagnosed in adults, their incidence in children has increased over recent decades, largely due to improved access to endoscopic procedures.

Pediatric peptic ulcers are classified as primary, most often associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, or secondary, typically resulting from physiological stress, systemic illness, or the use of medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Among the potential complications of PUD, perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) represents a rare but life-threatening surgical emergency in children, associated with significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized and managed promptly.

Children with PPU may initially present with non-specific symptoms of peptic ulcer disease; however, the onset of acute abdominal pain, peritoneal signs, and a systemic inflammatory response usually indicates perforation. The diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion and radiological imaging — most commonly plain radiographs demonstrating pneumoperitoneum — and is confirmed by computed tomography (CT) in equivocal cases. Surgical repair, typically performed via primary closure with an omental patch (Graham patch), remains the standard treatment, with laparoscopic approaches being increasingly utilized.

PPU in the pediatric population is infrequently reported in the literature, with most available data derived from isolated case reports, small case series, or retrospective studies with limited sample sizes. To date, no systematic review has synthesized the available evidence regarding the presentation, management strategies, and outcomes of PPU in children. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to summarize the current literature on PPU in the pediatric population, with a particular focus on epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic modalities, treatment approaches, and patient outcomes.

### Prompt upper endoscopy is an appropriate initial management in uninvestigated Chinese patients with typical reflux symptoms [^112DnSY2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to investigate the prevalence of clinically significant endoscopic findings (CSEFs) in Chinese patients presenting with uninvestigated typical reflux symptoms in the absence of alarm symptoms, and to evaluate whether prompt endoscopy is an appropriate initial management in these patients.

Methods

Consecutive patients presenting with uninvestigated typical reflux symptoms (i.e., heartburn or acid regurgitation) as chief complaints were recruited for symptom evaluation and upper endoscopy, followed by a 2-week proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.

Results

Of 469 patients recruited, CSEFs were observed in 180 (38.4%): 154 (32.8%) with erosive esophagitis (EE), 18 (3.8%) with Barrett's esophagus (BE), 24 (5.1%) with peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and 4 (0.9%) with carcinomas (1 esophageal carcinoma and 3 gastric adenocarcinomas). Multivariate analysis identified that an age > 50 years (odds ratio (OR) = 1.94, P = 0.008), male gender (OR = 4.11, P < 0.001), being overweight or obese (OR = 2.99, P < 0.001), and alcohol use (OR = 9.96, P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for EE; an age > 50 years (OR = 4.61, P = 0.003) and alcohol use (OR = 5.50, P = 0.003) were independent risk factors for BE; and Helicobacter pylori infection (OR = 8.52, P < 0.001) and alcohol use (OR = 4.08, P = 0.004) were independent risk factors for PUD. Symptom evaluation and response to PPI treatment were not correlated with EE, BE, and PUD in these patients.

Conclusions

CSEFs other than gastroesophageal reflux disease are present in a considerable proportion of Chinese patients with uninvestigated typical reflux symptoms but without alarm features. Symptom evaluation is of limited practical value, and thus prompt endoscopy seems to be an appropriate initial management option in these patients.

### The diagnostic value of endoscopy and Helicobacter pylori tests for peptic ulcer patients in late post-treatment setting [^114BsFYe]. BMC Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Discussion

Proper diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with dyspeptic syndrome after H. pylori eradication therapy is of utmost importance for physicians as well for patients. Several studies have demonstrated the reliability of H. pylori tests used before treatment, while post-treatment testing is not yet adequately studied. However, in the case of long-lasting recurrent dyspepsia after H. pylori eradication therapy, endoscopy has been strongly recommended. Our study shows that endoscopy gives useful information for the general practitioner both in the cases where peptic ulcer is found and in the cases where it is not found. In the case of a normal endoscopic finding, further management depends on the histological finding and on H. pylori status. Since persistent H. pylori positivity is always associated with possible peptic ulcer recurrence, the second line treatment according to bacterial susceptibility should be recommended. In the remaining cases where H. pylori is absent, the gastric mucosa is normal and no ulcer is detected, management of such patients should be aimed at establishment of other possible reasons for their complaints. Usually, a normal endoscopic finding reassures both the doctor and the patient.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^112AFrTY]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for peptic ulcer disease, more specifically with respect to laboratory testing (bleeding ulcer), WSES 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain blood-typing, hemoglobin, hematocrit and electrolytes, and coagulation assessment in patients with suspected bleeding peptic ulcer.

### Endoscopic therapy for severe ulcer bleeding [^114wbh9N]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding secondary to ulcer disease occurs commonly and results in significant patient morbidity and medical expense. After initial resuscitation, carefully performed endoscopy provides an accurate diagnosis of the source of the UGI hemorrhage and can reliably identify those high-risk subgroups that may benefit most from endoscopic hemostasis. Effective endoscopic hemostasis of ulcer bleeding can significantly improve outcomes by reducing rebleeding, transfusion requirement, and need for surgery, as well as reduce the cost of medical care. This article discusses the important aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of bleeding from ulcers, with a focus on endoscopic therapy.

### Peptic ulcer disease [^111ex93y]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The rapidly declining prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection and widespread use of potent anti-secretory drugs means peptic ulcer disease has become substantially less prevalent than it was two decades ago. Management has, however, become more challenging than ever because of the threat of increasing antimicrobial resistance worldwide and widespread use of complex anti-thrombotic therapy in the ageing population. Peptic ulcers not associated with H pylori infection or the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are now also imposing substantial diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This Seminar aims to provide a balanced overview of the latest advances in the pathogenetic mechanisms of peptic ulcers, guidelines on therapies targeting H pylori infection, approaches to treatment of peptic ulcer complications associated with anti-inflammatory analgesics and anti-thrombotic agents, and the unmet needs in terms of our knowledge and management of this increasingly challenging condition.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^1153YUtx]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

No evidence is available regarding the impact on clinical outcome of time before surgery for bleeding peptic ulcer. We suggest immediate surgery for unstable patients with bleeding peptic ulcer refractory to endoscopy/angioembolization.

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, what is the most appropriate surgical approach (open vs laparoscopy) and what are the most appropriate surgical procedures?

In patients with refractory bleeding peptic ulcer, we suggest surgical intervention with open surgery (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidences, 2D).

In patients operated for bleeding peptic ulcer, we suggest intra-operative endoscopy to facilitate the localization of the bleeding site (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidences, 2D).

We suggest choosing the surgical procedure according to the location and extension of the ulcer and the characteristics of the bleeding vessel (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 2C)

peptic ulcerListen to pronunciationA break in the lining of the lower part of the esophagus, the stomach, or the upper part of the small intestine. Peptic ulcers form when cells on the surface of the lining become inflamed and die. They are usually caused by Helicobacter pylori bacteria and by certain medicines, such as aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Peptic ulcers may be linked to cancer and other diseases.
