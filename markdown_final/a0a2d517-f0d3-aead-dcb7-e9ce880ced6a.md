## Question

Canagliflozon (ivokana) 100mg disp: 30 sig: take one tablet by mouth once daily before breakfast. Dispense 30tablets. 2 refills. For this patient. Correct?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a prescription for canagliflozin (Invokana) 100 mg, once daily before breakfast, with 30 tablets dispensed and 2 refills, is appropriate and correctly written. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug name and dose accuracy. Then, I should verify the indication and whether 100 mg is an appropriate starting dose. Next, I will check administration timing and whether "before breakfast" aligns with labeling. After that, I need to review quantity, refills, and whether any renal function caveats apply. Finally, I will consider safety counseling and documentation elements that should accompany the prescription to ensure it is complete and safe.

> Let me first confirm the medication identity and dose. The brand name is Invokana, and the active ingredient is canagliflozin; 100 mg is an available tablet strength and is the standard starting dose for glycemic control, with a maintenance range of 100–300 mg once daily, so 100 mg is appropriate to initiate therapy [^116aojpD] [^112qii7i].

> Wait, let me verify the indication context. For adults with type 2 diabetes, the labeled starting dose is 100 mg once daily, with potential titration to 300 mg if additional glycemic lowering is needed and tolerated; this applies whether the goal is glycemic control, cardiovascular risk reduction, or heart failure risk reduction, so 100 mg daily is a correct starting point in the absence of contraindications or interacting drugs [^112qii7i] [^11235bLr] [^113rBjpP].

> I should confirm administration timing. The FDA labeling recommends taking Invokana before the first meal of the day to leverage potential attenuation of postprandial glucose excursions, so "take one tablet by mouth once daily before breakfast" is consistent with labeled administration guidance [^111R2V2P].

> Hold on, I should verify renal function considerations because they can constrain dosing. In patients with eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m², the maximum recommended dose is 100 mg daily, and use is not recommended when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; therefore, 100 mg daily is appropriate if renal function is preserved or mildly impaired, but I need to ensure renal function was assessed before prescribing and that the label's cautions are observed [^115VvanX] [^116cYLsb] [^116zxtLx].

> Let me consider quantity and refills. Dispensing 30 tablets with 2 refills is reasonable for a 30-day supply and aligns with common outpatient practice; however, I should confirm that the patient has been counseled on adherence, missed-dose handling, and safety monitoring, and that follow-up for renal function and volume status is planned, especially in older adults or those on diuretics [^117FK3zZ] [^117FK3zZ] [^113tofgi].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "before breakfast" might be mandatory, but I should double-check. The label says Invokana may be taken with or without food, yet recommends administration before the first meal to optimize postprandial effects; thus, "before breakfast" is preferred but not strictly required, and the prescription as written is acceptable [^111R2V2P].

> Next, I should review safety counseling that should accompany the prescription. Patients should be educated about genital mycotic infections, volume depletion, rare but serious events like Fournier's gangrene and lower-extremity amputation risk, and the possibility of euglycemic ketoacidosis; they should also be told to withhold therapy around surgery or prolonged fasting and to monitor for signs of ketoacidosis, with ketone checks considered in high-risk scenarios [^113LbSti] [^117FK3zZ] [^115KxZU8].

> I will now examine drug–drug interactions that could alter dosing. Strong UGT inducers such as rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or ritonavir can reduce canagliflozin exposure; if a patient is on these agents, the dose may need to be increased to 200 mg daily if already on 100 mg, with further titration based on response and tolerability, so I should confirm concomitant medications before finalizing the script [^117FK3zZ] [^115VvanX].

> But wait, what if the patient is older than 65 or has fall risk factors. I should confirm that in older adults, especially those 75 and over, the incidence of volume depletion and related adverse effects is higher, so starting at 100 mg and monitoring closely is prudent; guidelines also advise limiting to 100 mg in older adults due to volume-related adverse effects, reinforcing the appropriateness of the 100 mg starting dose in this context [^113tofgi] [^115kAGDZ].

> Putting this together, the prescription for canagliflozin 100 mg once daily before breakfast, with 30 tablets and 2 refills, is correct and consistent with FDA labeling, provided renal function is adequate and no interacting drugs are present; I should document baseline eGFR, counsel on safety, and arrange follow-up to reassess efficacy, renal function, and tolerability before any dose escalation [^112qii7i] [^111R2V2P] [^113LbSti].

---

The prescription is **correct** for canagliflozin 100 mg once daily before breakfast, with 30 tablets and 2 refills, provided the patient has **eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** [^115VvanX] and no contraindications. If **eGFR is 30–59**, limit to 100 mg daily; if **eGFR < 30**, do not initiate [^116cYLsb]. Counsel on genital infections, volume depletion, and ketoacidosis risk [^113LbSti], and monitor renal function and volume status after initiation [^111QH2BG].

---

## Dosage and administration

- **Standard dose**: 100 mg once daily [^112qii7i].
- **Timing**: before the first meal of the day (before breakfast) [^111R2V2P].
- **Titration**: may increase to 300 mg daily if additional glycemic control is needed and tolerated [^11235bLr].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the prescribed dose

Clinical trials show that 100 mg daily improves **HbA1c**, fasting glucose, and body weight, with additional benefit at 300 mg in some patients [^11395Nzw] [^115Ep8j8]. The **CANVAS program** demonstrated cardiovascular and renal benefits at 100–300 mg daily [^114fPMsX] [^113C3Yu2].

---

## Renal function considerations

- **eGFR ≥ 60**: no dose adjustment needed [^116zxtLx].
- **eGFR 30–59**: maximum 100 mg daily [^115VvanX].
- **eGFR < 30**: do not initiate [^116cYLsb].

---

## Safety profile and patient counseling

Common adverse effects include **genital mycotic infections**, urinary tract infections, and volume depletion [^115TPh9b] [^117FK3zZ]. Rare but serious risks include **euglycemic ketoacidosis** and lower-limb amputation; counsel patients accordingly [^113LbSti] [^117FK3zZ].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor **renal function and electrolytes** periodically, especially in patients with eGFR 30–59 or those on diuretics [^111QH2BG]. Assess for **volume depletion**, hypotension, and genital infections at follow-up visits [^113LbSti].

---

## Summary of prescription appropriateness

| **Aspect** | **Prescription details** | **Clinical appropriateness** |
|-|-|-|
| Medication | Canagliflozin (Invokana) | Appropriate for T2DM |
| Dose | 100 mg once daily | Standard starting dose |
| Timing | Before breakfast | Aligned with labeling |
| Quantity | 30 tablets | 30-day supply |
| Refills | 2 | Standard for chronic therapy |
| Renal function | Assumed eGFR ≥ 30 | Required before initiation |
| Counseling | Not specified | Should include adverse effects and risks |

---

The prescription is **appropriate** if renal function is adequate and no contraindications are present. Confirm **eGFR**, provide counseling, and plan monitoring to ensure safe and effective use.

Laboratory Tests

Inform patients that due to its mechanism of action, patients taking INVOKANA will test positive for glucose in their urine [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Missed Dose

If a dose is missed, advise patients to take it as soon as it is remembered unless it is almost time for the next dose, in which case patients should skip the missed dose and take the medicine at the next regularly scheduled time. Advise patients not to take two doses of INVOKANA at the same time.

### Canagliflozin (Invokana) [^114fNyAd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing INVOKANA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days and some up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue INVOKANA, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting INVOKANA.

Withhold INVOKANA, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume INVOKANA when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue INVOKANA and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin is similar in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes. Following single-dose oral administration of 100 mg and 300 mg of INVOKANA, peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) of canagliflozin occurs within 1 to 2 hours post-dose. Plasma Cmaxand AUC of canagliflozin increased in a dose-proportional manner from 50 mg to 300 mg. The apparent terminal half-life (t1/2) was 10.6 hours and 13.1 hours for the 100 mg and 300 mg doses, respectively. Steady-state was reached after 4 to 5 days of once-daily dosing with canagliflozin 100 mg to 300 mg. Canagliflozin does not exhibit time-dependent pharmacokinetics and accumulated in plasma up to 36% following multiple doses of 100 mg and 300 mg.

Absorption

The mean absolute oral bioavailability of canagliflozin is approximately 65%. Co-administration of a high-fat meal with canagliflozin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin; therefore, INVOKANA may be taken with or without food. However, based on the potential to reduce postprandial plasma glucose excursions due to delayed intestinal glucose absorption, it is recommended that INVOKANA be taken before the first meal of the day [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Distribution

The mean steady-state volume of distribution of canagliflozin following a single intravenous infusion in healthy subjects was 83.5 L, suggesting extensive tissue distribution. Canagliflozin is extensively bound to proteins in plasma (99%), mainly to albumin. Protein binding is independent of canagliflozin plasma concentrations. Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

Metabolism

O -glucuronidation is the major metabolic elimination pathway for canagliflozin, which is mainly glucuronidated by UGT1A9 and UGT2B4 to two inactive O -glucuronide metabolites.

CYP3A4-mediated (oxidative) metabolism of canagliflozin is minimal (approximately 7%) in humans.

14.3 Cardiovascular Outcomes in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease

The CANVAS and CANVAS-R trials were multicenter, multi-national, randomized, double-blind parallel group, with similar inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients eligible for enrollment in both CANVAS and CANVAS-R trials were: 30 years of age or older and had established, stable, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, peripheral artery disease (66% of the enrolled population) or were 50 years of age or older and had two or more other specified risk factors for cardiovascular disease (34% of the enrolled population).

The integrated analysis of the CANVAS and CANVAS-R trials compared the risk of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event (MACE) between canagliflozin and placebo when these were added to and used concomitantly with standard of care treatments for diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The primary endpoint, MACE, was the time to first occurrence of a three-part composite outcome which included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke.

In CANVAS, patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, or matching placebo. In CANVAS-R, patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to canagliflozin 100 mg or matching placebo, and titration to 300 mg was permitted at the investigator's discretion (based on tolerability and glycemic needs) after Week 13. Concomitant antidiabetic and atherosclerotic therapies could be adjusted, at the discretion of investigators, to ensure participants were treated according to the standard care for these diseases.

### Canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (Invokamet) [^1171cxJq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INVOKAMET XR

After administration of INVOKAMET XR tablets with a high-fat breakfast, the peak (Cmax) and total (AUC) exposure of canagliflozin were not altered relative to dosing in the fasted state. However, the AUC of metformin increased by approximately 61% and Cmaxincreased by approximately 13%.

Canagliflozin

The pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin is essentially similar in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes. Following single-dose oral administration of 100 mg and 300 mg of canagliflozin, peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) of canagliflozin occurs within 1 to 2 hours post-dose. Plasma Cmaxand AUC of canagliflozin increased in a dose-proportional manner from 50 mg to 300 mg. The apparent terminal half-life (t1/2) was 10.6 hours and 13.1 hours for the 100 mg and 300 mg doses, respectively. Steady-state was reached after 4 to 5 days of once-daily dosing with canagliflozin 100 mg to 300 mg. Canagliflozin does not exhibit time-dependent pharmacokinetics and accumulated in plasma up to 36% following multiple doses of 100 mg and 300 mg. The mean systemic exposure (AUC) at steady state was similar following once daily and twice daily dosing regimens at the same total daily dose of 100 mg or 300 mg.

Absorption

Canagliflozin

The mean absolute oral bioavailability of canagliflozin is approximately 65%.

Metformin HCl

The absolute bioavailability of a metformin HCl 500 mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50% to 60%. Trials using single oral doses of metformin HCl 500 to 1,500 mg, and 850 to 2,550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination.

Following a single oral dose of 1,000 mg metformin HCl extended-release tablets (two 500 mg tablets) after a meal, the time to reach maximum plasma metformin concentration (Tmax) is achieved at approximately 7–8 hours. In both single and multiple-dose trials in healthy subjects, once daily 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets) dosing results in up to 35% higher Cmax, of metformin relative to the immediate-release given as 500 mg twice daily without any change in overall systemic exposure, as measured by AUC.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of canagliflozin hemihydrate PO (also known as Invokana):
- **Acute pyelonephritis, urosepsis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of serious UTIs, including pyelonephritis and urosepsis.
- **Bone fracture**: use caution in patients with factors contributing to fracture risk, such as elderly age and osteoporosis.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: use caution in patients taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Consider reducing the insulin or insulin secretagogue dose.
- **Decreased serum canagliflozin levels**: use caution in patients taking concomitant UGT enzyme inducers (such as rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or ritonavir). Increase canagliflozin dose to 200 mg/day in patients currently taking 100 mg, and to 300 mg in those taking 200 mg/day.
- **Diabetic ketoacidosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibors have been associated with an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, especially in patients with pancreatic disorders, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, recent surgery, reduced insulin dose, volume depletion, or excessive alcohol use. Consider obtaining ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis as indicated. Assess for ketoacidosis in patients presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis, regardless of blood glucose levels. Withhold canagliflozin at least 3 days, if possible, before major surgery or procedures associated with prolonged fasting. Resume once clinically stable and after oral intake has resumed.
- **Fournier's gangrene**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibors have been associated with an increased risk of Fournier's gangrene.
- **Lower extremity amputation**: use extreme caution in patients with a history of prior amputation, PAD, or neuropathy. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection, new pain or tenderness, sores or ulcers involving the lower limbs. Discontinue if symptoms develop.
- **Reactivation of genital mycotic infections**: use caution in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections and in uncircumcised males.
- **Volume depletion**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of volume depletion, especially in patients with renal impairment, taking loop diuretics, or advanced age. Assess and correct volume status before initiating canagliflozin. Monitor for volume depletion throughout treatment.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis

Inform patients that INVOKANA can cause potentially fatal ketoacidosis and that type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are risk factors.

Educate all patients on precipitating factors (such as insulin dose reduction or missed doses, infection, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, dehydration, and alcohol abuse) and symptoms of ketoacidosis (including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and labored breathing). Inform patients that blood glucose may be normal even in the presence of ketoacidosis.

Advise patients that they may be asked to monitor ketones. If symptoms of ketoacidosis occur, instruct patients to discontinue INVOKANA and seek medical attention immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Lower Limb Amputation

Inform patients that INVOKANA is associated with an increased risk of amputations. Counsel patients about the importance of routine preventative foot care. Instruct patients to monitor for new pain or tenderness, sores or ulcers, or infections involving the leg or foot and to seek medical advice immediately if such signs or symptoms develop [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Volume Depletion

Inform patients that symptomatic hypotension may occur with INVOKANA and advise them to contact their doctor if they experience such symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Inform patients that dehydration may increase the risk for hypotension, and to have adequate fluid intake.

Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues

Inform patients that hypoglycemia has been reported when INVOKANA is used with insulin or insulin secretagogues. Educate patients or caregivers on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Serious Urinary Tract Infections

Inform patients of the potential for urinary tract infections, which may be serious. Provide them with information on the symptoms of urinary tract infections. Advise them to seek medical advice if such symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Canagliflozin

The data in Table 3 are derived from four 26-week placebo-controlled trials where canagliflozin was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add-on therapy in three trials. These data reflect exposure of 1,667 adult patients to canagliflozin and a mean duration of exposure to canagliflozin of 24 weeks with 1,275 patients exposed to a combination of canagliflozin and metformin HCl. Patients received canagliflozin 100 mg (N = 833), canagliflozin 300 mg (N = 834) or placebo (N = 646) once daily. The mean daily dose of metformin HCl was 2,138 mg (SD 337.3) for the 1,275 patients in the three placebo-controlled metformin HCl add-on trials. The mean age of the population was 56 years and 2% were older than 75 years of age. Fifty percent (50%) of the population was male and 72% were White, 12% were Asian, and 5% were Black or African American. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 7.3 years, had a mean HbA1Cof 8.0% and 20% had established microvascular complications of diabetes. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired (mean eGFR 88 mL/min/1.73 m2).

Table 3 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of canagliflozin. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on canagliflozin than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with either canagliflozin 100 mg or canagliflozin 300 mg.

Abdominal pain was also more commonly reported in patients taking canagliflozin 100 mg (1.8%), 300 mg (1.7%) than in patients taking placebo (0.8%).

Canagliflozin and Metformin HCl

The incidence and type of adverse reactions in the three 26-week placebo-controlled metformin HCl tablets add-on trials in adults, representing a majority of data from the four 26-week placebo-controlled trials, was similar to the adverse reactions described in Table 3. There were no additional adverse reactions identified in the pooling of these three placebo-controlled trials that included metformin HCl tablets relative to the four placebo-controlled trials.

In a trial in adults with canagliflozin as initial combination therapy with metformin HCl [see Clinical Studies (14.1)], an increased incidence of diarrhea was observed in the canagliflozin and metformin HCl combination groups (4.2%) compared to canagliflozin or metformin HCl monotherapy groups (1.7%).

Trials characterizing the pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin and metformin after administration of INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR were not conducted in patients with renal and hepatic impairment. Descriptions of the individual components in this patient population are described below.

Pediatric Patients

Canagliflozin

The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of canagliflozin were investigated in pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Oral administration of canagliflozin at 100 mg and 300 mg resulted in exposures and responses consistent with those found in adult patients.

Metformin HCl

After administration of a single oral metformin 500 mg immediate-release tablet with food, geometric mean metformin Cmaxand AUC differed less than 5% between pediatric type 2 diabetic patients (12–16 years of age) and gender-and weight-matched healthy adults (20–45 years of age), all with normal renal function.

Excretion

Following administration of a single oral [14C] canagliflozin dose to healthy subjects, 41.5%, 7.0%, and 3.2% of the administered radioactive dose was recovered in feces as canagliflozin, a hydroxylated metabolite, and an O -glucuronide metabolite, respectively. Enterohepatic circulation of canagliflozin was negligible.

Approximately 33% of the administered radioactive dose was excreted in urine, mainly as O -glucuronide metabolites (30.5%). Less than 1% of the dose was excreted as unchanged canagliflozin in urine. Renal clearance of canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg doses ranged from 1.30 to 1.55 mL/min.

Mean systemic clearance of canagliflozin was approximately 192 mL/min in healthy subjects following intravenous administration.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Canagliflozin

Following single and multiple oral doses of canagliflozin in adult patients with type 2 diabetes, dose-dependent decreases in RTGand increases in urinary glucose excretion were observed. From a starting RTGvalue of approximately 240 mg/dL, canagliflozin at 100 mg and 300 mg once daily suppressed RTGthroughout the 24-hour period. Data from single oral doses of canagliflozin in healthy volunteers indicate that, on average, the elevation in urinary glucose excretion approaches baseline by about 3 days for doses up to 300 mg once daily. Maximal suppression of mean RTGover the 24-hour period was seen with the 300 mg daily dose to approximately 70 to 90 mg/dL in patients with type 2 diabetes in Phase 1 trials. The reductions in RTGled to increases in mean UGE of approximately 100 g/day in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with either 100 mg or 300 mg of canagliflozin. The 24-h mean RTGat steady state was similar following once daily and twice daily dosing regimens at the same total daily dose of 100 mg or 300 mg. In patients with type 2 diabetes given 100 to 300 mg once daily over a 16-day dosing period, reductions in RTGand increases in urinary glucose excretion were observed over the dosing period. In this trial, plasma glucose declined in a dose-dependent fashion within the first day of dosing.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, 4-way crossover trial, 60 healthy adult subjects were administered a single oral dose of canagliflozin 300 mg, canagliflozin 1,200 mg (4 times the maximum recommended dose), moxifloxacin, and placebo. No meaningful changes in QTc interval were observed with either the recommended dose of 300 mg or the 1,200 mg dose.

INVOKAMET

Administration of INVOKAMET 150 mg/1,000 mg fixed-dose combination with food resulted in no change in overall exposure of canagliflozin. There was no change in metformin AUC; however, the mean peak plasma concentration of metformin was decreased by 16% when administered with food. A delayed time to peak plasma concentration was observed for both components (a delay of 2 hours for canagliflozin and 1 hour for metformin) under fed conditions. These changes are not likely to be clinically meaningful.

Specific Populations

Pediatric Patients

The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of canagliflozin were investigated in pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Oral administration of canagliflozin at 100 mg and 300 mg resulted in exposures and responses consistent with those found in adult patients.

Patients with Renal Impairment

A single-dose, open-label trial evaluated the pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin 200 mg in adult subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment (classified using the MDRD-eGFR formula) compared to healthy subjects.

Renal impairment did not affect the Cmaxof canagliflozin. Compared to healthy adult subjects (N = 3; eGFR greater than or equal to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2), plasma AUC of canagliflozin was increased by approximately 15%, 29%, and 53% in subjects with mild (N = 10), moderate (N = 9), and severe (N = 10) renal impairment, respectively, (eGFR 60 to less than 90, 30 to less than 60, and 15 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively), but was similar for ESKD (N = 8) subjects and healthy subjects.

Increases in canagliflozin AUC of this magnitude are not considered clinically relevant. The glucose lowering pharmacodynamic response to canagliflozin declines with increasing severity of renal impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Canagliflozin was negligibly removed by hemodialysis.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Relative to adult subjects with normal hepatic function, the geometric mean ratios for Cmaxand AUC∞of canagliflozin were 107% and 110%, respectively, in subjects with Child-Pugh class A (mild hepatic impairment) and 96% and 111%, respectively, in subjects with Child-Pugh class B (moderate hepatic impairment) following administration of a single 300 mg dose of canagliflozin.

These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in adult patients with Child-Pugh class C (severe) hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Pharmacokinetic Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI)/Weight, Gender and Race

Based on the population PK analysis with data collected from 1,526 adult subjects, age, body mass index (BMI)/weight, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Study design

This was a multicentre, open‐label extension study of eligible patients with T2DM who participated in the 16‐week, double‐blind, randomized phase IV study of canagliflozin as an add‐on to insulin. 21 After the 16‐week double‐blind period, all eligible patients received once‐daily oral canagliflozin (100 mg) before breakfast for a period of 36 weeks. Patients were visited every 4 weeks, and were followed for 2 weeks after the end of treatment (Figure S1).

The patients received insulin regimens that were consistent with those in the double‐blind period: premixed, intermediate‐acting, long‐acting, premixed plus rapid‐ or short‐acting, intermediate‐acting plus rapid‐ or short‐acting, or long‐acting plus rapid‐ or short‐acting. The daily insulin dose ranged from 8 to 60 units. The insulin type(s) used remained the same from the first day of treatment to the end of the 52‐week total treatment period. The insulin dose was fixed during the study period, except for a temporary increase or decrease if considered to be necessary by the investigator.

2.2 Compliance with Declaration of Helsinki and informed consent

This study was conducted in the spirit of the ethical principles grounded in the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with: (1) Japanese laws related to ensuring drug/medical device quality, efficacy and safety and (2) Japanese ministerial orders and related regulations on good post‐marketing surveillance practice and good clinical practice. The study was approved by the ethics committee/institutional review boards at all of the participating institutions (see Acknowledgements section). All patients provided written informed consent for participation in the extension study.

Methods

Study design

We conducted a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in Japanese patients with T2DM who had inadequate glycemic control despite insulin, diet and exercise therapies (Fig. 1). After a 4-week single-blind run-in period, eligible patients were randomized and administered placebo or 100 mg of canagliflozin once daily before breakfast for 16 weeks. Randomization was performed using a block allocation method (1:1, block sizes of 4 and 87 blocks).

Fig. 1
Study design. Asterisk accepted when the difference between daily doses of each insulin product and total insulin products were ± 10% of those on the first day of treatment

The patients received one of the insulin regimens as follows: premixed, intermediate-acting, long-acting, premixed plus rapid- or short-acting, intermediate-acting plus rapid- or short-acting, long-acting plus rapid- or short-acting. The daily dose of insulin ranged from 8 to 60 units. In principle, the insulin dose was fixed during the study period; however, the change within ± 10% of the total daily dose of insulin from the baseline was allowed in order to avoid or treat hypoglycemia or other concomitant illnesses.

Compliance with the declaration of Helsinki and informed consent

This study was conducted in the spirit of the ethical principles grounded in the declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with Japanese laws related to ensuring drug/medical device quality, efficacy, and safety and Japanese ministerial orders and related regulations on good post-marketing surveillance practice and good clinical practice. The study was approved by the ethics committee/instructional review boards at all of the participating institutions (see List of participating investigators under " Acknowledgements " section).

Canagliflozin

Canagliflozin (Invokana) was approved for use in people with T2D by the EMA and the FDA in 2013. In people with diabetes, canagliflozin induces additional weight loss of 2.5–4.0 kg. Canagliflozin has been trialed in a phase IIb study in overweight and obese subjects without T2D. Over a 12-week study, the authors reported a mean weight loss of 1.9 kg, 2.8 kg and 2.4 kg with the use of 50 mg, 100 mg or 300 mg respectively. Subsequently, a further trial investigated the co-administration of canagliflozin and phentermine in obese patients without T2D. Over 26 weeks, participants using canagliflozin lost 1.9 kg compared with 4.1 kg in those using phentermine and 7.3 kg in participants using both drugs.

Empagliflozin

Empagliflozin (Jardiance) was approved for the treatment of people with T2D by the EMA and the FDA in 2014. The use of empagliflozin in addition to metformin or sulphonylurea is associated with weight loss of 2.1–2.5 kg. We are not aware of any trial exploring the effect of empagliflozin on body weight in people without T2D at the time of writing.

Ertugliflozin

Ertugliflozin (Steglatro) is the most recent SGLT-2 inhibitor to come to the market, with approval for use in people with T2D received from the EMA in 2018 and the FDA in 2017. A weight loss of 2.7–3.7 kg over 52 weeks has been associated with its use in people with T2D. To our knowledge, at the time of writing there are no trials exploring weight loss in people without T2D.

Other SGLT-2 Inhibitors

One trial explored the use of the SGLT-2 inhibitors remogliflozin and sergliflozin compared with placebo controls in obese people without co-morbid diabetes over 8 weeks. The authors reported that in people using remogliflozin there was a 7.6 kg weight loss and 6.1 kg weight loss in those using sergliflozin compared with 5.1 kg weight loss in placebo controls.

The clinical trials reporting on the impact of SGLT-2 inhibitors for weight loss in people with or without T2D are presented in Table 3.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g., less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days and some up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR.

Withhold INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-Approved Patient Labeling (Medication Guide).

Lactic Acidosis

Explain the risks of lactic acidosis, its symptoms, and conditions that predispose to its development, as noted in Warnings and Precautions (5.1). Advise patients to discontinue INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR immediately and to promptly notify their health care provider if unexplained hyperventilation, myalgias, malaise, unusual somnolence or other nonspecific symptoms occur. Once a patient is stabilized on INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of metformin HCl, are unlikely to recur. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.

Counsel patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR.

Inform patients about importance of regular testing of renal function and hematological parameters while receiving INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR.

Instruct patients to inform their doctor that they are taking INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR prior to any surgical or radiological procedure, as temporary discontinuation of INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR may be required until renal function has been confirmed to be normal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis

Inform patients that INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR can cause potentially fatal ketoacidosis and that type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are risk factors.

Educate all patients on precipitating factors (such as insulin dose reduction or missed doses, infection, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, dehydration, and alcohol abuse) and symptoms of ketoacidosis (including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and labored breathing). Inform patients that blood glucose may be normal even in the presence of ketoacidosis.

Advise patients that they may be asked to monitor ketones. If symptoms of ketoacidosis occur, instruct patients to discontinue INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR and seek medical attention immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Canagliflozin (Invokana) [^111NLrrx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

11 DESCRIPTION

INVOKANA®(canagliflozin) contains canagliflozin, an inhibitor of SGLT2, the transporter responsible for reabsorbing the majority of glucose filtered by the kidney. Canagliflozin, the active ingredient of INVOKANA, is chemically known as (1 S)-1,5-anhydro-1-[3-[[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-thienyl]methyl]-4-methylphenyl]-D-glucitol hemihydrate and its molecular formula and weight are C24H25FO5S∙1/2 H2O and 453.53, respectively. The structural formula for canagliflozin is:

Canagliflozin is practically insoluble in aqueous media from pH 1.1 to 12.9.

INVOKANA is supplied as film-coated tablets for oral administration, containing 102 and 306 mg of canagliflozin in each tablet strength, corresponding to 100 mg and 300 mg of canagliflozin (anhydrous), respectively.

Inactive ingredients of the core tablet are croscarmellose sodium (E468), hydroxypropyl cellulose (E463), lactose anhydrous, magnesium stearate (E572), and microcrystalline cellulose (E460[i]). The magnesium stearate is vegetable-sourced. The tablets are finished with a commercially available film-coating consisting of the following excipients: iron oxide yellow (E172) (100 mg tablet only), macrogol/PEG3350 (E1521), polyvinyl alcohol (E1203) (partially hydrolyzed), talc (E553b), and titanium dioxide (E171).

2.2 Screening and run‐in

All potential participants completed a 2‐week, single‐blind, placebo run‐in period if screening criteria were met. If eligibility was confirmed, the participant was counselled about diet and exercise, trained in the recognition of hypoglycaemia, provided with materials for making self‐monitored blood glucose measurements and then provided with single‐blind placebo therapy. The primary purpose of the run‐in period was to exclude individuals who were unlikely to adhere to the long‐term treatment and follow‐up regimen required by the trial.

2.3 Randomization

Randomization was carried out centrally through an interactive web response system. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to canagliflozin or matching placebo on the basis of a computer‐generated randomization schedule that was prepared by the study sponsor using randomly permuted blocks.

2.4 Post‐randomization study treatment and control

Study treatment is provided in identical bottles for both canagliflozin and matching placebo. Canagliflozin was administered at an initial dose of 100 mg daily but, at week 13 (or any time thereafter), the dose of canagliflozin (or matching placebo) may be increased from 100 to 300 mg. Uptitration is encouraged if the participant requires additional glycaemic control (eg, if ≥ 50% of glucose measurements from fasting fingerstick readings exceeded 6 mmol/L [110 mg/dL] during the 2 weeks preceding) and there has been no hypoglycaemia, volume depletion or other adverse event that might preclude dose increase. Participants are instructed to take the study treatment once daily before the first meal of the day until completion of the study or premature treatment discontinuation. Participants and all study staff will be masked to individual treatment allocation until the completion of the study.

2.5 Background drug treatments

Use of SGLT2 inhibitors is precluded, but participants are otherwise free to use other background therapy for glycaemic management at the discretion of the responsible investigator, in line with applicable local guidelines. Likewise, the use of all other therapies, particularly for cardiovascular and renal risk factors, will be according to best practice throughout the course of the study, instituted according to local guidelines and policies.

8.5 Geriatric Use

INVOKAMET and INVOKAMET XR

Because renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating canagliflozin, metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and aging can be associated with reduced renal function, monitor renal function more frequently after initiating INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR in the elderly and then adjust dose based on renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4)].

Canagliflozin

In 13 clinical trials of canagliflozin, 2,294 patients 65 years and older, and 351 patients 75 years and older were exposed to canagliflozin. Of these patients, 1,534 patients 65 years and older and 196 patients 75 years and older were exposed to the combination of canagliflozin and metformin HCl [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients 65 years and older had a higher incidence of adverse reactions related to reduced intravascular volume with canagliflozin (such as hypotension, postural dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and dehydration), particularly with the 300 mg daily dose, compared to younger patients; a more prominent increase in the incidence was seen in patients who were 75 years and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Smaller reductions in HbA1Cwith canagliflozin relative to placebo were seen in older (65 years and older; -0.61% with canagliflozin 100 mg and -0.74% with canagliflozin 300 mg relative to placebo) compared to younger patients (-0.72% with canagliflozin 100 mg and -0.87% with canagliflozin 300 mg relative to placebo).

Metformin HCl

Controlled clinical trials of metformin HCl did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. The initial and maintenance dosing of metformin HCl should be conservative in patients with advanced age due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dose adjustment should be based on a careful assessment of renal function [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Addition of canagliflozin to insulin improves glycaemic control and reduces insulin dose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized controlled trial [^117JrHXG]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of canagliflozin in reducing the required insulin dose and the risk of hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study was conducted in patients with T2D treated with insulin. They were randomly assigned to the control (n = 17) and canagliflozin (n = 17, plus 100mg/day canagliflozin) groups. In both groups, a defined insulin dose adjustment protocol was applied to achieve the same level of glycaemic control. The change from baseline in daily insulin dose was significantly smaller in the canagliflozin group (3.9 units/day) than in the control group (13.4 units/day; P = 0.040). Low blood glucose index and predicted % of blood glucose (BG) < 70mg/dL, which are hypoglycaemia-related variables, worsened significantly in the control group but both remained unchanged in the canagliflozin group. The standard deviation for night-time BG levels improved significantly only in the canagliflozin group. Supplementation of insulin therapy with 100mg canagliflozin in patients with T2D reduced the required insulin dose and hypoglycaemic risk and flattened night-time glycaemic fluctuations while maintaining the same level of glycaemic control.

Is the trial valid?
What are the results?
Will the results help locally?

All articles were rated according to this checklist to determine those of desirable quality. Articles that achieved ratings of ≥ 6 were included in the present study. Based on our objective, we only qualified data which were already compared the effects of canagliflozin with placebo. Yet, some data were excluded as the effects of canagliflozin were compared to other anti-hyperglycemic agents. Moreover, we only focused on 100 and 300 mg prescription doses of canagliflozin, thus the data with other doses were excluded. Other exclusions were done due to the differences in displaying the methodologies and results. This process was mainly arranged by co-operation of the two authors and rarely the authors consulted with the statistical advisor. As show in flow chart (Fig. 1) only 12 qualified papers were considered for statistics data analysis of which only seven articles were included as the data synthesis (Table 1). The remaining papers were cited and discussed in the introduction and discussion sections. Statistical data analysis and interpretations were performed by Stata/SE 17.0 for Windows (Stata Corp LLC, College Station TX, USA) and Excel 2019 (Microsoft Corp. Redmond, WA, USA). The first author's name, date of publication, quality assessment rating of each study, sample size, study group assignments, treatment duration, dose of canagliflozin, type of treatment (canagliflozin/placebo), clinical outcomes (differences in HbA1c, blood pressure and Body Mass Index) were systematically recorded.

Pool of Placebo- and Active-Controlled Trials for Glycemic Control and Cardiovascular Outcomes

The occurrence of adverse reactions for canagliflozin was evaluated in adult patients participating in placebo- and active-controlled trials and in an integrated analysis of two cardiovascular trials, CANVAS and CANVAS-R.

The types and frequency of common adverse reactions observed in the pool of eight clinical trials (which reflect an exposure of 6,177 adult patients to canagliflozin) were consistent with those listed in Table 3. Percentages were weighted by trials. Trial weights were proportional to the harmonic mean of the three treatment sample sizes. In this pool, canagliflozin was also associated with the adverse reactions of fatigue (1.8%, 2.2%, and 2.0% with comparator, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively) and loss of strength or energy (i.e., asthenia) (0.6%, 0.7%, and 1.1% with comparator, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively).

In the pool of eight clinical trials, the incidence rate of pancreatitis (acute or chronic) was 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.1% receiving comparator, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively.

In the pool of eight clinical trials, hypersensitivity-related adverse reactions (including erythema, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema) was 3.0%, 3.8%, and 4.2% of adult patients receiving comparator, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. Five patients experienced serious adverse reactions of hypersensitivity with canagliflozin, which included 4 patients with urticaria and 1 patient with a diffuse rash and urticaria occurring within hours of exposure to canagliflozin. Among these patients, 2 patients discontinued canagliflozin. One patient with urticaria had recurrence when canagliflozin was re-initiated.

Photosensitivity-related adverse reactions (including photosensitivity reaction, polymorphic light eruption, and sunburn) occurred in 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.2% of patients receiving comparator, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively.

Other adverse reactions occurring more frequently on canagliflozin than on comparator were:

INVOKAMET(canagliflozin and metformin HCl immediate-release tablets) and INVOKAMETXR (canagliflozin and metformin HCl extended-release tablets) contain canagliflozin and metformin HCl.

Canagliflozin

Canagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2, the transporter responsible for reabsorbing the majority of glucose filtered by the kidney. Canagliflozin is chemically known as (1 S)-1,5-anhydro-1-[3-[[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-thienyl]methyl]-4-methylphenyl]-D-glucitol hemihydrate and its molecular formula and weight are C24H25FO5S•1/2 H2O and 453.53, respectively. The structural formula for canagliflozin is:

Canagliflozin is practically insoluble in aqueous media from pH 1.1 to 12.9.

Metformin HCl

Metformin HCl is a biguanide chemically known as 1,1-Dimethylbiguanide HCl and its molecular formula and weight are C4H11N5● HCl and 165.62, respectively. The structural formula for metformin HCl is:

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin compared with placebo in older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pooled analysis of clinical studies [^115z5gQ7]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

In each study, eligible patients who were on protocol-specified background diabetes treatment directly entered a 2-week, placebo run-in period; those not on protocol-specified background diabetes therapy entered an 8- to 12-week AHA adjustment/dose stabilisation period prior to the run-in period. Patients were to remain on their stable diabetes treatment regimen through the end of the double-blind treatment period. Randomisation to treatment group (canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg or placebo) was stratified to ensure adequate distribution of specific patient characteristics (eg, whether a patient entered the AHA adjustment/dose stabilisation period) across treatment groups. After randomisation, HbA 1c and FPG were masked to study centres unless pre-defined criteria for initiation of glycaemic rescue therapy based on HbA 1c or FPG values were met. Study databases were locked at the primary assessment time point (Week 26) and studies were unblinded by the sponsor for regulatory filing. Blinding was maintained for patients and study centre and local sponsor personnel throughout the double-blind treatment period.

Glycaemic rescue therapy was initiated during the double-blind treatment period for patients who met pre-specified criteria (in general, FPG > 15.0 mmol/L after Day 1 to Week 6, > 13.3 mmol/L after Week 6 to Week 12, and > 11.1 mmol/L after Week 12 to Week 26). The agent for rescue therapy in each study was selected to be complementary to the protocol-specified background AHA therapy.

The studies were conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that comply with the Declaration of Helsinki, and are consistent with Good Clinical Practices and applicable regulatory requirements. Approval was obtained from institutional review boards and independent ethics committees for participating centres (Additional file 1), and patients gave written informed consent prior to participation.

Canagliflozin

The mean steady-state volume of distribution of canagliflozin following a single intravenous infusion in healthy subjects was 83.5 L, suggesting extensive tissue distribution. Canagliflozin is extensively bound to proteins in plasma (99%), mainly to albumin. Protein binding is independent of canagliflozin plasma concentrations. Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

Metformin HCl

The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of metformin HCl 850 mg immediate-release tablets averaged 654 ± 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time.

Metabolism

Canagliflozin

O -glucuronidation is the major metabolic elimination pathway for canagliflozin, which is mainly glucuronidated by UGT1A9 and UGT2B4 to two inactive O -glucuronide metabolites. CYP3A4-mediated (oxidative) metabolism of canagliflozin is minimal (approximately 7%) in humans.

Metformin HCl

Intravenous single-dose trials in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) or biliary excretion.

Excretion

Canagliflozin

Following administration of a single oral [14C] canagliflozin dose to healthy subjects, 41.5%, 7.0%, and 3.2% of the administered radioactive dose was recovered in feces as canagliflozin, a hydroxylated metabolite, and an O -glucuronide metabolite, respectively. Enterohepatic circulation of canagliflozin was negligible.

Approximately 33% of the administered radioactive dose was excreted in urine, mainly as O -glucuronide metabolites (30.5%). Less than 1% of the dose was excreted as unchanged canagliflozin in urine. Renal clearance of canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg doses ranged from 1.30 to 1.55 mL/min.

Mean systemic clearance of canagliflozin was approximately 192 mL/min in healthy subjects following intravenous administration.

Metformin HCl

Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin versus glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin (CANTATA-SU): 52 week results from a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 non-inferiority trial [^11395Nzw]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve glycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes by enhancing urinary glucose excretion. We compared the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, with glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin.

Methods

We undertook this 52 week, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, phase 3 non-inferiority trial at 157 centres in 19 countries between Aug 28, 2009, and Dec 21, 2011. Patients aged 18–80 years with type 2 diabetes and glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 7.0–9.5% on stable metformin were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by computer-generated random sequence via an interactive voice or web response system to receive canagliflozin 100 mg or 300 mg, or glimepiride (up-titrated to 6 mg or 8 mg per day) orally once daily. Patients, study investigators, and local sponsor personnel were masked to treatment. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 52, with a non-inferiority margin of 0.3% for the comparison of each canagliflozin dose with glimepiride. If non-inferiority was shown, we assessed superiority on the basis of an upper bound of the 95% CI for the difference of each canagliflozin dose versus glimepiride of less than 0.0%. Analysis was done in a modified intention-to-treat population, including all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00968812.

Findings

1450 of 1452 randomised patients received at least one dose of glimepiride (n = 482), canagliflozin 100 mg (n = 483), or canagliflozin 300 mg (n = 485). For lowering of HbA1c at 52 weeks, canagliflozin 100 mg was non-inferior to glimepiride (least-squares mean difference -0.01% [95% CI -0.11 to 0.09]), and canagliflozin 300 mg was superior to glimepiride (-0.12% [-0.22 to -0.02]). 39 (8%) patients had serious adverse events in the glimepiride group versus 24 (5%) in the canagliflozin 100 mg group and 26 (5%) in the 300 mg group. In the canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg groups versus the glimepiride group, we recorded a greater number of genital mycotic infections (women: 26 [11%] and 34 [14%] vs five [2%]; men: 17 [7%] and 20 [8%] vs three [1%]), urinary tract infections (31 [6%] for both canagliflozin doses vs 22 [5%]), and osmotic diuresis-related events (pollakiuria: 12 [3%] for both doses vs one [< 1%]; polyuria: four [< 1%] for both doses vs two [< 1%]).

Interpretation

Canagliflozin provides greater HbA1c reduction than does glimepiride, and is well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving metformin. These findings support the use of canagliflozin as a viable treatment option for patients who do not achieve sufficient glycaemic control with metformin therapy.

### Canadian CAnagliflozin REgistry: effectiveness and safety of canagliflozin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Canadian clinical practice [^114Dw2vS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The primary data source was the patient's medical records. Patients who were willing to participate in the study signed a written informed consent form, confirming that they understood the procedures for data collection. Baseline data were collected at the study enrollment visit. As per study protocol, investigators reported diabetes‐related complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, CAD, stroke or PVD) but were not required to provide further description or detailed history for this observational, real‐world study.

The observational phase began at the time of CANA initiation and patients were followed for a maximum of 12 months. Data collection was performed during each visit at Months 3, 6 and 12 (± 45 days) or until the time of early withdrawal or termination. Measures of effectiveness (ie, glycemic control, body weight, body mass index [BMI], waist circumference), patient reported outcomes (PROs) as well as safety and other data were collected at baseline and during the observational phase. Only data available from routine clinical practice were collected. Treatment adherence was evaluated at Visits 2, 3 and 4 based on the percentage of prescribed pills missed in the last 14 days as reported by patients. All aspects of treatment decisions and clinical management of patients were in accordance with clinical practice and at the discretion of the treating physician. The protocol did not stipulate dose selection or changes in dose.

The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with Good Clinical Practices. Additionally, each site received institutional review board approval.

2.2 Effectiveness outcomes

The primary outcome of the study was an estimation of mean change in HbA1c from baseline at 6 and 12 months. For patients who discontinued CANA, only HbA1c values collected before discontinuation were included in the analyses. Patients who did not fill prescriptions for CANA were considered drop‐outs. Secondary outcomes included measures of glycaemic control (mean change in HbA1c from baseline at 3, 6 and 12 months stratified by baseline HbA1c), proportion of patients achieving reduction in HbA1c ≥ 0.5% and of those reaching HbA1c < 7%, anthropometric endpoints (observed values for weight, BMI and waist circumference), and a double composite endpoint (proportion of patients with both ≥ 0.5% reduction in HbA1c and weight loss ≥ 3%). An exploratory analysis was undertaken to determine the proportion of patients with all three parameters: reduction in A1C ≥ 0.5%, weight loss ≥ 3% and reduction in systolic BP ≥ 4 mm Hg.

Falls

In a pool of nine clinical trials in adults with mean duration of exposure to canagliflozin of 85 weeks, the proportion of patients who experienced falls was 1.3%, 1.5%, and 2.1% with comparator, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. The higher risk of falls for patients treated with canagliflozin was observed within the first few weeks of treatment.

Genital Mycotic Infections

In the pool of four placebo-controlled clinical trials in adults for glycemic control, female genital mycotic infections (e.g., vulvovaginal mycotic infection, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and vulvovaginitis) occurred in 2.8%, 10.6%, and 11.6% of females treated with placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections on canagliflozin. Female patients who developed genital mycotic infections on canagliflozin were more likely to experience recurrence and require treatment with oral or topical antifungal agents and anti-microbial agents. In females, discontinuation due to genital mycotic infections occurred in 0% and 0.7% of patients treated with placebo and canagliflozin, respectively.

In the pool of four placebo-controlled clinical trials in adults, male genital mycotic infections (e.g., candidal balanitis, balanoposthitis) occurred in 0.7%, 4.2%, and 3.8% of males treated with placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. Male genital mycotic infections occurred more commonly in uncircumcised males and in males with a prior history of balanitis or balanoposthitis. Male patients who developed genital mycotic infections on canagliflozin were more likely to experience recurrent infections (22% on canagliflozin versus none on placebo) and require treatment with oral or topical antifungal agents and anti-microbial agents than patients on comparators. In males, discontinuations due to genital mycotic infections occurred in 0% and 0.5% of patients treated with placebo and canagliflozin, respectively.

In the pooled analysis of 8 randomized trials in adults evaluating glycemic control, phimosis was reported in 0.3% of uncircumcised male patients treated with canagliflozin and 0.2% required circumcision to treat the phimosis.

### Canagliflozin compared with sitagliptin for patients with type 2 diabetes who do not have adequate glycemic control with metformin plus sulfonylurea: a 52-week randomized trial [^116ADycg]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

At week −2, all subjects received single-blind placebo capsules matching the double-blind study drug for once-daily administration. After the placebo run-in period, subjects were randomly assigned to receive oral doses of canagliflozin 300 mg or sitagliptin 100 mg once daily (1:1) using an Interactive Voice Response System/Interactive Web Response System. The computer-generated randomization schedule was prepared by the sponsor before the study, and randomization was balanced using permuted blocks with the following two stratification criteria: whether the prerandomization A1C was ≥ 9.0% (75 mmol/mol) and whether a subject underwent the frequently sampled mixed-meal tolerance test (FS-MMTT).

After randomization, A1C and FPG values and all glucose levels from the FS-MMTT were masked to the study centers, unless FPG/A1C values met specific study criteria for discontinuation; similarly, urine glucose results were not reported for urine dipsticks. Subjects, investigators, and local sponsor personnel remained blinded to treatment assignment and urine samples for glucosuria until all subjects completed the study (week 52 visit) and the final database was locked.

Subjects meeting prespecified glycemic criteria (FPG > 15.0 mmol/L [270 mg/dL] after day 1 to week 6, > 13.3 mmol/L [240 mg/dL] after week 6 to week 12, > 11.1 mmol/L [200 mg/dL] after week 12 to week 26, and A1C > 8.0% [64 mmol/mol] after week 26) were discontinued (no rescue therapy was implemented). Subjects with serum creatinine ≥ 133 µmol/L (men) or ≥ 124 µmol/L (women), eGFR < 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2, or with eGFR values that constituted contraindications to metformin use in the country of the investigational site (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in some countries) also were discontinued from the study.

The study was conducted in accordance with ethical principles that comply with the Declaration of Helsinki and is consistent with Good Clinical Practices and applicable regulatory requirements. Approval was obtained from Institutional Review Boards and independent Ethics Committees for participating centers. All participants provided written informed consent.

### Canagliflozin in conjunction with sulfonylurea maintains glycemic control and weight loss over 52 weeks: a randomized, controlled trial in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113WLjiM]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Our aim was to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, added to background sulfonylurea (SU) monotherapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Methods

The CANagliflozin cardioVascularAssessment Study (CANVAS) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes study that randomly assigned participants to receive placebo or canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg once daily in addition to routine therapy. CANVAS included a prespecified SU substudy of patients taking background doses of SU monotherapy; data from the primary efficacy evaluation at 18 weeks have been published previously. We performed a retrospective analysis of the SU substudy at 52 weeks to measure long-term efficacy and safety of canagliflozin used with an SU. The primary objective of the long-term extension was to assess the change from baseline to 52 weeks in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c).

Findings

A total of 215 patients were included in the 52-week extension study. Patients receiving both 100-mg and 300-mg doses of canagliflozin achieved a sustained reduction in HbA 1c relative to patients receiving placebo (-0.61% [95% CI, -0.941% to -0.282%] and -0.66% [95% CI, -0.993% to -0.332%], respectively), regardless of baseline HbA 1c, duration of diabetes, SU dose, estimated glomerular filtration rate, or body mass index. A sustained reduction in fasting plasma glucose was also found in both 100-mg and 300-mg groups, relative to the placebo group (-2.04 mmol/L [95% CI, -2.778 to -1.299 mmol/L] and -1.88 mmol/L [95% CI, -2.623 to -1.146 mmol/L], respectively). Weight was reduced significantly at 52 weeks in both 100-mg and 300-mg groups, relative to placebo (-1.9% [95% CI, -3.2% to -0.7%] and -2.0% [95% CI, -3.2% to -0.7%], respectively). Reduction in systolic blood pressure was also reported for both dose groups relative to the placebo group, but there was no clear difference in HDL-C, LDL-C, or triglyceride levels. Canagliflozin was generally well tolerated. While documented hypoglycemia occurred in 14% of patients on placebo, the frequency of hypoglycemia with the addition of canagliflozin was similar. There was an increased frequency of genital mycotic infections in both men (5.1%) and women (10.4%) in both canagliflozin groups combined, relative to the placebo group (0%), and their frequency increased in the higher-dose group. There was a slightly higher rate of renal impairment in those treated with canagliflozin versus placebo (2.1% vs 0%).

Implications

After 52 weeks, patients receiving canagliflozin added to background SU had sustained reductions in HbA 1c and fasting plasma glucose, without increasing hypoglycemia and body weight; safety findings were generally consistent with the known safety profile of the drug. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01032629.

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in combination with insulin: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1143gnqj]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Combination therapy with canagliflozin and insulin was investigated in a prescribed substudy of the canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS); however, it was not evaluated in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Since the usage profile of insulin therapy and pathologic features of Japanese patients differ from those of Caucasian patients, we determined the clinical benefit of such a combination therapy in Japanese patients.

Methods

Patients who had inadequate glycemic control despite insulin, diet and exercise therapies were randomized into placebo (n = 70) and canagliflozin 100 mg (n = 76) groups that were administered once daily in addition to their prior insulin therapy in this double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The primary endpoint was the change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels from the baseline to week 16.

Results

There was a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c levels from the baseline in the canagliflozin group (-0.97 ± 0.08%) compared with the placebo group (0.13 ± 0.08%) at week 16 [last observation carried forward (LOCF)]. The decrease in HbA1c levels in the canagliflozin group was independent of the insulin regimen (premixed, long-acting and long-acting plus rapid- or short-acting). Compared with the placebo group, canagliflozin significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose levels (-34.1 ± 4.8 vs -1.4 ± 5.0 mg/dL) and body weights (-2.13 ± 0.25 vs 0.24 ± 0.26%), and significantly increased HDL cholesterol (3.3 ± 1.0 vs -0.5 ± 1.0 mg/dL) and HOMA2- %B (10.15 ± 1.37 vs 0.88 ± 1.42%). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar between the two groups. The incidence and incidence per subject-year exposure of hypoglycemia (hypoglycemic symptoms and/or decreased blood glucose) were slightly higher in the canagliflozin group (40.0% and 7.97) than in the placebo group (29.6% and 4.51). However, hypoglycemic events in both groups were mild in severity and dose-reduction of insulin by < 10% from the baseline following hypoglycemic events decreased the incidence per subject-year exposure in the canagliflozin group. The incidence of hypoglycemia between the groups did not differ according to the insulin regimen.

Conclusion

Canagliflozin in combination with insulin was effective in improving glycemic control and reducing body weight and well tolerated by Japanese patients with T2DM. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02220920.

### Effects of canagliflozin on cardiovascular disease risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115YWgsj]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This review discusses the effects, efficacy, safety and limitations of canagliflozin on the HbA1c, BMI and SBP variations in T2DM patients. Canagliflozin is an approved synthetic sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGL2i) therapeutic medicinal for the treatment of patients with T2DM, in particular when its efficacy has been tested by the placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we discuss some available data to evaluate the effects of Canagliflozin at 100 and 300 mg doses on the HbA1c levels, BMI, and SBP, respectively.

Despite the effects of canagliflozin in controlling the blood sugar, this review suggests that the cumulative effect of this drug in patients with T2DM leads to a very small reduction in HbA1c of 0.01 compared to the placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with the baseline of 0.14% [at 95% Confidence Interval: 0.07–0.21: 19, 39]. Moreover, the reduction in the level of HbA1c with daily dose of 100 mg and 300 mg was 0.005 and 0.03, considerably. This indicates that although the reduction in HBA1c level among patients receiving canagliflozin has a minimal effect, the data on 300 mg doses appear to have a better effect on blood sugar control. Regarding the effect of canagliflozin on BMI, the data show a very small overall reduction of 0.005. Yet, the reduction in BMI with 100 mg dose reached to 0.01, but with 300 mg dose was close to that of placebo level, even though indicated a very slight increase of 0.02. Additionally, the data revealed that for the patients receiving 100 mg uptake, there was a minor significant reduction in SBP. Similar interpretations have also been suggested by previous studies.

### Canagliflozin, a novel SGLT2 inhibitor for treatment of type 2 diabetes [^114wb9t9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the available clinical data on canagliflozin and provide formulary considerations as to its place in the current treatment approach of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Data Sources

A systematic review of the literature in MEDLINE and Web of Science was performed through July 2013 using the key words and medical subject headings canagliflozin, JNJ-28431754, TA-7284, and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor. A manual search of references from reports of clinical trials or review articles was performed to identify additional relevant studies.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Citations eligible for inclusion were in vitro or in vivo evaluations of canagliflozin with no restrictions on patient population or indication used. Data related to the patient populations and outcomes of interest were extracted from each citation.

Data Synthesis

Five clinical trials (n = 2775 subjects) have been published evaluating canagliflozin in patients with T2DM. A single study evaluated canagliflozin monotherapy, while the others included various add-on therapies. Four studies included placebo groups with 2 others using sitagliptin as an active control. Compared with placebo (+0.14%), canagliflozin monotherapy at doses of 100 to 300 mg/d decreases hemoglobin A1c by -0.77% to -1.03% from baseline. Reductions in fasting plasma glucose, body weight, and systolic blood pressure were seen. Because of the increase in glucosuria with the drug, patients (especially females) are at increased risk of genital mycotic infections. The overall safety of canagliflozin (eg, cardiovascular, oncologic, pancreatic, bone) is also yet to be fully elucidated.

Conclusions

Canagliflozin is comparable to second-line oral medications in terms of effectiveness but has limitations in affordability and long-term safety data.

Endpoints and Assessments

The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 26. Secondary endpoints at week 26 included the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c < 7.0%, changes from baseline in FPG and systolic BP, and change from baseline in body weight. Additional exploratory endpoints at week 26 included the proportion of patients with HbA1c < 8.0% and HbA1c > 9.0%; change from baseline in diastolic BP; the proportion of patients with BP < 140/90 mmHg and BP < 130/80 mmHg; and change from baseline in fasting plasma lipids, including triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio and non‐HDL cholesterol.

Overall safety and tolerability were assessed using AE reports, safety laboratory tests and vital signs measurements. The incidence of documented hypoglycaemia [i.e. concurrent fingerstick or plasma glucose ≤ 3.9 mmol/l (≤ 70 mg/dl) with or without symptoms or severe episodes (i.e. requiring assistance from another person or resulting in seizure or loss of consciousness)] was also assessed. Patients were instructed to record information on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia, as well as associated SMBG measurements, if available, and routine fasting SMBG measurements in a diary card.

The primary hypothesis for the present study was that canagliflozin (pooled data for patients who remained on canagliflozin 100 mg and those who increased their canagliflozin dose to 300 mg) was superior to placebo in reducing HbA1c from baseline to week 26. Sample size was determined based on demonstrating the statistical superiority of canagliflozin in lowering HbA1c compared with placebo. A total of 86 patients per treatment group were estimated to be required to achieve 90% power, with an assumed group difference of 0.5% and an assumed standard deviation of 1.0% using a two‐sample, two‐sided t ‐test, with a type I error rate of 0.05.

Approximately 100 patients were planned for inclusion in each treatment group to enlarge the safety database with respect to adding canagliflozin treatment with metformin and sitagliptin.

### Rationale, design, and methods of the study of comparison of canagliflozin vs. teneligliptin against basic metabolic risks in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (CANTABILE study): protocol for a randomized, parallel-group comparison trial [^1128LdRZ]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group comparison study. It is an exploratory study to compare the influence of canagliflozin/teneligliptin treatment on the rate of improvement in metabolic risk factors after 24 weeks of treatment (Fig. 1). We define the metabolic risks as obesity, borderline-high blood pressure, and dyslipidemia. The cutoff values of each risk factor are to be determined according to the Japanese criteria for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. The qualifying patients are to be randomly assigned to canagliflozin or teneligliptin therapy (see section " Treatments "). A glycemic (HbA1c) goal is set as < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%). In principle, diet, exercise therapy, and cardiovascular medications ongoing prior to the study will continue without modification. The changes in body weight, blood pressure, and triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels will be evaluated after 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks of treatment.

Fig. 1
Study design. A total of 200 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (100 patients/group) will participate in this study. After the confirmation of eligibility by a central managing modality, the enrolled patients will be randomly assigned to canagliflozin or teneligliptin therapy. In the canagliflozin group, 100 mg canagliflozin will be orally administered once per day. In the teneligliptin group, 20 mg Teneligliptin will be orally administered once per day. If necessary, the teneligliptin dose can be increased to up to 40 mg per day

This study will be conducted at 38 institutions in Japan in compliance with both the articles of the Declaration of Helsinki (revised in October 2013) and the Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects established by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare in Japan. Independent ethics committees at each institute approved the study protocol. The registration period is from 1 October 2017 to 31 March 2019, and the research period is from 1 October 2017 to 30 September 2020. In accordance with the law for clinical research in Japan in April 2018, the protocol of this study underwent reexamination and was approved by the Nara Medical University Certified Review Board (approval number: nara0002).

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin, an inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, when used in conjunction with insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^1134ARik]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

There are limited data about the effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors when used with insulin. We report the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes using insulin.

Research Design and Methods

The CANagliflozin CardioVascular Assessment Study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that randomized participants to placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg, or canagliflozin 300 mg once daily, added to a range of therapies. The primary end point of this substudy was the change in HbA1c from baseline at 18 weeks among patients using insulin; 52-week effects were also examined.

Results

Individuals receiving insulin at baseline were randomized to receive placebo (n = 690), canagliflozin 100 mg (n = 692), or canagliflozin 300 mg (n = 690). These individuals were 66% male and had a median age of 63 years, mean HbA1c of 8.3% (67 mmol/mol), BMI of 33.1 kg/m(2), estimated glomerular filtration rate of 75 mL/min/1.73 m(2), fasting plasma glucose of 9.2 mmol/L, and a median daily insulin dose of 60 IU. Most individuals were using basal/bolus insulin. Reductions in HbA1c with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg versus placebo were -0.62% (95% CI -0.69, -0.54; -6.8 mmol/mol [95% CI -7.5, -5.9]; P < 0.001) and -0.73% (95% CI -0.81, -0.65; -8.0 mmol/mol [95% CI -8.9, -7.1]; P < 0.001) at 18 weeks and -0.58% (95% CI -0.68, -0.48; -6.3 mmol/mol [95% CI -7.4, -5.2]) and -0.73% (95% CI -0.83, -0.63; -8.0 mmol/mol [95% CI -9.1, -6.9]) at 52 weeks. There were significant falls in fasting plasma glucose, body weight, and blood pressure at both time points and there was a greater incidence of hypoglycemia, genital mycotic infections, and hypovolemia with both canagliflozin doses.

Conclusions

Canagliflozin added to insulin therapy improved glycemic control and decreased body weight. There was a greater frequency of several anticipated side effects, although few led to discontinuation of treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin by baseline HbA1c and known duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116HJUmG]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

Canagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, has demonstrated glycemic improvements across studies of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The impact of canagliflozin on HbA1c lowering was assessed by baseline HbA1c and known duration of T2DM.

Methods

This post hoc analysis pooled data from patients with T2DM enrolled in four 26-week, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies of canagliflozin (N = 2313). Change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26 was assessed in the overall population and in subgroups by baseline HbA1c (< 8.0%, 8.0%- < 9.0%, and ≥ 9.0%) and known duration of T2DM (< 5 years, 5- < 10 years, and ≥ 10 years).

Results

Relative to placebo, canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg provided greater HbA1c reductions in the overall population. Progressively larger placebo-subtracted reductions in HbA1c with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg were seen with increasing baseline HbA1c. HbA1c reductions were similar across subgroups based on known duration of T2DM. Both canagliflozin doses were generally well tolerated across subgroups, with a safety and tolerability profile consistent with that seen in Phase 3 studies.

Conclusions

Canagliflozin provided glycemic improvements in patients with T2DM across a range of baseline HbA1c and known duration of T2DM.

SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit — initiation and renal dose modifications — should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials, and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. For canagliflozin, dose modifications are: eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2: max dose 100 mg daily; and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is not recommended for glycemic control. For dapagliflozin, eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is not recommended for glycemic control; and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is contraindicated. For empagliflozin, eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is not recommended.

### Optimizing the analysis strategy for the CANVAS program: a prespecified plan for the integrated analyses of the CANVAS and CANVAS-R trials [^116Pfby4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

3.2

The CANVAS‐R study 3 is a second large prospective, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trial of patients with T2DM with a history or a high risk of cardiovascular events. CANVAS‐R was initiated after marketing authorization in the USA and in response to the FDA regulatory requirement for a "CANVAS‐like" study, the data from which could be combined with data from the ongoing CANVAS trial to address the specified post‐marketing safety requirements. Participants in CANVAS‐R have nearly identical inclusion criteria to those of CANVAS and have been assigned to once‐daily placebo or canagliflozin 100 mg (with optional uptitration to 300 mg) for a planned average of 2 years of follow‐up. The dosing strategy was selected to reflect the labelling instructions in many countries in which canagliflozin is approved. The separate primary objective of CANVAS‐R is attenuation of kidney disease progression, as evidenced by fewer transitions from normo‐ to micro‐ or macro‐, or micro‐ to macroalbuminuria. The secondary objectives defined in the original protocol were to determine corresponding effects on the regression of albuminuria, on estimated glomerular filtration rate and on albumin:creatinine ratio. To enable the study to meet the post‐marketing evaluation of cardiovascular safety in the integrated analysis of data across the CANVAS Program, the procedures for recording and managing serious adverse events and endpoint adjudication across the 2 trials are identical (Table 1), as are the participant characteristics (Table 2). This includes the use of a common independent and blinded Endpoint Adjudication Committee that operates to the same Charter that is used for CANVAS. CANVAS‐R completed randomization of 5812 individuals between January 2014 and May 2015 and median follow‐up is currently 1.7 years.

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin used in conjunction with sulfonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, controlled trial [^117MHUCZ]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The efficacy and safety of canagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, was evaluated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled on sulfonylurea monotherapy.

Methods

The CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes study that randomized participants to placebo or canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg once daily in addition to routine therapy. Participants in the CANVAS trial are men and women aged ≥ 30 years with T2DM and a history or high risk of cardiovascular disease, and inadequate glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] ≥ 7.0% and ≤ 10.5%) on current antihyperglycemic therapies. The primary objective of this prespecified substudy was to assess change from baseline to 18 weeks in HbA1c among patients on sulfonylurea monotherapy.

Results

Of the 4330 patients enrolled in CANVAS, 127 met the entry criteria for the sulfonylurea monotherapy substudy (placebo, n = 45; canagliflozin 100 mg, n = 42; canagliflozin 300 mg, n = 40). At 18 weeks, placebo-subtracted changes (95% confidence interval) in HbA1c were -0.74% (-1.15, -0.33; P < 0.001) and -0.83% (-1.24, -0.42; P < 0.001) with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg, respectively. Relative to placebo, canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg also decreased fasting plasma glucose (FPG; -2.1 mmol/L [-3.0, -1.2] and -2.7 mmol/L [-3.6, -1.7], respectively). Body weight was lower with canagliflozin 300 mg (-1.8% [-3.2, -0.4]; P = 0.014) but unchanged with canagliflozin 100 mg (-0.4% [-1.8, 1.0]; P = 0.557). Canagliflozin 300 mg increased hypoglycemia episodes compared to canagliflozin 100 mg and placebo (15%, 0%, and 4.4%, respectively). Adverse events (AEs) of male and female genital mycotic infections, pollakiuria, and thirst were more common with canagliflozin.

Conclusions

Canagliflozin added to ongoing sulfonylurea monotherapy produced improvements in HbA1c, FPG, and body weight, with an increased incidence of AEs consistent with the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibition.

### Canagliflozin improves glycaemic control over 28 days in subjects with type 2 diabetes not optimally controlled on insulin [^116YxhV8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Aim

Canagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that is being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 28-day study conducted at two sites, in 29 subjects with T2DM not optimally controlled on insulin and up to one oral antihyperglycaemic agent. Subjects were treated with canagliflozin 100 mg QD or 300 mg twice daily (BID) or placebo. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics and pharmacodynamic effects of canagliflozin were examined. Glucose malabsorption following a 75-g oral glucose challenge was also examined.

Results

Canagliflozin pharmacokinetics were dose-dependent, and the elimination half-life ranged from 12 to 15 h. After 28 days, the renal threshold for glucose excretion was reduced; urinary glucose excretion was increased; and A1C, fasting plasma glucose and body weight decreased in subjects administered canagliflozin (A1C reductions: 0.19% with placebo, 0.73% with 100 mg QD, 0.92% with 300 mg BID; body weight changes: 0.03 kg increase with placebo, 0.73 kg reduction with 100 mg QD, 1.19 kg reduction with 300 mg BID). Glucose malabsorption was not observed with canagliflozin treatment. There were no deaths, serious adverse events or severe hypoglycaemic episodes. The incidence of adverse events was similar across groups. There were no clinically meaningful changes in routine laboratory safety tests, vital signs or electrocardiograms.

Conclusion

In subjects receiving insulin and oral antihyperglycaemic therapy, canagliflozin was well tolerated without evidence for glucose malabsorption, had pharmacokinetic characteristics consistent with once-daily dosing, and improved glycaemic control.

### Canagliflozin, a novel inhibitor of sodium glucose co-transporter 2, dose dependently reduces calculated renal threshold for glucose excretion and increases urinary glucose excretion in healthy subjects [^113T44jR]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Canagliflozin, a potent, selective sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor in development for treatment of type 2 diabetes, lowers plasma glucose (PG) by lowering the renal threshold for glucose (RT(G)) and increasing urinary glucose excretion (UGE). An ascending single oral-dose phase 1 study investigated safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics of canagliflozin in healthy men (N = 63) randomized to receive canagliflozin (n = 48) or placebo (n = 15). Canagliflozin (10, 30, 100, 200, 400, 600 or 800 mg q.d. or 400 mg b.i.d.) was administered to eight cohorts (six subjects/cohort: canagliflozin; two subjects/cohort: placebo). Dose dependently, canagliflozin decreased calculated 24-h mean RT(G) with maximal reduction to approximately 60 mg/dl, and increased mean 24-h UGE. At doses > 200 mg administered before breakfast, canagliflozin reduced postprandial PG and serum insulin excursions at that meal. Canagliflozin was generally well tolerated; most adverse events were mild and no hypoglycaemia was reported. These results support further study of canagliflozin.

### Dose-ranging effects of canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, as add-on to metformin in subjects with type 2 diabetes [^115Ep8j8]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This dose-ranging trial demonstrates that canagliflozin, a novel oral antihyperglycemic agent, at all doses studied, significantly improved glycemic control without an increased occurrence of hypoglycemia in subjects with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control with metformin. The extent of improvement in A1C observed with canagliflozin is particularly notable given the mild baseline hyperglycemia in the subject population studied. Improvements in glycemic control, with reductions in A1C and FPG, were observed at 100 mg QD with further improvement seen up to a 300-mg QD dose, as well as modestly greater weight reduction at the top once-daily canagliflozin dose. Notable in this observation is the fact that UGE (ratio of U Glucose to U Creatinine) did not appear to be substantively greater at the 300-mg relative to the 100-mg QD doses, similar to observations in other studies of canagliflozin, suggesting that the higher dose may provide an additional mechanism of glucose lowering. Perhaps an effect in slowing the rate of glucose absorption after a meal (through inhibition of luminal SGLT1 in the proximal small intestine) as has been suggested at higher canagliflozin doses, including at 300 mg, may explain the tendency for greater effects with these higher doses. However, this mechanism remains speculative and is under active study. Whether 300 mg QD provides greater efficacy compared with 100 mg, as well as the mechanisms responsible for the greater efficacy, requires further dosage studies of canagliflozin.

### Patient preference for second-and third-line therapies in type 2 diabetes: a prespecified secondary endpoint of the triMaster study [^114c3mTL]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Patient preference is key for medication selection in chronic medical conditions, like type 2 diabetes, where there are many different drugs available. Patient preference balances potential efficacy with potential side effects. As both aspects of drug response can vary markedly between individuals this decision could be informed by the patient personally experiencing the alternative medications, as occurs in a crossover trial. In the TriMaster (NCT02653209, ISRCTN12039221), randomised double-blind, three-way crossover trial patients received three different second or third line once-daily type 2 diabetes glucose-lowering drugs (pioglitazone 30mg, sitagliptin 100mg, and canagliflozin 100mg). As part of a prespecified secondary endpoint we examined patients' drug preference after they had tried all 3 drugs. 448 participants were treated with all three drugs which overall showed similar glycaemic control (HbA1c on pioglitazone 59.5 sitagliptin 59.9, canagliflozin 60.5mmol/mol, p = 0.19). 115 patients (25%) preferred pioglitazone, 158 (35%) sitagliptin, 175 (38%) canagliflozin. The drug preferred by individual patients was associated with a lower HbA1c (mean 4.6 [95%CI 3.9, 5.3]mmol/mol lower vs. non-preferred) and fewer side effects (mean 0.50[0.35, 0.64] fewer side effects vs. non-preferred). Allocating therapy based on individually preferred drugs, rather than allocating all patients the overall most preferred drug (canagliflozin), would result in more patients achieving the lowest HbA1c for them (70% v 30%) and the fewest side effects (67% v 50%). When precision approaches do not predict a clear optimal therapy for an individual, allowing patients to try potential suitable medications before they choose long term therapy could be a practical alternative to optimising treatment for type 2 diabetes.

### Canagliflozin and heart failure in type 2 diabetes mellitus: results from the CANVAS program [^116vHXQX]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Randomization, Treatment, and Follow-Up

After a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, participants were randomized centrally through an interactive web response system using a computer-generated randomization schedule prepared by the study sponsor using randomly permuted blocks. Participants in CANVAS were assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to canagliflozin 300 mg, canagliflozin 100 mg, or matching placebo, and participants in CANVAS-R were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to canagliflozin or matching placebo, administered at an initial dose of 100 mg daily with optional uptitration to 300 mg from week 13. Participants and all study and sponsor staff were masked to individual treatment allocations until the completion of the study. Use of other background therapy for glycemic management, treatment of HF, and other risk factor control was according to best practices instituted in line with local guidelines.

Participants were followed after randomization in a face-to-face follow-up that was scheduled for 3 visits in the first year and at 6-month intervals thereafter, with alternating telephone follow-up between face-to-face assessments. Every follow-up included inquiry about primary and secondary outcome events and serious adverse events. Serum creatinine measurement with estimated glomerular filtration rate was performed at least every 26 weeks in both trials. Participants who prematurely discontinued study treatment continued scheduled follow-up wherever possible, with extensive efforts made to obtain full outcome data for all participants during the final follow-up window that spanned from November 2016 to February 2017.

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin when used in conjunction with incretin-mimetic therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113THyTw]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes enrolled in the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) who were on an incretin mimetic [dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist].

Methods

CANVAS is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that randomized participants to canagliflozin 100 or 300mg or placebo added to routine therapy. The present post hoc analysis assessed the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin 100 and 300mg compared with placebo in subsets of patients from CANVAS who were taking background DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists with or without other antihyperglycaemic agents at week18.

Results

Of the 4330 patients in CANVAS, 316 were taking DPP-4 inhibitors and 95 were taking GLP-1 receptor agonists. At 18weeks, canagliflozin 100 and 300mg provided larger placebo-subtracted reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors [-0.56% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.77, -0.35), and -0.75% (95% CI: -0.95, -0.54), respectively] and GLP-1 receptor agonists [-1.00% (95% CI: -1.35, -0.65), and -1.06% (95% CI: -1.43, -0.69), respectively]. Body weight and blood pressure (BP) reductions were seen with canagliflozin versus placebo in both subsets. Higher incidences of genital mycotic infections and osmotic diuresis-related adverse events (AEs) were seen with canagliflozin compared with placebo. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was numerically higher with canagliflozin versus placebo; nearly all events occurred in patients on background insulin or insulin secretagogues.

Conclusions

In patients on background incretin mimetics, canagliflozin improved HbA1c, body weight and BP, with an increased incidence of AEs related to SGLT2 inhibition.

### Initial combination therapy with canagliflozin plus metformin versus each component as monotherapy for drug-Naïve type 2 diabetes [^116AkZdv]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This study assessed the efficacy/safety of canagliflozin (CANA), a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, plus metformin extended-release (MET) initial therapy in drug-naïve type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

This 26-week, double-blind, phase 3 study randomized 1,186 patients to CANA 100 mg (CANA100)/MET, CANA 300 mg (CANA300)/MET, CANA100, CANA300, or MET. Primary end point was change in HbA(1c) at week 26 for combinations versus monotherapies. Secondary end points included noninferiority in HbA(1c) lowering with CANA monotherapy versus MET; changes in fasting plasma glucose, body weight, and blood pressure; and proportion of patients achieving HbA(1c) < 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol).

Results

From mean baseline HbA(1c) of 8.8% (73 mmol/mol), CANA100/MET and CANA300/MET significantly lowered HbA(1c) versus MET (median dose, 2,000 mg/day) by -1.77%, -1.78%, and -1.30% (-19.3, -19.5, and -14.2 mmol/mol; differences of -0.46% and -0.48% [-5.0 and -5.2 mmol/mol]; P = 0.001) and versus CANA100 and CANA300 by -1.37% and -1.42% (-15.0 and -15.5 mmol/mol; differences of -0.40% and -0.36% [-4.4 and -3.9 mmol/mol]; P = 0.001). CANA100 and CANA300 monotherapy met noninferiority for HbA(1c) lowering and had significantly more weight loss versus MET (-2.8, -3.7, and -1.9 kg [-3.0%, -3.9%, and -2.1%]; P = 0.016 and P = 0.002). Greater attainment of HbA(1c) < 7.0% (50%, 57%, and 43%) and significantly more weight loss (-3.2, -3.9, and -1.9 kg [-3.5%, -4.2%, and -2.1%]; P = 0.001) occurred with CANA100/MET and CANA300/MET versus MET. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) related to SGLT2 inhibition (genital mycotic infections, osmotic diuresis- and volume depletion-related AEs) was higher in the CANA arms (0.4–4.4%) versus MET (0–0.8%). AE-related discontinuation rates were 1.3–3.0% across groups. The incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.0–5.5% in the CANA arms and 4.6% with MET.

Conclusions

Initial therapy with CANA plus MET was more effective and generally well tolerated versus each monotherapy in drug-naïve type 2 diabetes. CANA monotherapy demonstrated noninferior HbA1c lowering versus MET.

### Rationale, design and baseline characteristics of the effect of canagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria in the Japanese population: the CANPIONE study [^113TTEun]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the effect of canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, on albuminuria and the decline of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in participants with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria.

Methods

The CANPIONE study is a multicentre, randomized, parallel-group and open-labelled study consisting of a unique 24-week preintervention period, during which the rate of eGFR decline before intervention is estimated, followed by a 52-week intervention and a 4-week washout period. Participants with a geometric mean urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) of 50 and higher and less than 300mg/g in two consecutive first-morning voids at two different time points, and an eGFR of 45ml/min/1.73m 2 or higher, are randomly assigned to receive canagliflozin 100mg daily or to continue guideline-recommended treatment, except for SGLT2 inhibitors. The first primary outcome is the change in UACR, and the second primary outcome is the change in eGFR slope.

Results

A total of 258 participants were screened and 98 were randomized at 21 sites in Japan from August 2018 to May 2021. The mean baseline age was 61.4years and 25.8% were female. The mean HbA1c was 7.9%, mean eGFR was 74.1ml/min/1.73m 2 and median UACR was 104.2mg/g.

Conclusions

The CANPIONE study will determine whether the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin can reduce albuminuria and slow eGFR decline in participants with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria.

### Rationale and design of a randomized trial to test the safety and non-inferiority of canagliflozin in patients with diabetes with chronic heart failure: the CANDLE trial [^113xuL7B]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Randomization and treatment

Eligible patients with the appropriately signed informed consent will be randomized to either the canagliflozin or glimepiride groups at a ratio of 1:1 using the minimization method with biased coin assignment balancing for age (< 65, ≥ 65 year), HbA1c level (< 6.5, ≥ 6.5%), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; < 40, ≥ 40%) at the time of screening. The trial is an open-label design, although the assessor(s) will be blinded to treatment randomization. The assessors will also be blinded to the primary end point, NT-proBNP level, by measurement at a central laboratory.

All participants receive the study drug for 24 weeks. Patients who are assigned to the canagliflozin group receive canagliflozin 100 mg once daily. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial reported small dose-dependent effects of empagliflozin (10 mg vs. 25 mg/day) on metabolic parameters. However, the two dose groups had similar hazard ratios for cardiovascular outcomes. Some studies on canagliflozin showed that 100 mg/day had sufficient effects on metabolic parameters, while 300 mg/day was slightly more effective. Importantly, only 100 mg/day is approved in Japan, and therefore the dose of canagliflozin is fixed at 100 mg/day in the canagliflozin group. Because of the possible risk of excess diuresis and subsequent dehydration by combined use of canagliflozin and diuretics, the dose of the diuretics may need to be reduced when necessary. Patients assigned to the glimepiride group are started at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 mg once or twice daily. According to the individual's glycemic control, the dose of glimepiride can be increased to 6.0 mg/day. For background therapy in both groups, participants who have been receiving any SGLT2 inhibitor other than canagliflozin need to discontinue it at the start of the washout period, for 4 weeks, prior to receiving the study drug, canagliflozin or glimepiride. While, participants who have been taking a sulfonylurea need to stop taking it in the canagliflozin group and need to change to glimepiride (if needed) in the glimepiride group at the initiation of the study drug (Additional file 1). Because of the possible risk of excess diuresis and subsequent dehydration by combined use of canagliflozin and diuretics, the dose of the diuretics may need to be reduced when necessary.

3.1 Demographic and baseline characteristics

A total of 538 patients were screened for the CanCARE study, of whom 527 patients were enrolled at 28 Canadian sites and were included in the final analysis set for effectiveness and safety. Eleven (2.0%) patients were excluded from analysis because they did not meet one or more of the eligibility criteria. The number of participants for whom HbA1c data were available within the required reporting window of ± 45 days was: baseline, 509; 3 months, 435; 6 months, 376 and 12 months, 321. Patient demographics are summarized in Table 1. Overall baseline demographic and disease characteristics were consistent with eligibility criteria and were representative of the Canadian T2DM patient population. 5

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of patients included in the study

Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.5%, with a mean T2DM duration of 9.8 years. Patients enrolled in the study were treated by community specialists (39.3%) or primary care practitioners (60.7%). At baseline, CANA treatment was initiated, either as monotherapy or as add‐on therapy to multiple AHAs, including one or more oral and injectable agents. With respect to dosing patterns, 83.1% (438/527) of patients received CANA 100 mg and 16.5% (87/527) received CANA 300 mg at study initiation. Two patients (0.7%) initially received CANA 200 mg. Among 351 participants who completed the 12‐month study, 58.2% were receiving CANA 100 mg and 41.5% were receiving CANA 300 mg. A total of 77% percent of patients who completed the study reported not missing a single dose of CANA throughout the duration of the study. A very low percentage of patients (~4%) received CANA as monotherapy from baseline through Months 6 and 12. At initiation, most patients (75.9%) received CANA in combination with two AHAs. The proportion of patients receiving CANA according to different AHA regimens at baseline, and at 6 and 12 month was: insulin, with or without an oral AHA (24.3%, 24.4% and 23.9%, respectively), metformin alone (19.7%, 18.6% and 19.8%, respectively), metformin and DPP‐4 inhibitors (17.1%, 16.5% and 16.0%, respectively), metformin and sulfonylureas (12.7%, 13.1%, and 13.9%, respectively) or metformin + sulfonylureas + DPP‐4 inhibitors (12.3%, 12.7%, and 16.0%, respectively).

### Patient preference for second-and third-line therapies in type 2 diabetes: a prespecified secondary endpoint of the triMaster study [^1165j2Nj]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Patient preference is very important for medication selection in chronic medical conditions, like type 2 diabetes, where there are many different drugs available. Patient preference balances potential efficacy with potential side effects. As both aspects of drug response can vary markedly between individuals, this decision could be informed by the patient personally experiencing the alternative medications, as occurs in a crossover trial. In the TriMaster (NCT02653209, ISRCTN12039221), randomized double-blind, three-way crossover trial patients received three different second- or third-line once-daily type 2 diabetes glucose-lowering drugs (pioglitazone 30mg, sitagliptin 100mg and canagliflozin 100mg). As part of a prespecified secondary endpoint, we examined patients' drug preference after they had tried all three drugs. In total, 448 participants were treated with all three drugs which overall showed similar glycemic control (HbA1c on pioglitazone 59.5 sitagliptin 59.9, canagliflozin 60.5mmolmol -1, P = 0.19). In total, 115 patients (25%) preferred pioglitazone, 158 patients (35%) sitagliptin and 175 patients (38%) canagliflozin. The drug preferred by individual patients was associated with a lower HbA1c (mean: 4.6; 95% CI: 3.9, 5.3) mmolmol -1 lower versus nonpreferred) and fewer side effects (mean: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.64) fewer side effects versus nonpreferred). Allocating therapy based on the individually preferred drugs, rather than allocating all patients the overall most preferred drug (canagliflozin), would result in more patients achieving the lowest HbA1c for them (70% versus 30%) and the fewest side effects (67% versus 50%). When precision approaches do not predict a clear optimal therapy for an individual, allowing patients to try potential suitable medications before they choose long-term therapy could be a practical alternative to optimizing treatment for type 2 diabetes.

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter inhibitors as adjunctive treatment to insulin in type 1 diabetes: a review of randomized controlled trials [^116Htccn]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

2.3 Canagliflozin

An 18‐week phase 2 RCT evaluated the effects of canagliflozin vs placebo as an adjunct to insulin therapy among 351 patients with T1D. 36 To mitigate the risk of hypoglycaemia, patients with A1C ≤ 8.0% and > 8.0% were recommended to reduce their basal insulin dose by 20% and 10%, respectively. During treatment, patients were instructed to adjust insulin dosing according to titration algorithms. At week 18, more patients achieved the primary end point (composite goal of A1C reduction ≥ 0.4% with no increase in body weight) with canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg vs placebo (36.9% and 41.4% vs 14.5%, respectively [P < .001]). Consistent with this result, canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg resulted in greater placebo‐subtracted reductions in A1C and body weight (Table 1). The addition of canagliflozin led to reductions in total daily insulin dose and basal/bolus doses (Table 2). Rates of overall hypoglycaemia were similar with canagliflozin or placebo, with a low incidence of severe hypoglycaemia (Table 3). However, canagliflozin was associated with an increased incidence of genital mycotic infections in women and urinary tract infections overall (Table 3). Patients receiving canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg also had higher rates of osmotic diuresis‐related AEs (7.7% and 9.4% vs 2.6% with placebo) and volume depletion‐related AEs (3.4% and 0.9% vs 0.0%). Treatment with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg was associated with an increased risk of ketone‐related AEs (5.1% and 9.4%, respectively, vs 0.0% with placebo), including DKA (Table 4).

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^115kAGDZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in older adults — SGLT2 inhibitors reduce HbA1c by ~0.8%, can reduce weight, and do not cause hypoglycemia; empagliflozin and canagliflozin have been shown to decrease major adverse cardiovascular events, heart failure, and the progression of CKD; these compounds cause an obligate increase in urine volume and an increase in urogenital candida infections, and because adverse effects related to volume depletion were more frequent in older patients treated with canagliflozin, recommendations limit the dosage to 100 mg/d in such patients.

### Canagliflozin compared with sitagliptin for patients with type 2 diabetes who do not have adequate glycemic control with metformin plus sulfonylurea: a 52-week randomized trial [^1126HprK]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses

The primary hypothesis for this study was that canagliflozin 300 mg was noninferior to sitagliptin 100 mg in reducing A1C from baseline to week 52. The primary analysis was based on the modified intent-to-treat population (all randomized subjects who received one or more doses of study drug) with a last observation carried forward approach to impute missing data at the end point. Assuming no difference between canagliflozin and sitagliptin in A1C-lowering efficacy and a common SD of 1.0% with respect to change in A1C, it was estimated that 234 subjects per treatment group would provide ∼90% power to demonstrate the noninferiority of canagliflozin compared with sitagliptin. In addition, per-protocol analysis (subjects completing the 52-week study and without protocol deviations that could impact efficacy assessment) was conducted to further support the noninferiority assessment. To provide 90% power for the per-protocol analysis, assuming a discontinuation rate of 35% over 52 weeks, the sample size was increased to 360 subjects per treatment group.

Safety analyses and the primary efficacy analysis were conducted using the modified intent-to-treat population. The last observation carried forward approach was used for the primary analysis of efficacy data. All statistical tests were interpreted at a two-sided significance level of 5%, and all CIs were interpreted at a two-sided confidence level of 95%. Primary and continuous secondary end points were assessed using an ANCOVA model, including treatment and stratification factors as fixed effects and the corresponding baseline value as a covariate. The least squares (LS) mean differences and two-sided 95% CIs were estimated for the comparisons of canagliflozin versus sitagliptin. Noninferiority of canagliflozin to sitagliptin was assessed based on a prespecified margin of 0.3% for the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the comparison in the primary last observation carried forward analysis. If noninferiority was demonstrated, then superiority was assessed, as determined by an upper bound of the 95% CI around the between-group difference (canagliflozin minus sitagliptin) of < 0.0%. A prespecified hierarchical testing sequence was implemented to strongly control overall type I error attributable to multiplicity; P values are reported for prespecified comparisons only.

INVOKAMET and INVOKAMET XR

No animal studies have been conducted with the combined products in INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR to evaluate carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility. The following data are based on findings in studies with canagliflozin and metformin HCl individually.

Canagliflozin

Carcinogenesis

Carcinogenicity was evaluated in 2-year studies conducted in CD1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. Canagliflozin did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice dosed at 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg (less than or equal to 14 times exposure from a 300 mg clinical dose).

Testicular Leydig cell tumors, considered secondary to increased luteinizing hormone (LH), increased significantly in male rats at all doses tested (10, 30, and 100 mg/kg). In a 12-week clinical trial, LH did not increase in males treated with canagliflozin.

Renal tubular adenoma and carcinoma increased significantly in male and female rats dosed at 100 mg/kg, or approximately 12-times exposure from a 300 mg clinical dose. Also, adrenal pheochromocytoma increased significantly in males and numerically in females dosed at 100 mg/kg. Carbohydrate malabsorption associated with high doses of canagliflozin was considered a necessary proximal event in the emergence of renal and adrenal tumors in rats. Clinical trials have not demonstrated carbohydrate malabsorption in humans at canagliflozin doses of up to 2-times the recommended clinical dose of 300 mg.

Mutagenesis

Canagliflozin was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames assay. Canagliflozin was mutagenic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay with but not without metabolic activation. Canagliflozin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in an in vivo oral micronucleus assay in rats and an in vivo oral Comet assay in rats.

### Canagliflozin and renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes: results from the CANVAS program randomised clinical trials [^113C3Yu2]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

In the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) Program, canagliflozin reduced the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events and the results suggested a renal benefit in patients with type 2 diabetes who were at high risk for cardiovascular events, compared with those treated with placebo. Here we report the results of a prespecified exploratory analysis of the long-term effects of canagliflozin on a range of sustained and adjudicated renal outcomes.

Methods

The CANVAS Program consists of two double-blind, randomised trials that assessed canagliflozin versus placebo in participants with type 2 diabetes who were at high risk of cardiovascular events, done at 667 centres in 30 countries. People with type 2 diabetes and an HbA 1c of 7.0–10.5% (53–91 mmol/mol) who were aged at least 30 years and had a history of symptomatic atherosclerotic vascular disease, or who were aged at least 50 years and had at least two cardiovascular risk factors were eligible to participate. Participants in CANVAS were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive 300 mg canagliflozin, 100 mg canagliflozin, or matching placebo once daily. Participants in CANVAS-R were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive canagliflozin or matching placebo, at an initial dose of 100 mg daily, with optional uptitration to 300 mg from week 13 or matching placebo. Participants and all study staff were masked to treatment allocations until study completion. Prespecified outcomes reported here include a composite of sustained and adjudicated doubling in serum creatinine, end-stage kidney disease, or death from renal causes; the individual components of this composite outcome; annual reductions in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); and changes in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). The trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01032629 (CANVAS) and NCT01989754 (CANVAS-R).

Findings

Between Nov 17, 2009, and March 7, 2011 (CANVAS), and Jan 17, 2014, and May 29, 2015 (CANVAS-R), 15494 people were screened, of whom 10142 participants (with a baseline mean eGFR 76.5 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, median UACR 12.3 mg/g, and 80% of whom were receiving renin-angiotensin system blockade) were randomly allocated to receive either canagliflozin or placebo. The composite outcome of sustained doubling of serum creatinine, end-stage kidney disease, and death from renal causes occurred less frequently in the canagliflozin group compared with the placebo group (1.5 per 1000 patient-years in the canagliflozin group vs 2.8 per 1000 patient-years in the placebo group; hazard ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.33–0.84), with consistent findings across prespecified patient subgroups. Annual eGFR decline was slower (slope difference between groups 1.2 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 per year, 95% CI 1.0–1.4) and mean UACR was 18% lower (95% CI 16–20) in participants treated with canagliflozin than in those treated with placebo. Total serious renal-related adverse events were similar between the canagliflozin and placebo groups (2.5 vs 3.3 per 1000 patient-years; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.49–1.19).

Interpretation

In a prespecified exploratory analysis, canagliflozin treatment was associated with a reduced risk of sustained loss of kidney function, attenuated eGFR decline, and a reduction in albuminuria, which supports a possible renoprotective effect of this drug in people with type 2 diabetes.

### Rationale, design, and baseline characteristics of the canagliflozin cardiovascular assessment study (CANVAS) – a randomized placebo-controlled trial [^113UYdQh]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibition is a novel mode of treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor canagliflozin lowered blood glucose, blood pressure, and body weight, with increased risk of urogenital infections in Phase 2 studies. Effects on macrovascular complications of diabetes remain to be determined. CANVAS is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the effects of canagliflozin on the risk of cardiovascular disease and to assess safety and tolerability in patients with inadequately controlled T2DM and increased cardiovascular risk. The first of 2 planned phases randomized 4,330 individuals to placebo, canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg (1:1:1) with planned follow-up of about 2 years to substantiate potential cardiovascular protection by assessing key biomarkers and to achieve initial safety objectives. By the end of mid-September 2012, a total of 7174 patient-years of follow-up were accrued. Mean baseline age was 62 years, duration of diabetes 13 years; hemoglobin A1c 8.2%, fasting plasma glucose 9.3 mmol/L, and body mass index 32 kg/m(2). Of the participants, 34% are female and 57% had a history of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Participants will be followed up to achieve primary safety and tolerability objectives and to investigate secondary outcomes. The planned second phase will not be undertaken. CANVAS will define the effects of canagliflozin on biomarkers and provide data on cardiovascular safety against established regulatory parameters.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in combination with insulin in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113nviEX]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of this study was to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of canagliflozin as add-on therapy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had inadequate glycaemic control with insulin.

Materials and Methods

The study comprised a 16-week, double-blind period in which patients were randomized to either placebo (P; N = 70) or canagliflozin (100mg, CAN; N = 76), followed by a 36-week open-label period in which all patients received canagliflozin. The efficacy endpoints included the change in HbA1c from baseline to end of treatment. The safety endpoints were adverse events, hypoglycaemic events, and laboratory test values.

Results

The changes from baseline (mean ± standard deviation, last observation carried forward) in the P/CAN and CAN/CAN groups, respectively, were -1.09% ± 0.85% and -0.88% ± 0.86% for HbA1c, -1.40% ± 2.54% and -2.14% ± 2.75% for body weight, and 7.84% ± 14.37% and 8.91% ± 10.80% for HOMA2-%B (all, P < .001). Adverse events occurred in 85.1% of the P/CAN group and 92.0% of the CAN/CAN group. Hypoglycaemic events occurred in 43.3% and 54.7%, respectively. All hypoglycaemic events were mild in severity and insulin dose reduction decreased the incidence rate of hypoglycaemic events. Post-hoc ordinal logistic modelling/logistic modelling showed that lower serum C-peptide at Week 0 was a risk factor for hypoglycaemia in both the P and CAN groups in the double-blind period as well as in the canagliflozin all-treatment period.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates the long-term efficacy and safety of canagliflozin combined with insulin in Japanese patients.

### Canagliflozin lowers postprandial glucose and insulin by delaying intestinal glucose absorption in addition to increasing urinary glucose excretion: results of a randomized, placebo-controlled study [^116wprT2]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Study design

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover study consisting of a screening phase, a 25-day double-blind treatment phase (including two 1-day treatment periods and a washout period of 7–21 days between periods 1 and 2), and a follow-up phase of up to 10 days after period 2. Subjects were randomized to one of two treatment sequences: canagliflozin 300 mg in period 1, followed by matching placebo in period 2, or vice versa. On days –3 and –2 of each period, subjects were counseled to adhere to a specified diet (∼55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 15% protein, and total caloric intake of ∼30 kcal/kg body weight). On the morning of day –1 of each study period, subjects were admitted to the clinical research unit in a fasting state for safety analyses, followed by standardized meals.

On the morning of day 1 of each study period, after an overnight fast of at least 8 h, subjects received a primed (25 μCi), continuous intravenous infusion of 3 H-glucose (0.25 μCi/min) for approximately 9 h. Three hours after starting the intravenous infusion and 20 min after administration of study drug, subjects received a standard 600-kcal MMTT (55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 15% protein). The liquid component of the MMTT consisted of an oral solution of 75 g glucose, which was mixed with 75 μCi 14 C-glucose, and an acetaminophen solution (960 mg in 30 mL); acetaminophen absorption was used as an indirect measure of gastric emptying. Subjects returned for a final follow-up visit for safety analyses 7 to 10 days after discharge on day 1 of period 2.

### Pharmacodynamic differences between canagliflozin and dapagliflozin: results of a randomized, double-blind, crossover study [^112jwxNt]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

This was a randomized, double‐blind, two‐stage group sequential, two‐period crossover study. Each participant underwent a screening phase (up to 3 weeks), a baseline phase (11 days, including a 2‐day domiciled period), a double‐blind treatment phase (4 days, including two 3‐day domiciled periods, with a 12–14‐day washout period between study drug doses in periods 1 and 2), and a follow‐up phase (7–10 days after the last dose of study drug; Figure 1). On the day −12 visit before randomization, participants were counselled to adhere to a specified at‐home diet recommended by a dietician to provide a normal, weight‐maintaining, balanced diet. Participants were admitted to the clinical research centre on the morning of day −11, at which time eligibility, safety and dietary compliance evaluations were completed. Eligible participants remained domiciled and received standardized meals until completion of a mixed‐meal tolerance test (MMTT) on the morning of day −10.

Just before this baseline MMTT, participants were randomized (1:1) to one of two treatment sequences, AB or BA. Treatment A was dapagliflozin 10 mg, and treatment B was canagliflozin 300 mg. Canagliflozin 300 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg tablets were identically over‐encapsulated to ensure treatment blinding. Canagliflozin tablets used in the present study were manufactured and provided by the sponsor (Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Titusville, NJ, USA; batch number 33977.8). Commercially available dapagliflozin 10 mg tablets (Forxiga ®; Bristol‐Myers Squibb/AstraZeneca EEIG, Middlesex, UK) were used in the study (batch numbers 13D23/G073 and 13J03/G073).

### Efficacy of additional canagliflozin administration to type 2 diabetes patients receiving insulin therapy: examination of diurnal glycemic patterns using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) [^112q6uMu]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

The appearance of non-insulin-dependent SGLT2 inhibitors with a new action mechanism may increase the number of options for drug therapy, further advancing diabetes care. SGLT2 inhibitors are available for several procedures: monotherapy to combination therapy with other oral blood-glucose-lowering agents or insulin. Therefore, they can be selected for patients with differing background factors.

The additional administration of SGLT2 inhibitors to type 2 diabetes patients receiving insulin improved diurnal changes in the blood glucose level, decreasing the dose of insulin, suggesting that these agents are effective for insulin-related weight gain.

Body weight and BP

Canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg provided reductions in body weight in patients < 65 and ≥ 65 years of age (Figure 1 C), with differences versus placebo of -2.2% and -2.8%, respectively, in patients < 65 years of age and -2.3% and -3.2%, respectively, in those ≥ 65 years of age. Both canagliflozin doses were associated with reductions in systolic and diastolic BP in both age subsets (Figures 1 D and 1 E). For systolic BP, placebo-subtracted reductions were -3.9 mmHg with canagliflozin 100 mg in both age subsets, and -4.5 and -5.1 mmHg with canagliflozin 300 mg in patients < 65 and ≥ 65 years of age, respectively. Changes in diastolic BP with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg were greater in patients ≥ 65 years of age (placebo-subtracted reductions of -2.6 and -2.5 mmHg, respectively) than in those < 65 years of age (-1.8 mmHg for both doses). Mean changes in pulse rate with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg and placebo were -0.9, -0.1, and 0.2 beats per minute (bpm), respectively, in patients < 65 years of age and 0.6, -1.8, and -0.9 bpm, respectively, in those ≥ 65 years of age.

Safety and tolerability

Overall safety and tolerability

The overall incidence of AEs was similar with canagliflozin and placebo within and across age subsets (Table 3). Incidences of serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were low (≤ 3.3%) and similar across groups in patients < 65 years of age. In patients ≥ 65 years of age, higher incidences of serious AEs and AE-related discontinuations were observed with canagliflozin 100 mg (6.9% and 8.8%, respectively) relative to canagliflozin 300 mg (3.4% and 5.4%, respectively) and placebo (3.6% and 4.4%, respectively); these increases with canagliflozin 100 mg were not associated with any pattern in specific AEs. Relative to placebo, both canagliflozin doses were associated with a higher incidence of AEs related to study drug in patients < 65 and ≥ 65 years of age, which were mainly related to the specific AEs discussed below.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^112t5f7s]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Endocrine Society — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in CKD: SGLT2 inhibitors generally become less effective as GFR decreases, and because of a small increase in adverse events related to intravascular volume contraction, no more than 100 mg once daily of canagliflozin should be used in patients with an eGFR of 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Canagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ertugliflozin should be stopped if the eGFR is < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and dapagliflozin should be stopped at 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, primarily because of a decrease in efficacy. Interestingly, empagliflozin and canagliflozin have been shown to delay the progression of CKD.

Due to approval dates and sample sizes, this analysis focused on canagliflozin only and did not include other SGLT2 inhibitors. Another limitation is that patients were required to initiate canagliflozin 300 mg rather than canagliflozin 100 mg, which is not consistent with the prescribing information. However, it is known that approximately one-third of patients in the real world are initiated on canagliflozin 300 mg. Furthermore, this study compared patients who initiated the highest dose of canagliflozin (300 mg) with those who initiated any dose of a GLP-1 receptor agonist, as the patients may be comparable in terms of disease severity and prior line of therapy. Data from a previous real-world study comparing canagliflozin versus GLP-1 receptor agonists found that most outcomes were generally similar for patients initiated on canagliflozin 100 mg (vs 300 mg). Additionally, a prescription claim does not ensure that the medication was taken as prescribed and does not reflect the potential for use of medication samples (ie, the use of canagliflozin 100 mg samples prior to a prescription for canagliflozin 300 mg). Another limitation is that only ~33% of the population in the HIRD had laboratory data, and these patients may not be representative of the overall database. Furthermore, because all patients were commercially insured or had Medicare Advantage insurance, these results may not be generalizable beyond the US managed care population. In addition, interpretation of the novel composite endpoint based on exceeding HbA1c targets and initiation of a new AHA may not fully capture all possible aspects that could be used to define treatment failure. Similar to other retrospective analyses, this study is subject to possible measurement (ie, diagnosis coding) errors and residual confounding for variables that may differentially impact outcomes but are not available for use in the inverse probability of treatment weighting balancing methods. Additionally, this study was designed to assess effectiveness and treatment durability; therefore, safety data, including hypoglycemia, were not available. Lastly, the cost-effectiveness analysis used non-rebate prices, and may not reflect the amount actually paid by patients and health systems.
