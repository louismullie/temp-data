## Question

An 82-year-old woman with moderate Alzheimer's disease is brought to clinic by her daughter, who reports that over the past month, her mother has become increasingly agitated in the evenings, sometimes shouting and refusing care. She has no history of psychiatric illness and is not currently taking any antipsychotic medications. The daughter asks if her mother should be started on an antipsychotic to help with these behaviors.

Based on current guidelines, what is the most appropriate initial approach to managing this patient's behavioral symptoms? Should an antipsychotic be prescribed at this time? Justify your answer.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an 82-year-old woman with moderate Alzheimer's disease and new evening agitation should be started on an antipsychotic now, and what the most appropriate initial management should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether this fits agitation in dementia. Then, I should verify the first-line principle of nonpharmacologic management and what that entails. Next, I will examine the need for a medical workup to identify reversible causes. After that, I should review the risk–benefit profile of antipsychotics, including mortality and cerebrovascular risks. Then, I will consider whether current severity warrants pharmacotherapy now or if we should defer. Finally, I will outline a monitoring and deprescribing plan if medication is eventually used, and I will integrate any newer evidence such as brexpiprazole where relevant.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. Evening agitation with shouting and care refusal in Alzheimer's disease is consistent with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and the temporal pattern suggests sundowning, which is common in moderate-stage disease and often reflects unmet needs, environmental triggers, or medical contributors rather than primary psychiatric illness [^b6ad5c7a] [^d80eca7c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about medications. I need to check the first-line principle. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on nonpharmacologic interventions as the initial approach for agitation in dementia, reserving antipsychotics for cases with significant distress or danger after reversible causes are addressed, so I should prioritize nonpharmacologic strategies first [^b6ad5c7a] [^2993a790] [^34a2480e].

> Next, I should review what nonpharmacologic care entails. Let me think about a structured approach: describe the behavior and its antecedents, investigate reversible causes, create individualized environmental and caregiver interventions, and evaluate response iteratively, often using the DICE model; caregiver education and environmental modifications are among the most evidence-based elements and should be implemented now [^b6ad5c7a] [^cccd42e6] [^b8bcf8e6].

> I will now examine the need for a medical workup because new or worsened agitation demands it. I should double-check for delirium, infection, pain, constipation, dehydration, medication effects, sleep apnea, and psychiatric comorbidity such as depression or psychosis, as these are common and treatable drivers of agitation in dementia and must be identified and managed before labeling the behavior as treatment-refractory [^d80eca7c] [^b6ad5c7a] [^7ddff4ca].

> Let me consider the risk–benefit profile of antipsychotics. I should confirm that atypical antipsychotics have only modest efficacy for aggression over 6–12 weeks and carry increased risks of mortality, cerebrovascular events, falls, cognitive worsening, and metabolic effects; the FDA boxed warning reflects these risks, and meta-analytic data estimate roughly a 1.5-fold increase in mortality, which is particularly salient in an 82-year-old [^90d7988d] [^9085acae] [^34a2480e] [^7ddff4ca].

> But wait, what if the agitation is severe or dangerous now. I need to ensure I apply the severity threshold correctly. Guidelines support antipsychotics when behaviors cause significant distress or pose imminent risk to the patient or others, or when nonpharmacologic measures fail after a reasonable trial; here, shouting and refusal of care alone do not meet that high threshold, so I should not start an antipsychotic today [^34a2480e] [^2993a790] [^b6ad5c7a].

> Let me reconsider whether any newer pharmacologic options change this. Brexpiprazole recently gained FDA approval for agitation in Alzheimer's disease and showed modest benefit over 12 weeks, but it still carries the class boxed warning for increased mortality; given the patient's current risk profile and the absence of a trial of nonpharmacologic care, I should still defer pharmacotherapy and reassess after implementing nonpharmacologic interventions and completing the medical evaluation [^324c0733] [^324c0733].

> I should confirm a monitoring and safety plan. If antipsychotics are ever initiated, I need to start low, go slow, document goals and metrics, and plan for time-limited use with periodic attempts to taper; routine reassessment every 3–6 months is advised, with more frequent visits during initiation or changes, and discontinuation should be considered after 3–6 months of stability or if benefits are unclear [^34a2480e] [^50926ad8] [^7891e5c0].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is as follows: do not start an antipsychotic now. Instead, prioritize nonpharmacologic interventions and a comprehensive medical evaluation for reversible causes, set measurable behavioral goals, and reassess in 2–4 weeks; if agitation escalates to significant distress or danger, or persists despite optimized nonpharmacologic care, then consider a cautious, time-limited antipsychotic trial with shared decision-making and explicit monitoring for efficacy and adverse effects, recognizing that brexpiprazole is now an FDA-approved option but still requires the same risk–benefit scrutiny and deprescribing plan [^b6ad5c7a] [^34a2480e] [^6b47e817].

---

Do not start an antipsychotic now. The first-line approach is **non-pharmacologic interventions** [^b6ad5c7a] (environmental changes, caregiver education, and behavioral strategies) [^f3335e4d] and a **search for reversible causes** (pain, infection, constipation, medication effects, sleep disturbance) [^d80eca7c]. Antipsychotics are reserved for severe agitation or psychosis that poses a safety risk or significant distress after these steps fail, and if used, they should be at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with close monitoring for adverse effects [^34a2480e] [^889adb1b]. Given the modest benefit and significant risks (increased mortality, cerebrovascular events, falls, cognitive worsening) [^90d7988d] [^9085acae], **shared decision-making with the family is essential** [^58c89f39].

---

## Recommended initial approach

### Non-pharmacological interventions (first-line)

- **Environmental modifications**: Reduce noise, clutter, and overstimulation; maintain consistent routines; ensure adequate lighting; and provide familiar objects to reduce confusion and agitation [^b6ad5c7a].

- **Caregiver education and support**: Train caregivers in communication techniques, distraction, and de-escalation strategies; provide respite care to reduce caregiver stress [^b6ad5c7a].

- **Behavioral strategies**: Use person-centered approaches, validate feelings, and avoid confrontation; identify and address triggers for agitation [^b8bcf8e6].

---

### Medical evaluation for reversible causes

Assess for **pain, infection, constipation, dehydration, medication side effects, and sleep disturbances**, as these are common, treatable contributors to agitation [^d80eca7c]. Also review current medications for anticholinergic or sedative effects that may worsen confusion or agitation [^notfound].

---

## Role of antipsychotic medications

### Indications for antipsychotic use

Antipsychotics are considered only when:

- **Severity**: Agitation or psychosis is severe, persistent, and causes significant distress or safety risks [^34a2480e].

- **Failure of non-pharmacologic measures**: Non-pharmacologic interventions have been adequately tried and failed [^2993a790].

- **Safety risk**: Behaviors pose imminent risk to the patient or others [^e552ed23].

---

### Risks associated with antipsychotic use

Antipsychotics carry significant risks in elderly patients with dementia, including:

- **Increased mortality**: Meta-analyses show a 1.5–1.7 fold increase in mortality with atypical antipsychotics [^f94c58e6] [^61130f37].

- **Cerebrovascular events**: Increased risk of stroke and transient ischemic attacks [^7ddff4ca].

- **Falls and fractures**: Higher risk due to sedation and orthostatic hypotension [^fe428ccf].

- **Cognitive worsening**: Potential acceleration of cognitive decline [^9085acae].

- **Extrapyramidal symptoms**: Parkinsonism, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia [^260853a7].

---

### Monitoring and duration of therapy

If antipsychotics are initiated, use the **lowest effective dose** and monitor closely for adverse effects, including sedation, extrapyramidal symptoms, metabolic changes, and falls [^34a2480e]. Reassess regularly, and attempt dose reduction or discontinuation within 3 months if symptoms improve or stabilize [^7891e5c0].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| American Psychiatric Association (APA) | - Non-pharmacologic interventions first-line <br/> - Antipsychotics only for severe agitation or psychosis after non-pharmacologic measures fail <br/> - Lowest effective dose for shortest duration with close monitoring [^34a2480e] [^889adb1b] |
| American Geriatrics Society (AGS) | - Do not use antipsychotics as first-line for BPSD <br/> - Reserve for cases with imminent risk or severe distress after non-pharmacologic interventions fail [^2993a790] |
| European Academy of Neurology (EAN) | - Weak recommendation against routine antipsychotic use <br/> - Consider only for severe agitation or psychosis after non-pharmacologic measures fail [^e756a95c] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's moderate Alzheimer's disease with new-onset evening agitation, the most appropriate initial approach is **non-pharmacologic interventions and a search for reversible causes**. Antipsychotics should not be started now unless agitation is severe, persistent, and poses a safety risk after these steps fail. If antipsychotics are eventually used, employ the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with close monitoring and shared decision-making with the family [^58c89f39].

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — psychosis and agitation management emphasizes nonpharmacological interventions first with careful risk–benefit assessment. Clinicians must weigh the risk of not treating against the risks of active treatment and the consideration and use of behavioral, psychosocial, and psychotherapeutic treatments is particularly critical. If symptoms cause significant distress or are associated with behavior that may place the patient or others at risk, treatment with low doses of antipsychotic medication is indicated in addition to nonpharmacological interventions, and treatment with an antipsychotic is also indicated if a patient is agitated or combative in the absence of psychosis, with the use of these agents reevaluated and their benefit documented on an ongoing basis. When antipsychotics are ineffective, carbamazepine, valproate, or an SSRI may be used in a careful therapeutic trial, and a low-dose benzodiazepine may prove useful for symptoms limited to specific times or settings, noting problematic side effects in elderly patients. Although mood stabilizers and SSRIs are commonly used for agitation, delusions, and aggression, they have not been consistently shown to be effective or safe and should not be seen as having improved safety or comparable efficacy compared to antipsychotics. As illness evolves, the continued use of any intervention must be evaluated and justified on an ongoing basis, and periodic reevaluation and revision of the treatment plan, including a change in dose, a change in medication, or medication discontinuation, may be indicated, with patients whose initial symptom severity was relatively low potentially more easily withdrawn from psychotropics.

Dementia — agitation and aggression definition, contributors, and initial step describe that "Agitation" is an umbrella term that refers to a range of behavioral disturbances, including physical aggression, combativeness, threatening behavior, persistent or intermittent psychomotor hyperactivity, and disinhibition, and these behaviors pose a particular problem for patients cared for at home, especially by frail spouses. Agitation is more likely to occur later in the course of dementia and often has multiple causes, and new or worsened agitation can result from an occult general medical problem, medication side effects, untreated or undertreated pain, constipation, depression, psychotic symptoms, or delirium. Thus, the first priority is a careful medical evaluation.

Behavioral and environmental management of agitation in dementia — In designing an intervention to treat a problematic behavior, a structured approach should be taken to facilitate selecting the optimal treatment and monitoring the effect of that treatment. The first step is to carefully describe the target behavior, including where, when, and how often it occurs, and the next step is to assess the specific antecedents and consequences of each problem behavior. Activities that consistently precede the problem behavior may be acting as precipitants and should be avoided whenever possible, multistep activities can be simplified, and whatever the intervention, it is critical to match the level of demand on the patient with his or her current capacity. Clinicians can recommend that caregivers maintain a log of specific behaviors as well as their intensity, frequency, precipitants, and consequences. If the agitation is deemed dangerous to the patient or others, it is important to undertake further measures to enhance safety, which may include providing one-on-one care, instituting behavioral measures, or initiating pharmacological treatment, and if agitation and aggressive behavior cannot be brought under control, hospitalization and/or nursing home placement must be considered.

### Management of agitation and aggression associated with Alzheimer disease [^90d7988d]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Agitation and aggression are frequently occurring and distressing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). These symptoms are disturbing for individuals with Alzheimer disease, commonly confer risk to the patient and others, and present a major management challenge for clinicians. The most widely prescribed pharmacological treatments for these symptoms-atypical antipsychotics-have a modest but significant beneficial effect in the short-term treatment (over 6–12 weeks) of aggression but limited benefits in longer term therapy. Benefits are less well established for other symptoms of agitation. In addition, concerns are growing over the potential for serious adverse outcomes with these treatments, including stroke and death. A detailed consideration of other pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to agitation and aggression in patients with Alzheimer disease is, therefore, imperative. This article reviews the increasing evidence in support of psychological interventions or alternative therapies (such as aromatherapy) as a first-line management strategy for agitation, as well as the potential pharmacological alternatives to atypical antipsychotics-preliminary evidence for memantine, carbamazepine, and citalopram is encouraging.

### Clinical practice guidelines for severe Alzheimer's disease [^4660f63b]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Although severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a prevalent, serious, and costly public health problem, few practice guidelines exist to help physicians manage this disorder.

Methods

A search of English language medical databases was performed from 1996 to the present for articles pertaining to the management of AD. The focus of this review was on studies that included patients with severe disease. Studies were assessed by considering the subjects, trial design, analysis, and results. Recommendations were based on the best available evidence.

Results

Severe AD can be defined and diagnosed reliably by using measures of cognition, function, behavior, and global staging. Specific assessments would also include medical status, safety issues, and the health status of the caregiver. Disease-specific management would include treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine. Treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms begins with nonpharmacologic behavioral and environmental approaches. Severe agitation, aggression, and psychosis that are potentially dangerous to the patient, caregiver, and others in the environment can be treated with atypical antipsychotics, with consideration of their increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse events and mortality. All pharmacologic approaches require careful monitoring and regular periodic reassessments to determine whether ongoing treatment is necessary.

Conclusions

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of severe AD have the potential to improve the quality of life for the patient and their caregiver. More randomized controlled trials aimed specifically at this phase of illness are still urgently required.

Anecdote of clinical experience

Over the past three years, we have experience a surge in the number of dementia-related illnesses being admitted to our unit. Quite recently, we managed a clinical condition that apparently stimulates the urge for writing this review. The intention is to increase the awareness of fellow clinicians/physicians, and also, hoping the carers and family of dementia patients who read medical journals will be better informed.

An elderly frail woman, mostly bedbound, from a nursing home was admitted to our unit. She had background history of frontotemporal dementia and previous stroke. Her family mentioned that she often became agitated whenever she had exacerbations of arthritic pains or infections (particularly urinary infection). However, due to rising frequencies of agitation and aggression symptoms in the nursing home, she was reviewed by the community Psychiatry team and was started on quetiapine treatment. On subsequent review by the latter, risperidone was added to her medications due to lack of improvement of her symptoms. The addition of risperidone made her to be overly drowsy on most time of the day, and her oral intake became very poor according to her family.

Unfortunately, in just over six months on quetiapine and risperidone combination, she suffered another major ischemic stroke, and was started on end of life care in the same nursing home. At that time, all her active medications were stopped including the antipsychotics (risperidone and quetiapine). Surprisingly, she made a spontaneous recovery after few weeks, and her oral intake began to improve at the time. However, about two months following her recovery, she was restarted on her regular medications including the antipsychotics. Again, she started becoming drowsy again at most times of the day with worsening oral intake due to drowsiness. Little wonder, she presented to our unit with acute kidney injury from severe dehydration and also had aspiration pneumonia. During the week-long period of admission on our unit, her antipsychotics medications were stopped and she was rehydrated and treated for likely aspiration pneumonia. Her oral intake became significantly improved and she was neither agitated nor aggressive at any time during the period of her admission into our unit. On discharge, I discussed with the patient's next of kin the need to stop both the risperidone and quetiapine, as these medications were no longer indicated in the patient. I also put a note to the psychiatry team to inform them of the above plan and requested a follow-up by them.

### Agitation and irritability in Alzheimer's disease: evidenced-based treatments and the black-box warning [^b96644a6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

More than five million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD), and this number is expected to triple by 2050. While impairments in cognition, particularly memory, are typically the defining features of the clinical syndrome, behavioral symptoms are extremely common, affecting up to 90% of patients. Behavioral symptoms in AD can be difficult to manage and may require a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches. The latter is complicated by FDA "black-box warnings" for the medication classes most often used to target these symptoms, and currently there are initiatives in place to limit their use. In this review, we describe common behavioral symptoms of AD-with a particular focus on the challenging symptoms of "agitation" and "irritability"-and discuss evidence-based approaches to their management. Ultimately, multidimensional approaches must be tailored to the patient and their environment, though evidence-based practices should define the treatment of agitation and irritability in AD.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^f630508c]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale for a treatment algorithm

Evidence for the efficacy of psychotropic drugs in BPSD associated with Alzheimer's and mixed dementia has emerged over the last two decades. Trials of varying quality along with meta-analyses, case series, and case reports now exist for various drugs in several classes. Yet, many of these drugs, such as antipsychotic medications, confer well-known risks of side effects and toxicity, especially in the elderly. Faced with this complex and evolving evidence, adopting a rational and consistent prescribing strategy is challenging.

In the Canadian context, there has been a reduction in antipsychotic drug prescription rates in the long-term care setting after a warning was issued by Health Canada in 2004 relating to risks of mortality and stroke in patients with dementia treated with antipsychotics. This reduction coincided with increased rates of exposure to two psychotropic drugs from two or more different classes ("polypharmacy"), and to drugs lacking an evidence of effectiveness. This suggests that greater direction is required in managing BPSD.

Appropriate algorithmic treatment has the potential to improve outcomes such as faster symptom control, decreased length-of-stay, lower rates of polypharmacy, and higher care-giver and patient satisfaction. Algorithmic treatment has been used successfully in the treatment of depression. A sequential drug treatment algorithm has been applied specifically to geriatric patients with depressive disorders. In updating their algorithm for treatment of geriatric depression, reaffirmed their view that algorithmic treatment using a sequential approach should lead to superior outcomes compared with individualized treatment, in that it allows standardization of the quantity and quality of drug treatment through, for example, optimizing drug dosing, the frequency of follow-up and the length of drug treatment trials. Existing algorithms for treatment of BPSD either address symptoms other than agitation and aggression (e.g. psychosis) or, where these symptoms are a focus (e.g.;), differ from the present algorithm in that they do not propose sequential treatment with a defined sequence of drugs with pre-specified dosing schedules and decision time-points.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^34a2480e]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Dementia — agitation and psychosis management emphasizes first addressing reversible causes [I], using environmental measures if symptoms are not causing significant danger or distress [I], and considering behavioral measures [III]; if these are unsuccessful or behaviors are dangerous or distressing, judicious pharmacologic treatment may be used [II] with ongoing reevaluation and documentation [I]. Antipsychotic medications are recommended for psychosis [II] and agitation [II], can provide modest improvement in behavioral symptoms [I], and have evidence based mostly on 6–12-week trials with limited research beyond 12 weeks though clinical experience supports use [II]. Antipsychotics must be used with caution at the lowest effective dosage [I], with patients and families advised about potential benefits and risks, particularly mortality [I]; second-generation agents have a black box warning for increased mortality in elderly patients and first-generation agents carry at least a similar risk, with selection based on side-effect profile and patient characteristics [I]. Benzodiazepine benefit is modest but they may have a role for prominent anxiety [III] or on an as-needed basis for infrequent agitation or procedural sedation [II], with lorazepam and oxazepam preferable to longer half-life agents such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide [III]. Anticonvulsants, lithium, and beta-blockers have minimal evidence and are generally not recommended except after other treatments have failed [III]; trazodone and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are not well studied for non-depressive symptoms but may be appropriate for nonpsychotic patients with agitation, especially with mild agitation or prior antipsychotic sensitivity [III].

Special issues for long-term care — dementia management addresses placement needs, staffing, antipsychotic use, and restraints with graded guidance. Many patients eventually require long-term-care placement; approximately two-thirds of nursing home patients have dementia. Care should be organized to meet the needs of patients, including those with behavioral problems [I], and employing staff with knowledge and experience concerning dementia and the management of difficult behavior is important [II]. Special care units may offer more optimal care, although there is limited evidence that they achieve better outcomes than traditional units [III]. Appropriate use of antipsychotic medications can relieve symptoms and reduce distress and can increase safety for patients, other residents, and staff [I], but their use may be associated with worsening cognitive impairment, oversedation, falls, tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, hyperlipidemia, weight gain, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accidents, and death [I]. Good clinical practice requires careful consideration and documentation of the indications and available alternatives, both initially and on a regular ongoing basis [I], and a dose decrease or discontinuation should be considered periodically for all patients who receive antipsychotic medications [I]; a structured education program for staff may help to both manage patients' behavior and decrease the use of these medications in nursing homes [I]. Physical restraints are rarely indicated and should be used only for patients who pose an imminent risk of physical harm to themselves or others [I], reasons for the use should be carefully documented [I], and the need for restraints can be decreased by environmental changes that decrease the risk of falls or wandering and by careful assessment and treatment of possible causes of agitation [II].

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^260853a7]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Antipsychotics — Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are presented as the primary pharmacological treatment for psychotic symptoms and the most commonly used and best-studied pharmacological treatment for agitation, with considerable evidence from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses for efficacy. Findings from CATIE-AD failed to demonstrate conclusive benefits of second-generation antipsychotics over placebo in Alzheimer's disease with psychosis or aggression, although certain outcome variables favored medications and discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was lower with olanzapine and risperidone than with placebo or quetiapine. Given side effects and potential toxicity, the risks and benefits must be reassessed on an ongoing basis, the lowest effective dose should be sought with emergent side effects first treated by dose reduction, and indications should be generally limited to psychosis or behavioral disturbances, not primarily for sleep disorders or anxiety. Periodic attempts (e.g., every several months) to reduce or withdraw antipsychotic medications should be considered for all patients while weighing the probability of a relapse and the dangerousness of the target behavior(s). In general, agents with significant anticholinergic properties should be avoided in patients with dementia, and mild to moderate adverse effects of antipsychotics include akathisia, parkinsonism, and sedation.

Treatment of NPS in NDD

Only one agent — pimavanserin — is currently approved by the US FDA for the treatment of a neuropsychiatric syndrome of a NDD. This agent is approved for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions occurring in PD psychosis. All other use of psychotropics is "off label", although it may be necessary for best practices, based on extensive experience, and endorsed by treatment guidelines. Table 1 summarizes current recommendations for treatment of NPS in NDD.

Table 1
Recommended treatments for neuropsychiatric syndromes

*Initiation of pharmacological interventions should occur after non-pharmacological approaches, cognitive enhancers, and comprehensive assessment of medical and environmental factors has been completed

Maximum recommended dose for citalopram in patients over the age of 60 is 20 mg/day

*TCA should not be used in patients with cognitive impairment

Overview

Psychotropics are commonly used in AD and other NDD despite the absence of a specific FDA-approved indication in this setting. It is incumbent on the clinician in these circumstances to weigh potential benefit and harm to the patient, consider the urgency and the magnitude of the threat, review the consequences of not treating, and assess the appropriateness of non-pharmacological interventions prior to initiating use of a psychotropic agent. A shared decision-making paradigm to include family caregivers or others is an important aspect of the decision to treat.

Treatment of Agitation in AD

An unanswered question concerning agitation in NDD is whether there are different types of agitation and if these differing phenoptypes may respond differentially to treatments used for agitation. For example, among patients with agitation treated with citalopram, those with the mild-moderate symptoms appeared to respond best while those with more severe agitation demonstrated less efficacy and more side effects. Different brain circuits may be involved in different types of behavioral dysregulation and may respond differentially to antipsychotics, antidepressants, or mood stabilizers. This question represents an area where further study is warranted.

The potential benefit of antipsychotics must be weighed against the significant risks to patients, such as cerebrovascular adverse events and mortality. Antipsychotic use may have less risk of premature death or need for medical care in cases where careful control for cardiovascular risk factors was implemented. Atypical antipsychotics are more beneficial than placebo and are associated with decreased caregiver burden, but the potential for adverse effects limits their overall usefulness. Not all atypical antipsychotics have been studied in the context of NPS of NDD, and the class effects are not established.

Regarding medical management for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, more specifically with respect to antipsychotics, choice of agent and dosage, CCSMH 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering quetiapine for the treatment of severe agitation refractory to other pharmacological treatments (or if not tolerated due to extrapyramidal side effects) in patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.

### Atypical antipsychotic use in patients with dementia: managing safety concerns [^fe428ccf]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as agitation and delusions occur commonly in elderly patients with dementia and often cause significant distress. Data on treatment efficacy are strongest for atypical antipsychotics, but these agents must be used with great caution. Adverse effects in patients with dementia include an increased risk of mortality and cerebrovascular events, as well as metabolic effects, extrapyramidal symptoms, falls, cognitive worsening, cardiac arrhythmia, and pneumonia. Conventional antipsychotics may pose an even greater safety risk. No clear efficacy evidence exists to support the use of alternative psychotropic classes (e.g., antidepressants, anticonvulsants), although they may be safer options. An antipsychotic trial is warranted when nonpharmacological intervention is unsuccessful and neuropsychiatric symptoms or associated behaviors cause severe distress or pose a significant safety risk. Before an atypical antipsychotic is started, a comprehensive assessment should be performed to rule out medical causes of the neuropsychiatric symptoms and to ascertain whether any contributing environmental or caregiver factors are present. Risks, benefits, and alternatives should be discussed with the patient and surrogate decision maker, with an opportunity given to ask questions. Dosages should be the lowest necessary, and metabolic parameters should be regularly monitored. Face-to-face visits are important to monitor response, tolerance, and the need for continued treatment. For patients in whom neuropsychiatric symptoms have been much improved or have been in remission for 3–6 months, a discontinuation trial should be considered. Through careful selection of appropriate patients for treatment, education of patients and caregivers, and close monitoring, safety risks can be minimized.

A combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches is necessary for the appropriate neuropsychiatric management of patients with young-onset dementia. Nonpharmacologic interventions, including psychological management, environmental strategies, and caregiver's support, should be the first choice for neuropsychiatric management. Pharmacologic interventions differ according to the underlying causes of dementia; thus, differential diagnoses are very important. Antipsychotics should be prescribed carefully; they should be used for the shortest time possible, at the lowest possible dose.

### Real-world treatment patterns and characteristics among patients with agitation and dementia in the United States: findings from a large, observational, retrospective chart review [^094d9375]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Background:

Few studies have examined patient characteristics and treatment patterns among patients with dementia and agitation in the United States (US).

Objective:

To examine real-world treatment patterns and characteristics of patients with agitation related to dementia who were treated with antipsychotics in US residential care and community-based settings.

Methods:

This retrospective chart review collected US physician-level data from patients 55 to 90 years old initiated on an antipsychotic medication for the treatment of agitation related to dementia from January 2018 to May 2018. Clinical characteristics and treatment patterns were assessed overall and stratified by residential care and community-based settings.

Results:

A total of 313 participating physicians, 59.5% of whom were primary care physicians, abstracted 801 patient charts (residential care: n = 312; community-based: n = 489). Of patients with agitation who were initiated on an antipsychotic, most patients (74.5%) were initiated within 3 months of the onset of their studied agitation episode, and 62.8% experienced multiple agitation episodes before initiation. While non-pharmacological therapies are recommended first-line approach for agitation in dementia, use of non-pharmacological therapy before initiation of antipsychotics was reported for only 37.8% of patients in residential care and 21.3% in community-based settings.

Conclusion:

Most patients were initiated on an antipsychotic treatment after multiple episodes of agitation and largely without initial non-pharmacological therapy, suggesting that current treatment guideline recommendations for first-line non-pharmacological intervention may not be adequately followed in clinical practice. Understanding the clinical burden and treatment patterns among dementia patients with agitation is imperative for effective disease management.

### Dementia-related agitation: a review of non-pharmacological interventions and analysis of risks and benefits of pharmacotherapy [^f9f0dafc]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Unsurprisingly, the subject of dementia has been a rising matter of public health concerns as people now live longer. World Alzheimer Report 2015, estimate that about 46.8 million people worldwide have dementia. These numbers are projected to almost double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2030 and 131.5 million in 2050. The modality for treating agitation and other behavioral symptoms in dementia patients has been a challenge. Many years on, there has been no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy in treating dementia-related agitation. This review discusses the current knowledge of non-pharmacological interventions, and analyzes the risks and benefits of pharmacotherapy in the management of dementia-related agitation, as well as providing an anecdotal of the author's clinical experience. This article aims to provide opportunity for increase awareness for clinicians, particularly those with no specialty training in geriatrics medicine but see dementia patients with agitation and other behavioral symptoms from time to time. Likewise, it hopefully will benefit the readers of medical journals to update their existing knowledge on matters relating to the management of dementia-related agitation.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^64c85a4e]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

We speculate that treatment of inpatients experiencing agitation and aggression associated with Alzheimer's or mixed dementia may be improved by bringing structure and consistency to an area where numerous putative drug treatments exist but most trials have been published relatively recently. Even when physicians familiarize themselves with which drugs are the most appropriate, they may not necessarily adopt evidence-informed dosing schedules or trial duration. However, until the present algorithm is evaluated rigorously we do not know whether it is associated with improved clinical outcomes over usual practice. We acknowledge further limitations of this paper. First, the medication algorithm was derived from a consensus of physician preferences based on the characteristics of candidate drugs as enumerated earlier. The appraisal of evidence did not involve formal systematic reviews but did require three of the authors of this manuscript (SD, AB, TR) to undertake an evaluation of existing literature on drug efficacy and tolerability and to synthesize these findings with the views of the larger physician group in terms of acceptability/applicability and ease of use. Second, the present algorithm was designed specifically for a specialist geriatric psychiatry inpatient setting and we anticipate that in other settings, such as long-term care homes, some changes to the recommended drug sequence may be indicated. Thirdly, we acknowledge that some patients or their carers may be unwilling to consent to receive antipsychotics, or indeed other specific recommended drugs. However, the algorithm has been designed to cater for this scenario by allowing any treatment or series of treatments to be skipped.

Finally, we acknowledge that no medication algorithm can be applicable to every patient. As the algorithm has been developed and applied, we have encountered situations where the prescribing psychiatrist has chosen to deviate from it (e.g. in terms of doses and duration of treatment) due to individual patient characteristics and/or observed response. While the physicians have been able to follow the algorithm's principles and dosing schedules in most cases, we recognize that physicians must retain the discretion to make decisions around drug prescription which they see as in the patient's best interest. Therefore, this document should be seen as an overarching guide to sequential drug treatment rather than a rigid schema.

AGS Choosing Wisely — behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia — Don't use antipsychotics as first choice to treat behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. People with dementia often exhibit aggression, resistance to care and other challenging or disruptive behaviors, antipsychotic medicines are often prescribed but they provide limited benefit and can cause serious harm, including stroke and premature death, use of these drugs should be limited to cases where non-pharmacologic measures have failed and patients pose an imminent threat to themselves or others, and identifying and addressing causes of behavior change can make drug treatment unnecessary.

Clean-up phase

The clean-up phase (Figure 3) follows the following principles:

Cognitive enhancers (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or memantine) should not be discontinued unless there is evidence that their introduction may have caused the BPSD symptoms (e.g. as may occur in the frontal variant of Alzheimer's disease). Optimization of these drugs is a parallel process to initiation of drugs specifically for treatment of agitation and aggression in BPSD and is therefore not part of the main drug treatment pathway. However, it is recommended that while working through the main pathway prescribers should avoid introducing new acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or memantine to permit assessment of the effects of pathway drugs.
Antipsychotics, antidepressants (including trazodone), carbamazepine, gabapentin, prazosin and cyproterone acetate should be discontinued if these drugs had been started specifically for BPSD, but not if started for another clinical indication (e.g. depression, schizophrenia). Where discontinuation is required, this should be undertaken from day 3 to day 10.
Benzodiazepines or "Z-drugs" (e.g. zopiclone, zolpidem) should be discontinued unless there is clear recent evidence of insurmountable difficulty in stopping them. Where discontinuation is indicated, it should be undertaken as slowly as needed for safety, which in many cases will necessitate a gradual taper with the down-titration process continuing beyond day 10.
During the clean-up period (and afterwards), the PRN psychotropic drugs described in the section on 'Drugs included for PRN use' above may be used, either (a) trazodone 25 mg every hour as needed, maximum initially 150 mg/24 h with option to increase to a maximum of 300 mg/day if required in non-FRAIL patients, or (b) lorazepam 0.5 mg as needed, max 2 mg/24 h. As per above, trazodone is the preferred choice whereas lorazepam is recommended only in specific circumstances.

At the end of the clean-up phase, Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) (compared with baseline), CGI-S and NPI-Q are performed (Table 2). In a substantial minority of cases, the clean-up phase in an inpatient setting may produce adequate improvement (normally reflected through a CGI-I score of one or two), obviating the need to enter the main drug treatment pathway.

### Dementia-related agitation: a review of non-pharmacological interventions and analysis of risks and benefits of pharmacotherapy [^87f78d33]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Risks and benefits of pharmacological interventions

Quite often, it is not uncommon that physicians use pharmacotherapy approach for treating dementia-related agitation and other neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). Several drugs including neuroleptics, anti-depressants, sedatives/hypnotics and anxiolytics among others are frequently used. While there is still no FDA-approved drug treatment for dementia-related agitation, they have issued several black box warnings regarding increased risk of stroke and mortality associated with the use of some drugs (particularly antipsychotics) in the elderly patients with dementia.

Ballard et al. conducted a randomized trial across five areas in Great Britain, to examine dementia patients who were started on long-term (at least 3 months) neuroleptic agents for neuropsychiatric symptoms control. They assess whether neuroleptics affect cognitive function and other outcomes, and determine whether discontinuing neuroleptics was related to an exacerbation of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Ballard et al. report that withdrawal of neuroleptics in most patients with Alzheimer's disease led to measurable improvement of cognitive and functional status, and no significant harmful effect. A year later, in 2009, Rappaport et al. did a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled tolerability study of intramuscular aripiprazole on 129 acutely agitated patients with Alzheimer's, vascular, or mixed dementia across 16 centers in the USA. Moderate-to severe acute exacerbations of agitated behavior was defined using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component (PEC) scores, and they performed efficacy analyses for the PEC, Agitation–Calmness Evaluation Scale (ACES), Clinical Global Impressions–Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impressions–Improvement (CGI-I) rating scales. The authors concluded that a total of 10 mg or 15 mg of intramuscular aripiprazole given in divided doses showed overall good tolerability and remarkable improvements in agitation associated with Alzheimer's, vascular, or mixed dementia. Similarly, another study by Seitz et al. on several atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine and aripiprazole) showed demonstrable good evidence in managing neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia patients. But, Seitz et al. recommend that safe and effective non-pharmacological interventions approach should be considered ahead of antipsychotics and other pharmacological treatments due to distressing adverse effects. Schneider et al. demonstrated that atypical antipsychotics are associated with an increased risk of death, with an odds ratio of 1.54. Likewise, observational study by Gill et al. found an increased risk of mortality with the use of the antipsychotics. There is also reported evidence of increased risk of major cerebrovascular events associated with antipsychotics use. Other common adverse effects which should also be monitored during treatment with atypical antipsychotics include increased falls and fall-related injuries such as hip fractures. Most often, these risks occur soon after initiating antipsychotics treatment, although chronic therapy is also argued to be associated with increased risks.

### Short-term antipsychotics for Alzheimer disease… [^f94c58e6]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Do patients with Alzheimer disease who are treated with short-term antipsychotics have a higher mortality rate than those not taking antipsychotics. Evidence-Based Answer Physicians should consider not using antipsychotics in patients with dementia. Patients with dementia, including Alzheimer disease, who are treated with antipsychotics for any length of time have a higher mortality rate than those not taking antipsychotics. Evidence Summary A 2005 systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 RCTs of 10 to 26 weeks' duration compared mortality in patients 56 to 99 years of age who received atypical antipsychotics or placebo. 1 Patients had Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, mixed dementia, or primary dementia. Overall, 87% of patients had Alzheimer disease.

Subgroup analysis did not find heterogeneity between trials of patients with Alzheimer disease and higher cognitive function vs. lower cognitive function. Of the 5, 110 patients, 1, 757 were randomized to placebo and 3, 353 were randomized to an atypical antipsychotic, including aripiprazole, 2 to 15 mg per day; risperidone, 0. 5 to 4 mg per day; quetiapine, 50 to 600 mg per day; and olanzapine, 1 to 15 mg per day. In pooled analysis of all 15 RCTs, death was more common among patients receiving atypical antipsychotics. Patients with Alzheimer disease were not analyzed separately from those with other causes of dementia.

A 2014 retrospective cohort study investigated short- and long-term mortality risk associated with antipsychotic use in outpatients 65 years and older who had dementia. 2 Risk was assessed over multiple timeframes and for multiple antipsychotics. Patients had records in the Norwegian Prescription Database and were assumed to have dementia based on treatment with at least one antidementia drug. The anti-psychotic group had also received a prescription for risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, levomepromazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, haloperidol, zuclopenthi xol, or chlorprothixene, whereas the control group was receiving other psychotropic drugs, including antidepressants, benzodiazepines, lithium, and anticonvulsants.

Survival analyses were adjusted for age, sex, mean daily dosage, and medical conditions. Compared with use of other psychotropic drugs, antipsychotic use increased mortality risk at 30 days and two to six years. The percentage of patients with Alzheimer disease vs. other types of dementia was not reported.

### Management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia [^58d46f75]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose is to review the results and clinical implications of recent studies of neuropathology in relation to neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, and discuss new therapeutic approaches based on evidence from clinical trials.

Recent Findings

In a large autopsy series from a national consortium, multiple neuropathologies of dementia subtypes were common and increased severity of specific NPS during life was associated with greater severity of neuropathology across diagnoses. Based on three clinical trials, brexpiprazole, which is an antipsychotic with dopamine and serotonin receptor partial agonism properties, was recently approved for the treatment of agitation in Alzheimer's dementia by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Its therapeutic profile indicates modest efficacy with high safety. Brexpiprazole has not been compared to other antipsychotics that are commonly prescribed to treat agitation in dementia, though none of them have been approved for this indication. Other drugs that showed positive results in Phase 2 trials are being tested in Phase 3 trials. These include cannabinoids and drug combinations that inhibit dextromethorphan metabolism peripherally, thereby increasing its bioavailability in the brain. Apathy is common in several types of dementia, and there is initial evidence that treatment with methylphenidate, a psychostimulant, may be efficacious with good tolerability.

Summary

Greater understanding of the associations between NPS and dementia subtypes can improve clinical management of these disorders. In addition to the approval of brexpiprazole to treat agitation in Alzheimer's dementia, there is optimism about other medications based on ongoing clinical trials. Along with short-term improvement, altering the adverse impact on NPS on long-term prognosis remains an important challenge for the field.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^ebc92182]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Step 2(b): aripiprazole

Again, aripiprazole (NbN: dopamine, serotonin receptor partial agonist) has a smaller evidence base than risperidone. However, there is randomized trial evidence suggesting a statistically significant effect for agitation in patients with Alzheimer's disease where BPSD symptoms included psychosis, with superiority over placebo detected as early as week 2 for some outcomes. Aripiprazole was superior to placebo in a meta-analysis, both on outcome measures specific to agitation and on the more wide-ranging Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Aripiprazole was included as an alternative to quetiapine due to its differing mechanism of action, which involves partial D2 receptor antagonism. Although this has not been demonstrated, the panel of psychiatrists believed this different mechanism of action might confer a greater efficacy in risperidone non-responders than the remaining atypical antipsychotics.

Step 3: carbamazepine

Carbamazepine (NbN: glutamate: voltage-gated sodium and calcium channel blocker) is used in many forms of epilepsy and as a mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder. Case reports support its use to control aggressive outbursts in episodic dyscontrol syndrome. The panel ranked carbamazepine below the antipsychotics. It has one successful but small randomized trial in patients with BPSD who were resistant to treatment with antipsychotics, with efficacy demonstrated over a six-week treatment period, but also several other negative trials in BPSD (for review see). Carbamazepine presents several issues to prescribers including potential for drug interactions given its known induction of the CYP 3A4 enzyme, which plays a role in the metabolism of numerous psychotropic drugs, and rare but potentially dangerous side effects including severe skin reactions, aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis. However, the panel considered carbamazepine as a drug that still had potential for efficacy in the psychopathology of BPSD within a short time-scale in patients resistant to or unable to take antipsychotics. By Step 3 patients may already have been hospitalized for six weeks or more, and in Ontario, patients admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit may be forced to relinquish their place in long-term care homes after 60 days in hospital. Thus, the panel regarded it as essential that prescribers had the option around this deadline of using a drug with the potential to deliver a marked improvement within a few weeks, in at least a minority of cases. However, prescribers can skip steps in the algorithm, and when they consider carbamazepine unsuitable, they may move straight to Step 4, citalopram.

### Assessment and management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia [^b6ad5c7a]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia include agitation, depression, apathy, repetitive questioning, psychosis, aggression, sleep problems, wandering, and a variety of inappropriate behaviors. One or more of these symptoms will affect nearly all people with dementia over the course of their illness. These symptoms are among the most complex, stressful, and costly aspects of care, and they lead to a myriad of poor patient health outcomes, healthcare problems, and income loss for family care givers. The causes include neurobiologically related disease factors; unmet needs; care giver factors; environmental triggers; and interactions of individual, care giver, and environmental factors. The complexity of these symptoms means that there is no "one size fits all solution", and approaches tailored to the patient and the care giver are needed. Non-pharmacologic approaches should be used first line, although several exceptions are discussed. Non-pharmacologic approaches with the strongest evidence base involve family care giver interventions. Regarding pharmacologic treatments, antipsychotics have the strongest evidence base, although the risk to benefit ratio is a concern. An approach to integrating non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments is described. Finally, the paradigm shift needed to fully institute tailored treatments for people and families dealing with these symptoms in the community is discussed.

### An individualised, non-pharmacological treatment strategy associated with an improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms in a man with dementia living at home [^17a930d6]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

More than 90% of people with dementia experience neuropsychiatric symptoms which are often distressing and can result in early institutionalisation, diminished quality of life, increased frequency of emergency department visits along with stress and ill-health in caregivers. Non-pharmacological interventions are recommended as first-line treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms, instead of medications such as atypical antipsychotics which have significant side effects. Most systematic reviews of non-pharmacological interventions for neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia focus on patients in long-term care facilities and there are a limited number of research studies assessing the use of non-pharmacological interventions for patient's living at home. In this case report, we discuss an elderly man with dementia whose cognitive symptoms were accompanied by significant neuropsychiatric symptoms of suspicion, delusions, agitation and aggression. We describe how a programme of individualised, non-pharmacological interventions was associated with an improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms within 3 months.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^09fc09d4]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Drugs and physical treatments included in the main sequential treatment algorithm – evidence and rationale

Following review of patient's suitability for the algorithm, baseline assessments, and a "clean-up" or "washout" period (Figure 3), the algorithm begins with trials of antipsychotic drugs (Figure 4).systematically appraised existing guidelines for BPSD. They noted that there was a broad agreement among 15 clinical guidelines that antipsychotic drugs had the strongest evidence for treating BPSD. However, the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs comes at a cost for some individuals, as they carry risks of falls, excessive sedation, and metabolic abnormalities. A further concern is the reported increased risk of stroke and mortality associated with atypical antipsychotics. In general, guidelines recommend restricting the use of antipsychotic medications to where symptoms and their potential consequences meet specific criteria. For example, recent guidance from the American Psychiatric Association states "… nonemergency antipsychotic medication should only be used for the treatment of agitation or psychosis in patients with dementia when symptoms are severe, are dangerous, and/or cause significant distress to the patient" (: 24). However, in the hospital inpatient setting for which the algorithm was designed, many patients with dementia exhibiting agitation and aggression do indeed meet these criteria, for example being at significant risk of harming themselves or others and exhibiting clear evidence of distress. Where symptoms of agitation and aggression do not meet these criteria, this drug treatment algorithm should not be used.

Drug clean-up principles.

AchEI: acetycholinesterase inhibitor; BPSD: behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia; PRN: pro re nata.

While the recommended treatment sequence begins with antipsychotic agents, we have acknowledged that a minority of patients or their families and caregivers may not agree with the use of antipsychotic drugs, in which case drug treatment may need to start lower down the algorithm at Step 3. While several antipsychotic drugs have trial or meta-analytic evidence of efficacy for agitation and aggression associated with Alzheimer's disease, we selected three atypical antipsychotic drugs: risperidone, quetiapine, and aripiprazole.

Nursing home antipsychotic medication use — when used appropriately and cautiously, these medications can be modestly effective in reducing patient distress and increasing safety, but excessive dosing and sometimes even appropriate use can lead to worsening cognition, oversedation, falls, increased mortality, and tardive dyskinesia; regulations resulting from the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 and good clinical practice require documentation of indications, discussion of available alternatives, and identification of treatment outcomes, and the psychiatrist should regularly reassess patients for response and adverse effects, consider withdrawal, discontinue or continue medications, and reinstate prescriptions as clinically necessary; a structured educational program for staff has been shown to decrease antipsychotic use while maintaining care without adverse outcomes.

Atypical antipsychotics play a limited role in the management of dementia-related psychosis (DRP). Major adverse outcomes are associated with most antipsychotics in patients with dementia, and guidelines recommend that these drugs not be prescribed for long durations. When treating symptoms of DRP, clinicians should follow guidelines such as using medication only if the patient or others are in distress or danger and starting with low doses. Novel antipsychotics or alternative agents may offer superior efficacy and safety.

### Successful management of persistent distressing neuropsychiatric symptoms by clozapine in a patient suffering from dementia with lewy bodies [^04b4a4c8]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia associated with poor prognosis and high carers' burden. Neuropsychiatric symptoms worsen this prognosis and are a high source of distress for service users and their carers. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the pharmacological and non-pharmacological management of these symptoms. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the first-line pharmacological option, but challenging risky behaviours may persist despite their use. Antipsychotic medications are indicated in such clinical scenarios, but there is very limited evidence to support the efficacy and safety of these medications for managing neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB. Hence, we report an individual with DLB with severe distressing persistent visual hallucinations and agitation. After multiple treatment options had failed, clozapine was successfully initiated with substantial improvement in both clinical and functional outcomes. Further studies are warranted for evaluating the efficacy of clozapine in managing neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB.

Recommendation

The authors conclude that there should be a weak recommendation for discontinuation in patients currently treated with antipsychotics. Discontinuation of antipsychotics may be considered in patients for whom there is no obvious indication and in patients in whom there is suspicion of side effects, such as rapid cognitive decline, sedation, falls, or extrapyramidal symptoms.

Justification for recommendations

The identified studies did not show a significant positive or detrimental effect of discontinuation of antipsychotics. Observational studies have clearly demonstrated that treatment is associated with increased mortality in patients with dementia [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59].

Supplemental considerations for treatment of agitation/aggression with antipsychotics in dementia

We believe that treatment with antipsychotics may be relevant in selected patients with agitation and/or aggression. With the recommendations in this guideline, we wish to indicate that in those patients where antipsychotics are indicated, atypical antipsychotics will often be the first‐line treatment. Most medical specialties may get involved in the decision to start or stop antipsychotic treatment. A detailed neuropsychiatric assessment including medical and drug history must be performed before initiating antipsychotic treatment.

In particular factors such as infection, dehydration, pain, pulmonary or cardiac disease, environmental factors such as changes in living conditions, and other stressors should be identified and treated adequately by non‐pharmacological approaches. We believe that a principle of watchful waiting should be adopted before initiating treatment with antipsychotics. Anti‐dementia medication (cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine) should be instituted as indicated. Communication and interaction with professional and family caregivers should be optimized. It is the opinion of the authors that antipsychotic treatment may be necessary in patients with severe agitation and/or aggression causing harm to themselves or to other people. Shared decision‐making must be emphasized, and the patient as well as a legal guardian in instances where one has been appointed must be informed about the individual risk–benefit ratio. In instances where treatment with antipsychotics is initiated, starting low with slow uptitration to the minimally effective dose or until unacceptable side effects occur is, in the opinion of the authors, paramount. Follow‐up for all patients should be planned and a preplanned stop date should be considered since symptoms may remit spontaneously. Long‐term treatment (more than 3 months) may be necessary in a minority of patients and must be monitored carefully (e.g. effects on symptoms, body weight, cognition, extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation and ECG).

Summary of evidence

Four references reporting on the effect of atypical antipsychotics versus haloperidol were identified (Figure S4 and Tables S13 and S17). Three studies were RCTs [69, 70, 71] and one was an RCT with a crossover design [72]. Three studies compared risperidone (0.25 to 2 mg) to haloperidol (0.25 to 3 mg), and one study compared it with olanzapine (2.5 to 7.5 mg). There were no events in the studies reporting on mortality [69, 70, 72] or serious adverse events [71, 72]. With regard to agitation/aggression, two studies on risperidone reported that treatment with atypical antipsychotics improved scores [71, 72], and two studies, one on risperidone, the other on olanzapine, reported the converse [69, 70]. However, none of the studies reported measures of variance (Tables S18 and S19). None of the studies reported on caregiver burden. One study did not include a financial statement [69], and two studies reported receiving funding for the study from pharmaceutical companies [71, 72]. None of the studies included a conflicts of interest statement.

Level of evidence

The level of evidence was graded as very low (Tables S18 and S19).

Recommendation

The authors conclude that there should be a weak recommendation for treatment of patients with dementia and agitation/aggressive behavior with modern (atypical) antipsychotics compared to haloperidol when pharmacological treatment of agitation/aggressive behavior is necessary. Among modern (atypical) antipsychotics, risperidone may be considered as first‐line treatment when pharmacological treatment of agitation/aggressive behavior is necessary.

Justification for recommendations

Atypical antipsychotics is superior compared to placebo in reducing behavioral symptoms in patients with dementia, whereas haloperidol is not [73] and in elderly patients with various conditions, risperidone has been found to be as efficacious as haloperidol [74]. Moreover, several very large observational studies have demonstrated that haloperidol is associated with higher mortality, risk of pneumonia and cardiovascular disease compared to atypical antipsychotics (including risperidone) [53, 54].

Future research needs in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — priority areas include evaluation and assessment improvements, such as better detection and evaluation of dementia in the prodromal and early stages; identification of specific biomarkers and refinements in imaging techniques to facilitate diagnosis and treatment planning; earlier and more accurate detection of noncognitive symptoms; more accurate assessments of potentially dangerous behaviors such as driving; development of more clinically meaningful outcome measures, more refined neuropsychological tests, functional assessments, and wider use of "hard" endpoints such as institutionalization and mortality; pharmacologic advances with medications that improve cognition or halt progression, including agents that prevent plaque deposition, inhibit beta and gamma secretase, remove plaque and insoluble amyloid fragments, and prevent the formation of and remove neurofibrillary tangles (tau deposition), along with neuroprotective, neurotropic (nerve cell growth factors and cell transplants), and antioxidant approaches; medications that directly enhance cognition by activating intact cognitive systems; targeted therapies for other dementing disorders and efforts to prevent stroke and decrease its destructive effect on brain tissue as important avenues for prevention; optimal pharmacological treatment of behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms (psychosis, agitation, depression, sleep disturbance) with a critical need for well-designed, randomized, controlled trials given reliance on small uncontrolled studies; and further study of psychosocial, psychotherapeutic, and behavioral interventions, with particular importance of randomized controlled trials or alternatives, including that one aspect of dementia care that deserves further study is the rehabilitation model.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^ca27aa3d]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Neuropsychiatric assessment in dementia — prevalence, monitoring, and target symptoms: Ninety percent of patients with dementia develop a neuropsychiatric or behavioral symptom during the course of the disease, so it is important for the psychiatrist to periodically assess for noncognitive psychiatric symptoms and for progression of cognitive decline, with regular monitoring to detect new symptoms and adapt treatment. In Alzheimer's disease, depression is reported more commonly early in the illness, whereas delusions and hallucinations are more common in the middle and later stages, and it is particularly important to look for the emergence of such symptoms after a medication dose has been lowered or discontinued. Ongoing assessment should address depression, suicidal ideation or behavior, hallucinations, delusions, agitation, aggressive behavior, disinhibition, sexually inappropriate behavior, anxiety, apathy, and disturbances of appetite and sleep; cognitive symptoms that almost always require assessment include impairments in memory, executive function, language, judgment, and spatial abilities, and it is often helpful to track cognitive status with a structured mental status examination while watching for practice effects if the same instrument is used repeatedly.

### Management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia in clinical settings: recommendations from a multidisciplinary expert panel [^885bebc1]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

Noncognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia (aggression, agitation, depression, anxiety, delusions, hallucinations, apathy, disinhibition) affect individuals with dementia nearly universally across dementia stages and etiologies. NPS are associated with poor outcomes for individuals with dementia and caregivers, including excess morbidity and mortality, greater healthcare use, and earlier nursing home placement, as well as caregiver stress, depression, and difficulty with employment. Although the Food and Drug Administration has not approved pharmacotherapy for NPS, psychotropic medications are frequently used to manage these symptoms, but in the few cases of proven pharmacological efficacy, significant risk of adverse effects may offset benefits. There is evidence of efficacy and limited potential for adverse effects of nonpharmacological treatments, typically considered first line, but their uptake as preferred treatments remains inadequate in real-world clinical settings. Thus, the field currently finds itself in a predicament in terms of management of these difficult symptoms. It was in this context that the University of Michigan Program for Positive Aging, working in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and Center for Innovative Care in Aging sponsored and convened a multidisciplinary expert panel in Detroit, Michigan, in fall 2011 with three objectives: to define critical elements of care for NPS in dementia; to construct an approach describing the sequential and iterative steps of managing NPS in real-world clinical settings that can be used as a basis for integrating nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches; and to discuss how the approach generated could be implemented in research and clinical care.

Research question 4. 1

Should patients with dementia and agitation/aggressive behavior be treated with modern (atypical) antipsychotics compared to no pharmacological treatment?

PICO question

Population: Patients with dementia and agitation/aggressive behavior.

Intervention: Treatment with aripiprazole, zotepine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone or clozapine.

Comparator: No pharmacological treatment.

Outcome: 1. Mortality (Important); 2. Agitation/Aggression (Critical); 3. Global cognitive function (Important); 4. Serious adverse events (Critical); 5. Caregiver burden (Important).

Summary of evidence

A total of 4058 references were screened and seven references were included [62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68] (Figure S4 and Table S13 and S14). Two references reported on different outcomes from the same study [65, 66]. All studies included were RCTs. Studies were on risperidone (0.25 to 2 mg), quetiapine (25 to 200 mg) or olanzapine (2.5 to 15 mg). Meta‐analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity in populations, length of interventions and outcome measures. There were no differences in mortality between interventions and across studies [62, 64, 65, 67, 68] (relative risk point estimates 0.85–2.08; not significant) or serious adverse events [62, 63, 66, 67] (relative risk point estimates 0.89–1.9; not significant in all but one study [68]). However, there were, in general, very few events for the two outcomes, possibly because of the relatively low number of patients and short length of included trials (6–36 weeks; four studies ≤ 12 weeks). For both global cognitive function and agitation/aggression scores, there was no difference in change score between treatment and placebo, except for a single study [67]. None of the studies reported on caregiver burden (Table S15). All studies reported financial statements. All but one study [67] reported receiving some or all of the funding for the study from pharmaceutical companies. One study did not include a statement on conflict of interest [62] (Table S1).

Level of evidence

The level of evidence was graded as low (Tables S15 and S16).

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — sleep disturbance management emphasizes nonpharmacological strategies and careful sequencing; clinicians should consider behavioral and environmental interventions, combine nonpharmacological and pharmacological therapies, and seek to avoid use of multiple psychotropic medications; other initial steps may include establishing regular sleep and waking times, limiting daytime sleeping, avoiding fluid intake in the evening, establishing calming bedtime rituals, and providing adequate daytime physical and mental activities; pharmacological treatment should be instituted only after other measures have been unsuccessful and the potential benefits outweigh the risk of side effects; if another behavioral or neuropsychiatric condition is present and medications for that condition have sedative properties, clinical practice favors prescribing that agent at bedtime, if appropriate; if the patient has psychotic symptoms and sleep disturbance, second-generation antipsychotics may be the initial treatment of choice; if there are clear deficits in sleep hygiene, education and behavioral management might be the preferred treatment course; identification of sleep apnea is particularly important, which may affect 33%–70% of patients with dementia, and this condition is a relative contraindication to the use of benzodiazepines or other agents that suppress respiratory drive.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — benzodiazepines for agitation or anxiety: Benzodiazepines may have a higher likelihood of side effects and a lower likelihood of benefit than antipsychotics; their long-term use is generally to be avoided and they may be used on an occasional as-needed basis for rare agitation or procedures, with use kept to a minimum and a maximum of 1–3 mg of lorazepam (or equivalent doses of other benzodiazepines) in 24 hours. Oral lorazepam may be given on an as-needed basis in a dosage of 0.5 to 1.0 mg every 4–6 hours, with standard oral doses of 0.5–1.0 mg given from 1 to 2 times per day; oxazepam starting doses of 7.5–15.0 mg may be given 1 to 4 times per day; some clinicians prefer clonazepam starting at 0.5 mg/day with increases up to 2 mg/day. Many clinicians favor oxazepam and lorazepam because they do not require oxidative metabolism in the liver and have no active metabolites. Common adverse effects include sedation, ataxia, amnesia, confusion (even delirium), and possibly paradoxical anxiety, which can worsen cognition and behavior and increase the risk of falls; benzodiazepines also carry a risk of respiratory suppression in patients with sleep-related breathing disorders. Agents with long half-lives and long-lived metabolites can take weeks to reach steady-state levels and generally are not used in this patient population; elderly patients taking long-acting benzodiazepines are more likely to fall and to suffer hip fractures than those taking short-acting agents. If benzodiazepines are prescribed for an extended period (e.g., 1 month), they should be tapered rather than stopped abruptly because of the risk of withdrawal.

Purpose Of Review

We review non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches to managing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). We examine methods for assessment and evidence for interventions, focusing on recent findings and innovations. Finally, we recommend an algorithm for management of BPSD.

Recent Findings

Training of formal caregivers is the most effective intervention for BPSD; other non-pharmacological interventions are also beneficial. Antidepressants and antipsychotics remain a mainstay of pharmacological treatment for BPSD. There is limited evidence supporting the use of stimulants, cognitive enhancers, dextromethorphan/quinidine, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and pimavanserin. The management of BPSD is highly individualized. Following thorough assessment, the initial step is addressing contributing medical problems. Non-pharmacological interventions should be tried prior to pharmacological interventions. Antipsychotics should be prescribed only when behaviors pose a significant safety risk or if the person with dementia is very distressed. New approaches will be needed to address an increasing population of people with dementia.

Study design and sample selection

This study aimed to collect information for approximately 800 patients initiated on an antipsychotic medication for the treatment of agitation related to dementia. The index date was defined as the initiation date of an antipsychotic for the treatment of agitation related to dementia/Alzheimer's disease (AD). For patients who had received more than one antipsychotic for the treatment of their agitation before the chart abstraction date, the index date was the date of the last antipsychotic initiation in order to capture more contemporary data. Patients were observed until death or chart abstraction, whichever came first (see Supplementary Figure 1).

Physicians were eligible to participate in the survey if they were currently practicing medicine in the US, had treated at least 1 eligible patient with dementia, and had complete access to patients' medical charts, including information on use of antipsychotic therapy.

Patients were eligible if they 1) were suspected of having or diagnosed as having AD or other forms of dementia; 2) received an antipsychotic medication for the treatment of agitation related to dementia; and 3) were 55 to 90 years old at the index date. Patients were excluded from the study if they received an antipsychotic medication for the treatment of a condition other than agitation related to dementia; if they had a history of HIV, AIDS, stroke, or transient ischemic attack before the index date; or if they had an unknown living accommodation setting (i.e. it was unknown whether the patient lived in residential care or community-based settings). The index date was required to occur at least 90 days before the chart abstraction date to allow sufficient follow-up time for the observation of outcomes and no more than 2 years before the chart abstraction date to capture outcomes in contemporary practice. Physicians were allowed to select an option "Unknown" if they had no information for a given component of the chart abstraction. The proportion of physicians indicating "Unknown" was assessed for each component. No patients were excluded from the sample due to data incompleteness.

Parkinson's disease spectrum illnesses (including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies) — management priorities include monitoring, psychosis risk, and selective pharmacotherapy. The cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson's disease and related illnesses requires a broad treatment approach that targets both cognitive and noncognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms, and mild cognitive impairment may be partially ameliorated by dopaminergic agents prescribed for motor symptoms, so both cognitive and motor symptoms should be carefully monitored. Because dopaminergic agents predispose patients to visual hallucinations and other psychotic phenomena, especially in patients with dementia, these agents should be used with particular care, and the minimal dosage needed to control motor symptoms should be prescribed. Patients are vulnerable to delirium from medications and concomitant general medical conditions; therefore, development of these symptoms deserves thorough evaluation. Pharmacological and behavioral interventions have been shown to have beneficial effects for specific patients, but strong evidence guiding agent selection is lacking. Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on cognition in dementia with Lewy bodies and dementia with Parkinson's disease with effects similar to those seen in Alzheimer's disease. For noncognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia with Lewy bodies, if psychotic symptoms result in distress or danger, the judicious use of an antipsychotic agent, often at low doses, is indicated; although all antipsychotic agents can aggravate Parkinsonian motor disturbances and open-label data support second-generation antipsychotics, because antipsychotics can dramatically worsen dementia with Lewy bodies, they should be prescribed very cautiously. Depression is common in Parkinson's disease and may exacerbate functional impairment or be misinterpreted as dementia; data supporting psychotherapy or antidepressants are modest, but clinical experience supports their use.

Non-pharmacological interventions

The growing concerns over the efficacy and side effects of pharmacotherapy have resulted in the emphasis of non-pharmacological interventions as the first line treatment approach.

NICE UK in agreement with the American and the Canadian Association for Geriatric Psychiatry, as well as the European Association of Geriatric Psychiatry (EAGP) recommends the initial treatment approach for people who have agitation in all types and severities of dementia to be the non-pharmacological interventions.

This approach includes simple and complex interventions which are most often combined and provided to patients in a person-centered care approach. Examples of these interventions include multisensory stimulation, aromatherapy, music therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, animal-assisted therapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and physical exercises. These non-pharmacological interventions are increasingly being recognized globally as the crucial parts of the comprehensive dementia care due to its fewer risks compare to the drugs treatment. Unenthusiastically however, available evidence still shows that effective non-pharmacological interventions have not been widely embraced by the real-world clinical practice and standard of care. Kales et al. recommend a non-pharmacologic strategy called DICE approach to be used as a basis for integrating non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions in the real-world clinical settings. The DICE approach which comprises Describe, Investigate, Create and Evaluate, is essentially patient/caregiver-centered approach that describes sequential steps for thorough assessments to help manage neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. Kales et al. claim DICE model will provide clinicians with well-planned efficient treatment approach when integrated into clinical practice. Another model called Targeted Interdisciplinary Model for Evaluation and treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms (TIME) was described by Lichtwarck et al. as a multicomponent intervention program frequently employed by physicians and nursing home staff (in Norway) for assessing and treating behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia or other complex disorders. The TIME model consists of three interconnected phases of registration and assessment phase; a guided reflection phase; and an action and evaluation phase. These phases were extracted from the concepts of cognitive behavioral therapy and are to be tailored to individual patient. In 2016, Lichtwarck et al. published a study protocol on the proposed 3-month TIME trial to take place in 30 nursing homes (in Norway) involving 168 residents with high degree of dementia-related agitation, so as to evaluate the effectiveness-implementation of TIME model and its implementation process by staffs and at organization levels. The authors believe the result of TIME intervention model could become an evidence-based model that will improve assessment and treatment of agitation and other neuropsychiatry symptoms in dementia patients.

Background for treatment of agitation/aggressive behavior with antipsychotics in dementia

Aggression or agitation may occur during the course of the condition without obvious reasons or when patients with dementia experience stress (e.g. changes in the environment during hospitalization), as a result of a physical condition, or as side effects of drug treatment. A number of meta‐analyses have found that the efficacy of antipsychotics for treating agitation/aggression in patients with dementia, is modest and confers increased mortality and risk of cerebrovascular accidents [50, 51, 52]. In 2007 European regulatory agencies and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued warnings regarding the use of atypical antipsychotics in patients with dementia. This was extended by the European Medicines Agency in 2008 and the FDA in 2009 to include a warning regarding the use of all antipsychotics, partly based on a number of large observational studies and meta‐analyses that showed an increased mortality associated with treatment [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59], which has been confirmed in subsequent studies [2, 60].

However, antipsychotics may be used as first‐line pharmacological treatment in agitation/aggression under certain preconditions (after all non‐pharmacological measures have been proven to be without benefit or in the case of severe self‐harm or harm to others) [61]. This includes the use of risperidone, haloperidol and aripiprazole. Antipsychotics confer modest benefits for short‐term treatment of aggression/agitation in dementia [50, 51, 52], but these benefits have to be balanced against the risk of serious adverse events including increased mortality. The benefits are less clear‐cut with long‐term prescribing, but the mortality risk remains significantly elevated [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59]. Therefore, minimizing and individualizing (with regular assessment of the individual risk–benefit ratio) the use of antipsychotics and ensuring that treatment with antipsychotics is only instituted when non‐pharmacological treatment proves to be ineffective and when treatable causes of agitation/aggression have been ruled out, is necessary and will improve quality of life and function. A prescription or dose optimization of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine should be carried out in parallel to other measures, since the effects of this may only be evident with a delay of 8 to 12 weeks. Because of the risk of severe hypersensitivity to antipsychotics in patients with Lewy‐body dementia and Parkinson´s disease dementia, the recommendations for Research questions 4.1 and 4.2 do not extend to these patients.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^44166abe]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Over 35 m people have dementia worldwide and the prevalence is anticipated to double every 20 years. Alongside progressive loss of cognition and function, dementia presents another important challenge, collectively referred to as behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) or, alternatively, as neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia or non-cognitive symptoms of dementia. Up to 80% of patients with dementia present with BPSD at some stage of their illness. Presentations include psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and psychotic features such as hallucinations and delusions, as well as behavioural issues such as agitation, aggression, disinhibition, hypersexuality, wandering, sleeping and eating problems, and motor symptoms.

The presence of BPSD is associated with impaired quality of life, and increased rate of institutionalization and cost of care with many people having to live in residential care settings such as long-term care homes. When BPSD symptoms are severe, transfer to an inpatient setting may be the only option to allow adequate treatment. Thus, BPSD is a common problem on inpatient geriatric psychiatry units. Inadequately controlled BPSD may precipitate hospital admission by making it impossible for individuals to live at home with family members or in residential/nursing home settings. Furthermore, their emergence or persistence during an inpatient stay may prolong hospitalization and interfere with successful discharge. While BPSD may be associated with any form of dementia, this paper describes a drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression, specifically associated with Alzheimer's or mixed (Alzheimer's/vascular) dementia. It was originally designed for use by psychiatrists working in large teaching hospitals in Toronto and London, Ontario, Canada. While both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments have been reported to reduce BPSD symptoms, this paper addresses pharmacological treatments. For reference, non-pharmacological treatments which may be used alongside the drug treatments described here have been listed in Table 1.

Introduction

Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) include agitation and aggression in people with dementia. BPSD is common on inpatient psychogeriatric units and may prevent individuals from living at home or in residential/nursing home settings. Several drugs and non-pharmacological treatments have been shown to be effective in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. Algorithmic treatment may address the challenge of synthesizing this evidence-based knowledge.

Methods

A multidisciplinary team created evidence-based algorithms for the treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. We present drug treatment algorithms for agitation and aggression associated with Alzheimer's and mixed Alzheimer's/vascular dementia. Drugs were appraised by psychiatrists based on strength of evidence of efficacy, time to onset of clinical effect, tolerability, ease of use, and efficacy for indications other than behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia.

Results

After baseline assessment and discontinuation of potentially exacerbating medications, sequential trials are recommended with risperidone, aripiprazole or quetiapine, carbamazepine, citalopram, gabapentin, and prazosin. Titration schedules are proposed, with adjustments for frailty. Additional guidance is given on use of electroconvulsive therapy, optimization of existing cholinesterase inhibitors/memantine, and use of pro re nata medications.

Conclusion

This algorithm-based approach for drug treatment of agitation/aggression in Alzheimer's/mixed dementia has been implemented in several Canadian Hospital Inpatient Units. Impact should be assessed in future research.

### Treatment of psychosis and agitation in Alzheimer's disease… [^61130f37]. ClinicalTrials (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment of Psychosis and Agitation in Alzheimer's DiseaseClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Clinically, many patients with AD show no response or minimal response to antipsychotics for symptoms of agitation/aggression or psychosis, or they have intolerable side effects on these medications. Antipsychotics have a wide range of side effects, including the risk of increased mortality that led to an FDA black box warning for patients with dementia; a more recent review and meta-analysis showed a 54% increased risk of mortality. In addition, some patients show only partial response to antipsychotics and symptoms persist. For these reasons, the investigators need to study alternative treatment strategies. Currently, there is no FDA-approved medication for the treatment of psychosis or agitation in AD.

The investigators innovative project will examine the efficacy and side effects of low dose lithium treatment of agitation/aggression with or without psychosis in 80 patients with AD in a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial. The results will determine the potential for a large-scale clinical trial to establish the utility of lithium in these patients. Symptoms of psychosis or agitation are common in Alzheimer's disease. These symptoms are associated with distress for the patient, an increased burden for caregivers, more rapid cognitive decline, greater risk of institutionalization and mortality, and increased health care costs. In a recent meta-analysis, caregiver education and behavior modification studies revealed a small to medium effect size in treating agitation in these patients.

However, none of these studies were double-blind and none had a control group that received the same amount of staff time as the intervention group, thereby biasing the results toward the active intervention. Among the psychotropic medications that have been studied, only antipsychotics have shown superiority over placebo for the treatment of psychosis and agitation in patients with dementia. However, most studies show only moderate superiority for antipsychotic over placebo and a few studies have been negative. The side effects of antipsychotic medications include sedation, extrapyramidal signs, tardive dyskinesia, weight gain, and the metabolic syndrome. A pooled analysis from 17 short-term trials showed that the mortality rate in patients with dementia receiving antipsychotic medications was 1. 6 to

1. 7 times as high as the mortality rate in patients receiving placebo.

These findings led the FDA to issue a black-box warning for antipsychotic medication use in patients with dementia; a more recent meta-analysis reported a slightly lower odds ratio of 1.
54. Lithium has several different actions from anticonvulsants, though both are effective in bipolar disorder, especially mania. Lithium is not being proposed here to treat mania in AD though the investigators will monitor symptoms on the Young Mania Rating Scale. In patients with AD, lithium has been studied for its putative cognitive enhancing effects. A few reports suggest that chronic lithium use reduces the risk of dementia, but other data show increased dementia risk with lithium use.

### Brexpiprazole for the treatment of agitation in Alzheimer dementia… [^6b47e817]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Brexpiprazole, 2 or 3 mg, reduced agitation in Alzheimer dementia and was generally well tolerated over 12 weeks. Importance Agitation is a prevalent, distressing, and burdensome manifestation of Alzheimer dementia in need of an efficacious, safe, and well-tolerated treatment. ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT03548584 Agitation associated with dementia is defined as excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, or physical aggression, which causes excess distress or disability and cannot be solely attributed to a suboptimal care environment or another. disorder. 1 Agitation in dementia is common2, 3; has a negative effect on patient functioning, health outcomes, and quality of life3-5; increases caregiver distress and time spent caring5, 6; and may contribute to the patient being institutionalized.

7 Due to the lack of health-authority–approved pharmacological treatment options for agitation in dementia, physicians may prescribe off-label medications, 8, 9 despite having insufficient information about dosing, efficacy, and safety. Certain atypical antipsychotics have demonstrated efficacy on agitation in dementia but have an unfavorable benefit/risk profile that must be taken into consideration by patients and prescribing clinicians. 10, 11. Brexpiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic that acts on noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems, 12 which are implicated in the neurochemistry of agitation in Alzheimer disease. 13 Two prior randomized clinical trials suggested that brexpiprazole, 2 mg, may be efficacious, safe, and well tolerated in patients with agitation in Alzheimer dementia, 14 indicating its potential as a new treatment for agitation, provided that results could be replicated.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are universally experienced by people with dementia throughout the course of the illness and cause a significant negative impact on quality of life for patients and caregivers. Nonpharmacologic treatments have been recommended as first-line treatment of BPSD by multiple professional organizations and should target patients with dementia factors, caregiver factors, and environmental factors. Psychotropic medications are often prescribed off-label without significant evidence to support their use. The Describe, Investigate, Create, Evaluate approach can provide a structured method to investigate and treat BPSD with flexibility to use in multiple treatment settings.

### The management of agitation in demented patients with propranolol [^ea00655f]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Congress and the FDA have strongly suggested that tranquilizers and antipsychotics not be used in agitated demented frail elderly patients. The medical profession has not moved away from the tradition of antipsychotic sedation of such patients. Use of 'modern second generation low dose' antipsychotics continue to be the standard of care. Propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker with good penetration of the CNS, is a reasonable and safe alternative to sedatives and antipsychotics. Anti-dementia drugs are complementary to propranolol. A case study which contrasts the two pharmacologic approaches is detailed. A method of estimating delirium-agitation risk in dementia patients (DRN method) is described.

### Withdrawal versus continuation of long-term antipsychotic drug use for behavioural and psychological symptoms in older people with dementia [^7891e5c0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Antipsychotic agents are often used to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in people with dementia although there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of their long-term use for this indication and concern that they may cause harm, including higher mortality. When behavioural strategies have failed and treatment with antipsychotic drugs is instituted, regular attempts to withdraw them have been recommended in guidelines. Physicians, nurses and families of older people with dementia may be reluctant to stop antipsychotics, fearing deterioration of NPS. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2013.

Objectives

To evaluate whether withdrawal of antipsychotic agents is successful in older people with dementia and NPS in primary care or nursing home settings, to list the different strategies for withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older participants with dementia and NPS, and to measure the effects of withdrawal of antipsychotic agents on participants' behaviour and assess safety.

Search Methods

We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), theCochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources up to 11 January 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised, controlled trials comparing an antipsychotic withdrawal strategy to continuation of antipsychotics in people with dementia who had been treated with an antipsychotic drug for at least three months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the quality of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 10 studies involving 632 participants. One new trial (19 participants) was added for this update. One trial was conducted in a community setting, eight in nursing homes and one in both settings. Different types of antipsychotics at varying doses were discontinued in the studies. Both abrupt and gradual withdrawal schedules were used. Reported data were predominantly from studies at low or unclear risk of bias. We included nine trials with 575 randomised participants that used a proxy outcome for overall success of antipsychotic withdrawal. Pooling data was not possible due to heterogeneity of outcome measures used. Based on assessment of seven studies, discontinuation may make little or no difference to whether or not participants complete the study (low-quality evidence). Two trials included only participants with psychosis, agitation or aggression who had responded to antipsychotic treatment. In these two trials, stopping antipsychotics was associated with a higher risk of leaving the study early due to symptomatic relapse or a shorter time to symptomatic relapse. We found low-quality evidence that discontinuation may make little or no difference to overall NPS, measured using various scales (7 trials, 519 participants). There was some evidence from subgroup analyses in two trials that discontinuation may reduce agitation for participants with less severe NPS at baseline, but may be associated with a worsening of NPS in participants with more severe NPS at baseline. None of the studies assessed withdrawal symptoms. Adverse effects of antipsychotics (such as falls) were not systematically assessed. Low-quality evidence showed that discontinuation may have little or no effect on adverse events (5 trials, 381 participants), quality of life (2 trials, 119 participants), or cognitive function (5 trials, 365 participants). There were insufficient data to determine whether discontinuation of antipsychotics has any effect on mortality (very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is low-quality evidence that antipsychotics may be successfully discontinued in older people with dementia and NPS who have been taking antipsychotics for at least three months, and that discontinuation may have little or no important effect on behavioural and psychological symptoms. This is consistent with the observation that most behavioural complications of dementia are intermittent and often do not persist for longer than three months. Discontinuation may have little or no effect on overall cognitive function. Discontinuation may make no difference to adverse events and quality of life. Based on the trials in this review, we are uncertain whether discontinuation of antipsychotics leads to a decrease in mortality. People with psychosis, aggression or agitation who responded well to long-term antipsychotic drug use, or those with more severe NPS at baseline, may benefit behaviourally from continuation of antipsychotics. Discontinuation may reduce agitation for people with mild NPS at baseline. However, these conclusions are based on few studies or small subgroups and further evidence of benefits and harms associated with withdrawal of antipsychotic is required in people with dementia and mild and severe NPS. The overall conclusions of the review have not changed since 2013 and the number of available trials remains low.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^9ad522ca]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Moderately impaired patients with Alzheimer's disease — safety, supervision, driving, supports, and symptom management should be addressed routinely. As patients become more impaired, they are likely to require more supervision to remain safe, and safety issues should be addressed as part of every evaluation. Families should be advised about the possibility of accidents due to forgetfulness, of difficulties coping with household emergencies, and of the possibility of wandering, and should be advised to determine whether the patient is handling finances appropriately and to consider taking over the paying of bills and other responsibilities. At this stage of the disease, nearly all patients should not drive, and families should be counseled to undertake measures to prevent patients from driving. A referral for some form of respite care may be helpful, and families should begin to consider and plan for additional support at home as well as discuss the patient's possible transfer to a long-term care facility. Treatment for cognitive symptoms should also be considered; for patients with Alzheimer's disease, currently available data suggest that the combination of a cholinesterase inhibitor plus memantine is more likely to delay symptom progression than a cholinesterase inhibitor alone during this stage of the illness. Delusions, hallucinations, agitation, and combativeness are prevalent, it may be helpful to reassure families that these symptoms are often treatable, and for patients in whom wandering is the only symptom, pharmacotherapy will rarely be indicated.

### The psychopharmacology algorithm project at the harvard south shore program: an update on management of behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia [^5c1223ff]. Psychiatry Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Geriatric patients with dementia frequently present with agitation, aggression, psychosis, and other behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). We present an update of our previously published algorithms for the use of psychopharmacologic agents in these patients taking into account more recent studies and findings in meta-analyses, reviews, and other published algorithms. We propose three algorithms: BPSD in an emergent, urgent, and non-urgent setting. In the emergent setting when intramuscular (IM) administration is necessary, the first-line recommendation is for olanzapine (since IM aripiprazole, previously favored, is no longer available) and haloperidol injection is the second choice, followed by possible consideration of an IM benzodiazepine. In the urgent setting, the first line would be oral second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) aripiprazole and risperidone. Perhaps next could be then prazosin, and lastly electroconvulsive therapy is a consideration. There are risks associated with these agents, and adverse effects can be severe. Dosing strategies, discontinuation considerations, and side effects are discussed. In the non-emergent setting, medications are proposed for use in the following order: trazodone, donepezil and memantine, antidepressants such as escitalopram and sertraline, SGAs, prazosin, and carbamazepine. Other options with less support but potential future promise are discussed.

### Psychotropic drug treatment for agitated behaviour in dementia: what if the guideline prescribing recommendations are not sufficient? A qualitative study [^a1466ed5]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Reanalysis of problem and cause

The physicians indicated that when (previous) guideline-treatment failed, they would first reanalyse the situation. They said they considered what had already been done and whether the advice in the guideline had been sufficiently tried. In addition, they indicated that they wanted to have a full understanding of the patient's behaviour and to look for underlying causes or other leads.

E17-F4: 'I actually always start with an analysis, why does this resident actually show this behaviour?'

Physicians pointed out several factors they considered during the analysis. These included (a) specification of the agitation, (b) person-related factors and (c) underlying causes.

Specification of the agitation

Physicians described that they tried to specify the agitation. They considered the type, the severity and the occurrence of the agitated behaviour. The different types of agitation that were mentioned included aggression, nocturnal agitation, disinhibited behaviour, sexual disinhibition, compulsive behaviour, constant request of attention, repetitive calling/shouting and motor restlessness. Next to the type of agitation, they mentioned to consider the severity of the behaviour. Lastly, they also took into account the actual condition and situation in which the agitation occurred.

E3-F1: 'We have behavioural consultations with the multidisciplinary team every week, and we always try to explore, like, what type of behaviour are we actually talking about'.
Person-related factors

Physicians stated that it is very important to know the person in front of you to better understand their behaviour. They explored the patients' biography, personality and coping strategies.

E9-F2: 'And then you ask, gosh, what kind of person did he use to be, what is his life history? What kind of training? What was his coping strategy? What was meaningful? And a very important one: is this someone with a need for autonomy or not? And did he experience any traumas?'

Underlying causes

It was indicated that there is usually something underlying the agitation. Physicians said they considered psychiatric or somatic underlying causes and also external provoking factors.

E10-F3: 'Right, because agitation usually follows from something. Usually there's something of… erm… at the root of it, isn't there? Anxiety, or depression or… '.

Multiple different psychiatric causes were mentioned as possible underlying causes. These include anxiety, depressive symptoms, psychotic symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSS)/trauma, personality disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and intellectual disability.

Interventions for treating non-cognitive symptoms in people with dementia

Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are linked to negative outcomes such as faster cognitive decline, greater dependency, and higher risks of institutionalisation and mortality. BPSD also affects the well-being and QoL of PwD and their caregivers, making management challenging for healthcare professionals, who require specific training. Clinical assessment should aim to identify medical, psychological and environmental triggers. Non-pharmacological treatments are widely considered as a first-line intervention for non-cognitive symptoms, though psychotropic agents are often used despite their being off-label and their uncertain risk–benefit profile.

Two RQs focused on RCTs assessing the safety and efficacy of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for non-cognitive symptoms in PwD. Overall, 143 studies were included in the literature review, of which 72 on pharmacological interventions (16 from the literature update) and 71 on non-pharmacological interventions (34 from the literature update). Evidence summaries and therapeutic indications for pharmacological interventions are provided in Supplementary Tables S6 and S7.

The WG underlined that psychotropic agents should be prescribed with caution in PwD, carefully considering the balance between potential benefits and the risk for adverse event. Available evidence did not support the use of antidepressants for the treatment of mild to moderate depressive disorders in people with mild to moderate dementia. Therefore, the WG agreed to recommend not offering antidepressants in people with mild to moderate dementia, if not indicated for a pre-existing severe mental health condition. A specific recommendation against offering bupropion was included due to its risk–benefit profile.

When considering antipsychotics, based on their risk–benefit profile, the WG agreed to recommend limiting their use in people at risk of harm themselves or experiencing agitation, hallucinations or delusions causing them severe distress. When needed, antipsychotics should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time, reassessing people every 4 weeks. The option of discontinuing treatment should be considered in case the person is not getting a clear ongoing benefit and should be discussed with PwD and their caregivers. Antipsychotics may worsen motor symptoms in PDD and DLB, potentially causing severe sensitivity reactions.

Introduction

Alzheimer disease and dementias of other types are accompanied by myriad behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms that adversely affect the quality of life of persons living with dementia (PLWD) and their care partners. The most common neuropsychiatric symptoms are depression, apathy, and agitation with 66 percent of PLWD having a diagnosis of these symptoms in a single year. Over the course of disease, it is estimated that up to 50% of PLWD experience agitation symptomsand up to 90% among persons with Alzheimer disease. Use of CNS active drugs, including antidepressants, atypical and typical antipsychotics, hypnotics, anxiolytics, and anticonvulsants, is prevalent among PLWD.

In 2024, the International Psychogeriatric Association published a consensus algorithm to guide agitation reduction and prevention in persons with neurocognitive disorders through integration of psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions. Until recently, there were no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved pharmacologic treatments for agitation for PLWD and prescribing was "off label". There are relatively few studies of the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy for agitation in PLWD. Antipsychotics are the most commonly used pharmaceutical agents for PLWD with moderate-to-severe agitation. Although double-blind placebo-controlled studies of risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, and brexpiprazolereported small reductions in agitation, only brexpiprazole was studied in a large, phase 3 trial intended to obtain FDA approval.

In May 2023, the FDA announced approval of the atypical antipsychotic, brexpiprazole, under the brand name Rexulti, for treating agitation in persons with Alzheimer disease citing favorable efficacy and safety profiles in clinical trials. However, a serious consideration for use of antipsychotics is that they have been shown to increase the risk of death in persons with dementia, and thus brexpiprazole, like other antipsychotics, includes a FDA black box warning. The trials of 345 persons with Alzheimer's disease assessed the safety and efficacy of brexpiprazole in persons with Alzheimer disease and demonstrated improvement in agitation over a 12-week period, relative to placebo. Across all 3 published trials, 7 patients died during the phase 3 trial–6 participants treated with brexpiprazole and one in the control group. Study investigators reported that the deaths were unrelated to treatment but acknowledged that with limited duration of treatment, longer-term safety data were needed.

### Therapeutic window of dopamine D2 / 3 receptor occupancy to treat psychosis in Alzheimer's disease [^f39c2949]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

See Caravaggio and Graff-Guerrero (doi:10.1093/awx023) for a scientific commentary on this article. Antipsychotic drugs, originally developed to treat schizophrenia, are used to treat psychosis, agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's disease. In the absence of dopamine D2/3 receptor occupancy data to inform antipsychotic prescribing for psychosis in Alzheimer's disease, the mechanisms underpinning antipsychotic efficacy and side effects are poorly understood. This study used a population approach to investigate the relationship between amisulpride blood concentration and central D2/3 occupancy in older people with Alzheimer's disease by combining: (i) pharmacokinetic data (280 venous samples) from a phase I single (50 mg) dose study in healthy older people (n = 20, 65–79 years); (ii) pharmacokinetic, 18F-fallypride D2/3 receptor imaging and clinical outcome data on patients with Alzheimer's disease who were prescribed amisulpride (25–75 mg daily) to treat psychosis as part of an open study (n = 28; 69–92 years; 41 blood samples, five pretreatment scans, 19 post-treatment scans); and (iii) 18F-fallypride imaging of an antipsychotic free Alzheimer's disease control group (n = 10, 78–92 years), to provide additional pretreatment data. Non-linear mixed effects modelling was used to describe pharmacokinetic-occupancy curves in caudate, putamen and thalamus. Model outputs were used to estimate threshold steady state blood concentration and occupancy required to elicit a clinically relevant response (> 25% reduction in scores on delusions, hallucinations and agitation domains of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory) and extrapyramidal side effects (Simpson Angus Scale scores > 3). Average steady state blood levels were low (71 ± 30 ng/ml), and associated with high D2/3 occupancies (65 ± 8%, caudate; 67 ± 11%, thalamus; 52 ± 11%, putamen). Antipsychotic clinical response occurred at a threshold concentration of 20 ng/ml and D2/3 occupancies of 43% (caudate), 25% (putamen), 43% (thalamus). Extrapyramidal side effects (n = 7) emerged at a threshold concentration of 60 ng/ml, and D2/3 occupancies of 61% (caudate), 49% (putamen) and 69% (thalamus). This study has established that, as in schizophrenia, there is a therapeutic window of D2/3 receptor occupancy for optimal treatment of psychosis in Alzheimer's disease. We have also shown that occupancies within and beyond this window are achieved at very low amisulpride doses in Alzheimer's disease due to higher than anticipated occupancies for a given blood drug concentration. Our findings support a central pharmacokinetic contribution to antipsychotic sensitivity in Alzheimer's disease and implicate the blood-brain barrier, which controls central drug access. Whether high D2/3 receptor occupancies are primarily accounted for by age- or disease-specific blood-brain barrier disruption is unclear, and this is an important future area of future investigation, as it has implications beyond antipsychotic prescribing.

Dementia with Lewy bodies — clinical features, cautions, and frequency: Dementia with Lewy bodies has been recognized clinically only in the last 10–15 years and differs from Alzheimer's disease by earlier, more prominent visual hallucinations, early parkinsonian features (postural instability and falls), cognitive fluctuations lasting days to weeks, and a somewhat more rapid evolution. Patients are markedly sensitive to the extrapyramidal effects of antipsychotic medications, and these medications should be used only with the utmost caution. Lewy bodies may account for as many as 7%–26% of dementia cases, depending on the criteria used. The neuropathology of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are interrelated with an abundance of Lewy inclusion bodies in both subcortical and cortical regions; autopsy often reveals both dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease, creating controversy about their independence, and development of valid clinical and pathological diagnostic criteria is an area of active research.

Dementia of the Alzheimer's type — Alzheimer's disease has insidious onset and gradual progression, most commonly beginning with deficits in recent memory that are followed by aphasia, visuospatial perceptual impairments, apraxia, and agnosia; neuropsychiatric symptoms are common early while psychotic and behavioral disturbances are more common in middle and later stages, and late features include incontinence, gait and motor disturbances, becoming mute and bed bound, with seizures and myoclonus late. Diagnosis should be made only when the typical symptom profile is present and other etiologies have been ruled out, a definitive diagnosis requires both the clinical syndrome and microscopic examination of the brain at autopsy, and a careful clinical diagnosis conforms to the pathological diagnosis 70%–90% of the time. Onset generally occurs in late life (most commonly in the 60s, 70s, and 80s and beyond, with rare instances in the 40s and 50s), incidence increases with age with estimates of 0.5% per year from age 65–69 years, 1% per year from age 70–74 years, 2% per year from age 75–79 years, 3% per year from age 80–84 years, and 8% per year from age 85 years onward, and progression averages 8–10 years from symptom onset to death. In DSM-IV-TR, Alzheimer's disease is subdivided into "With Early Onset" and "With Late Onset", as well as "With and Without Behavioral Disturbance".

### Cognitive effects of atypical antipsychotics in patients with Alzheimer's disease and comorbid psychiatric or behavioral problems: a retrospective study [^2abef7dc]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In addition to cognitive decline, 30% to 40% of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) experience concomitant psychiatric and behavioral complications, such as hallucinations, delusions, and aggression. Atypical antipsychotics (AAs) are used to treat psychosis and aggressive behaviors in these patients; however, data regarding their early effects on cognition are conflicting. Based on a literature search, the cognitive effects of long-term treatment with AAs in outpatients with AD have not been studied.

Objective

The aim of this study was to describe and compare the rate of cognitive decline with longterm AA use in adult patients with AD receiving concomitant treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors.

Methods

This study was conducted at the Department of Neurology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. Data were collected from the charts of adult outpatients who (1) received care at Memory Disorders Clinic, Columbus, Ohio, between April 2003 and June 2005; (2) were aged ≥ 55 years with a diagnosis of mild to severe definite or probable AD; (3) received an AA for ≥ 6 months or did not receive any AA; and (4) received a cholinesterase inhibitor during the entire evaluation period. Cognitive function, as measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), was compared between those who received AA treatment and those who did not. The end point was the rate of decline in cognitive function, defined as annualized change in mean MMSE score from baseline to the end of follow-up.

Results

Ninety-two outpatients were included in the final analysis (67 women, 25 men; mean age, 72.4 years). Thirty-four patients received treatment with an AA for 6 ≥ months (mean duration of treatment, 421 days) and 58 did not receive any AA treatment. Quetiapine (mean dose, 67 mg/d) was prescribed to 28 (82%) of the patients receiving an AA. The AAs were prescribed for psychosis (15 [44%] patients), psychosis/agitation (11 [32%]), and agitation/aggression (8 [24%]). The baseline mean MMSE scores in patients receiving and not receiving an AA were 14.65 and 17.88, respectively (P = 0.021), with mean (SD) annual rates of cognitive decline of 3.03 (1.84) and 2.24 (1.27), respectively (P = NS).

Conclusion

The results from this retrospective study of data from a small, selected group of outpatients with AD did not find a significant difference in the rate of cognitive decline between those who received an AA for ≥ 6 months and those who did not.

### Behavioral disorders in dementia: appropriate nondrug interventions and antipsychotic use [^f3335e4d]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia pose management challenges for caregivers and clinicians. Firstline nonpharmacologic treatments include eliminating physical and emotional stressors, modifying the patient's environment, and establishing daily routines. Family members and caregivers benefit from education about dementia symptoms and reminders that the behaviors are normal and unintentional. Cognitive and emotion-oriented interventions, sensory stimulation interventions, behavior management techniques, and other psychosocial interventions are modestly effective. In refractory cases, physicians may choose to prescribe off-label antipsychotics. Aripiprazole has the most consistent evidence of symptom improvement; however, this improvement is small. Olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone have inconsistent evidence of benefit. Physicians should use the smallest effective dose for the shortest possible duration to minimize adverse effects, most notably an increased mortality risk. Other adverse effects include anticholinergic and antidopaminergic effects, extrapyramidal symptoms, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, postural hypotension, metabolic syndrome, cardiac arrhythmia, and sedation. Patients should be monitored for these effects while receiving treatment; however, laboratory monitoring may be limited to patients receiving long-term therapy.
