## Question

At which gestational ages can cell-free DNA testing be performed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate gestational age window for cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing, including the minimum, optimal, and practical upper limits, and how patient or assay factors might modify timing recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological constraint of fetal fraction and when it becomes reliably adequate. Then, I should verify guideline-based lower limits for gestational age. Next, I will examine whether there is a clinical upper limit or only a practical window and why. After that, I should review modifiers such as maternal BMI, multifetal gestations, medications, and redraw strategies. Finally, I need to synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer and ensure I emphasize confirmatory diagnostic testing and counseling points consistent with guidelines [^114CrwjL] [^112Vo8Eo].

> Let me first confirm the biological foundation because that anchors the timing; cfDNA screening performance hinges on the fetal fraction (FF), which needs to meet assay-specific minimums, commonly around 4%, although some platforms can detect aneuploidy at 2–4% depending on methodology [^112ee6d3] [^114ZYYzs] [^114txkpX]. Wait, let me verify the earliest gestational timing when FF is usually sufficient; while placental DNA is present very early, FF prior to about 9–10 weeks is often too low, leading to no-calls or reduced analytical separation, which justifies avoiding blood draws before 10 weeks for aneuploidy screening [^112ee6d3] [^114txkpX].

> Next, I should review the consensus lower limit from high-credibility guidelines; both SOGC and ACOG/SMFM frame cfDNA as a first-trimester screening tool and state it is highly effective when performed after 10 weeks' gestation, so the minimum recommended gestational age is 10 weeks by last menstrual period timing [^114CrwjL] [^112Vo8Eo]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; some assays report detection at FF below 4%, but guideline-level implementation still standardizes the earliest draw to 10 weeks to minimize failure rates and maximize reliability, so I should keep 10 weeks as the practical threshold [^114ZYYzs] [^114CrwjL].

> I will now examine the practical upper limit and the typical clinical window; there is no strict biological maximum, but most screening pathways emphasize offering aneuploidy screening before 20 weeks because results after that point reduce time for diagnostic confirmation and options for pregnancy management, which is why many programs operationalize screening at less than 20 weeks' gestation as the routine offer [^1155QhDb]. But wait, what if testing is done later; feasibility clearly extends beyond 20 weeks, with validated cfDNA applications like fetal RHD genotyping reporting successful testing from 9.0 up to 36.7 weeks, confirming there is no hard upper biological cut-off even though utility wanes later in gestation [^116CVYmM] [^114AucSK].

> Let me think about why early first-trimester testing is considered optimal; earlier cfDNA facilitates earlier confirmatory diagnostics such as CVS at 10–12 weeks or amniocentesis after 15 weeks, which translates into earlier, safer decision-making and has been associated with earlier gestational age at diagnosis and termination when indicated after a positive screening result, supporting an optimal screening window around 10–14 weeks [^112Vo8Eo] [^111HXsYs] [^1149ABzw]. I should confirm that this aligns with counseling norms; yes, guidelines emphasize that cfDNA is a screening test and positives require diagnostic confirmation, reinforcing the value of testing early enough to allow timely follow-up [^114CrwjL] [^112Vo8Eo].

> Now, I need to consider modifiers of timing within that window; maternal weight inversely correlates with FF, and several clinical factors, including heparin and aspirin use, are associated with higher nonreportable rates, so for individuals with higher BMI or on these medications, waiting until 12–14 weeks or drawing in the afternoon if feasible might improve FF and reduce no-calls, though the diurnal suggestion is emerging and should be contextualized carefully [^111tKgJW] [^114txkpX] [^113d5WDy]. Hold on, I should verify the diurnal data; recent analyses indicate modest afternoon increases in FF, but I need to ensure I'm not over-interpreting a single dataset, so I will treat this as a potential optimization rather than a firm requirement [^113d5WDy].

> Regarding multiple gestations, I initially thought that twins always have a higher FF and thus could be tested earlier, but wait, I should verify; although total FF tends to increase with gestational age similarly in twins and singletons, per-fetus FF considerations and zygosity can complicate interpretation, so the same 10-week lower limit remains prudent, and testing performance depends on platform and validation data in twins rather than simply assuming higher FF translates to earlier reliable testing [^116dtjaQ] [^112Vo8Eo]. Let me reconsider; the safest course is to adhere to the 10-week minimum and rely on platform-specific twin performance characteristics rather than advancing the draw date in twins based on FF assumptions alone [^116dtjaQ] [^112Vo8Eo].

> I should double-check redraw strategies after a no-call due to low FF; informative redraws are commonly performed 5–28 days after the initial draw, with success tied to initial FF and maternal weight and, interestingly, gestational age was not a strong determinant of redraw success in at least one large dataset, which means scheduling a redraw should balance the likelihood of result with the clinical timeline for confirmatory testing and management decisions [^113Jd2kc]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; although GA per se may not drive redraw success in that cohort, FF does typically rise with advancing gestation on average, so a short interval delay can still be reasonable if it preserves actionability before the second-trimester diagnostic window closes [^114txkpX] [^113Jd2kc].

> Next, I should review special indications that shift timing; for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of monogenic disorders, many accredited programs implement testing once FF is sufficient, often at or after 12 weeks for reliable assay performance, and case reports demonstrate feasibility at 12 and 16 weeks for specific single-gene conditions, consistent with a later minimum than aneuploidy screening in some workflows [^113fJCeQ] [^111wV3P5] [^114pj3hK]. I need to ensure I mention RHD genotyping as well; fetal RHD testing has been validated across a wide gestational span including late gestation, again illustrating feasibility beyond the typical aneuploidy screening window though clinical utility should guide timing [^116CVYmM] [^114AucSK].

> I will now integrate counseling and test scope considerations that influence timing choices; cfDNA for microdeletions or sex chromosome aneuploidies has lower and more variable predictive values than for common trisomies, so routine screening for these is not universally recommended, and pretest counseling should set expectations about PPV and the need for diagnostic confirmation of positive results, which becomes especially important when testing later in gestation where options may be constrained [^114CrwjL] [^112Vo8Eo] [^1155QhDb]. Let me first confirm the core guidance; ACOG and SOGC consistently underscore that cfDNA is a screening test and that abnormal or uninterpretable results warrant genetic counseling and offer of diagnostic testing, irrespective of gestational age at screening [^112Vo8Eo] [^111HXsYs] [^114CrwjL].

> Synthesis and final position; cfDNA aneuploidy screening should begin at 10 weeks' gestation at the earliest, with an optimal clinical window of roughly 10–14 weeks to maximize time for confirmatory CVS or later amniocentesis and informed decision-making, while a practical screening window commonly extends to less than 20 weeks in routine pathways, acknowledging that testing remains technically feasible thereafter but with diminishing clinical utility as gestation advances, feasible but… but wait… but with limited utility for general aneuploidy screening unless there are specific indications or late presentation [^114CrwjL] [^1155QhDb] [^116CVYmM] [^1149ABzw]. I need to ensure I highlight individualized adjustments; for higher BMI, certain medications, or prior no-call, consider a slightly later draw or a short-interval redraw to improve FF while preserving actionability, and in twins or specialized indications such as monogenic NIPD or RHD genotyping, adhere to validated assay timing and performance characteristics rather than deviating from the 10-week minimum without supportive data [^111tKgJW] [^113Jd2kc] [^116dtjaQ] [^113fJCeQ] [^116CVYmM].

Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing is **recommended from 10 weeks gestation** [^114CrwjL] because fetal fraction is reliably sufficient for accurate results [^112Vo8Eo] [^114ZYYzs]. Testing before 10 weeks is discouraged due to low fetal fraction [^112ee6d3] and higher no-call rates [^114CrwjL] [^114txkpX]. There is no strict upper gestational limit, but **clinical utility declines after 24 weeks** as management options narrow [^112Vo8Eo] [^1149ABzw]; cfDNA is most useful when performed between 10 and 20 weeks [^1155QhDb]. If a no-call result occurs, a redraw after 1–2 weeks is reasonable [^113Jd2kc], but persistent low fetal fraction may indicate placental dysfunction and warrants further evaluation [^113xJG5f] [^112TdoBD].

---

## Earliest gestational age for cfDNA testing

- **Earliest gestational age**: cfDNA testing is recommended from 10 weeks gestation [^114CrwjL], when fetal fraction is typically ≥ 4% [^114ZYYzs] and results are reliable [^112Vo8Eo].

- **Rationale**: Before 10 weeks, fetal fraction is often too low [^114txkpX], increasing no-call rates and reducing accuracy [^112ee6d3].

- **Clinical guidance**: SOGC 2024 [^114CrwjL] and ACOG/SMFM 2020 [^112Vo8Eo] recommend cfDNA as a highly effective screen for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 when performed after 10 weeks [^1155QhDb].

---

## Optimal gestational age range for cfDNA testing

The optimal gestational age range for cfDNA testing is **10–20 weeks**, balancing accuracy with clinical utility; testing earlier in this window facilitates timely confirmatory diagnostics and management decisions [^112Vo8Eo] [^1155QhDb]. Fetal fraction rises with gestational age, further improving test performance during this period [^116dtjaQ] [^113d5WDy].

---

## Upper gestational age limit for cfDNA testing

No strict upper gestational age limit exists for cfDNA testing [^112Vo8Eo], but **clinical utility declines after 24 weeks** as management options narrow [^1149ABzw]. Testing can still be performed after this point, though results may have limited impact on management. Professional guidelines from SOGC and ACOG/SMFM emphasize early testing for maximal clinical benefit [^114CrwjL] [^111HXsYs].

---

## Factors influencing cfDNA testing accuracy by gestational age

- **Fetal fraction**: Increases with gestational age, improving accuracy [^116dtjaQ]; low fetal fraction (< 4%) [^114ZYYzs] is a key cause of no-calls [^112ee6d3] [^113d5WDy].

- **Maternal factors**: Higher BMI, heparin/aspirin use, chronic hypertension, and diabetes increase no-call rates [^111tKgJW].

- **Technical factors**: Sequencing depth and platform [^111F2cKv] affect performance [^113gJavR], especially at low fetal fraction [^113y7RnY].

---

## Clinical implications of testing outside recommended gestational ages

- **Early testing (< 10 weeks)**: Higher no-call rates and reduced accuracy due to low fetal fraction [^112ee6d3] [^114CrwjL].

- **Late testing (> 24 weeks)**: Limited clinical utility as management options narrow [^112Vo8Eo] [^1155QhDb], though accuracy remains high if fetal fraction is adequate.

- **No-call results**: Often due to low fetal fraction [^112ee6d3]; a redraw after 1–2 weeks is reasonable [^113Jd2kc], but persistent low fetal fraction may signal placental dysfunction and warrants further evaluation [^113xJG5f] [^112TdoBD].

## Summary table: cfDNA testing by gestational age

| **Gestational age** | **Clinical utility** | **Accuracy** | **Recommendations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| < 10 weeks | Limited (low fetal fraction) | Lower (higher no-call rate) | Not recommended |
| 10–20 weeks | High (optimal window) | High (adequate fetal fraction) | Recommended |
| 20–24 weeks | Moderate (utility declines) | High (adequate fetal fraction) | Acceptable |
| > 24 weeks | Limited (fewer options) | High (if fetal fraction adequate) | Use selectively |

---

cfDNA testing is **best performed from 10 weeks** gestation, with optimal utility between 10 and 20 weeks [^114CrwjL] [^1155QhDb]; after 24 weeks, utility declines [^112Vo8Eo] even though accuracy remains high if fetal fraction is sufficient [^113d5WDy].

### Factors associated with informative redraw after an initial no result in noninvasive prenatal testing [^113Jd2kc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) sometimes fails to provide a result due to low cell-free DNA fetal fraction. We investigated how initial fetal fraction, maternal weight, gestational age, and time between blood sampling contribute to obtaining an informative result when a redraw is performed.

We performed a retrospective data review of NIPT samples received between January and October 2016 by a commercial laboratory, where the initial blood draw did not yield a result and a second sample was drawn between 5 and 28 days after the initial sampling. We included cases with fetal fraction less than 2.8% (the threshold for "no result" in this laboratory) and those with higher fetal fraction but where the NIPT results could not be interpreted with high confidence.

For 4,018 cases in which a redraw was recommended, a result was obtained for the second sample in 2,835 cases (70.6%) [95% CI 69.1–72.0%]. For the 2,959 cases with insufficient fetal fraction, there was a result for the second sample in 1,861 cases (62.9%) [95% CI 61.1–64.6%]. For this subset, the average increase in fetal fraction was 1.2% with an average interval between draws of 14 days. Informative redraw rate was strongly dependent on maternal weight and fetal fraction measured at the first draw. Gestational age was not an important determinant. Informative redraw rate increased rapidly over the first 8 days after the initial draw and more slowly thereafter.

Based on fetal fraction in the initial sample, maternal weight, and interval between blood sampling, the likelihood of obtaining an informative redraw can be assessed.

### Guideline no. 456: Prenatal screening for fetal chromosomal anomalies [^114CrwjL]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2024). High credibility.

Regarding prenatal screening for chromosomal abnormalities, specifically in choosing the appropriate screening test, the SOGC 2024 guidelines recommend informing patients considering maternal plasma cell-free DNA screening of the following:

- **Efficacy**: It is a highly effective screening test for common fetal trisomies (21, 18, 13) when performed after 10 weeks of gestation.

- **Test outcomes**: There is the possibility of a failed ('no-call') test, a false-negative or false-positive fetal aneuploidy result, or an unexpected fetal or maternal result.

- **Confirmation**: All positive maternal cell-free DNA screening results should be confirmed with diagnostic fetal testing.

- **Microdeletions**: Routine cell-free DNA screening for fetal microdeletions is not currently recommended.

- **Sex chromosome abnormalities**: Routine cell-free DNA screening for sex chromosome abnormalities is debated and not currently recommended.

### Non-invasive prenatal testing for aneuploidy and beyond: Challenges of responsible innovation in prenatal screening [^112ee6d3]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Cell-free DNA in the blood of pregnant women is primarily of maternal origin. A small proportion, approximately 10%, is derived from the fetus, specifically from the placenta. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) requires this "fetal fraction" of cell-free DNA in maternal blood to be above a minimum level for adequate analysis. Most laboratories set this limit at around 4%. Although cell-free fetal DNA can be found in maternal blood as early as four weeks of pregnancy, the fraction may not be sufficiently large if testing is carried out before nine or ten weeks. Testing too early may consequently lead to inaccurate or failed results. In later stages, the fetal fraction may still be insufficient due to maternal factors requiring further investigation.

One clearly established risk factor for a failed result is higher maternal body weight, which leads to a dilution effect and possibly increased adipocyte turnover in obese women. Reported failure rates vary considerably between laboratories, ranging from 0 to 5%. After a failed result, NIPT can be repeated, or alternative testing may be considered. However, this adds additional time to the screening and diagnostic process, potentially affecting subsequent choices and influencing whether the woman could still have a non-surgical termination. More evidence on failure rates and risk factors for failed NIPT is necessary. There is also limited evidence regarding the performance of NIPT as a test for fetal aneuploidy in twin or triplet pregnancies.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prenatal screening for chromosomal abnormalities, ACOG/SMFM 2020 guidelines recommend recognizing that cell-free DNA is the most sensitive and specific screening test for common fetal aneuploidies; however, it has the potential for false-positive and false-negative results and is not equivalent to diagnostic testing.

### Association between low fetal fraction in cell-free DNA testing and adverse pregnancy outcome: A systematic review [^113xJG5f]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2021). Low credibility.

Low fetal fraction (LFF) in prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing is a significant cause of test failure and no-call results. LFF may indicate early abnormal placentation and potentially associate with adverse pregnancy outcomes. This review examines the relationship between LFF in cfDNA testing and adverse pregnancy outcomes by synthesizing available literature.

A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE up to November 1, 2020. Five studies met the inclusion criteria; all were retrospective observational cohort studies. The cohort sizes ranged from 370 to 6375 pregnancies, with tests conducted in the first trimester or early second trimester. Two studies used a 4% cutoff for LFF, while two others used the 5th and 25th percentiles, respectively. One study utilized a range of cutoff values for LFF.

LFF in prenatal cfDNA testing showed associations with hypertensive disease of pregnancy, small-for-gestational-age neonates, and preterm birth. However, results were conflicting regarding the association between LFF and gestational diabetes mellitus.

In conclusion, LFF in cfDNA testing is linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, specifically pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders, preterm birth, and impaired fetal growth associated with placental dysfunction. Due to the limited available evidence, a large prospective cohort study on the relationship between fetal fraction and pregnancy outcomes is necessary.

### Noninvasive prenatal testing/noninvasive prenatal diagnosis: The position of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^111CiNRr]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2013). Low credibility.

The 1997 discovery of free fetal DNA in maternal plasma launched clinical researchers' efforts to establish a reliable method for noninvasive prenatal testing for fetal genetic conditions. Various methods, including massively parallel sequencing (MPS) and selective analysis of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma, have recently been developed as highly sensitive and specific noninvasive screening tools for common fetal chromosome aneuploidies. Incorporating these new noninvasive technologies into clinical practice will impact the prenatal screening paradigm for fetal aneuploidy, in which genetic counseling plays an integral role.

The National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) currently supports noninvasive prenatal testing/noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPT/NIPD) as an option for patients whose pregnancies are considered to be at an increased risk for certain chromosome abnormalities. NSGC urges that NIPT/NIPD only be offered in the context of informed consent, education, and counseling by a qualified provider, such as a certified genetic counselor. Patients whose NIPT/NIPD results are abnormal, or who have other factors suggestive of a chromosome abnormality, should receive genetic counseling and be given the option of standard confirmatory diagnostic testing.

### Analysis of cell-free fetal DNA for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis in a family with neonatal diabetes [^113uADAk]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

This article describes the first case of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis using cell-free fetal DNA in a family with neonatal diabetes. The test showed that the baby had not inherited the neonatal diabetes mutation, providing reassurance to the parents at mid-gestation that this baby was not at high risk of neonatal diabetes. This information was crucial for informing the management of the pregnancy, delivery, and care of the neonate accordingly.

### The accuracy of prenatal cell-free DNA screening for sex chromosome abnormalities: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112eywcc]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Low credibility.

Although cell-free DNA screening for sex chromosome abnormalities is increasingly used in clinical practice, its diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility remain unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the performance of cell-free DNA in the detection of sex chromosome abnormalities.

Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched from inception to January 2022 for articles relating to cell-free DNA screening for sex chromosome abnormalities. Original articles, randomized control trials, conference abstracts, cohort and case-control studies, and case series with more than 10 cases with diagnostic confirmation were considered for inclusion.

Quality assessment of each included publication was performed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool. The positive predictive value was calculated as the proportion of true positive cases among those who tested positive and underwent diagnostic testing. Sensitivity and specificity were pooled, and a summary receiver operating characteristic curve was produced using bivariate models that included studies that had diagnostic confirmation for high- and low-risk women.

The search identified 7553 results. Of these, 380 proceeded to the full-text screening, of which 94 articles were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 1,531,240 women tested. All studies reported a confirmatory genetic test. The pooled positive predictive value was 49.4% (95% confidence interval, 45.8–53.1).

### The impact of noninvasive prenatal testing on the practice of maternal-fetal medicine [^1145vZDy]. American Journal of Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) via cell-free fetal DNA in the maternal circulation is a highly sensitive and specific new testing option. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of NIPT on the uptake of first trimester screening (FTS) and invasive genetic testing.

- **Study design**: Uptake of prenatal testing was investigated in women referred for advanced maternal age or abnormal screening to the University of Texas Health Maternal-Fetal Medicine Clinics in Houston. Patients who presented from August to November 2011, before the clinical introduction of NIPT, were compared with patients who presented from March to June 2012, after its introduction.

- **Results**: In patients referred between 14 and 22 weeks gestational age, invasive genetic testing was significantly reduced following the introduction of NIPT (35.4% vs. 17.9%, p < 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: NIPT has made an impact on the practice of maternal-fetal medicine by significantly decreasing the number of second trimester diagnostic tests performed. Additionally, patients interested in early screening information appear to prefer the higher sensitivity and specificity of NIPT.

Where appropriate, data evaluation included descriptive statistics, two-sided t-test, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at the 5% significance level. No Bonferroni correction for multiple tests was applied to minimize type II (false-negative) associations. The study was based on a retrospective analysis of deidentified data and therefore fell under an IRB exemption protocol, as determined by Ethical & Independent Review Services, Corte Madera, CA (E&I) protocol #: 17113‐02.

### Cell-free placental DNA: What do we really know [^113hXeWh]. PLoS Genetics (2024). Low credibility.

Cell-free placental DNA (cfpDNA) is present in maternal circulation during gestation. CfpDNA carries great potential as a research and clinical tool, as it provides a means to investigate the placental (epi)genome across gestation, which previously required invasive placenta sampling procedures. CfpDNA has been widely implemented in the clinical setting for noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT). Despite this, the basic biology of cfpDNA remains poorly understood, limiting the research and clinical utility of cfpDNA. This review will examine the knowledge of cfpDNA, including its origins and molecular characteristics, highlight gaps in knowledge, and discuss future research directions.

### Delivering an accredited non-invasive prenatal diagnosis service for monogenic disorders and recommendations for best practice [^113fJCeQ]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2018). Low credibility.

The identification of cell-free fetal DNA circulating in maternal blood, combined with technological developments — particularly next-generation sequencing — is enabling the development of safer prenatal diagnosis. While this technology has been widely applied as a highly sensitive screening test for aneuploidy, there has been relatively little clinical application for the diagnosis of monogenic disorders. In the UK, we have established non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) as a clinical service for a range of inherited disorders. The results from NIPD do not require confirmation by invasive testing and are welcomed by patients and health professionals alike. Here, we describe the technical approaches used and outline recommendations for best practice when delivering an NIPD service from an accredited laboratory.

### The effects of heparin, aspirin, and maternal clinical factors on the rate of nonreportable cell-free DNA results: a retrospective cohort study [^111tKgJW]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Low credibility.

Technological advances in the analysis of cell-free DNA in maternal serum have expanded prenatal screening possibilities for fetal aneuploidies. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of the assay partially depend on the amount of cell-free DNA present in maternal circulation. Therefore, it is important to identify the fetal and maternal factors that influence the level of cell-free DNA in maternal circulation. Maternal heparin use has been associated with an increase in nonreportable cell-free DNA results due to a low fetal fraction in some, but not all, previous studies. Additionally, there are likely other factors affecting cell-free DNA that remain uncharacterized.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to determine whether heparins, low-dose aspirin, and maternal clinical factors affect the rate of nonreportable cell-free DNA testing results.

- **Study design**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted with pregnant individuals receiving cell-free fetal DNA testing from January 1, 2014, to June 30, 2018. Data were collected on patient demographics, medical comorbidities, medication use, and cell-free DNA test results. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors independently associated with the rate of nonreportable results.

- **Results**: From an original sample of 1117 pregnant individuals, 743 met the inclusion criteria. Maternal weight (odds ratio, 1.02), heparin use (odds ratio, 12.06), aspirin use (odds ratio, 4.70), chronic hypertension (odds ratio, 5.26), and pregestational diabetes mellitus (odds ratio, 2.46) were factors associated with nonreportable results.

### High fetal fraction on first trimester cell-free DNA aneuploidy screening and adverse pregnancy outcomes [^1176vx4n]. American Journal of Perinatology (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that high fetal fraction (FF) on first trimester cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) aneuploidy screening is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes.

- **Study design**: This is a single-institution retrospective cohort study of women who underwent cfDNA screening. A fetal fraction of 16.5% was considered high (n = 102). Women with high FF had a greater chance of delivering a small for gestational age infant, < fifth percentile, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.4 (95% confidence interval: 1.1–4.8, p = 0.039). There was no significant association between high FF and either preterm birth or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

- **Conclusion**: Women with a high FF in the first trimester are at increased risk of delivering a small for gestational age infant, < fifth percentile. Further investigation into the clinical implications of a high FF is warranted.

### Obstetrical provider knowledge and attitudes towards cell-free DNA screening: Results of a cross-sectional national survey [^115HJuDk]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) based on cfDNA in the maternal plasma has recently acquired significant attention, offering patients and healthcare providers a prenatal genetic screening test for aneuploidy that is more accurate than ultrasound and placental analyte screening modalities, and safer than invasive diagnostic testing. Prenatal genetic screening methods have used non-invasive maternal serum screening testing protocols, such as the first trimester combined or integrated approaches, identifying up to 95% of trisomies with a false positive rate of 5–23% in the general population. Given a screen positive risk result, determined by the test's 'cut-off' number, patients are then offered the option of invasive diagnostic procedures such as chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, which carry a 0.5–1% risk of miscarriage.

cfDNA screening represents a significant clinical advancement over alternative screening modalities, with an overall detection rate (DR) of 99.7% and a false-positive rate (FPR) of 0.04% for trisomy 21. Different professional societies, such as the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), agree that cfDNA screening is a highly effective form of early prenatal screening for common trisomies (21, 18, 13) after 10 weeks' gestation. However, there are several limitations to this screening test. cfDNA screening is a rapidly evolving field and at the time when we constructed our survey, detection rates for individual aneuploidies were still being evaluated.

### Recommended pre-test counseling points for noninvasive prenatal testing using cell-free DNA: A 2015 perspective [^114gPycX]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell-free DNA is being offered to an increasing number of women. Comprehensive pre-test counseling is complicated by emerging information about the benefits and limitations of testing, as well as the potential to detect incidental findings. Genetic counselors are trained to facilitate informed decision-making; however, not all centers have access to these professionals. To aid in the informed consent process, we have summarized key points to be included in discussions with patients who are considering NIPT.

### Diurnal effects on the fraction of fetal cell-free DNA in maternal plasma [^115Y1Hmt]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Low credibility.

The discovery of fetal cell‐free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics through non‐invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) by relying on accurately measuring the fetal fraction (FF) in maternal plasma. While FF is known to be influenced by maternal and fetal factors, the impact of intraday rhythms remains unclear. This study investigated whether FF varies based on blood draw timing.

Data from 2519 euploid singleton pregnancies undergoing NIPT were analyzed. Key variables included maternal age, BMI, gestational age, fetal sex, and blood draw timing (06:50–21:00). FF was measured using the Harmony Prenatal IVD Test. Multiple linear regression identified independent predictors of FF, while intraday variation was assessed using Mann‐Whitney U tests and boxplots.

FF showed a significant positive relationship with blood draw timing (β = 0.00176 per hour, p < 0.005), with afternoon values approximately 10% higher than morning values (∼0.01 difference). Other predictors included BMI (negative), gestational age (positive), and fetal sex (higher in females). Blood draw timing appeared to be a stronger predictor of FF than gestational age or fetal sex, second only to BMI.

This novel finding demonstrates diurnal variation in FF, suggesting that optimizing blood draw timing could improve NIPT accuracy, particularly in borderline cases. Further research is needed to confirm the clinical implications.

### Implementation of non-invasive prenatal testing by semiconductor sequencing in a genetic laboratory [^1147v7gX]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2016). Low credibility.

Gestational age and maternal weight are key characteristics that influence the fetal DNA fraction. Because a low fetal fraction leads to a dramatic decrease in sensitivity, fetal fraction assessment is of utmost importance. The most convenient measurement of fetal fraction is based on the presence of the Y chromosome in the plasma sample (FF-Y). Evidently, this fetal fraction calculation is only possible for pregnancies with a male fetus. Other methods for fetal fraction measurements rely on single nucleotide polymorphism differences between maternal and fetal DNA. These calculations, however, mostly require additional testing, hence, rendering the overall test more costly.

Interestingly, fetal cell-free DNA fragments are overall shorter than the corresponding maternal cell-free DNA fragments. This inherent information can be used for fetal DNA fraction measurements and eliminates the need for an additional test for fetal fraction measurement. Recently, Kim et al. developed a new strategy, called seqFF, for fetal fraction calculation. This method is based on the fact that the genomic origin or representation of cfDNA from fetal and maternal origin differs slightly. The method being described uses the sequence data that are investigated for the NIPT analysis itself, making an extra test for fetal fraction calculation redundant. More importantly, fetal fraction can be determined for pregnancies with male as well as female fetuses.

In addition to the issues raised concerning sensitivity and specificity for NIPT, the use of cell-free DNA…

### Cell free DNA testing-interpretation of results using an online calculator [^1155QhDb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). High credibility.

All pregnant women, regardless of age, should be offered screening or invasive testing for chromosomal abnormalities at less than 20 weeks' gestation. Noninvasive prenatal screening for fetal aneuploidy, using cell-free DNA (cfDNA), is a screening method that offers high sensitivity and specificity in validation studies and has reduced the need for unnecessary invasive procedures. Laboratories typically advertise and report a test's sensitivity and specificity to describe the test's accuracy. However, the positive predictive value (PPV) of a screening test — the proportion of positive results that are truly positive — is a function of the prevalence of the condition in a population and often is not reported in direct-to-patient advertising.

False-positive cfDNA screening tests have been reported, and there is evidence that some women decide to terminate their pregnancies without confirmatory testing. It is our belief that laboratories should disclose the patient-specific PPV of cfDNA screening for aneuploidy on result reports.

To aid in counseling patients about the benefits, risks, and limitations of aneuploidy screening with cfDNA, and to demonstrate the relationship between an a priori risk and PPV, we developed a web-based calculator. This tool estimates the PPV of the four commercially available cfDNA testing platforms for which published data exist. Estimates are made using a patient's age and gestational age-related risk of trisomy 21, 18, and 13, or an a priori risk based on other findings. This web-based calculator serves as an aid for providers and genetic counselors.

### Screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities: ACOG practice bulletin, number 226 [^111HXsYs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for prenatal screening for chromosomal abnormalities, the ACOG/SMFM 2020 guidelines recommend considering cell-free DNA screening as a follow-up in cases with a screen-positive serum analyte screening test result for patients seeking to avoid a diagnostic test. Inform patients that this approach may delay definitive diagnosis and will fail to identify some fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities.

### Committee opinion summary no. 640: Cell-free DNA screening for fetal aneuploidy [^114q1utN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Noninvasive prenatal screening that uses cell-free DNA from the plasma of pregnant women offers tremendous potential as a screening method for fetal aneuploidy. A number of laboratories have validated various techniques for using cell-free DNA as a screening test for fetal aneuploidy. All tests have high sensitivity and specificity for trisomy 18 and trisomy 21, regardless of the molecular technique used. Women whose results from cell-free DNA screening are not reported, indeterminate, or uninterpretable (a "no call" test result) should receive further genetic counseling and be offered comprehensive ultrasound evaluation and diagnostic testing due to an increased risk of aneuploidy.

Patients should be counseled that cell-free DNA screening does not replace the precision obtained with diagnostic tests such as chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, and therefore, it is limited in its ability to identify all chromosome abnormalities. Cell-free DNA screening does not assess the risk of fetal anomalies such as neural tube defects or ventral wall defects. Patients undergoing cell-free DNA screening should be offered maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening or ultrasound evaluation for risk assessment. The cell-free DNA screening test should not be considered in isolation from other clinical findings and test results. Management decisions, including the termination of the pregnancy, should not be based solely on the results of cell-free DNA screening. Patients should be counseled that a negative cell-free DNA test result does not ensure an unaffected pregnancy.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for multiple gestations, particularly in screening for chromosomal abnormalities such as in monochorionic twin pregnancies, the RCOG 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining cell-free fetal DNA testing (also known as NIPT). This is contingent on the results of the first-trimester combined test for major autosomal trisomies in twin pregnancies.

### Preface: In silico pipeline for accurate cell-free fetal DNA fraction prediction [^112W1kNf]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2019). Low credibility.

Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has evolved into an important routine clinical practice. Numerous variations on experimental and in silico procedures have been shown to reliably detect fetal chromosomal aneuploidies, mostly concerning trisomies 13, 18, and 21. The accuracy of NIPT seems high; however, as fetal fragments are scattered throughout a more abundant maternal background in blood plasma, individual performance highly depends on the fraction of fetal‐derived cell‐free DNA (FF). Indeed, the minimal FF for reporting unilateral conclusions has often been debated to be 4%, though lower limits are alleged.

Several fetal gender‐independent methodologies have been described to assess FF. Prior parental genomic information often facilitates some of these procedures, as, for example, paternal or maternal homozygous loci that are determined to be partly heterozygous in maternal blood during pregnancy form a precise platform to quantify FF. Nonetheless, parental priors are not always obliged: using binomial mixture modeling, fetal and maternal clusters of single nucleotide polymorphisms also reflect FF, yet a higher sequencing depth is required. Likewise, different inputs, such as molecule size (cell‐free fetal DNA fragments are often shorter) and methylation patterns (some fetal sites are hypermethylated), enable FF prediction.

### Association between low fetal fraction in cell-free DNA testing and adverse pregnancy outcome: A systematic review [^114ihT5i]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2021). Low credibility.

The search identified a total of 1,571 publications, including works on cfDNA testing applications outside prenatal testing, predominantly related to malignancies outside pregnancy. After removing duplicates, 876 records were screened by title and abstract, resulting in 29 potentially eligible studies. However, only five studies met the inclusion criteria and were included for review. No additional articles were found through cross-referencing the included studies. All five studies were retrospective observational cohort studies, published between 2016 and 2020, with cohort sizes ranging from 370 to 6,375 pregnancies. All tests were conducted in the first trimester or early second trimester.

- **Quality assessment**: Quality assessment of the included studies was conducted according to the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.

The main study characteristics are summarized in Table 2.

### The predictive value of prenatal cell-free DNA testing for rare autosomal trisomies: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111hfqzf]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

The diagnostic accuracy of cell-free fetal DNA in screening for rare autosomal trisomies is uncertain. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming to determine the predictive value of cell-free DNA in screening for rare autosomal trisomies.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched from inception to January 2022.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: All studies that reported on the diagnostic accuracy of cell-free DNA in the detection of rare autosomal trisomies were included. Case series were included if they contained at least 10 cases with diagnostic test results or postnatal genetic testing.

- **Methods**: Study appraisal was completed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Statistical analysis was performed using random-effects meta-analysis of double-arcsine-transformed proportions of confirmed results in the fetus out of the positive tests to obtain a pooled estimate of the positive predictive value.

- **Results**: The search identified 7,553 studies, of which 1,852 were duplicates. After screening 5,701 titles and abstracts, 380 studies proceeded to the full-text screen; 206 articles were retrieved for data extraction, of which another 175 articles were excluded. A total of 31 studies, with a total of 1,703 women, were included for analysis. The pooled positive predictive value of cell-free DNA for the diagnosis of rare autosomal trisomies was 11.46% (95% confidence interval, 7.80–15.65). Statistical heterogeneity was high (I² = 82%). Sensitivity analysis restricted to 5 studies at low risk of bias demonstrated consistent results.

### Fetal fraction and noninvasive prenatal testing: What clinicians need to know [^114txkpX]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Low credibility.

The fetal fraction (FF) is a function of both biological factors and bioinformatics algorithms used to interpret DNA sequencing results. It is an essential quality control component of noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) results. Clinicians need to understand the biological influences on FF to be able to provide optimal post-test counseling and clinical management. There are many different technologies available for the measurement of FF. Clinicians do not need to know the details behind the bioinformatics algorithms of FF measurements, but they do need to appreciate the significant variations between the different sequencing technologies used by different laboratories.

There is no universal FF threshold that is applicable across all platforms and there have not been any differences demonstrated in NIPT performance by sequencing platform or method of FF calculation. Importantly, while FF should be routinely measured, there is not yet a consensus as to whether it should be routinely reported to the clinician. The clinician should know what to expect from a standard test report and whether reasons for failed NIPT results are revealed. Emerging solutions to the challenges of samples with low FF should reduce rates of failed NIPT in the future. In the meantime, having a "plan B" prepared for those patients for whom NIPT is unsuccessful is essential in today's clinical practice.

### Effects of an animated educational video on knowledge of cell-free DNA screening among Thai pregnant women: a randomized control trial [^113SfKu2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). High credibility.

In developing countries, pregnant women have insufficient knowledge about cell-free DNA screening. Reports from developed countries have found that various tools in prenatal genetic counseling can improve the knowledge of pregnant women who undergo cell-free DNA screening. Data are limited from developing countries where women have different baseline socio-educational backgrounds. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of an animated educational video combined with traditional counseling versus traditional counseling alone in changing pregnant women's knowledge of cell-free DNA screening.

- **Methods**: This study was a randomized control trial at an antenatal clinic. Eligible subjects who were Thai pregnant women were randomized to either view or not view the 4-minute animated educational video explaining cell-free DNA screening. Both groups received traditional counseling. The women were asked to complete a Thai questionnaire assessing knowledge of the screening before and after intervention. The questionnaire consisted of three sections: demographic data of the research participants and their existing awareness about cell-free DNA testing; performance and limitations of cell-free DNA screening; and participants' attitudes toward the positive screening. The primary outcome was the change in knowledge scores. Secondary outcomes were attitudes toward positive screening tests, levels of satisfaction with counseling, and screening acceptance rates.

- **Results**: Data from 83 women in the video group and 82 in the non-video group were analyzed.

### Optimizing use of existing prenatal genetic tests: Screening and diagnostic testing for aneuploidy [^1123Jj2d]. Seminars in Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Screening and diagnostic testing for the detection of fetal aneuploidy has been an integral part of prenatal care for over three decades. The recent introduction of new technologies, such as cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening and preimplantation genetic screening, has increased complexity for obstetrical care providers. Inconsistencies among the professional society recommendations have caused confusion and disparities in practice. As we work to responsibly incorporate new technologies, clear guidelines with consensus among relevant professional societies are needed. In January 2017, a workshop was convened during the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Pregnancy Meeting, where representatives from many stakeholder groups were present. The goal was to develop a framework for introducing new genetic tests into clinical practice. This paper provides consensus recommendations from this workshop on the use of existing prenatal screening and diagnostic testing for aneuploidy.

### A 2-year review of publicly funded cell-free DNA screening in Ontario: Utilization and adherence to funding criteria [^117UBHxd]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Low credibility.

Ontario offers a publicly funded modified contingent model of prenatal screening for aneuploidy, in which cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening is covered for pregnancies at higher risk of fetal aneuploidy. The objective of this study was to review the utilization of provincially funded cfDNA screening and adherence to the criteria laid out in Ontario prenatal screening guidelines.

This was a descriptive cohort study using data collected by Ontario's prescribed maternal and child registry. The study population included all pregnant individuals who received cfDNA screening from January 2016 to December 2017.

- **Results**: The most common criteria for provincially funded cfDNA screening were advanced maternal age ≥ 40 years (37.7%), positive multiple marker screen (34.1%), modifying risk factors such as ultrasound soft markers (7.1%), and previous aneuploidy (5.5%). The audit demonstrated that 2.9% of funded cfDNA screens did not meet funding criteria, and 11.4% of self-paid cfDNA screens could have been publicly funded.

Reviewing and auditing the application of criteria for funded cfDNA screening using prescribed registry data allows an opportunity to identify areas where targeted education may improve adherence to standardized screening protocols and provides a basis for reassessment of the funding model.

### Dna sequencing of maternal plasma to detect Down syndrome: an international clinical validation study [^116QUvje]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Prenatal screening for Down syndrome has improved, but the number of resulting invasive diagnostic procedures remains problematic. Measurement of circulating cell-free DNA in maternal plasma might offer improvement.

- **Methods**: A blinded, nested case-control study was designed within a cohort of 4,664 pregnancies at high risk for Down syndrome. Fetal karyotyping was compared with an internally validated, laboratory-developed test based on next-generation sequencing in 212 Down syndrome and 1,484 matched euploid pregnancies. None had been previously tested. Primary testing occurred at a CLIA-certified commercial laboratory, with cross-validation by a CLIA-certified university laboratory.

- **Results**: Down syndrome detection rate was 98.6% (209/212), the false-positive rate was 0.20% (3/1,471), and the testing failed in 13 pregnancies (0.8%); all were euploid. Before unblinding, the primary testing laboratory also reported multiple alternative interpretations. Adjusting chromosome 21 counts for guanine-cytosine base content had the largest impact on improving performance.

- **Conclusion**: When applied to high-risk pregnancies, measuring maternal plasma DNA detects nearly all cases of Down syndrome at a very low false-positive rate. This method can substantially reduce the need for invasive diagnostic procedures and attendant procedure-related fetal losses. Although implementation issues need to be addressed, the evidence supports introducing this testing on a clinical basis.

### Offering non-invasive prenatal testing as part of routine clinical service: Can high levels of informed choice be maintained [^1142mWVN]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2017). Low credibility.

Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell-free DNA in maternal blood is an advanced screening test, which has been shown to be highly accurate for Down syndrome, with detection rates over 99% and false positive rates less than 0.1% for singleton pregnancies. The test can also be used to screen for trisomies 13 and 18, as well as sex chromosome aneuploidies; however, detection rates are slightly lower. The lower predictive value means that NIPT is not considered diagnostic, and invasive testing is recommended to confirm positive NIPT results.

Non-invasive prenatal testing has become widely available in recent years through the private sector, and a number of studies have been conducted to address implementation within a national prenatal care setting. Clinical advantages include improved accuracy rates in comparison to combined screening, reduction in the need for invasive tests that carry a small risk of miscarriage, early information about risk status, and the opportunity for early reassurance for low-risk women.

Nevertheless, a number of disadvantages have been identified, such as the smaller diagnostic yield in comparison to invasive testing with array comparative genomic hybridisation and the potential for test failures or inconclusive results.

### Clinical validation of a prenatal cell-free DNA screening test for fetal RHD in a large U.S. cohort [^116CVYmM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

A total of 655 maternal samples met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. The median maternal age was 32 years (range 16.0–46.0 years), and the median weight was 70 kg (range 41.7–170.1 kg) at the time of noninvasive prenatal cell-free DNA testing. Race and ethnicity, as documented in the medical record, was as follows: 485 (74.0%) were White, 46 (7.0%) were Black, 14 (2.1%) were Asian, 4 (0.6%) were other, and 106 (16.2%) were of unknown races; 90 (13.7%) were Hispanic or Latina, 444 (67.8%) were non-Hispanic, and 121 (18.5%) had unknown ethnicities.

The median gestational age at the time of testing was 12 weeks (range 9.0–36.7 weeks), and the median fetal fraction was 8.3% (range 2.8–32.0%). Newborn sex was split between male (51.2%) and female (47.8%). Most pregnancies were singleton (99.1%); 5 (0.8%) were monozygotic twin pregnancies, and 1 fetus (0.2%) was conceived through egg donation.

### Noninvasive inferring expressed genes and in vivo monitoring of the physiology and pathology of pregnancy using cell-free DNA [^114Waugt]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Noninvasive monitoring of fetal development and the early detection of pregnancy-associated complications is challenging, largely because of the lack of information about the molecular spectrum during pregnancy. Recently, cell-free DNA in plasma was found to reflect the global nucleosome footprint and status of gene expression and showed potential for noninvasive health monitoring during pregnancy.

- **Objective**: We aimed to test the relationships between plasma cell-free DNA profiles and pregnancy biology and evaluate the use of a cell-free DNA profile as a noninvasive method for physiological and pathologic status monitoring during pregnancy.

- **Study design**: We used genome cell-free DNA sequencing data generated from noninvasive prenatal testing in a total of 2,937 pregnant women. For each physiological and pathologic condition, features of the cell-free DNA profile were identified using the discovery cohort, and support vector machine classifiers were built and evaluated using independent training and validation cohorts.

- **Results**: We established nucleosome occupancy profiles at transcription start sites in different gestational trimesters, demonstrated the relationships between gene expression and cell-free DNA coverage at transcription start sites, and showed that the cell-free DNA profiles at transcription start sites represented the biological processes of pregnancy. In addition, using cell-free DNA data, nucleosome profiles of transcription factor binding sites were identified to reflect the transcription factor footprint, which may help to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying pregnancy-related changes.

### Increasing maternal age is not a significant cause of false-positive results for monosomy X in non-invasive prenatal testing [^1132VPbt]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Low credibility.

The accuracy of cell-free DNA aneuploidy screening varies by the chromosome assessed. The positive predictive value is consistently low for monosomy X (MX), at less than 30%. This study aims to investigate maternal age and other possible predictors of false-positive MX screening results to guide pre-test and post-test counseling.

A total of 52,499 NIPT samples were tested over 69 months across three specialist obstetric services. Outcome data were available for 96 out of 107 cases high risk for MX. Cytogenetic outcomes were compared to clinical and demographic data to identify trends that might indicate a higher likelihood of a false-positive NIPT result.

The likelihood of a false-positive MX result significantly increased with the absence of ultrasound features suggestive of MX and with lower PAPP-A levels. Non-significant trends toward false-positive results were identified with increased maternal age, increased body mass index, and Caucasian ethnicity.

Maternal age is not a reliable predictor of a false-positive result. Assessment of ultrasound findings and placental serology in the first trimester is important for appropriate post-test counseling and should continue to be part of screening even when NIPT is used as a first-tier screening test.

### Cell-free DNA screening in twin pregnancies: A more accurate and reliable screening tool [^1131AuoL]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Low credibility.

Historically, twin gestations have posed unique challenges to aneuploidy detection during pregnancy. Traditional serum screening is complicated by the presence of two fetuses contributing varying levels of analytes in maternal blood, resulting in a less sensitive screening test in twins compared to singleton gestations. Additionally, traditional screening methods are often focused solely on the detection of Down syndrome, at the exclusion of other chromosome abnormalities. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening for aneuploidy in multifetal gestations has been validated and clinically available since 2012. This screening approach allows for the evaluation of multiple aneuploidies, and validation studies suggest that this testing may offer increased sensitivity and specificity compared to traditional serum screening.

Despite the growing use of this test by clinicians, professional societies have not yet broadly supported cfDNA screening for multifetal pregnancies. In a recent Practice Bulletin, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) stated: "Noninvasive prenatal testing that uses cell-free fetal DNA from the plasma of pregnant women offers potential as a screening tool for fetal aneuploidy. However, more information is needed before use of this test can be recommended in women with multifetal gestations". The American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) does not overtly endorse cfDNA screening for multiples. Rather, ACMG recommends: "In pregnancies with multiple gestations and/or donor oocytes, testing laboratories should be contacted".

### The influence of noninvasive prenatal testing on gestational age at time of abortion for aneuploidy [^1149ABzw]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to compare the gestational age at termination for trisomy 13, 18, or 21 (aneuploidy) before and after the introduction of noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT).

A retrospective cohort study was conducted involving women undergoing termination for aneuploidy at two academic institutions and one private clinic. Two time periods were compared: before and after the introduction of NIPT (2006–2011 and 2012–2014, respectively). Maternal demographics and clinical characteristics were abstracted from medical records, and nonparametric statistical methods were used to compare the two cohorts.

Our cohort included 93 women: 41 prior to NIPT and 52 post-NIPT. Maternal age did not differ between the time periods (38 post-NIPT vs. 37 pre-NIPT; p = 0.17). Women in the post-NIPT period were less likely to undergo diagnostic testing before proceeding to abortion following a positive screening result (82.7% vs. 97.6%; p < 0.01). In the post-NIPT period, there was a significant decrease in the gestational age at the time of invasive testing (13.0 vs. 15.7 weeks; p < 0.01), and women were more likely to undergo chorionic villous sampling (CVS) (59.6% vs. 41.5%; p < 0.01). There was a significant decrease in the gestational age at termination (14.2 vs. 17.2 weeks; p < 0.01). Women in the post-NIPT group were less likely to have terminations after 16 weeks (25.0% vs. 61.0%; p < 0.01), 18 weeks (7.7% vs. 39.0%; p < 0.01), or 20 weeks (3.9% vs. 12.2%; p = 0.23).

With the introduction of NIPT, there was a notable reduction in the median gestational age at diagnosis and termination for women with Trisomy 13, 18, or 21.

### Analysis of cell-free fetal DNA for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis in a family with neonatal diabetes [^111wV3P5]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

An early genetic diagnosis of neonatal diabetes guides clinical management and results in improved treatment in approximately 40% of patients. In the offspring of individuals with neonatal diabetes, a prenatal diagnosis allows for an accurate estimation of the risk of developing diabetes and, eventually, the most appropriate treatment for the baby. In this study, we performed non-invasive prenatal genetic testing for a fetus at risk of inheriting a paternal 11 p.R201C mutation, which causes permanent neonatal diabetes.

- **Methods**: A droplet digital polymerase chain reaction assay was used to detect the presence of the mutation in cell-free circulating DNA extracted from maternal plasma at 12 and 16 weeks' gestation.

- **Results**: The mutation was not detected in the cell-free samples, suggesting that the fetus had not inherited the 11 mutation. The fetal fraction was estimated at 6.2% and 10.7%, which is above the detection limit of the assay. The result was confirmed by Sanger sequencing after the baby's birth, confirming that the baby's risk of developing neonatal diabetes was reduced to that of the general population.

- **Conclusions**: We report the first case of non-invasive prenatal testing in a family with neonatal diabetes. A prenatal diagnosis in families at high risk of monogenic diabetes informs both prenatal and postnatal management. Although the clinical impact of this novel technology still needs to be assessed, its implementation in clinical practice, including cases at risk of inheriting mutations from the mother, will likely have a positive impact on the clinical management of families.

### Clinical validation of a noninvasive prenatal test for genomewide detection of fetal copy number variants [^112JHep3]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Cell-free DNA assessment of fetal chromosomes does not analyze and report on all chromosomes; hence, a significant proportion of fetal chromosomal abnormalities are not detectable by noninvasive methods. Here we report the clinical validation of a novel noninvasive prenatal test (NIPT) designed to detect genomewide gains and losses of chromosomal material ≥ 7 Mb and losses associated with specific deletions < 7 Mb.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study is to provide a clinical validation of the sensitivity and specificity of a novel NIPT for the detection of genomewide abnormalities.

- **Study design**: This retrospective, blinded study included maternal plasma collected from 1222 study subjects with pregnancies at increased risk for fetal chromosomal abnormalities that were assessed for trisomy 21 (T21), trisomy 18 (T18), trisomy 13 (T13), sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs), fetal sex, genomewide copy number variants (CNVs) ≥ 7 Mb, and select deletions < 7 Mb. Performance was assessed by comparing test results with findings from G-band karyotyping, microarray data, or high coverage sequencing.

- **Results**: Clinical sensitivity within this study was determined to be 100% for T21 (95% confidence interval, 94.6–100%), T18 (95% CI, 84.4–100%), T13 (95% CI, 74.7–100%), and SCAs (95% CI, 84–100%) and 97.7% for genomewide CNVs (95% CI, 86.2–99.9%). Clinical specificity within this study was determined to be 100% for T21 (95% CI, 99.6–100%), T18 (95% CI, 99.6–100%), and T13 (95% CI, 99.6–100%), and 99.9% for SCAs and CNVs (95% CI, 99.4–100% for both).

### Multisite evaluation and validation of optical genome mapping for prenatal genetic testing [^111dFio3]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2024). High credibility.

Prenatal diagnostic testing of amniotic fluid, chorionic villi, or, more rarely, fetal cord blood is recommended following a positive or unreportable noninvasive cell-free fetal DNA test, abnormal maternal biochemical serum screen, abnormal ultrasound, or increased genetic risk for a cytogenomic abnormality based on family history. Although chromosomal microarray is recommended as the first-tier prenatal diagnostic test, in practice, multiple assays are often assessed in concert to achieve a final diagnostic result. The use of multiple methodologies is costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive.

Optical genome mapping (OGM) is an emerging technique with application for prenatal diagnosis because of its ability to detect and resolve, in a single assay, all classes of pathogenic cytogenomic aberrations. In an effort to characterize the potential of OGM as a novel alternative to traditional standard of care (SOC) testing of prenatal samples, OGM was performed on a total of 200 samples representing 123 unique cases, which were previously tested with SOC methods (92/123 = 74.7% cases tested with at least two SOCs). OGM demonstrated an overall accuracy of 99.6% when compared with SOC methods, a positive predictive value of 100%, and 100% reproducibility between sites, operators, and instruments.

The standardized workflow, cost-effectiveness, and high-resolution cytogenomic analysis demonstrate the potential of OGM to serve as a first-tier test for prenatal diagnosis.

For this study, we identified clinical cases with previous commercial single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based noninvasive prenatal cell-free DNA testing that were evaluated between April 1, 2022, and September 30, 2022, and had residual samples in the Natera, Inc. proprietary research sample bank. These samples were matched to clinical outcomes using outcomes data collected as part of Natera's clinical quality improvement program, through which serologic RhD phenotypes were available for both the pregnant patient and their newborn.

Only pregnant patients with RhD-negative serology were used in this study. Additional inclusion criteria for use in this clinical validation included the following: the residual sample passed quality metrics; a previously reported noninvasive prenatal cell-free DNA result for fetal aneuploidy; documented RhD-negative serologic results for the pregnant person; documented serologic results for the RhD antigen in the newborn for the pregnancy of interest (serologic truth); maternal genotype identified as RHD deletion or RHD-CE-D hybrid(r's); and identification of the pregnancy as a singleton or monozygotic twin pregnancy based on SNP-based noninvasive prenatal cell-free DNA testing. Demographics (e.g. race and ethnicity, maternal age, maternal weight) and clinical characteristics were collected to evaluate the generalizability of the validation results to the U.S. population. Commercially obtained samples stored in Natera's biorepository were analyzed under a waiver of informed consent through Natera's IRB-approved protocol.

### Impact of noninvasive prenatal testing in regionally dispersed medical centers in the United States [^1135gRQU]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Noninvasive prenatal testing using cell-free DNA is a new alternative to screen for common fetal aneuploidies. It is not known what impact regional location may play on noninvasive prenatal testing implementation and downstream invasive prenatal procedure use in the United States. Six different regionally based centers collected data on noninvasive prenatal testing indication and results between February and November 2012, as well as their invasive prenatal procedure rates before and after offering noninvasive prenatal testing. Statistical analyses were performed using the 2-proportion Z-test.

Of 1,477 patients who underwent noninvasive prenatal testing, 693 (47%) were from centers in the West; 522 (35.3%) from centers in the East; and 262 (17.7%) from one center in the Midwest. Statistically significant differences were observed between West Coast and non-West Coast sites for gestational age (14.1 weeks; P ≤ .0001). Advanced maternal age (AMA-only) was the most frequent indication in five of six sites (range, 21.8–62.9%). A total of 98 invasive prenatal procedures were performed on 94 (6.4%) patients, of which 64 (65.3%) were performed at centers in the West. More invasive procedures were performed following negative noninvasive prenatal testing results (n = 61) than abnormal noninvasive prenatal testing results (n = 30). The overall rate of patients undergoing an invasive procedure after an abnormal noninvasive prenatal testing result was 32.6% (30 of 92). All six centers reported a decrease in invasive procedure volume after noninvasive prenatal testing.

### Diurnal effects on the fraction of fetal cell-free DNA in maternal plasma [^113FTXM8]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Low credibility.

**Summary**: The fetal fraction (FF) is a critical parameter for prenatal diagnostics through non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). It is influenced by maternal and fetal physiological factors; however, the potential impact of intraday rhythms on FF remains poorly understood. FF demonstrates significant diurnal variation, with higher values in the afternoon. This novel finding highlights the importance of timing in FF measurement and suggests that optimizing blood draw timing could improve NIPT accuracy, particularly in borderline cases.

### Towards systematic nomenclature for cell-free DNA [^115Vt1fS]. Human Genetics (2021). Low credibility.

Prenatal testing reveals that molecular analysis of plasma and serum DNA during human pregnancy has led to the discovery that maternal blood contains cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of both fetal and maternal origin. The origin of the cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) is the cytotrophoblast; therefore, it is more accurately described as placental DNA rather than fetal DNA that circulates in maternal blood. Despite this, the term "cffDNA" has gained universal acceptance in the prenatal literature, and no change to this practice is proposed here.

This uniquely accessible source of fetal DNA has created new possibilities for prenatal diagnosis and screening. The use of cffDNA for fetal molecular diagnostics is termed noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) and has clinical applications such as the determination of fetal blood group, fetal sex, and an expanding range of monogenic conditions. This should be distinguished from the use of cffDNA for the detection of fetal chromosome conditions, such as trisomy 21, which has been referred to as noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS), and maternal cfDNA screening. The use of cffDNA for aneuploidy detection is a screening test, and diagnostic confirmation with invasive testing — such as chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis — is still required following a high-risk result. The phenomenon of fetoplacental mosaicism is the biological reason why NIPT cannot achieve diagnostic accuracy for chromosome conditions, as the placental karyotype…

### Cell-free DNA screening for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 in pregnancies at low and high risk for aneuploidy with genetic confirmation [^115vpNdb]. American journal of obstetrics and gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

Cell-free DNA noninvasive prenatal screening for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 has been rapidly adopted into clinical practice. However, previous studies are limited by a lack of follow-up genetic testing to confirm the outcomes and accurately assess test performance, particularly in women at a low risk for aneuploidy.

Objective

To measure and compare the performance of cell-free DNA screening for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 between women at a low and high risk for aneuploidy in a large, prospective cohort with genetic confirmation of results STUDY DESIGN: This was a multicenter prospective observational study at 21 centers in 6 countries. Women who had single-nucleotide-polymorphism-based cell-free DNA screening for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 were enrolled. Genetic confirmation was obtained from prenatal or newborn DNA samples. The test performance and test failure (no-call) rates were assessed for the cohort, and women with low and high previous risks for aneuploidy were compared. An updated cell-free DNA algorithm blinded to the pregnancy outcome was also assessed.

Results

A total of 20,194 women were enrolled at a median gestational age of 12.6 weeks (interquartile range, 11.6–13.9). The genetic outcomes were confirmed in 17,851 cases (88.4%): 13,043 (73.1%) low-risk and 4808 (26.9%) high-risk cases for aneuploidy. Overall, 133 trisomies were diagnosed (100 trisomy 21; 18 trisomy 18; 15 trisomy 13). The cell-free DNA screen positive rate was lower in the low-risk vs the high-risk group (0.27% vs 2.2%; p < 0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity were similar between

### High-throughput fetal fraction amplification increases analytical performance of noninvasive prenatal screening [^113y7RnY]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The percentage of a maternal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sample that is fetal-derived (the fetal fraction; FF) is a key driver of the sensitivity and specificity of noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS). On certain NIPS platforms, over 20% of women with a high body mass index (and over 5% overall) receive a test failure due to low FF (< 4%).

- **Methods**: A scalable fetal fraction amplification (FFA) technology was analytically validated on 1,264 samples undergoing whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based NIPS. All samples were tested with and without FFA.

- **Results**: Zero samples had FF < 4% when screened with FFA, whereas 1 in 25 of these same patients had FF < 4% without FFA. The average increase in FF was 3.9-fold for samples with low FF (2.3-fold overall) and 99.8% had higher FF with FFA. For all abnormalities screened on NIPS, z-scores increased 2.2-fold on average in positive samples and remained unchanged in negative samples, powering an increase in NIPS sensitivity and specificity.

- **Conclusion**: FFA transforms low-FF samples into high-FF samples. By combining FFA with WGS-based NIPS, a single round of NIPS can provide nearly all women with confident results about the broad range of potential fetal chromosomal abnormalities across the genome.

### The importance of determining the limit of detection of non-invasive prenatal testing methods [^114ZYYzs]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2016). Low credibility.

Several non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) methods, which analyze circulating fetal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal plasma, suggest a fetal fraction (FF) of ≥ 4% for a reportable result, based on the assumption that fetal aneuploidies may not be detectable at lower FF. This study determined the actual limit of detection (LOD) of a massively parallel sequencing-based NIPT method and evaluated its performance in testing samples with low FF.

An experimental model, involving the creation of artificial plasma mixtures with a final aneuploid FF ranging from 1% to 4%, simulated samples at different proportions of fetal cfDNA. We then analyzed 7,103 blood samples from pregnant women undergoing NIPT to assess the impact of low FF on the performance of cfDNA testing.

Detection of common aneuploidies in samples with an FF as low as 2% is well within the ability of this technology. Of 105 pregnancies confirmed chromosomally abnormal, 25 (23.8%) involving a 2% < FF < 4% were consistently detected. These high-risk pregnancies would not have been identified using the suggested 4% FF cut-off.

This study underscores the importance of determining the actual LOD for each specific NIPT methodology. It may reduce the incidence of test cancellations and shorten the time required for the diagnosis of aneuploidy. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

### Timing of diagnosis of fetal structural abnormalities after the introduction of universal cell-free DNA in the absence of first-trimester anatomical screening [^116SwtQJ]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Low credibility.

This study shows that when first-trimester anatomical screening (FTAS) is not part of the routine prenatal screening offer, an inevitable shift is observed in the timing of diagnosis for some anomalies, which are in principle amenable to early detection. In our cohort, this concerned 338 of the 461 (73.3%) anomalies diagnosed during or following the second-trimester anatomical screening (STAS), of which 37 (8%) belonged to the anomalies "always detectable" and 301 (65.3%) to the "sometimes detectable" in the first trimester.

If these two groups are considered together, a hypothetical maximum of 73% of the anomalies detected in the second half of pregnancy could have potentially been recognized earlier. Although this detection rate is theoretically possible, it is very unlikely that in a real-life setting, all of the "sometimes detectable" anomalies would have been diagnosed at FTAS. Multiple studies have shown that about half of the structural anomalies diagnosed at STAS can already be detected at FTAS. Therefore, we estimate that, in addition to the 8% of "always detectable" anomalies, a proportion of the "sometimes detectable" could have been diagnosed at FTAS.

In our cohort, only 13 women (2.6%) had undergone FTAS due to an increased a priori risk of fetal abnormalities. All other women only received a dating ultrasound scan at around 11 weeks of gestation. At this examination, some obvious defects (n = 31) could already be recognized. Of the 31, 29 (93.5%) belonged to the theoretically "always detectable" in the first trimester, such as anencephaly, alobar holoprosencephaly, megacystis, and abdominal wall defects. However, irrespective of the…

### Incidental detection of maternal malignancy by fetal cell-free DNA screening [^114SKn6b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

Cell-free DNA is an advancing technology with increasing applications in screening, diagnosis, and treatment for several disease processes. The shared physiological, genetic, and epigenetic characteristics of placental physiology and tumor development have become apparent to both clinicians and researchers. Maternal malignancy has been reported as a cause of false-positive prenatal cell-free DNA screening results. The detection of multiple aneuploidies or a single autosomal monosomy increases the chance for an underlying maternal malignancy when the result is discordant with fetal diagnostic testing.

There is currently no consensus guideline on counseling and evaluation of patients with concern for malignancy from cell-free DNA testing. Furthermore, laboratories differ significantly in reporting policies, terminology, and in reporting strategies and methods used for unexpected or incidental findings. The ordering practitioner is therefore tasked to understand the policies of their laboratory of choice to provide adequate pretest and posttest genetic counseling.

- **Pretest counseling**: The potential for incidental or unexpected findings or nonreportable results should be explained.
- **Posttest counseling**: With an abnormal, unanticipated, or nonreportable result, posttest counseling should include a description of possible fetal or maternal diagnoses, including malignancy. Health care professionals should explain options for further evaluation and management, including a recommendation for fetal diagnostic testing.

The medical workup recommended by various authors to evaluate cancer risk is based on co…

### Double aneuploidy detected by cell-free DNA testing and confirmed by fetal tissue analysis [^111MAmhV]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Double aneuploidies account for 0.21–2.8% of spontaneous abortions resulting from chromosomal abnormalities. Rarely, cell-free DNA testing detects multiple aneuploidies; however, to discern among maternal, placental, and fetal origin, further evaluation is required.

- **Case**: A 49-year-old woman, gravida 5 para 0, underwent cell-free DNA testing at 11 4/7 weeks of gestation, which revealed a fetus that was high risk for trisomies 18 and 21. On ultrasonography at 14 weeks of gestation, she was diagnosed with a missed abortion and underwent surgical management. Fetal and placental tissues were sent for analysis and were positive for trisomies 18 and 21, confirming the results of cell-free DNA testing.

- **Conclusion**: Our case highlights the ability of cell-free DNA testing to recognize a double aneuploidy confirmed by fetal tissue analysis.

### Harmonizing cell-free DNA collection and processing practices through evidence-based guidance [^113gJavR]. Clinical Cancer Research (2020). High credibility.

Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is rapidly transitioning from discovery research to an important tool in clinical decision-making. However, the lack of harmonization of preanalytic practices across institutions may compromise the reproducibility of cfDNA-derived data and hamper advancements in cfDNA testing in the clinic. Differences in cellular genomic contamination, cfDNA yield, integrity, and fragment length have been attributed to different collection tube types and anticoagulants, processing delays and temperatures, tube agitation, centrifugation protocols and speeds, plasma storage duration and temperature, the number of freeze-thaw events, and cfDNA extraction and quantification methods, all of which can also ultimately impact subsequent downstream analysis.

Thus, there is a pressing need for widely applicable standards tailored for cfDNA analysis that include all preanalytic steps from blood draw to analysis. The NCI's Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research Branch has developed cfDNA-specific guidelines that are based upon published evidence and have been vetted by a panel of internationally recognized experts in the field. The guidelines include optimal procedures as well as acceptable alternatives to facilitate the generation of evidence-based protocols by individual laboratories and institutions. The aim of the document, entitled "Biospecimen Evidence-based Best Practices for Cell-free DNA: Biospecimen Collection and Processing", is to improve the accuracy of cfDNA analysis in both basic research and the clinic by improving and harmonizing practices.

### Routine cell-free DNA prenatal screening identifies pregnancies at high risk for cystic fibrosis that may benefit from fetal therapy [^114saMXF]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2025). High credibility.

Recent improvements in cell-free DNA technology have enabled non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to screen for fetal single-gene autosomal recessive conditions from maternal blood as early as the first trimester. This technique can determine the fetal risk for cystic fibrosis (CF) with a single blood sample from a pregnant person without the need for a partner sample, which is required for traditional carrier screening.

A retrospective review of 100,106 consecutive general-risk pregnant patients who underwent CF carrier screening was completed. All positive CF carriers underwent cell-free DNA testing, which reported a risk of the fetus being affected with CF. Pregnancies with at least a 1 in 4 risk were classified as high risk. Results of confirmatory testing were solicited from all high-risk cases, and a random sample of 50% of low-risk cases was used to compute test performance analytics.

The study cohort included 2,587 CF carriers and 20 cases with high-risk cell-free DNA results where the CF-affected status of the fetus/neonate was known, of which 13 were affected. All cases (n = 8) with a 9 in 10 cell-free DNA estimated risk were affected. The assay correctly identified all known affected fetuses as high risk, with a sensitivity of 100%.

Of the 13 affected, 12 cases had at least one CFTR variant eligible for CFTR modulator therapy. Additionally, 75% of all cell-free DNA fetal risk results were returned before 18.5 weeks gestation, providing ample time for diagnostic testing and initiation of in utero treatment if indicated.

### Timing of diagnosis of fetal structural abnormalities after the introduction of universal cell-free DNA in the absence of first-trimester anatomical screening [^117Beubk]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Low credibility.

- **Classification of abnormalities**: Timing of detection of fetal abnormalities was divided into two groups depending on whether they were diagnosed in pregnancies in which first-trimester anatomical screening (FTAS) was performed or not. All abnormalities were classified based on the affected organ systems into the following groups: central nervous system, facial, thoracic, gastrointestinal, abdominal wall, genitourinary, skeletal/limbs, other abnormalities, and multiple congenital abnormalities (MCA). Cases with two structural abnormalities were classified based on the most severe one.

- **Multiple congenital abnormalities**: Cases with more than two structural abnormalities in at least two different organ systems were labeled as MCA. Ventriculomegaly was included as a structural abnormality when the atrial width was 10 mm or more during the second trimester. Microcephaly was included when the head circumference was < P2.3.

- **Specific conditions**: Hydronephrosis was included in the case of pelvicalyceal dilatation with an anteroposterior (AP) diameter of 10 mm or more in the second trimester and an AP diameter of 15 mm or more in the third trimester. An absent stomach on multiple ultrasounds was labeled as esophageal atresia, and an evident double bubble was labeled as duodenal atresia.

- **Detectability groups**: Diagnosed fetal abnormalities were classified into three groups depending on whether they were "always", "sometimes", or "never" detectable in the first trimester, according to the classification suggested by Syngelaki and colleagues. Cases with MCA were labeled as "always detectable" when at least one of the abnormalities belonged to the group of abnormalities detectable in the first trimester.

### Cell-free DNA fetal fraction in twin gestations in single-nucleotide polymorphism-based noninvasive prenatal screening [^116dtjaQ]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Low credibility.

In the 6-month period, 4615 twin and 121,446 singleton pregnancy test referrals met the inclusion criteria. Of the 4615 twin pairs, 1454 (31.51%) were monozygotic (MZ) and 3161 (68.49%) were dizygotic (DZ).

- **Demographics**: There were small but statistically significant differences in gestational ages when blood was drawn for noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS) for MZ, DZ, and singleton pregnancies (P < .0001). Maternal age was somewhat higher in DZ pregnancies compared with MZ and singleton pregnancies (P < .0001). Women with DZ pregnancies were also significantly heavier than women with MZ or singleton pregnancies (P < .0001).

- **FF and gestational age relationship**: Figure 1 A shows the relationship between fetal fraction (FF) and gestational age in twin pregnancies. The increase in FF with gestational age was very similar in MZ and DZ pregnancies and parallels that seen in singletons.

- **FF and maternal weight relationship**: The relationship between FF and maternal weight was proportionate in each of these three groups of pregnancies (Figure 1 B).

### Committee opinion no. 545: Noninvasive prenatal testing for fetal aneuploidy [^1119Lyur]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Noninvasive prenatal testing that uses cell-free fetal DNA from the plasma of pregnant women offers tremendous potential as a screening tool for fetal aneuploidy. Cell-free fetal DNA testing should be an informed patient choice after pretest counseling and should not be part of routine prenatal laboratory assessment. It should not be offered to low-risk women or women with multiple gestations because it has not been sufficiently evaluated in these groups. A negative cell-free fetal DNA test result does not ensure an unaffected pregnancy. A patient with a positive test result should be referred for genetic counseling and should be offered invasive prenatal diagnosis for confirmation of test results.

### Timing of diagnosis of fetal structural abnormalities after the introduction of universal cell-free DNA in the absence of first-trimester anatomical screening [^111Cv1Tr]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Low credibility.

This study has some limitations. Although the classification of abnormalities into "always", "sometimes", and "never" detectable in the first trimester is based on the largest and most comprehensive cohort available in the literature, there may be a variance between theoretically expected and observed detection rates. This study also clearly shows that not all anomalies can be diagnosed at the STAS. In fact, in 123 (25%) cases, the referral took place following a later ultrasound examination, after STAS. This confirms the findings of the study by Syngelaki et al. that about 20% of all the structural anomalies present in a fetal cohort will be diagnosed after the STAS, either in the late second or third trimester or even after birth. These late diagnoses concern especially gastrointestinal and some renal and skeletal anomalies. The goal of this study was not to assess the diagnostic ability of ultrasound but rather to identify the moment of diagnosis of anomalies in pregnancy and correlate this to a reported pattern of diagnosis in the first trimester.

### Analysis of cell-free fetal DNA for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis in a family with neonatal diabetes [^114pj3hK]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

An early genetic diagnosis of neonatal diabetes guides clinical management and leads to improved treatment in approximately 40% of patients. In the offspring of individuals with neonatal diabetes, a prenatal diagnosis allows accurate estimation of the risk of developing diabetes and, eventually, the most appropriate treatment for the baby. In this study, we performed non-invasive prenatal genetic testing for a fetus at risk of inheriting a paternal KCNJ11 p.R201C mutation causing permanent neonatal diabetes.

- **Methods**: A droplet digital polymerase chain reaction assay was used to detect the presence of the mutation in cell-free circulating DNA (cfDNA) extracted from maternal plasma at 12 and 16 weeks' gestation.

- **Results**: The mutation was not detected in the cfDNA samples, suggesting that the fetus had not inherited the KCNJ11 mutation. The fetal DNA fraction was estimated at 6.2% and 10.7%, which is above the detection limit of the assay. This result was confirmed by Sanger sequencing after the baby's birth, which showed that the baby's risk of developing neonatal diabetes was reduced to that of the general population.

- **Conclusions**: We report the first case of non-invasive prenatal testing in a family with neonatal diabetes. A prenatal diagnosis in families at high risk of monogenic diabetes informs both prenatal and postnatal management. Although the clinical impact of this novel technology still needs to be assessed, its implementation in clinical practice — including cases at risk of inheriting mutations from the mother — will likely have a positive impact on clinical management.

### Noninvasive prenatal exome sequencing diagnostic utility limited by sequencing depth and fetal fraction [^111F2cKv]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Low credibility.

Sequencing cell-free DNA now allows the detection of large chromosomal abnormalities and dominant Mendelian disorders in the prenatal period. Improving upon these methods would allow newborn screening programs to begin with prenatal genetics, ultimately improving the management of rare genetic disorders.

- **Methods**: As a pilot study, we performed exome sequencing on the cell-free DNA from three mothers with singleton pregnancies to assess the viability of broad sequencing modalities in a noninvasive prenatal setting.

- **Results**: We found poor resolution of maternal and fetal genotypes due to both sampling and technical issues.

- **Conclusion**: We find broad sequencing modalities inefficient for noninvasive prenatal applications. Alternatively, we suggest a more targeted path forward for noninvasive prenatal genotyping.

### Diurnal effects on the fraction of fetal cell-free DNA in maternal plasma [^113d5WDy]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). High credibility.

Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has revolutionized prenatal care by enabling early and accurate detection of fetal chromosomal abnormalities, such as trisomy 13, 18, and 21, through the analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal plasma. cfDNA in maternal blood comprises a mix of small genomic DNA fragments (< 200 base pairs) released primarily from the mother's hematopoietic system and organs, while the smaller fetal DNA fraction is derived mainly from syncytiotrophoblast cell turnover in the placenta. Fetal fraction (FF), defined as the ratio of fetal cfDNA to total circulating cfDNA in maternal plasma, is a critical parameter for ensuring NIPT accuracy and interpreting clinical outcomes. Estimates of FF can vary significantly between and within pregnancies but generally range between 0.10 and 0.15 during gestational weeks 10–20, the most common period for NIPT.

In general, higher FFs allow greater statistical separation between aneuploid and euploid pregnancies, enhancing test performance. Conversely, low FFs reduce detection rates and may lead to uninformative or "no call" outcomes if the FF does not meet the assay-specific minimum threshold, typically ranging from 0.02 to 0.04. Although most NIPT tests yield successful results, approximately 1%–8% of pregnant women receive uninformative or no-call outcomes primarily due to insufficient FF. Such cases pose significant challenges for clinical management, as they often necessitate either a repeat test using a second blood sample or invasive procedures such as amniocentesis, which carry additional risks.
