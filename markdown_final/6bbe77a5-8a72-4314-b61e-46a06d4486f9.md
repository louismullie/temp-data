## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment decision-making, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and how it frames treatment choices. Then, I should verify the evidence hierarchy and how guidelines grade recommendations. Next, I will examine patient-specific factors that modify treatment selection. After that, I need to check how to interpret and apply guideline recommendations in practice. Then, I will review special populations and implementation considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a decision framework and provide disease-specific examples to illustrate application, ensuring I continuously verify claims against the cited sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why it matters. Treatment decisions are anchored in disease severity, stage, comorbidities, and the strength of evidence supporting each option, so I need to ensure I am aligning choices with the best available guidance and the patient's clinical trajectory. For example, in COVID-19, recommendations vary by severity and risk of progression, and many agents are supported by low-to-moderate certainty evidence, which means I should be cautious and explicit about uncertainty when counseling patients [^113FjQVZ] [^112zQ87B]. In heart failure, contemporary guidelines emphasize patient-centered, evidence-based management and explicitly incorporate value statements where available, reinforcing the need to match therapy to both physiology and preferences [^113u92iX]. In hepatocellular carcinoma, the complexity of cirrhosis and competing liver-related mortality necessitates multidisciplinary, liver-function–preserving strategies rather than algorithm-only approaches, so I should confirm that any plan respects hepatic reserve and transplant candidacy [^115Toskd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "best" treatments without verifying the evidence hierarchy. I need to check that randomized controlled trials remain the highest-quality evidence for efficacy, while acknowledging that negative trials are as informative as positive ones for shaping practice and avoiding ineffective therapies [^1139B3fX]. Phase III trials typically provide the pivotal data for regulatory approval and guideline endorsement, whereas phase I and II trials inform dosing, safety, and preliminary efficacy signals; phase IV post-marketing studies refine safety and real-world effectiveness, so I should confirm where a given intervention sits on this continuum before recommending it [^116uUiem]. But wait, what if the evidence base is heterogeneous or indirect? In that case, I should double-check how guidelines synthesize and grade the certainty of evidence and the strength of recommendations, because this directly affects how confidently I can advise patients [^115uy5RM].

> Next, I should review how guidelines frame recommendations. I need to ensure I interpret class or category designations correctly: strong recommendations generally reflect high-certainty evidence and a clear net benefit, whereas weak or conditional recommendations reflect lower certainty or context-dependent tradeoffs. NCCN's "preferred", "other recommended", and "useful in certain circumstances" categories operationalize this gradient in oncology, and ACC/AHA classes I through III and corresponding phrasing standardize strength across cardiology domains, so I should verify the exact wording and intent before applying it [^111RF2eo] [^113HErCg]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "conditional" always meant "do not use", but that would be misleading; conditional recommendations often support use in the right context with shared decision-making, so I should correct that interpretation and communicate uncertainty transparently [^113FjQVZ] [^115uy5RM].

> I will now examine patient-specific factors that modify treatment choice. Age, comorbidities, frailty, organ function, and preferences can shift the balance of benefits and harms, and I should confirm that my plan accounts for these realities rather than assuming average trial effects apply uniformly. For instance, patients with multiple chronic conditions are frequently underrepresented in trials, so I need to explicitly acknowledge uncertainty and engage in shared decision-making about tradeoffs and monitoring plans [^112Kt3eU]. In type 2 diabetes, sustainability and patient willingness are central to success; prescribing a regimen the patient cannot adhere to undermines outcomes, so I should verify feasibility and revisit choices iteratively [^116G6PJt]. In HCC, cirrhosis severity and transplant candidacy often trump tumor-centric algorithms, so I must balance oncologic control with liver function preservation and candidacy optimization in MDT discussions [^115Toskd].

> Let me think about how to interpret and apply guideline statements in real time. I should confirm that strong recommendations warrant adoption unless contraindicated, while weak or conditional recommendations require individualized deliberation and documentation of rationale. For COVID-19, many suggestions are conditional due to low-to-moderate certainty; therefore, I need to discuss uncertainty, align with patient values, and monitor for evolving evidence that could change the plan [^113FjQVZ]. For hypertension, conflicting guidance across societies underscores the need to reconcile evidence, consider patient-specific risk and preferences, and avoid rigid thresholds when the balance of benefits and harms is nuanced or continuous rather than binary [^113UamHE]. I should double-check that my documentation reflects the strength of recommendation and the evidence gap I discussed with the patient [^115uy5RM].

> Next, I should review special populations and implementation considerations. In pediatrics, evidence is often limited; for COVID-19 in children, I must extrapolate cautiously, verify regulatory status of agents, and prioritize supportive care while avoiding off-label use without justification [^113HAmNW]. In older adults, deprescribing and step-down strategies may be appropriate when benefits are marginal or harms outweigh gains, so I should confirm goals of care and revisit the regimen regularly [^notfound]. In resource-limited settings, I need to ensure feasibility of monitoring, access to medications, and follow-up infrastructure; WHO tuberculosis guidance favoring community- or video-observed therapy illustrates how delivery models can be adapted to improve adherence and outcomes [^113cSbNy]. For emerging therapies like cell and gene therapies, I should verify logistical and system-level requirements, because delivery often requires specialized centers and coordinated pathways that differ from conventional drugs [^116FbWjz].

> I will now synthesize a practical decision framework, but let me first confirm the steps against the evidence. First, define the clinical question and context, including severity, stage, and comorbidities. Second, retrieve and appraise the most current, trustworthy guideline and its evidence base. Third, map options to the evidence hierarchy and guideline categories, noting conditional versus strong recommendations. Fourth, individualize by integrating patient preferences, feasibility, and special circumstances. Fifth, implement with appropriate monitoring and safety netting. Sixth, reassess iteratively as new evidence emerges or the patient's condition changes, documenting the rationale at each step [^115uy5RM] [^116uUiem]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with how high-quality guidelines advise clinicians to operationalize recommendations; yes, it mirrors the structured approach emphasized by users' guides and trial-to-practice translation frameworks [^115uy5RM] [^114HrAgG].

> Let me consider concrete disease-specific examples to ensure the framework is actionable. In advanced HCC, first-line systemic therapy selection should follow ASCO and NCCN updates, with multidisciplinary input to balance tumor control and liver function. I should confirm Child-Pugh eligibility for specific regimens and transplant candidacy considerations before finalizing the plan [^116DtgFZ] [^115Toskd]. In COVID-19, I should stratify by severity and progression risk, apply conditional recommendations such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for high-risk nonhospitalized patients, and avoid anchoring bias by evaluating alternative diagnoses. I also need to check EUA status and follow regulatory protocols for non-approved agents [^1135DQTh] [^111eHwcq]. In heart failure, I should apply the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline's stepwise, phenotype-informed therapy, escalate and de-escalate based on response, and incorporate value statements where available to guide cost-conscious choices [^113u92iX]. In asthma, I should use the stepwise GINA approach, tailor to age and phenotype, and plan for step-up or step-down based on control, recognizing evidence gaps in overlapping asthma-COPD features that require careful clinical judgment [^1143Ayc3] [^1179AP9W].

> But wait, what if the evidence is evolving rapidly or contradictory? I need to ensure my approach is adaptable and transparent about uncertainty. Living guidelines, like IDSA's COVID-19 updates, model iterative evidence integration and explicit versioning, which I can emulate in my documentation and patient communication when evidence is dynamic [^111tirQm]. I should also remember that treatment hierarchies and network meta-analyses can be informative but must be interpreted alongside effect sizes, confidence intervals, and evidence quality to avoid overinterpreting rankings [^117HGCCw]. Finally, I should double-check that shared decision-making is not a one-time event; revisiting choices as new data arrive or as patient priorities shift maintains alignment between evidence, feasibility, and values over time [^116G6PJt].

> In summary, I need to ensure that every treatment decision is anchored in the best available evidence, translated through trustworthy guidelines, and individualized to the patient's context and preferences, with explicit acknowledgment of uncertainty when appropriate. By systematically verifying the evidence hierarchy, interpreting guideline strength and applicability, integrating patient-specific modifiers, and planning for iterative reassessment, I can deliver care that is both evidence-based and patient-centered while remaining agile as the evidence evolves [^115uy5RM] [^116uUiem].

Treatment selection should be **individualized** based on disease severity, patient comorbidities, and preferences, using the **best available evidence** [^115uy5RM] and guideline-directed care [^113u92iX]. For many chronic diseases, a **stepwise approach** is recommended, starting with first-line therapies and escalating or switching based on response and tolerability [^1143Ayc3] [^112opxsU]. Shared decision-making is essential to align options with patient values and improve adherence [^116G6PJt] [^1175tK24]. Regular monitoring and timely adjustments help minimize adverse effects and optimize outcomes [^116G6PJt].

---

## General principles of treatment selection

- **Evidence-based practice**: Use the best available evidence, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses, to guide treatment decisions [^115uy5RM] [^1139B3fX].

- **Guideline-directed care**: Follow established clinical practice guidelines to ensure standardized, high-quality care [^113u92iX] [^116DtgFZ].

- **Patient-centered care**: Incorporate patient preferences, values, and clinical circumstances into treatment decisions [^116G6PJt] [^1175tK24].

- **Shared decision-making**: Engage patients in discussions about treatment options, benefits, risks, and costs [^116G6PJt].

---

## Stepwise treatment approaches

Many chronic diseases use a **stepwise approach**, starting with first-line therapies and escalating or switching based on response and tolerability [^notfound]. Examples include:

| **Disease** | **First-line therapy** | **Second-line therapy** | **Third-line therapy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Asthma | - Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) [^notfound] | - ICS + long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) [^notfound] | - Biologics (e.g. anti-IgE, anti-IL5) [^notfound] |
| Hypertension | - Thiazide diuretics <br/> - ACE inhibitors <br/> - Calcium channel blockers [^notfound] | - Combination therapy <br/> - Beta-blockers [^notfound] | - Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists <br/> - Direct renin inhibitors [^notfound] |
| Type 2 diabetes | - Metformin <br/> - Lifestyle modifications [^notfound] | - Sulfonylureas <br/> - GLP-1 receptor agonists <br/> - SGLT2 inhibitors [^notfound] | - Insulin therapy <br/> - Combination therapy [^notfound] |

## Factors influencing treatment choice

Several factors **influence treatment selection**:

- **Disease severity and stage**: More aggressive treatments may be necessary for advanced disease [^1155Dd25] [^1143Ayc3].

- **Patient comorbidities**: Comorbid conditions may limit treatment options or necessitate dose adjustments [^115Toskd].

- **Patient preferences and lifestyle**: Treatments must be feasible and acceptable to patients to ensure adherence [^116G6PJt] [^1175tK24].

- **Cost and accessibility**: Financial constraints and healthcare access can impact treatment choice [^1143Ayc3] [^112DXyUX].

- **Potential side effects and risks**: Treatments with favorable risk-benefit profiles are preferred [^112DXyUX] [^113HErCg].

---

## Role of shared decision-making

Shared decision-making is a **collaborative process** that improves adherence, satisfaction, and outcomes by aligning treatment with patient values and preferences [^116G6PJt] [^1175tK24]. It is especially important when multiple reasonable options exist or when trade-offs between benefits and harms are significant [^116xBUPw].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of treatment

Regular monitoring and timely adjustments are **essential** to optimize outcomes, minimize adverse effects, and address therapeutic inertia [^1143Ayc3] [^116G6PJt]. Key elements include:

- **Regular follow-up**: Schedule follow-up visits to assess treatment response and adherence [^112Kt3eU].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Use lab tests to monitor therapeutic effects and detect adverse reactions [^notfound].

- **Patient-reported outcomes**: Incorporate patient-reported symptoms and quality of life measures [^notfound].

- **Dose adjustments**: Modify treatment based on response, side effects, and changes in clinical status [^1143Ayc3].

---

## Emerging treatments and novel therapies

Emerging treatments — such as targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and gene therapies — offer promising options for previously untreatable conditions [^112htQFX] [^1132kz2k]. However, **rigorous clinical evaluation** is necessary to establish safety and efficacy before widespread adoption [^116uUiem] [^115nrLtU].

---

Treatment selection is a **complex process** that requires balancing evidence, guidelines, and patient-specific factors. Individualized, stepwise care with shared decision-making and regular monitoring helps achieve the best outcomes.

### When are treatment blinding and treatment standardization necessary in real-world clinical trials? [^112WpHyT]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

QUESTIONS TO INFORM CHOICES REGARDING CONCEALMENT OR BLINDING OF TREATMENT ALLOCATION

Question 1: Will the providers, participants, and raters have expectations regarding likely benefits and adverse effects of study interventions?

Even when investigators perceive equipoise between alternative treatments, study participants or treating clinicians may have strong preferences or expectations regarding differences (Table 1). In comparisons of new products with treatments in common use, both patients and clinicians may anticipate that a new treatment will be superior. In comparisons of treatments in common use, expectations may be influenced by media reports or direct‐to‐consumer marketing. As seen during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, patient and clinician perceptions regarding highly publicized treatments may be strongly influenced by media reports and high‐profile endorsements. A priori, investigators should consider to what extent evaluations and opinions expressed in popular media, regardless of backing by robust evidence, may influence behaviors or study patients, clinicians, or raters.

Table 1
Considerations regarding blinding or allocation concealment

Example: The CURVES trialcompared efficacy and evaluated dosing of atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin. Based on an expectation that participants and clinicians would not have strong preferences or expectations regarding differences among these similar treatments, neither participants nor clinicians were blinded to treatment assignment.

Question 2: How might preferences or expectations influence intervention adherence, the fidelity or intensity of the treatment delivered, or the reporting of beneficial or adverse effects?

Participants' or clinicians' expectations, perceptions of treatments, or preferences could affect treatment delivery, adherence to study treatment, as well as the assessment of outcomes. The potential influence of preferences and expectations on treatment delivery or adherence would be expected to increase with treatment duration, treatment complexity, and the need for personalization or adjustment of treatment based on perceived beneficial or adverse effects. Preferences and expectations would be expected to have greater potential to bias assessment of outcomes requiring subjective assessments by participants or clinicians. Those biases could influence reporting or assessment of both benefits and adverse effects or potential harms.

As an example, in the CURVES trialcomparing alternative statins using fixed dosing regimens, the efficacy end points were mean percent change in enzymatically measured plasma LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations over 8 weeks of treatment. Given the simple dosing profile for each of the study medications and the laboratory‐based determination of study outcome, the opportunity for expectations to affect treatment delivery, patient medication adherence, or outcome assessment was limited. Consequently, neither participants nor clinicians were blinded to treatment assignment.

### Current therapies for the medical management of diabetes [^1155cKxh]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes affects a large and diverse number of individuals who share in common its risks for complications but who differ greatly from one another in age, health, and a number of circumstances influential to successful treatment. Because type 2 diabetes comprises the majority of diabetes cases, a number of agents have been developed for its treatment. Their unique properties offer opportunities to overcome some of the treatment limitations of older medicines and enable a more individualized and flexible approach to glucose-lowering. At the same time, new medications are accompanied by greater costs and uncertainties about their long-term benefits or safety, and thus the present state of care for type 2 diabetes places focus on a process of shared decision-making between the clinician and patient as to which treatments can optimize health while minimizing harms. We review the major classes of diabetes agents and provide some guidance for how one might approach decision-making in choosing among them.

Treatment selection in metastatic ccRCC

As the predominant histological type within RCC, this is the group of patients for which there is the greatest evidence base to guide management. Renal cell carcinoma can sometimes follow an indolent course, therefore a period of observation can be considered before starting treatment. Immediate treatment is advised however where there is extensive multisite, progressive or symptomatic disease. First-line treatment in mRCC depends heavily on the prognostic category, with differing recommendations for favourable and intermediate-risk disease vs poor-risk disease.

### Pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^112opxsU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline key questions — acute episodic migraine pharmacologic treatment focuses on six key questions: comparative benefits and harms of initial pharmacologic treatments in adult patients with acute attacks of episodic migraine; comparative benefits and harms of second-step pharmacologic treatments for patients who did not achieve adequate relief with an initial pharmacologic treatment attempt for an acute migraine attack; patients' values and preferences regarding initial pharmacologic treatments; patients' values and preferences regarding second-step pharmacologic treatments; cost-effectiveness of initial pharmacologic treatments in adult patients; and cost-effectiveness of second-step pharmacologic treatments in patients who did not achieve adequate relief with an initial attempt. Across these, variation by demographic characteristics (age, sex, gender, race/ethnicity) and by the presence of menstrual or menstrual (cyclical) migraine is explicitly queried for benefits/harms and for outcomes.

### Summary version of the standards, options and recommendations for nonmetastatic breast cancer (updated January 2001) [^1179cMj1]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Management of patients with recurrent disease

Management of local recurrence after breast-conserving treatment for breast cancer

Local recurrence should be treated with surgery. Radiotherapy should not be considered except in specific cases (standard). The standard treatment is a simple total mastectomy (standard). Immediate reconstruction can be considered (option). If oestrogen receptors are present, additional hormone therapy is recommended (recommendation).

Breast-conserving surgery can only be considered if the patient refuses mastectomy or if mastectomy is technically impossible. In this case, the patient should be informed of the high risk of recurrent disease (recommendation). As the efficacy of additional chemotherapy is unknown, this should only be considered in the setting of a randomised clinical trial (recommendation, expert agreement).

Management of uncontrolled, isolated local recurrence (inflammatory or locally advanced tumour)

There is no standard (standard). Chemotherapy can be considered, followed if possible, by local treatment that may or may not be curative (options). Local treatment (surgery and/or radiotherapy) for symptom control can also be considered (option).

Chemotherapy is appropriate for an inflammatory recurrence. Radiotherapy can be considered if there are contraindications for chemotherapy (option). When possible, mastectomy should be performed for a locally advanced recurrence (option). If this is not possible, chemotherapy or radiotherapy should be given with the aim of making the lesion operable (option). Irrespective of the treatments administered, the indications for additional medical treatment will be the same as those for potentially curable isolated recurrences (recommendation, expert agreement).

### Alternative clinical trial designs [^115mQmLH]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

In any trial, the compromises needed to make the study a reality create trials that span the explanatory-pragmatic continuum. It is vitally important that the location on this continuum be consistent with the question the investigator is asking and the conclusions that the investigator wishes to impart on the eventual reader (table 2). Depending on the question being asked and the conclusion desired, the time to determine pragmatism is during the design phase as a clinical trial with no consideration for external validity might result in a conclusion that has no relevance outside the patients recruited. Pragmatic trials avoid this outcome by testing the intervention in an environment that most closely resembles how it will be used in the real world (table 3).

CONCLUSIONS

Prostate cancer encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical scenarios, ranging from low‐risk disease, in which treatment can only harm and not extend life, to a fatal disease, which still claims too many lives globally. Appropriate risk stratification and individualized treatment are keys to good management. Emerging data and new therapies will continue to refine therapeutic paradigms and improve outcomes for individuals with prostate cancer.

### The return of the lesion for localization and therapy [^114SaHEn]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Lesion-based localization has sometimes been considered a relic of the past, but it has re-emerged as a tool for causal localization of symptoms and identification of therapeutic targets. Although there are limitations to lesion-based treatments, new technologies are improving the accuracy, safety, and convenience of therapeutic lesioning. Combined, these developments may facilitate the return of the lesion, complementing the currently available neuroimaging and brain stimulation techniques for localization and therapy.

### Principles of good clinical trial design [^115nrLtU]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials are a fundamental component of medical research and serve as the main route to obtain evidence of the safety and efficacy of treatment before its approval. A trial's ability to provide the intended evidence hinges on appropriate design, background knowledge, trial rationale to sample size, and interim monitoring rules. In this article, we present some general design principles for investigators and their research teams to consider when planning to conduct a trial.

### Promises and challenges of personalized medicine to guide ARDS therapy [^113mQVZN]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Key lessons

Personalized medicine in ARDS is inherently challenging because of heterogeneous etiology and pathophysiology
ARDS research need not focus exclusively on novel investigational therapies, as repurposing drugs that have been studied in untargeted/unenriched populations could be just as innovative and promising, including for COVID-19 ARDS
Opportunities for targeting therapies include timing, clinical phenotypes, and biologic phenotypes
Adaptive clinical trial design offers the chance to investigate multiple therapies quickly and flexibly
Supportive interventions, such as ventilator management and fluid strategy, can also potentially be personalized
Though existing drugs and supportive care strategies may be repurposed/targeted, novel therapies are also on the horizon

### Targeted therapies for cancer [^112htQFX]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, targeted therapies have changed the cancer treatment paradigm. But many patients develop treatment resistance and ultimately succumb to tumor progression. The articles in this special collection highlighted the progress and current challenges on targeted therapies, which have achieved extraordinary success in a subset of cancers with actionable targets, such as ALK and ROS1 in NSCLC. The contributing authors are leading experts on each specific topic and should be congratulated on their outstanding discoveries, which may translate into clinical trials and benefit patients in near future. More studies are warranted to advance our understanding on the mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired resistance of these targeted therapies. Combination therapies that work on distinct mechanisms of action could be a promising strategy to minimize treatment resistance. Analysis of molecular subtypes and actionable targets, along with the identification of novel biomarkers, will be key to the development of optimal treatment strategies for patients with these lethal malignancies. Last but not the least, we would like to conclude by thanking the reviewers and the editorial staff for their tremendous effort to put together this special collection.

### Issues facing clinical trials of the future [^113rgofF]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Diagnostic and therapeutic technology continues to advance rapidly, as does our knowledge of therapeutics and of clinical research methods. Unfortunately, these advances have been only poorly coupled with our knowledge of therapeutic principles, leading to increasing uncertainty about which technologies are truly effective and, amongst those that are effective, which are most effective for the cost. This article presents general principles derived from several investigators' experiences with clinical trials, and uses them to suggest how future clinical trials may differ from current approaches. A proposed organization for future trials also is elucidated.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1179AP9W]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Unanswered clinical questions in patients with overlapping features of asthma and COPD — there is an urgent need for more research to guide better recognition and safe and effective treatment, because patients who do not have 'classical' features of asthma or of COPD, or who have features of both, have generally been excluded from randomized controlled trials of most therapeutic interventions for airways disease, and from many mechanistic studies. Future research should include study of clinical and physiological characteristics, biomarkers, outcomes and underlying mechanisms among broad populations of patients with respiratory symptoms or with chronic airflow limitation. In the meantime, the present chapter provides interim advice about diagnosis and initial treatment from the perspective of clinicians, particularly those in primary care and nonpulmonary specialties, and further research is needed to inform evidence-based definitions, to provide a more detailed classification of these patients, and to encourage the development of specific interventions for clinical use.

### Consistency of recommendations for evaluation and management of hypertension [^113UamHE]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Box.
Criteria for Classification of Recommendations

We found inconsistent guidance for a disconcertingly high proportion of reference recommendations. This suggests that clinicians evaluating and treating hypertension are often faced with impossible expectations, in that following one guideline's recommendations would mean going against recommendations from another guideline.

Regardless of measures taken to improve CPG development, a high degree of consistency and strong guidance may be unrealistic in hypertension management. The direct evidence for precise actions is often limited, the thresholds for action are often more continuous than binary, and the relative importance of benefits and harms is sensitive to an individual patient's values and preferences.

### Treatment guidelines in psoriatic arthritis [^111q88H7]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose of guidelines

As pathophysiology of disease and therapy effectiveness, particularly in specific scenarios, is better understood, physicians may struggle to keep up with the latest evidence. Treatment guidelines are designed with several goals in mind: to educate providers, particularly in a changing therapeutic landscape; to describe 'best care' through processing of the best available scientific evidence and broad consensus and to simultaneously point out where there is little information to guide treatment decisions; to reduce inappropriate variation in care and set standards for quality control; to promote efficient use of resources; and to highlight the research that needs to be done to inform future care.

### Current and new treatment options for adults recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes [^116G6PJt]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

No treatment is appropriate for all patients, nor is any one treatment optimal. The challenge is to find that treatment that best fits with what a patient is able and willing to do and embrace at this point in their diabetes journey, with an emphasis on shared-decision making and revisiting at future office visits. Prescribing a medication or making lifestyle recommendations that a patient is not willing or able to follow for any reason is not likely to lead to improvements in diabetes outcomes. The best treatment is one that is easy to implement and sustainable for the patient. Primary care often sees patients over the course of their lifetime and can revisit treatment options. Regardless of management decisions, frequent monitoring of glycaemia is crucial to assure therapeutic inertia is addressed.

### Mechanism-based cancer therapy: resistance to therapy, therapy for resistance [^111pQa7W]. Oncogene (2015). Low credibility.

The introduction of targeted therapy promised personalized and efficacious cancer treatments. However, although some targeted therapies have undoubtedly improved prognosis and outcome for specific cancer patients, the recurrent problem of therapeutic resistance subdues present revolutionary claims in this field. The plasticity of tumor cells leads to the development of drug resistance by distinct mechanisms: (1) mutations in the target, (2) reactivation of the targeted pathway, (3) hyperactivation of alternative pathways and (4) cross-talk with the microenvironment. Moreover, the intra-tumor heterogeneity of most tumors can also limit therapeutic response. Interestingly, the early identification of some mechanisms of resistance led to the use of alternative agents that improved clinical benefit, demonstrating that an understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving resistance to specific therapies is of paramount importance. Here we review the most generalized mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies, together with some experimental strategies employed to identify such mechanisms. Therapeutic failure is not an option and we need to understand the dynamics of tumor adaptation in order to adequately adjust therapies; in essence 'to fight fire with fire'.

### Guidelines of care for the management of actinic keratosis [^115RYn16]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Actinic keratosis (AK) management approaches — treatment options include topically applied creams, gels, and solutions; cryosurgery; and photodynamic therapy (PDT), with selection based on AK features, treatment factors, and patient preferences; although these guidelines focus on treatment, there are situations in which nontreatment is a potential option and observation may be considered for patients with limited life expectancy or when morbidity outweighs benefit; treatment can be field directed or lesion directed, with field-directed options such as topical agents or PDT used to manage multiple AKs and keratinocytic changes and potentially reduce new AKs, limit recurrence, and mitigate subclinical damage, while lesion-directed options manage few or isolated AKs and can be completed within a single visit using modalities such as liquid nitrogen cryosurgery or curettage, though practical limits on the number treatable in this manner may favor a field-directed approach; given variability in participation and discomfort, shared decision-making between patient and clinician about therapy choice is important.

### Translational cancer research: balancing prevention and treatment to combat cancer globally [^114NoUPt]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2015). Low credibility.

The Tradition of Translational Cancer Research

Recent decades have yielded unprecedented advances in understanding the biological mechanisms underlying cancer development and progression. Translation of this knowledge to the clinic promises new treatments tailored to exploit the molecular Achilles heel of a patient's tumor. This has been described as personalized medicine, precision medicine, or, more conservatively, as stratified medicine and is popularized in the term "bench-to-bedside" research. In the cancer field, this is what is generally understood by translational cancer research. Thus, molecularly informed treatment points to marked improvements in patient outcomes. However, cancer challenges are emerging that need additional and complementary solutions.

Because of population growth, increasing life expectancies and changes in underlying cancer incidence, the annual number of cases continues to rise globally, being expected to almost double in the next 20 years. Currently, close to half the people living within five years of a diagnosis (13.6 million) are from the richest countries, which comprise only one sixth of the world's population (840 million). Allied to this human burden is the spiraling cost of cancer therapy, which weighs ever more heavily on national budgets. However, the largest relative increases in new cases in the coming decades will occur in low-income countries, where even affordable and effective cancer treatments remain largely unavailable and demands on inadequate cancer services will only continue to grow. Lower income countries therefore face a "double burden" as they transition to higher numbers of cancers on top of preexisting burdens from communicable diseases and malnutrition.

Regarding medical management for pleural mesothelioma - NCCN, more specifically with respect to management of stage I disease, NCCN 2024 guidelines recommend to offer the following treatment options in patients with pleural mesothelioma and clinical stage I and epithelioid histology:

- systemic therapy and consider offering pleural intensity-modulated radiation therapy (preferred, performed in carefully selected patients at centers with experience in this technique)

- observation (consider offering for patients who are asymptomatic with minimal burden of disease if systemic therapy is planned at the time of symptomatic or radiographic progression) (Category 2A)

- surgical evaluation (however, recognize that the benefit of surgical resection is unclear and there is no evidence that patient survival is improved with surgery when combined with systemic therapy versus systemic therapy alone) (Category 2A).

### Advances in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma: an overview of the current and evolving therapeutic landscape for clinicians [^115Toskd]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

UTILIZING MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAMS FOR INDIVIDUALIZED DECISION MAKING

Considering the large number of treatment options available for patients with HCC, the methodology for deciding the optimal treatment for any given patient is particularly challenging. Historically, numerous algorithms were created to help guide treatment decisions, However, algorithms are increasingly becoming outdated, incomplete, and complicated because of the growing number of treatment options and combination therapies. Although many treatments and combination therapies have highly promising results, there is a paucity of randomized studies that compare outcomes between the various treatments. Because most patients with HCC have various degrees of cirrhosis, they represent a particularly complex subset of patients who have cancer. Essentially, all treatment options adversely affect hepatic reserve to some degree, making it essential to balance effective cancer control with the preservation of liver function — particularly because between one quarter to one third of patients with HCC die of competing risks, specifically underlying liver‐related complications, rather than HCC. Therefore, although the primary goal of cancer therapies is to eradicate or manage HCC, maintaining liver function is equally critical for improving patient outcomes. Because LT produces the best outcomes for the majority of patients, the goals of treatment are not only to preserve liver function and control tumor but also to optimize transplantation candidacy. Although no algorithm can accurately and comprehensively capture the complexities of the patients and treatments, multidisciplinary tumor boards have emerged as a critical tool to guide optimal decision making that often now supersedes most algorithms. These teams typically consist of transplant hepatologists, gastroenterologists, hepatobiliary surgeons, transplant surgeons, diagnostic radiologists, interventional radiologists, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists. A multimodal treatment approach for HCC from a patient's perspective involves not only dealing with the medical aspects of the disease but also navigating the physical, emotional, and practical challenges that arise during treatment. Patient‐centered considerations are essential when contemplating multimodal therapy. Patients with HCC often face a bleak outlook, so the opportunity to receive multiple, targeted treatment options brings a sense of hope. Multimodal treatments are seen as a way to maximize the chances of tumor reduction or elimination, potentially extend life expectancy, and offer personalized care tailored to individual tumor characteristics. Many patients with HCC prioritize quality of life as an even higher priority than survival. Patients want to maintain as much normalcy as possible and to be able to perform daily activities, spend time with loved ones, and retain some control over their bodies and choices. A multimodal treatment approach may offer the potential to extend life, but it can also compromise a patient's physical and emotional state.

Conclusion

In the absence of definitive management protocols, many treatment regimes have been explored in the treatment of COVID-19. Some of these treatments may have been tried out of desperation, and among these, some show initial promise. However, it is too early to see any published results of rigorous clinical trials.

Using the serum of recovered patients is a tried and tested approach, and trials are underway to study its effectiveness. This treatment appears to be helpful in the short term until definitive and effective treatments are found.

### Targeted therapies for cancer [^117Dn6gi]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The past few decades have seen extraordinary progress in developing novel treatment options that target tumors with specific molecular perturbations. These novel treatment options, known as targeted therapies, have shifted the treatment paradigm for a subset of cancer types, such as lung cancer. Emerging evidence has supported the rationale of the combination of targeted therapies with traditional therapies or immunotherapy to achieve optimal benefit while limiting the undesirable side effects. It takes a village to develop an approved targeted therapy from scratch. However, most cancer patients were unaware of the eligibility for targeted therapies upon diagnosis, which might have otherwise improved the overall prognoses. The development of next-generation sequencing has demonstrated a valuable asset for tailoring individualized treatment strategy. Nowadays, more and more patients could benefit from these targeted therapies. Even though, treatment resistance will inevitably develop, highlighting an urgent need to develop more innovative therapies that could target the evolving vulnerabilities.

### The complexity underlying treatment rankings: how to use them and what to look at… [^117HGCCw]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

If obtaining a treatment hierarchy is one of the aims of the synthesis, we recommend reviewers to specify the treatment hierarchy question a priori in the protocol, together with the appropriate ranking metric to answer that treatment hierarchy question. This is the first step to avoid misinterpreting the findings of the chosen ranking. The presented treatment hierarchy must be interpreted together with the relative treatment effects, with particular attention to the uncertainty in the estimations, as well as the quality of the synthesised evidence. More work focusing on the development of a comprehensive framework for evaluating the confidence in the rankings of treatments is needed.

Introduction

Findings from randomized clinical trials of cancer treatments represent the highest level of evidence for informing cancer care guidelines. Trials with both positive and negative findings can influence guideline care recommendations. This highlights the importance of completing all trials successfully and demonstrates how trials with negative findings are critical for understanding which newly developed treatments should not be used. One question is whether negative trials that influence guideline care are recognized for their scientific relevance by the research community.

### Preparing for pandemics: a systematic review of pandemic influenza clinical management guidelines [^1137UUGJ]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

What do the new findings imply?

The data highlight a need to ensure mechanisms for regular updates of pandemic influenza CMGs are considered at the development stage, to ensure publicly available CMGs are up to date, providing the best available evidence-based treatment and supportive care recommendations, for different at-risk populations.
The limited scope highlights a need for investments into trials to identify effective treatments and supportive care strategies to benefit patient care and outcomes.
A living guideline framework with mechanisms for integrating new evidence and dissemination, with close links between researchers and guideline developers from different settings, is needed to improve the quality, inclusivity, and availability of evidence-based care recommendations.
Further research is needed into the implementation of CMGs from development to the front line in different settings and contexts.

### Interventions for basal cell carcinoma: from evidence to personalized treatment [^1156SPW7]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

High‐quality evidence is required to inform patients on risks and benefits of treatments. A patient's personal situation can be of influence when considering treatment options. Low risk of recurrence and excellent cosmetic outcomes are not always of utmost importance to patients. Other issues, such as risks and side‐effects, type of therapy (treatment process), convenience of treatment (travel time and waiting time) and costs were included in several discrete choice experiments. Furthermore, for patients with a limited life‐expectancy, watchful‐waiting can be a suitable option. Implementing shared decision‐making results in well‐informed patients with an improved grasp of the risks and benefits of treatments.

To conclude, the updated review on interventions for BCC is a highly valuable and well‐executed summary of evidence that identified important gaps in the available evidence and can be used to weigh the risks and benefits of treatments.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^1115XFeh]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — treatment options introduction states that treatment options include pharmacotherapy with one of three medications (methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone) and psychosocial treatment, and that withdrawal management alone is not a treatment and should only be part of a comprehensive and longitudinal plan of care. Medications work quickly to reduce the risk for overdose and overdose death, and thus the combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial treatments, tailored to the individual's needs, is the recommended standard of care. Evidence cited indicates that methadone and buprenorphine maintenance are superior to withdrawal management alone and significantly reduce illicit opioid use; mortality is lower in patients on methadone or buprenorphine, these medications lower the risk of acquiring or spreading HIV infection, and buprenorphine compared with no treatment decreases heroin use and improves treatment retention. The guideline also notes evidence supporting extended-release injectable naltrexone versus placebo for prevention of relapse to opioid use disorder.

### Lipid management in cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines: strategies and tactics for implementation [^114i3PGA]. Atherosclerosis (2008). Low credibility.

Despite the widespread dissemination of clinical practice guidelines on the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD causes one third of deaths worldwide and almost half of all deaths in the developed world. It is therefore likely that, although some aspects of CVD management have improved, there is still a significant shortfall between what is known about CVD prevention and what is put into action. Twenty-one experts in the field of CVD from around the world attended a focus panel meeting in Marlow-on-Thames, UK (see acknowledgements for a list of meeting participants). These experts were invited to discuss practical strategies and tactics for overcoming barriers to the implementation of guidelines on CVD prevention, and lipid management in particular. This article reviews and updates the key topics presented during the course of the meeting, captures the essence of the group discussions, and summarizes the meeting outcomes. The participants concluded that initial efforts to implement CVD prevention guidelines more effectively are best directed at high-risk patients who have already been identified. Once current patients achieve their targets, more attention can be paid to finding untreated patients at risk. Recommendations from the expert panel included: Harmonize guidelines; focus on common areas of consensus rather than state-of-the-art science. Remove the boundary between primary and secondary prevention and focus on level of overall risk. Help policy makers understand the different components of CVD. Include professional societies from different specialties in guideline development and implementation, to increase ownership and decrease fragmentation of guideline committees.

### Multiple sclerosis: current treatment algorithms [^111fZGy3]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system. Currently, there are different formulations approved for MS treatment and others are in different stages of investigation or awaiting approval by federal agencies.

Recent Findings

All of these medications have demonstrated partial efficacy along with different side-effect profiles. Nevertheless, many patients continue to experience disease activity while on treatment, and recommendations have been made on how the success of therapy in an individual patient can be assessed.

Summary

The option of individualized optimal treatment is progressively more complicated due to the growth of our knowledge about the natural behavior of MS and its different types and stages, the variety of different therapies, their strength and weaknesses, and their serious and sometimes life-threatening side-effects. In this review, we will summarize current algorithms and treatment options and also address clinical challenges we regularly face in arriving at treatment choices for our patients.

### Clinical trial results applied to management of the individual cancer patient [^114HrAgG]. World Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

The application of clinical trial results to the management of the individual cancer patient is not always straightforward. The results of a clinical trial indicate the "average" effect of an intervention, often expressed in terms of an absolute risk reduction, which is an estimate of the likelihood of benefit for a particular patient. However, within any clinical trial, there might be differences between groups of patients in underlying pathology, genetics, or biology, and some patients might benefit more from a new treatment than others. Thus, within a clinical trial, it might also be useful to group together patients with similar characteristics, and test for subgroup interaction. The test for interaction will indicate whether the magnitude of benefit differs from one prognostic subgroup to the next (a quantitative interaction). Much less common are qualitative interactions, in which a new treatment is beneficial in one subgroup but harmful in another. If the test for subgroup interaction is significant, then the effects of treatment may indeed differ between subgroups of patients, but this should be confirmed in other trials before a treatment is implemented in clinical practice.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure [^113u92iX]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

The "2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure" replaces the "2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure" and the "2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA Focused Update of the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure". The 2022 guideline is intended to provide patient-centric recommendations for clinicians to prevent, diagnose, and manage patients with heart failure.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 2020 to December 2020, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other relevant databases. Additional relevant clinical trials and research studies, published through September 2021, were also considered. This guideline was harmonized with other American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines published through December 2021.

Structure

Heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. The 2022 heart failure guideline provides recommendations based on contemporary evidence for the treatment of these patients. The recommendations present an evidence-based approach to managing patients with heart failure, with the intent to improve quality of care and align with patients' interests. Many recommendations from the earlier heart failure guidelines have been updated with new evidence, and new recommendations have been created when supported by published data. Value statements are provided for certain treatments with high-quality published economic analyses.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^111i4J6E]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with significant complications and controversies regarding its optimal management. Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements have attempted to provide clinicians with evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies for hyponatraemia. Recently published guidance documents differ in their methods employed to review the quality of available evidence. Nagler et al. used the Appraisal of Guideline for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument in a systematic review of guidelines and consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia. Nagler and colleagues highlighted the variability in methodological rigour applied to guideline development and inconsistencies between publications in relation to management of hyponatraemia (including the recommended rate of correction of a low serum sodium concentration). These differences could cause confusion for practising physicians managing patients with hyponatraemia.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^1143Ayc3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Stepwise approach for managing asthma.

In preparing the step diagrams (Figs 2–4), the Expert Panel used some of the definitions and assumptions from EPR-3. The step diagrams that follow this section retain the EPR-3 recommendations that the Expert Panel did not address in the current report. The Expert Panel encourages readers to review the footnotes in the step diagrams because they offer important information about the use of these diagrams.

The following conventions apply to Figs 2 to 4:
Each figure applies to the care of individuals with asthma in one age group. Fig 2 applies only to ages 0 to 4 years. Fig 3 applies only to ages 5 to 11 years. Fig 4 applies only to ages 12 years and older.
Clinicians decide which step of care is appropriate depending on whether the individual is newly diagnosed (ie, is treatment naive) or whether the clinician is adjusting the individual's therapy to achieve asthma control. For newly diagnosed or treatment-naive individuals, clinicians should first choose the appropriate step diagram for the person's age and then consider both the individual's level of asthma impairment and risk when selecting the initial step and treatment. Within a given step, the preferred options are the best management choices supported by the evidence that the Expert Panel reviewed. When the available evidence is insufficient or does not change a previous recommendation, the step diagrams list preferred options from the EPR-3 step diagrams. Within a given step, an alternative option(s) is management strategies that are less effective or have more limited evidence than the preferred options. Clinicians and patients may choose the alternative treatments if individuals with asthma are currently receiving this therapy and their asthma is under control, if the preferred treatments are not available or too costly, or if the individuals with asthma prefer an alternative treatment. Preferred and alternative treatments within a step category are listed alphabetically unless the Expert Panel has established a rank order of preference for the preferred or alternative treatments. A lack of rank order is indicated by "or" between treatment options.
In the stepwise approach to therapy for asthma, the clinician escalates treatment as needed (by moving to a higher step) or, if possible, deescalates treatment (by moving to a lower step) once the individual's asthma is well controlled for at least three consecutive months. For individuals with persistent asthma (ie, who require treatment at Step 2 or above), clinicians should be guided by the current step of treatment and the individual's response to therapy (in terms of both asthma control and adverse effects) both currently and in the past to decide whether to step up, step down, or continue the current therapy. For individuals with persistent asthma who are using an alternative treatment and have an unsatisfactory or inadequate response to that therapy, the Expert Panel suggests replacing the alternative treatment with the preferred treatment within the same step before stepping up therapy.
The Expert Panel did not add management options that the panel recommends against, or for which the evidence is insufficient to determine harms and benefits, to the step diagrams. Instead, these options are listed in Table IF.
The guidance provided in the step diagrams is meant to assist and not replace the clinical decision making required for individual patient managementand the input from individuals with asthma about their preferences.

### Promising targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases [^112nPR7E]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Genetics and pathology have proven to be an effective combination to identify an evolving and deepening landscape of pathways and potential therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative diseases. Initially this landscape appeared to be populated with distinct therapeutic targets but with potentially overlapping mechanisms in each neurodegenerative disease. Our understanding has expanded to recognize that multiple pathologies are common in neurodegenerative disease, and that there is considerable overlap in pathways and targets driving neurodegenerative diseases. This potentially opens the way for future treatments to be indicated by tissue pathology and genetic basis rather than clinical phenotype. The potential to treat neurodegenerative disease by addressing underlying pathophysiology is still in the early days and challenges remain, especially the likely need to address pathologies early in disease. This will require redefinition of diagnosis and the tools to enable earlier diagnosis.

### Guidelines for asthma management: a review and comparison of 5 current guidelines [^115vixQ2]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

The first clinical practice guidelines for the assessment and management of asthma were published over 20 years ago in New Zealand and Australia. During the same period, British and Scottish groups were collaborating on a United Kingdom version of asthma guidelines. Shortly after the introduction of the New Zealand and Canadian guidelines, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the United States National Institutes of Health participated in 2 additional asthma guideline endeavors, which were published in the early 1990s. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute formed the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program to develop asthma guidelines for the United States, and participated with an international task force to develop guidelines for the treatment of asthma in all countries, which resulted in the formation of the Global Initiative for Asthma in the mid-1990s. The asthma guidelines issued by professional societies and other groups prior to the late 1990s were primarily based on consensus or expert opinion in each guideline committee, though those opinions were based on the available studies. The early guidelines played a vital role in bridging the gap between various treatment options and recent discoveries in basic science, and served as the vehicle to implementation into daily clinical practice. Asthma guidelines have been published and revised in dozens of countries around the world and have become reputable directives or "road maps" in asthma diagnosis, treatment, and management for patients of all ages. The guidelines have similar formats. The dissemination and implementation of the early guidelines was inconsistent, and they were criticized for not being evidence-based. As the knowledge of asthma pathophysiology continues to expand, along with basic science research on asthma diagnosis, treatment, and management, as well as education of the asthma patient, it is essential that the asthma guidelines be frequently updated and based on evidence-based-medicine processes.

### Guidelines for treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis and patient care [^113cSbNy]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for pulmonary tuberculosis, more specifically with respect to setting of care, WHO 2017 guidelines recommend to consider offering the following treatment administration options in patients on tuberculosis treatment:

- community- or home-based directly observed treatment over health facility-based directly observed treatment or unsupervised treatment

- directly observed treatment administered by trained lay providers or health-care workers over directly observed treatment administered by family members or unsupervised treatment

- video-observed treatment over directly observed treatment when the video communication technology is available and can be appropriately organized and operated by healthcare providers and patients.

### Role of novel targeted therapies in the clinic [^115EH1AZ]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

The number and variety of novel, molecular-targeted agents offers realistic hope for significant advances in cancer treatment. The potential of these new treatment approaches is unquestionable, but the reality is something that only thorough clinical evaluation and experience can reveal. Clinical experience of targeted therapies is at an early stage but it is likely that we will have an increasing number of treatment options available to us in the near future. This manuscript explores our current understanding of molecular-targeted therapies and considers: What approach should be used? (single vs multitarget agents); When should they be administered? (identifying the optimal point for intervention); How should they be used? (monotherapy or combination therapy regimens); and Who should we be giving them to? (acknowledging the need for patient selection).

### Systemic therapy for melanoma: ASCO guideline update [^112Kt3eU]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Multiple chronic conditions — evidence limitations and care planning considerations are described, emphasizing shared decision making and clinician review of all conditions. Creating evidence-based recommendations to inform treatment of patients with additional chronic conditions — referred to as multiple chronic conditions — is challenging because these patients are a complex and heterogeneous population and are often excluded from clinical trials, limiting the reliability of outcome data. As many patients for whom guideline recommendations apply present with multiple chronic conditions, any treatment plan needs to consider the complexity and uncertainty created by the presence of those conditions and highlights the importance of shared decision making regarding guideline use and implementation, and clinicians should review all other chronic conditions present in the patient and take those conditions into account when formulating the treatment and follow-up plan.

### Design and reporting of interventional clinical trials [^116uUiem]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

What are the different phases in clinical trials? What is the purpose of each of them?

Early phase trials are safety studies, and then late-phase trials are the randomized trials that are generally required before a new treatment is considered for licensing and wider use.

Phase I studies have the primary endpoints of safety and recommended phase II dose — so these trials look to establish the best dose of a drug or combination for further clinical testing. These are also the studies that explore for the first time the clinical pharmacology of a new agent in humans. Phase II studies are traditionally the first efficacy studies and inform the design of the pre-registration phase III study. Therefore, these phase III studies are the pivotal trials that allow a potential new treatment to be considered by the regulators as a standard treatment that would be widely available and recommended. Phase IV studies are carried out post-marketing, often for safety surveillance.

What is the difference between primary and secondary outcomes? Should a clinical trial publication include all the pre-specified outcome measures and at the pre-specified follow-up time? What are the drawbacks of not doing so?

The primary outcome of any study is the key measure to be evaluated by the trial, and the one around which all the sample size and statistical analyses are based. Secondary outcomes follow on from this and are frequently linked. For example, the primary outcome in a cancer trial might be overall survival with a secondary outcome of progression-free survival or time to next treatment being needed. In the early phase safety studies, which are the majority of my clinical practice, primary outcomes are typically the toxicity data reported or recommended phase II dose, with secondary outcomes of drug pharmacokinetics, and response.

### Pharmacologic treatment and management of coronavirus disease 2019 [^114akMNt]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Over the last 2 years, there has been gradual and sustained progress toward our understanding of pharmacotherapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a result of large- and small-scale randomized controlled trials. Numerous new and repurposed treatments have been evaluated; some have demonstrated benefit in clinically important outcomes like mortality and hospitalization, and optimism for oral antiviral treatments is growing. Given the rapidly evolving landscape of COVID-19 treatments, frontline clinicians should use treatment and management guidelines to guide their approach to each patient, with the individual's severity and location of illness in mind to appreciate the nuances in clinical evidence.

### Running interferon interference in treating PV / ET: meeting unmet needs [^1172vDQY]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Enthusiasm about interferons for the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms has recently arisen. How does a nontargeted therapy selectively target the malignant clone? Many foundational questions about interferon treatment are unanswered, including who, when, and for how long do we treat. Using an individual case, this review touches on gaps in risk assessment in polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) and the history of treatment with interferons. How is it that this proinflammatory cytokine effectively treats ET and PV, themselves proinflammatory states? We summarize existing mechanistic and clinical data, the molecular context as a modifier for treatment response, the establishment of treatment goals, and the challenges that lie ahead.

### Acne scarring: a review and current treatment modalities [^111BahJm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Acne is a prevalent condition in society and often results in secondary damage in the form of scarring. Of course, prevention is the optimal method to avoid having to correct the physically or emotionally troublesome scars. However, even with the best efforts, scars will certainly arise. This article attempts to give a broad overview of multiple management options, whether medically, surgically, or procedurally based. The hope is that a general knowledge of the current available alternatives will be of value to the physician when confronted with the difficult task of developing a treatment plan for acne-scarred individuals, even in challenging cases.

### Choice and selection of treatment modalities for cardiac patients: an interventional cardiology perspective [^112TGdT8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Interventional cardiology has embarked on an exciting era — an era that is filled with innovation, and rapidly evolving technology that has opened multiple avenues and options for our patients. However, we are also faced with the difficult task of determining the most optimal treatment strategy, often in areas of uncertainty (Figure 7). As evidenced by important lessons in multiple areas discussed above, we all realize that there are several areas of uncertainty in key areas of interventional cardiology. Based on all the experiences in various fields in interventional cardiology, there are 5 basic principles that one should use in cases of medical uncertainty. 62
Acknowledge ignorance and lack of definitive clinical data
Involve the patient and family in all clinical decision‐making
Work in collaboration with other experts to consider all possible treatment strategies
Prioritize sound clinical evidence, before adopting unproven clinical therapies
Caution must be exercised if extrapolating from results of low‐grade/anecdotal evidence, because of intrinsic biases

### How to interpret and use a clinical practice guideline or recommendation: users' guides to the medical literature [^115uy5RM]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Clinicians may rely on recommendations from clinical practice guidelines for management of patients.

Observations

A clinical practice guideline is a published statement that includes recommendations that are intended to optimize patient care. In the guideline development process, a panel of experts formulates recommendation questions that guide the retrieval of evidence that is used to inform the recommendations. Typically, methods of guideline development, a summary of the supporting evidence, and a justification of the panel's decisions accompany the recommendations. To use such guidelines optimally, clinicians must understand the implications of the recommendations, assess the trustworthiness of the development process, and evaluate the extent to which the recommendations are applicable to patients in their practice settings. Helpful recommendations are clear and actionable, and explicitly specify whether they are strong or weak, are appropriate for all patients, or depend on individual patients' circumstances and values. Rigorous guidelines and recommendations are informed by appropriately conducted, up-to-date systematic reviews that consider outcomes important to patients. Because judgments are involved in the interpretation of the evidence and the process of moving from evidence to recommendations, useful guidelines consider all relevant factors that have a bearing in a clinical decision and are not influenced by conflicts of interest.

Conclusions and Relevance

In considering a guideline's recommendations, clinicians must decide whether there are important differences between the factors the guideline panel has considered in making recommendations and their own practice setting.

### New treatment paradigms in spondyloarthritis [^113KNZ7W]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review presents the recent rapid expansion of therapeutical options in spondyloarthritis. Additionally, it focuses on the importance of additional questions raised by the growing therapeutic possibilities related to the optimal use of these drugs.

Recent Findings

The emergence of new treatment options opens new avenues and opportunities for treating patients with nonresponse, contraindications, or intolerance for classic drugs. However, it becomes more relevant than ever to define not only drugs and treatment options but also treatment strategies. We address current literature and remaining questions on strategies such as early intervention, combination treatment, personalized medicine, and treat-to-target.

Summary

Not only the treatment as such, but also the treatment strategy is crucial to reveal the full therapeutic potential and benefit for patients. Whereas cautious but crucial steps have been taken in the last years to explore these aspects, related to timing and sequence of treatment (including combination treatments), stratified medicine approaches, and treat-to-target strategies, it is now time for full-scale investment in prospective strategy trials.

A randomized clinical trial (RCT) is currently the strongest method for evaluating interventions in clinical practice. RCTs also provide the politically most powerful form of evidence. However it is not necessarily agreed what constitutes an RCT. This editorial explores what might be included within the rubric of 'randomized clinical trial' (and randomized controlled trial) by considering the reasons for using randomization and controls, and by discussing the definitions of clinical and trial. It suggests that the definition used in the Cochrane Glossary is too restricted and needs revision.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^113FjQVZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

How to approach a patient when considering pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19 — this section discusses how to approach a patient suspected to have COVID-19 and how to apply the IDSA COVID-19 treatment guidelines to specific clinical syndromes. The guideline notes that the certainty of supporting evidence is low to moderate for most recommendations and that the panel made conditional suggestions rather than strong recommendations for or against most of the agents. It further states that though substantial progress was made with COVID-19 therapies, there remain many unanswered questions in the management of COVID-19, and that despite limited evidence, to give actionable and timely guidance to frontline clinicians, it provides recommendations for use of combinations of agents, recommends some agents over others, or extrapolates to sub populations not evaluated in trials. Critical unanswered questions identified include which sub-populations or specific clinical types of patients benefit most from specific therapeutic agents, what the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 therapies are in populations immune from prior SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccination, what the efficacy and safety of treatments are in infections with specific SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-variants, and how therapeutic agents perform when compared to each other to allow a tiered approach to treating patients with COVID-19.

### Treatment of COVID-19: old tricks for new challenges [^111GRF1z]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Challenges in treating COVID-19

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which appeared in December 2019, presents a global challenge, particularly in the rapid increase of critically ill patients with pneumonia and absence of definitive treatment. To date, over 81,000 cases have been confirmed, with over 2700 deaths. The mortality appears to be around 2%; early published data indicate 25.9% with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia required ICU admission and 20.1% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome.

There is presently no vaccine or specific anti-viral drug regime used to treat critically ill patients. The management of patients mainly focuses on the provision of supportive care, e.g. oxygenation, ventilation, and fluid management. Combination treatment of low-dose systematic corticosteroids and anti-virals and atomization inhalation of interferon have been encouraged as part of critical COVID-19 management. Other reported therapeutic agents that are used for the treatment of seriously ill patients have been noted in Table 1.
