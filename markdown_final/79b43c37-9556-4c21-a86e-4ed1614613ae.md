## Question

Best antibiotic choice for upper respiratory infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the best antibiotic choice is for an upper respiratory infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "upper respiratory infection" actually encompasses and whether antibiotics are even indicated. Then, I should verify the likely etiology and whether it is viral or bacterial. Next, I will check guideline-based diagnostic criteria for the small subset of URTIs that warrant antibiotics, such as streptococcal pharyngitis and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. After that, I will review first-line antibiotic choices and durations for those specific bacterial entities, consider alternatives for penicillin allergy, and finally address stewardship principles and when to avoid antibiotics altogether, including the role of delayed prescribing and biomarkers like procalcitonin.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we are not conflating diagnoses. "Upper respiratory infection" in primary care typically includes the common cold, acute rhinosinusitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, and sometimes otitis media; critically, most of these presentations are viral and do not require antibiotics, so I should not jump to conclusions about prescribing before establishing a bacterial indication [^114BJQK4] [^112JZzgX].

> Wait, let me verify the etiologic split before discussing drugs. The vast majority of URTIs are viral, and antibiotics do not improve outcomes for the common cold, influenza, COVID-19, or laryngitis; in fact, they increase adverse effects without benefit, so routine antibiotics are inappropriate in these scenarios [^114BJQK4] [^112ykxLB] [^116Coi1i].

> Hold on, I should verify the specific bacterial indications where antibiotics are appropriate. I will now examine the two most common bacterial URTI entities: group A streptococcal pharyngitis and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. For streptococcal pharyngitis, diagnosis should be confirmed with rapid antigen testing or culture and antibiotics reserved for confirmed cases; for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, strict clinical criteria should be met, such as persistent symptoms for at least 10 days without improvement, severe onset with fever and purulent discharge for 3–4 days, or "double-worsening" after initial improvement, before antibiotics are considered [^111pTD8o] [^113CWCdx].

> Let me think about first-line therapy for confirmed streptococcal pharyngitis. Penicillin V remains the preferred agent due to narrow spectrum, proven efficacy, and low cost; amoxicillin is an acceptable alternative, particularly in children due to palatability, and both are supported by guidelines and stewardship principles favoring narrow-spectrum therapy when indicated [^notfound].

> Next, I should review acute bacterial rhinosinusitis treatment. For most adults who meet diagnostic criteria and are not severely ill, amoxicillin is first-line. If there are risk factors for resistance, severe infection, recent antibiotics, or immunocompromise, amoxicillin–clavulanate is preferred, and the recommended duration is 5–7 days, with reassessment if there is no improvement in 3–5 days and potential antibiotic modification if failure is confirmed [^116tfRog] [^1164iXc9].

> I need to ensure I address penicillin allergy appropriately. For patients with a true immediate hypersensitivity, reasonable alternatives include doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone for adults with ABRS, recognizing local resistance patterns and patient-specific risks. For streptococcal pharyngitis, options include a first-generation cephalosporin if the allergy is non-anaphylactic, or azithromycin or clindamycin in anaphylactic-type allergy, with attention to local macrolide resistance and stewardship guidance [^115YceDf].

> But wait, what if the presentation is a nonspecific URTI or acute bronchitis without bacterial features? I should double-check that antibiotics are not indicated here. For the common cold, laryngitis, and uncomplicated acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults, antibiotics should not be prescribed; when clinicians anticipate pressure for antibiotics, a delayed prescribing strategy can reduce unnecessary use, though I must balance this with observational data suggesting a small increase in infection-related complications with delayed therapy, underscoring the need to target delayed prescribing to lower-risk patients and communicate clearly about red flags and return precautions [^114BJQK4] [^1113PHUr] [^1121CL7t].

> Let me reconsider the overarching principle so I don't overgeneralize. The best "antibiotic choice" for most upper respiratory infections is no antibiotic at all, because the benefit is negligible and harms, including adverse effects and resistance, are real; stewardship data show high rates of inappropriate prescribing for viral URTIs and excessive durations, and correcting these patterns reduces harm and costs without sacrificing outcomes [^114BJQK4] [^116UQvDn] [^116HBEpY].

> I should confirm supportive strategies that actually help patients. Symptomatic care with analgesics, antipyretics, hydration, saline nasal irrigation, and, when appropriate, intranasal corticosteroids for rhinosinusitis can improve comfort while avoiding unnecessary antibiotics; patient education materials and communication tools reduce demand for antibiotics and improve satisfaction when antibiotics are not prescribed [^114RCeCn] [^115RkJYR].

> Next, I should review whether biomarkers can refine decisions. Procalcitonin-guided algorithms can safely reduce antibiotic initiation and duration in acute respiratory infections, including some upper and lower tract presentations, though access and local protocols vary; this can be a useful adjunct when diagnostic uncertainty is high and stewardship resources are available [^113ccWbX] [^111FjFmk].

> In summary, I need to ensure my recommendation is precise: there is no single "best antibiotic" for upper respiratory infection in general, because most URTIs are viral and should not receive antibiotics. When antibiotics are indicated for confirmed streptococcal pharyngitis or for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis meeting strict criteria, choose narrow-spectrum agents such as penicillin V or amoxicillin, use amoxicillin–clavulanate when risk factors for resistance or severity are present, keep durations short (about 5–7 days for ABRS), and tailor to penicillin allergy while applying rigorous stewardship and follow-up to confirm benefit and avoid overtreatment [^111pTD8o] [^116tfRog] [^114BJQK4].

---

The best antibiotic for upper respiratory infections is **no antibiotic** for most cases, as most URIs are viral and antibiotics are ineffective [^114CZS4Q] [^112ykxLB]. Antibiotics are only indicated for confirmed bacterial infections such as streptococcal pharyngitis or acute bacterial rhinosinusitis [^111pTD8o] [^113CWCdx]. When antibiotics are indicated, use **narrow-spectrum agents** (amoxicillin or penicillin V) [^116tfRog] to minimize resistance and adverse effects [^112iN1Xj]. Avoid broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluoroquinolones unless there is a specific indication [^112iN1Xj]. Use delayed prescribing or watchful waiting when appropriate to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use [^1113PHUr] [^114dExCM].

---

## Indications for antibiotic use in URIs

Antibiotics are **not recommended for most URIs** because they are typically viral and self-limited [^114CZS4Q]. However, antibiotics are indicated for specific bacterial infections:

- **Streptococcal pharyngitis**: Confirmed by rapid antigen testing or culture [^111pTD8o].
- **Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS)**: Persistent symptoms ≥ 10 days, severe symptoms ≥ 3 days, or worsening symptoms after initial improvement ("double sickening") [^111pTD8o].
- **Acute otitis media (AOM)**: Especially in children ≥ 2 years with severe symptoms or bilateral disease [^notfound].

---

## Recommended antibiotics for specific bacterial URIs

When antibiotics are indicated, **narrow-spectrum agents** are preferred:

| **Infection** | **First-line antibiotic** | **Alternative antibiotics** |
|-|-|-|
| Streptococcal pharyngitis | Penicillin V or amoxicillin | - Cephalexin <br/> - Azithromycin (if penicillin-allergic) [^notfound] |
| Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis | Amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate | - Doxycycline <br/> - Levofloxacin (if severe penicillin allergy) [^115YceDf] |
| Acute otitis media | Amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate | - Cefdinir <br/> - Azithromycin (if penicillin-allergic) [^115YceDf] |

---

## Antibiotics to avoid

Certain antibiotics should be **avoided** due to resistance, adverse effects, or lack of efficacy:

- **Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin)**: Reserve for severe infections due to resistance and adverse effects [^notfound].
- **Macrolides (e.g. azithromycin)**: High resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae; use only if penicillin-allergic [^115YceDf].
- **Broad-spectrum antibiotics**: Avoid routine use to prevent resistance and adverse effects [^112iN1Xj].

---

## Role of delayed prescribing and watchful waiting

Delayed prescribing and watchful waiting are effective strategies to **reduce unnecessary antibiotic use** without compromising patient outcomes [^1113PHUr]. Delayed prescribing reduces antibiotic use and maintains patient satisfaction [^1148ooYV].

---

## Clinical outcomes and risks associated with antibiotic use

Antibiotic use in URIs carries risks, including:

- **Adverse effects**: Gastrointestinal upset, allergic reactions, and rare severe reactions [^116UQvDn].
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Contributes to community resistance [^111dibF2].
- **Increased healthcare costs**: Unnecessary prescriptions increase expenditures [^116UQvDn].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing antibiotic choice

Patient-specific factors should guide **antibiotic selection**:

- **Allergies**: Penicillin allergy necessitates alternative agents [^116tfRog].
- **Age**: Pediatric dosing and safety considerations differ from adults [^notfound].
- **Comorbidities**: Chronic lung disease or immunocompromise may require different agents [^114RCeCn].
- **Severity of illness**: Severe infections may require broader-spectrum agents initially [^117Dmz7Y].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **judicious antibiotic use**:

- **IDSA**: Avoid antibiotics for viral URIs; use narrow-spectrum agents when indicated [^114CZS4Q].
- **AAFP**: Amoxicillin or penicillin V first-line for bacterial URIs; avoid fluoroquinolones [^notfound].
- **CDC**: Promote antibiotic stewardship and appropriate prescribing [^111pTD8o].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The best antibiotic for URIs is **no antibiotic** for most cases, as most URIs are viral [^114CZS4Q]. When antibiotics are indicated, use narrow-spectrum agents such as amoxicillin or penicillin V [^116JknDp]. Avoid broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluoroquinolones unless specifically indicated [^113upS4N]. Use delayed prescribing or watchful waiting to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and resistance [^1148ooYV].

### 'In Texas, everybody wants antibiotics': reducing inappropriate antibiotic expectations and use with a provider-patient communication tool in primary care [^112SJPgJ]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Through patient and provider stakeholder input, we identified key features of a communication tool on appropriate antibiotic use. Clear, simple messaging is essential, particularly to address misconceptions that antibiotics can treat colds, allergies and pain and that use of antibiotics without consulting a medical professional is safe. Stakeholders also believed that the tool was best used in the clinic encounter to optimise patient engagement. The tool was found to be useful in supporting patient–provider communication around antibiotic use and helpful when managing patient antibiotic expectations, especially when a provider did not believe an antibiotic was indicated.

Several studies have evaluated the effectiveness of patient education tools on antibiotic prescribing. A pre–post survey in hospital inpatients showed posters highlighting the futility of antibiotic treatment for colds, harms associated with antibiotic usage and awareness of AMR decreased patient expectation to receive antibiotics. In a mixed-methods study, primary care providers found a viral illness prescription pad (which directed patients to OTC remedies) to be a useful tool to facilitate patient education about antibiotic usage in upper respiratory tract infections. A quasi-experimental study found the rates of antibiotic prescribing significantly decreased after implementation of an intervention combining patient and provider education on antibiotic use in respiratory tract infections. Within the paediatric populations, a Cochrane review found that providing written information about antibiotics for acute upper respiratory tract infections significantly reduced the number of antibiotics used by patients.

### Guidelines for the use of antibiotics in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^117W6Ztp]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

To help physicians with the appropriate use of antibiotics in children and adults with upper respiratory tract infection, a multidisciplinary team evaluated existing guidelines and summarized key practice points. Acute otitis media in children should be diagnosed only if there is abrupt onset, signs of middle ear effusion, and symptoms of inflammation. A period of observation without immediate use of antibiotics is an option for certain children. In patients with sinus infection, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be diagnosed and treated with antibiotics only if symptoms have not improved after 10 days or have worsened after five to seven days. In patients with sore throat, a diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis generally requires confirmation with rapid antigen testing, although other guidelines allow for empiric therapy if a validated clinical rule suggests a high likelihood of infection. Acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults should not be treated with antibiotics; delayed prescriptions may help ease patient fears and simultaneously reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics.

### The safety of delayed versus immediate antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections [^113pnTnJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

An important consideration is the balancing of any increased risk of infection-related complication with reductions in antibiotic use. The Cochrane review of trials that randomized patients with respiratory infections reported a substantive reduction in antibiotic use with delayed compared with immediate prescribing (odds ratio of 0.04 with delayed compared with immediate prescribing). However, trials in the Cochrane review may have enrolled patients who would not have received antibiotics outside the trial. In the 3 larger trials that evaluated delayed antibiotic prescribing, one enrolled patients only if there was reasonable clinical doubt as to whether to treat with an antibiotic, the second if patients were not very ill, and the third if immediate antibiotics were not needed. Further evidence may be needed to assess the extent of reduction in antibiotic usage with a delayed prescribing strategy.

This study has several strengths and limitations. The main strengths were that this study was population based from representative general practices from England and Wales and that it included a large number of patients with replication of findings in 2 independent databases. One major limitation was that patients had not been randomized to the different antibiotic strategies. The observed increase in the risk of clinical outcomes with delayed antibiotic prescribing could be related to either more severe infection or to underlying differences in patient characteristics. More severe infections in patients with delayed antibiotic prescribing would be a causal explanation of our findings (ie, delaying treatment may lead to more severe infections in some patients, increasing the risk of hospital admission). On the other hand, differences in patient characteristics (ie, subgroups of patients at higher risks of hospital admission with a similar infection severity) could have biased and confounded the study results. However, the risk factors as measured in this study did not indicate higher underlying risks of hospital admission in patients with delayed antibiotic prescribing. Important predictors for hospital admissions (such as age, comorbidity score, and mean predicted risk of infection-related hospital admission of 0.16% in both groups) were either comparable or lower in delayed compared with immediate antibiotic-prescribing groups. Another limitation was that this study evaluated actual delays in antibiotic prescribing irrespective of whether this was intended or not by the clinicians at the initial URTI diagnosis. However, the chance of patients getting an antibiotic in the United Kingdom for URTI did not change substantially from 2000 to 2015. Delayed antibiotic prescribing was first proposed in treatment guidelines in 2008 and there may been misclassification in 2008 onwards (with antibiotic prescriptions recorded on the date of the URTI consultation but with the advice to delay intake). However, the HRs did not change over time and no effect of such misclassification was observed. A further limitation was that the incidence rates of the clinical outcomes were different between SAIL and CPRD, with higher rates in Wales. It may not be unexpected that the incidence of infections and complications varies between regions (the largest differences were found among young children aged < 5 years). In recent years, there has been a measles epidemic in Wales; measles can lead to hospital admissions and this may possibly partly explain these differences. The relative differences with delayed antibiotic prescribing were mostly consistent between SAIL and CPRD. Finally, no external validation of the risk prediction model was conducted, as the objective of this analysis was to describe the distribution of risks in the study population (rather than to use it for risk prediction in different populations). The model performance indicated that the model was properly fitted to the data. Another limitation was that there was no information on actual compliance and antibiotic intake by patients. Patients with URTI were also not routinely tested for viral or bacterial infections as point-of-care testing has only been introduced to a limited extent in recent years.

### Antibiotics for COPD exacerbations: does drug or duration matter? A primary care database analysis [^116MfTZj]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are globally the most common infectious cause of morbidity. Despite this prevalence, observed duration of antibiotic treatment for LRTI varies greatly, and there is disagreement between guidelines on the optimal duration. Effective first-line treatment for non-pneumonic LRTI in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients ('infective exacerbations') is an area of particular uncertainty.

COPD is a common cause of disability, and estimated to become the third leading cause of death worldwide in 2030. Exacerbations form a large part of the disease burden and can lead to a cough with discoloured phlegm irrespective of causation. Over £250 million is spent on treating COPD exacerbations annually in the UK, and recurrent exacerbations are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

Up to half of all COPD exacerbations are thought to be caused by bacteria, the remainder by viruses or environmental irritants. The most common pathogens are Haemophilus influenza e, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Initial studies suggested that the administration of antibiotics was associated with a lower risk of symptom persistence. However, a Cochrane review concluded that a statistically significant improvement in treatment failure rate was only seen in severe exacerbations, with more adverse events in the antibiotic group. Hence, the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society and international guidelines advise, based on moderate evidence, the prescription of antibiotics for ambulatory patients 'if clinically indicated'. However, our understanding of the success of real-life prescribing practices is limited.

### Parents' self-directed practices towards the use of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections in makkah, Saudi Arabia [^114eThVr]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Majority of the parents in the study expected antibiotics from their prescribers for the primary treatment of URTIs in their children. These findings suggest the need to educate parents about the effective and safe use of antibiotics in their children.

The percentage of parents demanding such inappropriate prescription for antibiotics reported in this study is almost twice the percentage of parents who had similar expectations for antibiotics in a previous study. There is a common misconception that a specific treatment is available for every ailment, and antibiotics, in particular, are considered as miracle drugs that can cure everything from headaches to gastrointestinal diseases. In two previous studies, such misconceptions held by parents about the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating viral URTIs have been attributed to inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics by physicians. In another study, 58% of the prescribers believed that their decision to prescribe antibiotics for a viral URTI such as common cold was influenced by parental pressure. Parents' lack of knowledge and awareness about the appropriate use of antibiotics, and the success they perceive about the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of previous episodes of URTIs that were often self-limiting may explain the increase in the demand for antibiotics. The incorrect perception of the general public about the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating viral URTIs has also been reported in a Dutch study where almost half of the participants wrongly recognised antibiotics to be useful in the treatment of viral infections.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^116tfRog]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in most adults — initial antibiotic and duration: If a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first-line therapy for 5–7 days for most adults. This is a Recommendation based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneity and noninferiority design, with Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A and Level of Confidence in Evidence: Moderate. Benefits-harms assessment indicates a preponderance of benefit over harm, while risks include potential increased gastrointestinal adverse effects with amoxicillin-clavulanate and adverse effects from penicillin allergy. Exceptions include patients with penicillin allergy for whom amoxicillin is contraindicated. Intentional vagueness states that whether to prescribe amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate is at the clinician's discretion and that "most" adults are recommended 5 days of therapy, although a longer course may be appropriate for more severe illness or persistent symptoms beyond the initial 5 days. Role of patient preferences is moderate for shared decision making and large for determining duration since adverse events are reduced with shorter duration of therapy.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections in adults: background [^112JZzgX]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease. 1. The diagnosis of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection or acute rhinopharyngitis should be used to denote an acute infection that is typically viral in origin and in which sinus, pharyngeal, and lower airway symptoms, although frequently present, are not prominent. 2. Antibiotic treatment of adults with nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection does not enhance illness resolution and is not recommended. Studies specifically testing the impact of antibiotic treatment on complications of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections have not been performed in adults. Life-threatening complications of upper respiratory tract infection are rare. 3. Purulent secretions from the nares or throat (commonly observed in patients with uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection) predict neither bacterial infection nor benefit from antibiotic treatment.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^115uZWzM]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the duration of prescriptions for antibiotic treatment for common infections in English primary care and to compare this with guideline recommendations.

Design

Cross sectional study.

Setting

General practices contributing to The Health Improvement Network database, 2013–15.

Participants

931015 consultations that resulted in an antibiotic prescription for one of several indications: acute sinusitis, acute sore throat, acute cough and bronchitis, pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute otitis media, acute cystitis, acute prostatitis, pyelonephritis, cellulitis, impetigo, scarlet fever, and gastroenteritis.

Main Outcome Measures

The main outcomes were the percentage of antibiotic prescriptions with a duration exceeding the guideline recommendation and the total number of days beyond the recommended duration for each indication.

Results

The most common reasons for antibiotics being prescribed were acute cough and bronchitis (386972, 41.6% of the included consultations), acute sore throat (239231, 25.7%), acute otitis media (83054, 8.9%), and acute sinusitis (76683, 8.2%). Antibiotic treatments for upper respiratory tract indications and acute cough and bronchitis accounted for more than two thirds of the total prescriptions considered, and 80% or more of these treatment courses exceeded guideline recommendations. Notable exceptions were acute sinusitis, where only 9.6% (95% confidence interval 9.4% to 9.9%) of prescriptions exceeded seven days and acute sore throat where only 2.1% (2.0% to 2.1%) exceeded 10 days (recent guidance recommends five days). More than half of the antibiotic prescriptions were for longer than guidelines recommend for acute cystitis among females (54.6%, 54.1% to 55.0%). The percentage of antibiotic prescriptions exceeding the recommended duration was lower for most non-respiratory infections. For the 931015 included consultations resulting in antibiotic prescriptions, about 1.3 million days were beyond the durations recommended by guidelines.

Conclusion

For most common infections treated in primary care, a substantial proportion of antibiotic prescriptions have durations exceeding those recommended in guidelines. Substantial reductions in antibiotic exposure can be accomplished by aligning antibiotic prescription durations with guidelines.

### Changes in clinical indications for community antibiotic prescribing for children in the UK from 1996 to 2006: will the new NICE prescribing guidance on upper respiratory tract infections just be ignored? [^112tJKZP]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyse changes in clinical indications for community antibiotic prescribing for children in the UK between 1996 and 2006 and relate these findings to the new NICE guidelines for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections in children.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Method

The IMS Health Mediplus database was used to obtain annual antibiotic prescribing rates and associated clinical indications in 0–18-year-old patients between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 2006 in the UK.

Results

Antibiotic prescribing declined by 24% between 1996 and 2000 but increased again by 10% during 2003–2006. Respiratory tract infection was the most common indication for which an antibiotic was prescribed, followed by "abnormal signs and symptoms", ear and skin infections. Antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory tract infections have decreased by 31% (p < 0.01) mainly because of reduced prescribing for lower respiratory tract infections (56% decline, p < 0.001) and specific upper respiratory tract infections including tonsillitis/pharyngitis (48% decline, p < 0.001) and otitis (46% decline, p < 0.001). Prescribing for non-specific upper respiratory tract infection increased fourfold (p < 0.001). Prescribing for "abnormal signs and symptoms" increased significantly since 2001 (40% increase, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

There has been a marked decrease in community antibiotic prescribing linked to lower respiratory tract infection, tonsillitis, pharyngitis and otitis. Overall prescribing is now increasing again but is associated with non-specific upper respiratory tract infection diagnoses. General practitioners may be avoiding using diagnoses where formal guidance suggests antibiotic prescribing is not indicated. The new NICE guidance on upper respiratory tract infections is at risk of being ignored.

### Diagnosis and management of respiratory tract infections for the primary care physician [^114WLXSZ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Respiratory tract infections cause nearly half of deaths owing to infectious disease in the United States. This article has discussed the management of several common respiratory tract infections, with an emphasis on appropriate diagnosis and use of antimicrobial agents. Understanding the cause of various respiratory tract infections enables primary care physicians to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use, decreasing adverse effects owing to medications and preventing the rise in antimicrobial resistance.

### Acute sinusitis in children [^11681APj]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is a common illness in children. Viral upper respiratory tract infection is the most common presentation of rhinosinusitis. Most children resolve the infection spontaneously and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. The proper choice of antibiotic therapy depends on the likely infecting pathogens, bacterial antibiotic resistance, and pharmacologic profiles of antibiotics. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is currently recommended as the empiric treatment in those requiring antimicrobial therapy. Isolation of the causative agents should be considered in those who failed the initial treatment. In addition to antibiotics, adjuvant therapies and surgery may be used in the management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

### The safety of delayed versus immediate antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections [^112ibS17]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, waiting to treat URTI was associated with increased risk of infection-related complications. There was considerable variation in the risks of infection-related hospital admission, although the probability of delayed antibiotic prescribing was unrelated to these. There is an important need to better target delayed antibiotic prescribing to patients with URTI with moderate risks of complications and immediate antibiotic prescribing to those with higher risks. Further research on the cost-effectiveness of the most optimal threshold is needed to establish the treatment thresholds.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^114jnQuu]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The judicious use of antibiotics preserves millions of lives and safeguards numerous individuals from infectious complications annually. However, their continued viability is threatened by rising rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which was responsible for an estimated 1.27 million deaths worldwide in 2019. Excessive and inappropriate antimicrobial use significantly contributes to this crisis. Research indicates a strong correlation between the consumption of antibiotics and the selection of resistant bacteria, both at societal and individual levels.

Primary care is responsible for about 80% of antibiotic prescriptions, and respiratory tract infections (RTIs) account for more than half of all antibiotic prescriptions globally. Given the limited development of new antibiotics, prudent antimicrobial utilisation, particularly in primary care, is crucial to mitigating the spread of AMR. Inappropriate use of antibiotics for uncomplicated RTIs is very common worldwide. In the UK around 50% of all general practice consultations for RTIs result in the prescription of an antibiotic, with a high variability across practices ranging from 20% to 80%. In a study comparing the rate of antibiotic prescribing for acute RTIs in Australian general practice from 2010 to 2015, it was found that antibiotics were prescribed at rates 4–9 times higher than those recommended by Australia's most widely used therapeutic guidelines. Even in the Netherlands, which has the lowest antibiotic use in Europe with slightly under ten defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day, it is estimated that nearly half of RTI prescriptions are not in accordance with local guidelines. In the UK, more than half of the patients with acute rhinosinusitis, acute bronchitis and sore throat seen in primary care are treated with antibiotics. In addition, in many regions around the world, antibiotics are accessible without prescriptions, as shown in a recent study of 38 studies across 24 countries, revealing 62% of non-prescription antibiotic dispensing, mostly for suspected RTIs. Despite being more prevalent in low-income countries, even in some high- and middle-income countries, non-prescription antibiotic provision is a concern. Most acute uncomplicated RTIs are caused by viruses and, in otherwise healthy adults, these infections are typically self-limiting and antibiotics provide no relevant benefits.

### Antibiotic use in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^1138EQug]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Upper respiratory tract infections account for millions of visits to family physicians each year in the United States. Although warranted in some cases, antibiotics are greatly overused. This article outlines the guidelines and indications for appropriate antibiotic use for common upper respiratory infections. Early antibiotic treatment may be indicated in patients with acute otitis media, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, epiglottitis, or bronchitis caused by pertussis. Persistent cases of rhinosinusitis may necessitate the use of antibiotics if symptoms persist beyond a period of observation. Antibiotics should not be considered in patients with the common cold or laryngitis. Judicious, evidence-based use of antibiotics will help contain costs and prevent adverse effects and drug resistance.

### Parents' self-directed practices towards the use of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections in makkah, Saudi Arabia [^115qjzHM]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are common in children, and most of these are viral in origin and are often self-limiting. Despite their viral origin, it is common practice to manage these infections with antibiotics. A prospective study conducted in 13 countries suggested that even URTIs with bacterial origin can be resolved without administering antibiotics. Antibiotics have limited efficacy in treating URTIs in both children as well as adults. Inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics is a common practice in children and is one of the major contributors to the emerging risk of antibiotic resistance worldwide.

Recently a study by Zhang et al. reported antibiotics use at health facilities at country, township and village level in China. They concluded the highest level of antibiotics uses among children complaining URIs, especially when visiting county hospitals. Similarly, in a nationwide study by Yoshida et al. in Japan recently found that 66.4% of the preschool children attending outpatient clinics for URIs were received antibiotics and interestingly most commonly prescribed antibiotics were third-generation cephalosporin (38.3%) followed by macrolides (25.8%) and penicillin (16.0%) respectively.

It was described in a multicenter study conducted in eight countries that repeated antibiotic exposure was common early in life and antibiotics used for respiratory illnesses was not according to international guidelines. Among the study cohort, 39.5% of the antibiotics use was for upper respiratory tract infections. Interestingly, the highest antibiotics use was reported in South Asian countries.

Other factors that may contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance in children include both the attitude and practices of pediatricians as well as parents. Pediatricians often prescribe antibiotics because of parental pressure and expectation. When parents panic due to acute illnesses in their children, they visit their pediatricians with an expectation of getting a prescription for antibiotics, which leads to unnecessary antibiotic use.

Parents perception towards antibiotics use is an essential factor while requesting antibiotics for their children. It has been proved by many findings that the majority of the parents believed that antibiotics are helpful to treat common cold among children and recover such symptoms promptly. This factor is more prominent in parents with poor knowledge level and lower educational level. In a recent systematic review regarding parenteral knowledge about antibiotics for URTIs, it is concluded that parent's knowledge is the key factor while using antibiotics to cure their child. However, parents can be satisfied if the appropriate clarification and therapeutics plan is provided by the physicians.

### Optimal pediatric outpatient antibiotic prescribing [^114VgHvs]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Overall Optimal Antibiotic Prescribing and Antibiotic Choice by Indication

Among the 506 633 antibiotics prescribed, 194 906 (38.5%) were optimal for antibiotic choice, 259 786 (51.3%) were optimal for duration of therapy, and 159 050 (31.4%) were optimal for both antibiotic choice and duration. After exclusion of 197 534 (39.0%) antibiotics prescribed for tier 3 diagnoses only (Figure 1), the 309 099 antibiotics remaining were prescribed for tiers 1 and 2 diagnoses; among these medications, 159 050 (51.5%) were optimal for both antibiotic choice and duration. The most common tier 3 diagnosis for which an antibiotic was prescribed was an unspecified acute upper respiratory infection with over 20 000 prescriptions (eTable 2 in Supplement 1).

When evaluating antibiotic choice by indication, antibiotics prescribed for SSTIs were most frequently optimal (17 039 of 18 291 [93.2%]) encounters (Figure 2 B). The diagnosis with the lowest percentage of optimal antibiotic choice was otitis externa (179 of 1698 encounters [10.5%]), followed by gastroenteritis (453 of 1864 encounters [24.3%]) and acute sinusitis (17 686 of 32 307 encounters [54.7%]) (Figure 2 B). Cefdinir was the antibiotic most often prescribed as a suboptimal choice, with 48 523 prescriptions among the 3 most common diagnoses of AOM, pharyngitis, and sinusitis (eFigure 3 in Supplement 1). Acute otitis media received an optimal antibiotic choice in 85 635 of 127 312 (67.3%) clinical encounters, and pharyngitis received an optimal antibiotic choice in 42 969 of 76 865 (55.9%) clinical encounters.

### Appropriate use of antibiotics for respiratory infections: review of recent statements and position papers [^114Zrbnc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Respiratory infections are among the most common reasons for prescribing antibiotics. The excessive use of antibiotics in ambulatory practice has contributed to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. The appropriate use of antimicrobial agents for respiratory infections could potentially reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance. This article reviews recent guidelines and position papers on the appropriate antibiotic treatment for respiratory infections. There is a wide consensus that antibiotics are not appropriate for the treatment of most cases of acute bronchitis, pharyngitis, and rhinosinusitis. The recently published community-acquired pneumonia guidelines emphasized the importance of selecting antibiotic regimens active against both typical and atypical pathogens. However, there is disagreement regarding the routine use of the new quinolones.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections: an overview of cochrane reviews [^115aJeY8]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this paper is to review the four Cochrane reviews of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections.

Methods

Each Cochrane review was read and summarized, and results presented as odds ratios (as in the Internet version) and, where relevant, numbers needed to treat.

Results

The reviews of antibiotics for acute otitis media have concluded that benefit is not great with a number needed to treat for a benefit (NNTB) of 15. Recent US guidelines are recommending a delay in prescriptions in children over the age of 6 months. For streptococcal tonsillitis, the Cochrane reviewers suggest that antibiotic use seems to be discretionary rather than prohibited or mandatory. This is because the benefit in terms of symptoms is only about 16h (NNTB from 2 to 7 at day 3 for pain) compared with placebo, and that serious complications, such as rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis, are now rare in developed countries. The reviewers do, however, suggest that antibiotics are considered in populations in whom these complications are more common. This is an area of debate, as the Infectious Disease Society of America (2002) recommends routine treatment. [Clin. Infect. Dis. 35 (2002) 113] There is good evidence and consensus that there is no indication for antibiotics for the common cold. The situation with acute purulent rhinitis is less clear, as new evidence suggests that antibiotics may be effective for acute purulent rhinitis (NNTB from 6 to 8). However, as most people with acute purulent rhinitis improve without antibiotics, giving antibiotics is not justified as an initial treatment. For acute maxillary sinusitis, the evidence suggests that antibiotics are effective for people with radiologically confirmed sinusitis. The reviewers suggest that clinicians should weigh up the modest benefits (NNTB from 3 to 6) against the potential for adverse effects.

Conclusion

The use of antibiotics for acute otitis media, sore throat and streptococcal tonsillitis, common cold and acute purulent rhinitis, and acute maxillary sinusitis seems to be discretionary rather than prohibited or mandatory, at least for non-severe cases.

### Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections – does treatment help? [^112SYcA1]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of respiratory tract infections (RTI's), especially in children. While severe M. pneumoniae infections are generally treated with antibiotics, the diagnosis as well as treatment of these infections should be reconsidered in the light of recent clinical findings. First, M. pneumoniae was found to be carried in the upper respiratory tract of a relatively high percentage of healthy, asymptomatic children. Clearly, this complicates the diagnosis of a suspected M. pneumoniae RTI and, thus, the decision when to initiate treatment. A complication in the treatment of these infections is that data on the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of M. pneumoniae RTI's are sparse and derived exclusively from comparative studies. A recent Cochrane review concluded that there is insufficient evidence about the efficacy of antibiotics for M. pneumoniae lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children. Due to side effects associated with the use of tetracyclines and quinolones in children, only macrolides can be used to treat M. pneumoniae infections in young patients. The general applicability of macrolides, however, is currently threatened by the worldwide increase in macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae strains. Finally, limited evidence is available that corticosteroids might have an additional benefit in the treatment of M. pneumoniae infections. In this review, the current issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of M. pneumoniae infections will be discussed.

Type of antibiotic prescribed for respiratory tract symptoms and conditions

Upper respiratory tract infections are treated with macrolides or broad-spectrum antibiotics in fewer than 10% of the cases where an antibiotic is prescribed, although there is high practice variation. For patients where an indication for an antibiotic is uncertain, there is practically no use of macrolides and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Macrolides and broad-spectrum antibiotics are prescribed for sinusitis for just under 10% of cases when there is no indication for an antibiotic. Similarly, patients with tonsillitis, bronchitis/bronchiolitis, and pneumonia are treated with first-, second- or third-choice antibiotics in around 80% of cases (Fig. 5, Supplementary Appendix 6).

Figure 5.

### Diagnosis and treatment of upper respiratory tract infections in the primary care setting [^116Gwx1k]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory tract infections such as acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), acute otitis media (AOM), and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) account for approximately 75% of antibiotic prescriptions written and are among the leading reasons for physician office visits in the United States. Resistance of the predominant pathogens in respiratory tract infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) to available antibiotics has led clinicians to reevaluate the diagnosis and management of these infections.

Objective

The purpose of this review is to provide primary care practitioners with an accessible combined resource for the management of AECB, AOM, and ABRS.

Methods

This review was based on discussions from a roundtable meeting (sponsored by an educational grant from GlaxoSmithKline) that convened clinicians versed in the management of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. In addition, primary articles were identified by a MEDLINE search and through secondary sources.

Results

To reduce the prevalence of resistance, judicious and appropriate use of antibiotics must be implemented in clinical practice. With accurate diagnosis of bacterial and nonbacterial conditions, and patient education on antibiotic use and misuse, the excessive use of antibiotics and ensuing resistance can be reduced. The incorporation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data with minimum inhibitory concentration values can provide a more comprehensive assessment of antibiotic activity in vivo. Stratification of patients with AECB according to patient characteristics and frequency of exacerbation can be used to determine which patients will benefit from antibiotic treatment and to guide clinicians in their choice of antibiotic. The Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group has issued recommendations on the management of AOM based on prior antibiotic therapy, which is a risk factor for antimicrobial resistance. The Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership guidelines for the treatment of ABRS in adults and children are based on the predicted efficacy of various antibiotics as well as patient age, severity of disease, likelihood of bacterial infection, likelihood of spontaneous resolution, and in vitro susceptibility of the predominant pathogens based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic breakpoints.

Conclusions

Guidelines for the management of AECB, AOM, and ABRS emphasize the importance of differentiating between bacterial and nonbacterial infections, choosing an antibiotic based on the likelihood of infection with resistant pathogens, and providing coverage against the predominant pathogens. The judicious use of antibiotics also has been identified as an instrumental part of controlling unnecessary antibiotic use and subsequent resistance.

Conclusion

We have found significant reductions in registrars' prescribing of antibiotics for URTI and acute bronchitis over the period 2010–2019. Prescribing for acute bronchitis, though, remains high and should be the subject of further educational interventions and antimicrobial stewardship interventions.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^115hjYQE]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Research on customising antibiotic treatment duration to meet individual patient needs is required in primary care

When evaluating a patient with an RTI, our primary objective is to determine whether antibiotic therapy is necessary. There is substantial evidence indicating that antibiotics have little to no impact on self-limiting infections or when a non-bacterial infection is suspected. If patients are taking antibiotics prescribed by another doctor, or if they started taking antibiotics on their own from leftover medications or pharmacy purchases, and the current doctor determines that the antibiotics are no longer needed, they should be stopped (Panel 2). For patients with RTIs in which antibiotic therapy is warranted, more evidence is needed to determine the optimal treatment durations. Traditional two-arm randomised clinical trials comparing fixed antibiotic durations have limitations, as they provide little insight into the minimal necessary duration for various infectionsand fail to account for the differing needs of individual patients. Based on clinical judgement made from patient history, examination, and precise diagnostic tests, doctors should be encouraged to prescribe first-line treatments at appropriate doses to optimise PK/PD properties, except when contraindicated. Unless the infection is deemed potentially serious, when managing patients with a prescribed fixed antibiotic duration, new studies should ascertain whether treatment cessation upon symptom resolution, prior to completing the antibiotic course, is feasible. In fact, one third of the patients already do that by themselves. Studies using medication event monitoring systems reveal that in real-life scenarios, only one-third of patients adhere to the prescribed antibiotic course. If the results of these studies align with expectations, patients could then be advised to discontinue medication once they feel better and are afebrile.

### Evaluating guideline-recommended antibiotic practices for childhood respiratory infections: is It time to consider case-based formats? [^111GoMqs]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to better understand barriers to adherence to published guidelines for respiratory infections among community providers.

Methods

A case-based survey was developed and emailed to all members of the state pediatric society. Providers chose their preferred management for acute otitis media, acute bacterial sinusitis, and community-acquired pneumonia. An "answer key" and a follow-up questionnaire were distributed to assess reevaluation of current practices.

Results

We received 173 completed surveys (15% response rate). While most responders followed guideline recommendations (6 of the 10 questions with ≥ 65% choosing recommended antibiotic), discrepancies existed in several cases. After receiving the answer key, respondents said they reviewed the guidelines (69%), adjusted their practice (26%), used cases for teaching (9%), and discussed guidelines with colleagues (21%).

Conclusions

The majority of respondents followed published guidelines, but there was a tendency to overuse azithromycin in certain cases. Future guidelines including case-based discussions may enhance adherence.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^116SHFBX]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To evaluate the duration of prescriptions for antibiotic treatment for common infections in English primary care and to compare this with guideline recommendations.

Design

Cross sectional study.

Setting

General practices contributing to The Health Improvement Network database, 2013–15.

Participants

931 015 consultations that resulted in an antibiotic prescription for one of several indications: acute sinusitis, acute sore throat, acute cough and bronchitis, pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute otitis media, acute cystitis, acute prostatitis, pyelonephritis, cellulitis, impetigo, scarlet fever, and gastroenteritis.

Main outcome measures

The main outcomes were the percentage of antibiotic prescriptions with a duration exceeding the guideline recommendation and the total number of days beyond the recommended duration for each indication.

Results

The most common reasons for antibiotics being prescribed were acute cough and bronchitis (386 972, 41.6% of the included consultations), acute sore throat (239 231, 25.7%), acute otitis media (83 054, 8.9%), and acute sinusitis (76 683, 8.2%). Antibiotic treatments for upper respiratory tract indications and acute cough and bronchitis accounted for more than two thirds of the total prescriptions considered, and 80% or more of these treatment courses exceeded guideline recommendations. Notable exceptions were acute sinusitis, where only 9.6% (95% confidence interval 9.4% to 9.9%) of prescriptions exceeded seven days and acute sore throat where only 2.1% (2.0% to 2.1%) exceeded 10 days (recent guidance recommends five days). More than half of the antibiotic prescriptions were for longer than guidelines recommend for acute cystitis among females (54.6%, 54.1% to 55.0%). The percentage of antibiotic prescriptions exceeding the recommended duration was lower for most non-respiratory infections. For the 931 015 included consultations resulting in antibiotic prescriptions, about 1.3 million days were beyond the durations recommended by guidelines.

Conclusion

For most common infections treated in primary care, a substantial proportion of antibiotic prescriptions have durations exceeding those recommended in guidelines. Substantial reductions in antibiotic exposure can be accomplished by aligning antibiotic prescription durations with guidelines.

### Estimates of the global, regional, and national morbidity, mortality, and aetiologies of lower respiratory infections in 195 countries, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^112hYTXR]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of findings

Substantial progress has been made to reduce the global burden of lower respiratory infections. However, this reduction has not been equal across locations, has been driven by decreases in several primary risk factors, and the burden in elderly adults could be growing and requires attention.

Our results suggest that the case fatality ratio among children younger than 5 years decreases rapidly with increasing sociodemographic development. There are several possible explanations for this observation, including improved access to health care, decreased exposure to disease risk, improved nutrition, and possibly improved case management. A key goal of the GAPPD was universal access to appropriate lower respiratory infection case management. More than 50% of lower respiratory infection deaths in 2016 were attributable to bacterial aetiologies. We found that antibiotic use has increased in most locations and contributed to a 1·94% decrease in under-5 lower respiratory infection mortality. Since the global number needed to treat is relatively small (3200), increased access to appropriate antibiotics could be an efficient intervention in many countries. We estimate that increased antibiotic availability could still prevent 30·2% (95% UI 14·4–43·8) of lower respiratory infection deaths. However, appropriate antibiotic use remains challenging — in large part because of the absence of reliable clinical signs and symptoms that can accurately predict bacterial pneumonia, — and universal use of antibiotics for lower respiratory infections could lead to antimicrobial resistance. Although interventions to expand judicious antibiotic use and improve diagnostic accuracy might help to mitigate this risk, these efforts must be accompanied by interventions to prevent cases of lower respiratory infection.

Pneumococcal pneumonia is by far the leading aetiology responsible for lower respiratory infection incidence and mortality in children and adults. There is increasing evidence that S pneumoniae might be a co-infection or a follow-up infection to viral infections. However, given our counterfactual approach to aetiological attribution, it is possible to interpret our results as the expected reduction in lower respiratory infection burden in the total absence of an aetiology. Because our approach treats aetiological attribution independently, it is difficult to assess co-infections. The vaccine probe approach to aetiological attribution might miss indirect effects of the vaccine in protecting non-vaccinated people, a phenomenon that has been observed for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Despite this limitation, we observed a moderate reduction in lower respiratory infection mortality in children younger than 5 years after the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in many countries, and the results suggest that a great deal of lower respiratory infection burden could be avertable if pneumococcal conjugate vaccine coverage was universal.

### Effects of knowledge, attitudes, and practices of primary care providers on antibiotic selection, United States [^113upS4N]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Antibiotic prescribing guidelines establish standards of care, help focus efforts on quality improvement, and have been shown to improve patient outcomes. Many guidelines emphasize the importance of diagnostic certainty for the management of bacterial upper respiratory tract infections and promote β-lactam agents, such as amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate, as the preferred first-line therapy. Studies indicate that health care providers often do not adhere to established clinical practice guidelines for the management of common infections. Prescribing rates for second-line, broad-spectrum antibiotics among outpatients have increased, contributing to a growing problem of antibiotic-resistant infections. It is not clear whether nonadherence is related to lack of familiarity with clinical practice guidelines or if other factors influence antibiotic selection once a diagnosis is established.

Published qualitative studies that have examined antibiotic selection among primary care providers (PCPs) are outdated and focus on non-US–based physicians; they do not include nurse practitioners or physician assistants, who together comprise > 25% of the US primary care workforce. The objectives of this study are to explore US PCP knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported practices (KAPs) concerning antibiotic therapy, assess factors that influence provider antibiotic choice, and provide an update on PCP attitudes regarding antibiotic resistance.

### Clinical practice guideline: management of sinusitis [^114rNTrA]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline formulates recommendations for health care providers regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of children, ages 1 to 21 years, with uncomplicated acute, subacute, and recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommendations where data were insufficient. A subcommittee, composed of pediatricians with expertise in infectious disease, allergy, epidemiology, family practice, and pediatric practice, supplemented with an otolaryngologist and radiologist, were selected to formulate the practice parameter. Several other groups (including members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, as well as numerous national committees and sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics) have reviewed and revised the guideline. Three specific issues were considered: 1) evidence for the efficacy of various antibiotics in children; 2) evidence for the efficacy of various ancillary, nonantibiotic regimens; and 3) the diagnostic accuracy and concordance of clinical symptoms, radiography (and other imaging methods), and sinus aspiration. It is recommended that the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis be based on clinical criteria in children ≤ 6 years of age who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are either persistent or severe. Although controversial, imaging studies may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis in children > 6 years of age. Computed tomography scans of the paranasal sinuses should be reserved for children who present with complications of acute bacterial sinusitis or who have very persistent or recurrent infections and are not responsive to medical management. There were only 5 controlled randomized trials and 8 case series on antimicrobial therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis in children. However, these data, plus data derived from the study of adults with acute bacterial sinusitis, support the recommendation that acute bacterial sinusitis be treated with antimicrobial therapy to achieve a more rapid clinical cure. Children with complications or suspected complications of acute bacterial sinusitis should be treated promptly and aggressively with antibiotics and, when appropriate, drainage. Based on controversial and limited data, no recommendations are made about the use of prophylactic antimicrobials, ancillary therapies, or complementary/alternative medicine for prevention and treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children. It is designed to assist pediatricians by providing an analytic framework for evaluation and treatment. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all patients with this condition.

### Antibiotic use in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^114BJQK4]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Upper respiratory tract infections are responsible for millions of physician visits in the United States annually. Although viruses cause most acute upper respiratory tract infections, studies show that many infections are unnecessarily treated with antibiotics. Because inappropriate antibiotic use results in adverse events, contributes to antibiotic resistance, and adds unnecessary costs, family physicians must take an evidence-based, judicious approach to the use of antibiotics in patients with upper respiratory tract infections. Antibiotics should not be used for the common cold, influenza, COVID-19, or laryngitis. Evidence supports antibiotic use in most cases of acute otitis media, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, and epiglottitis and in a limited percentage of acute rhinosinusitis cases. Several evidence-based strategies have been identified to improve the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing for acute upper respiratory tract infections.

Antimicrobial therapy for dysphonia — Statement 8: Clinicians should not routinely prescribe antibiotics to treat dysphonia, with a strong recommendation against prescribing based on systematic reviews and randomized trials showing ineffectiveness of antibiotic therapy and a preponderance of harm over benefit. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade A with systematic reviews showing no benefit for antibiotics for acute laryngitis or upper respiratory tract infection and Grade A evidence showing potential harms, and the level of confidence in evidence is high. The benefit-harm assessment indicates a preponderance of harm over benefit if antibiotics are prescribed, and exclusions include patients with dysphonia caused by bacterial, fungal, or mycobacterial infection; the word routine is used to discourage empiric therapy while acknowledging occasional circumstances where antimicrobial use may be appropriate.

### Antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^117LcnhV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute rhinosinusitis is an acute infection of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses that lasts less than four weeks. Diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms in ambulatory care settings. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor are they recommended in most countries. Some trials show a trend in favour of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear. We merged two Cochrane Reviews for this update, which comprised different approaches with overlapping populations, resulting in different conclusions. For this review update, we maintained the distinction between populations diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms, or imaging.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in adults with acute rhinosinusitis in ambulatory care settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 12), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2018), Embase (January 1974 to January 2018), and two trials registers (January 2018). We also checked references from identified trials, systematic reviews, and relevant guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in people with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms or sinusitis confirmed by imaging.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data about cure and side effects and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information as required.

Main Results

We included 15 trials involving 3057 participants. Of the 15 included trials, 10 appeared in our 2012 review, and five (631 participants) are legacy trials from merging two reviews. No new studies were included from searches for this update. Overall, risk of bias was low. Without antibiotics, 46% of participants with rhinosinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiography, were cured after 1 week and 64% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten time to cure, but only 5 to 11 more people per 100 will be cured faster if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment: clinical diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.54; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 19, 95% CI 10 to 205; I² = 0%; 8 trials; high-quality evidence) and diagnosis confirmed by radiography (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.39; NNTB 10, 95% CI 5 to 136; I² = 0%; 3 trials; moderate-quality evidence). Cure rates with antibiotics were higher when a fluid level or total opacification in any sinus was found on computed tomography (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.75 to 13.72; NNTB 4, 95% CI 2 to 15; 1 trial; moderate-quality evidence). Purulent secretion resolved faster with antibiotics (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.22; NNTB 10, 95% CI 6 to 35; I² = 0%; 3 trials; high-quality evidence). However, 13 more people experienced side effects with antibiotics compared to placebo or no treatment (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.82; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 8, 95% CI 6 to 12; I² = 16%; 10 trials; high-quality evidence). Five fewer people per 100 will experience clinical failure if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment (Peto OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.63; NNTH 19, 95% CI 15 to 27; I² = 21%; 12 trials; high-quality evidence). A disease-related complication (brain abscess) occurred in one participant (of 3057) one week after receiving open antibiotic therapy (clinical failure, control group).

Authors' Conclusions

The potential benefit of antibiotics to treat acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed either clinically (low risk of bias, high-quality evidence) or confirmed by imaging (low to unclear risk of bias, moderate-quality evidence) is marginal and needs to be seen in the context of the risk of adverse effects. Considering antibiotic resistance, and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude there is no place for antibiotics for people with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. We could not draw conclusions about children, people with suppressed immune systems, and those with severe sinusitis, because these populations were not included in the available trials.

Limitations of current vaccination strategies for upper respiratory tract infections

While vaccination is a cornerstone in preventing URTIs, several limitations hinder its comprehensive efficacy. One significant constraint is the limited induction of mucosal immunity by traditional intramuscular vaccines. These vaccines primarily stimulate systemic immune responses but may not elicit robust immunity at mucosal surfaces, such as the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa, which are primary entry points for respiratory pathogens. This limitation can result in reduced effectiveness in preventing initial infection and transmission of respiratory viruses. Additionally, the specificity of vaccines to pathogens means they may not protect against the wide array of viruses responsible for URTIs. For instance, while vaccines exist for influenza and SARS-CoV-2, there are currently no approved vaccines for common URTI-causing viruses like rhinoviruses and certain coronaviruses. This gap leaves individuals susceptible to infections from these prevalent pathogens. Furthermore, vaccine efficacy can be compromised in certain populations. Elderly individuals and those with immunocompromising conditions often exhibit diminished immune responses to vaccination, leading to lower levels of protection. This is particularly concerning given that these groups are at higher risk for severe outcomes from URTIs. These limitations underscore the need for complementary strategies to enhance protection against URTIs.

Prompt diagnosis and treatment of URTIs are vital components that have a significant impact on the evolution of diseases and overall health conditions in patients of all age groups. Receiving an immunity enhancer with an antiviral effect early has the potential to not only reduce the risk of recurrence and complications, but also help reduce antibiotic consumption. Any reasonable solution that can result in a reduction in antibiotic consumption among the population is considered favorable. To tackle this growing resistance, it is vital to use antibiotics appropriately at the necessary times, including the use of suitable dose intervals and for the relevant duration.

Therapeutic approaches targeted at improving and modulating immunity are appropriate not only for the effective treatment of persisting infections of the upper respiratory tract but also for the prevention of recurrence and upcoming complications. The use of antibiotics in an irrational manner not only leads to antibiotic resistance but may also have negative and even occasionally irreversible effects on the intestinal microbiota. Maintaining and protecting the intestinal microbiota and avoiding its alteration are crucial steps toward effective URTI treatment.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: background [^113vs9MS]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised.1. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. 2. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever.3. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases. 4. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms-especially those with unilateral facial pain-regardless of duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, should be used.

### Delayed antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory infections [^1148ooYV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Concerns exist regarding antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) owing to adverse reactions, cost, and antibacterial resistance. One proposed strategy to reduce antibiotic prescribing is to provide prescriptions, but to advise delay in antibiotic use with the expectation that symptoms will resolve first. This is an update of a Cochrane Review originally published in 2007, and updated in 2010 and 2013.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects on clinical outcomes, antibiotic use, antibiotic resistance, and patient satisfaction of advising a delayed prescription of antibiotics in respiratory tract infections.

Search Methods

For this 2017 update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2017), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infection Group's Specialised Register; Ovid MEDLINE (2013 to 25 May 2017); Ovid Embase (2013 to 2017 Week 21); EBSCO CINAHL Plus (1984 to 25 May 2017); Web of Science (2013 to 25 May 2017); WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (1 September 2017); and ClinicalTrials.gov (1 September 2017).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials involving participants of all ages defined as having an RTI, where delayed antibiotics were compared to immediate antibiotics or no antibiotics. We defined a delayed antibiotic as advice to delay the filling of an antibiotic prescription by at least 48 hours. We considered all RTIs regardless of whether antibiotics were recommended or not.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Three review authors independently extracted and collated data. We assessed the risk of bias of all included trials. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing information.

Main Results

For this 2017 update we added one new trial involving 405 participants with uncomplicated acute respiratory infection. Overall, this review included 11 studies with a total of 3555 participants. These 11 studies involved acute respiratory infections including acute otitis media (three studies), streptococcal pharyngitis (three studies), cough (two studies), sore throat (one study), common cold (one study), and a variety of RTIs (one study). Five studies involved only children, two only adults, and four included both adults and children. Six studies were conducted in a primary care setting, three in paediatric clinics, and two in emergency departments. Studies were well reported, and appeared to be of moderate quality. Randomisation was not adequately described in two trials. Four trials blinded the outcomes assessor, and three included blinding of participants and doctors. We conducted meta-analysis for antibiotic use and patient satisfaction. We found no differences among delayed, immediate, and no prescribed antibiotics for clinical outcomes in the three studies that recruited participants with cough. For the outcome of fever with sore throat, three of the five studies favoured immediate antibiotics, and two found no difference. For the outcome of pain related to sore throat, two studies favoured immediate antibiotics, and three found no difference. One study compared delayed antibiotics with no antibiotic for sore throat, and found no difference in clinical outcomes. Three studies included participants with acute otitis media. Of the two studies with an immediate antibiotic arm, one study found no difference for fever, and the other study favoured immediate antibiotics for pain and malaise severity on Day 3. One study including participants with acute otitis media compared delayed antibiotics with no antibiotics and found no difference for pain and fever on Day 3. Two studies recruited participants with common cold. Neither study found differences for clinical outcomes between delayed and immediate antibiotic groups. One study favoured delayed antibiotics over no antibiotics for pain, fever, and cough duration (moderate quality evidence for all clinical outcomes - GRADE assessment). There were either no differences for adverse effects or results favoured delayed antibiotics over immediate antibiotics (low quality evidence - to GRADE assessment) with no significant differences in complication rates. Delayed antibiotics resulted in a significant reduction in antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics prescription (odds ratio (OR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.05). However, a delayed antibiotic was more likely to result in reported antibiotic use than no antibiotics (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.59 to 4.08) (moderate quality evidence - GRADE assessment). Patient satisfaction favoured delayed over no antibiotics (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.06). There was no significant difference in patient satisfaction between delayed antibiotics and immediate antibiotics (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.10) (moderate quality evidence - GRADE assessment). None of the included studies evaluated antibiotic resistance.

Authors' Conclusions

For many clinical outcomes, there were no differences between prescribing strategies. Symptoms for acute otitis media and sore throat were modestly improved by immediate antibiotics compared with delayed antibiotics. There were no differences in complication rates. Delaying prescribing did not result in significantly different levels of patient satisfaction compared with immediate provision of antibiotics (86% versus 91%) (moderate quality evidence). However, delay was favoured over no antibiotics (87% versus 82%). Delayed antibiotics achieved lower rates of antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics (31% versus 93%) (moderate quality evidence). The strategy of no antibiotics further reduced antibiotic use compared to delaying prescription for antibiotics (14% versus 28%). Delayed antibiotics for people with acute respiratory infection reduced antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics, but was not shown to be different to no antibiotics in terms of symptom control and disease complications. Where clinicians feel it is safe not to prescribe antibiotics immediately for people with respiratory infections, no antibiotics with advice to return if symptoms do not resolve is likely to result in the least antibiotic use while maintaining similar patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes to delaying prescription of antibiotics. Where clinicians are not confident in using a no antibiotic strategy, a delayed antibiotics strategy may be an acceptable compromise in place of immediate prescribing to significantly reduce unnecessary antibiotic use for RTIs, and thereby reduce antibiotic resistance, while maintaining patient safety and satisfaction levels. Editorial note: As a living systematic review, this review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review.

### Pharyngitis management: defining the controversy [^1149pYrX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite numerous controlled trials, clinical practice guidelines and cost-effective analyses, controversy persists regarding the appropriate management strategy for adult pharyngitis. In this perspective, we explore this controversy by comparing two competing clinical guidelines. Although the guidelines appear to make widely diverging recommendations, we show that the controversy centers on only a small proportion of patients: those presenting with severe pharyngitis. We examine recently published data to illustrate that this seemingly simple problem of strep throat remains a philosophical issue: should we give primacy to relieving acute time-limited symptoms, or should we emphasize the potential societal risk of antibiotic resistance? We accept potentially over treating a minority of adult pharyngitis patients with the most severe presentations to reduce suffering in an approximately equal number of patients who will have false negative test results if the test-and-treat strategy were used.

### The safety of delayed versus immediate antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections [^116YT4SV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical safety of delayed antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), which is recommended in treatment guidelines for less severe cases.

Methods

Two population-based cohort studies used the English Clinical Practice Research Databank and Welsh Secure Anonymized Information Linkage, containing electronic health records from primary care linked to hospital admission records. Patients with URTI and prescriptions of amoxicillin, clarithromycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, or phenoxymethylpenicillin were identified. Patients were stratified according to delayed and immediate prescribing relative to URTI diagnosis. Outcome of interest was infection-related hospital admission after 30 days.

Results

The population included 1.82 million patients with an URTI and antibiotic prescription; 91.7% had an antibiotic at URTI diagnosis date (immediate) and 8.3% had URTI diagnosis in 1–30 days before (delayed). Delayed antibiotic prescribing was associated with a 52% increased risk of infection-related hospital admissions (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.43–1.62). The probability of delayed antibiotic prescribing was unrelated to predicted risks of hospital admission. Analyses of the number needed to harm showed considerable variability across different patient groups (median with delayed antibiotic prescribing, 1357; 2.5% percentile, 295; 97.5% percentile, 3366).

Conclusions

This is the first large population-based study examining the safety of delayed antibiotic prescribing. Waiting to treat URTI was associated with increased risk of hospital admission, although delayed antibiotic prescribing was used similarly between high- and low-risk patients. There is a need to better target delayed antibiotic prescribing to URTI patients with lower risks of complications.

### Guidelines for the use of antibiotics in acute upper respiratory tract infections… [^115YceDf]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

If an antibiotic is prescribed, first-line therapy for patients with nonsevere illness is high-dosage amoxicillin. Patients with nonsevere illness in whom amoxicillin therapy has failed should switch to high-dosage amoxicillin/clavulanate. For patients with symptoms of severe infection, first-line therapy is high-dosage amoxicillin/clavulanate. Alternative therapies for patients allergic to penicillin are shown in Table 1.
5. For children, treatment options include high-dosage amoxicillin, high-dosage amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, cefdinir, or ceftriaxone. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, macrolides, or clindamycin is recommended if the patient has a history of type I hypersensitivity reaction to betalactam antibiotics.

For adults, treatment options include high-dosage amoxicillin, high-dosage amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, cefdinir, gatif loxacin, levof loxacin, and moxif loxacin. TMP-SMX, doxycycline, azithromycin, or clarithromycin is recommended if the patient has a history of type I hypersensitivity reaction to betalactam antibiotics. 19, 20 Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae are possible causes, and macrolide antibiotics are the treatment of choice. The CDC recommends azithromycin for five days, clarithromycin for seven days, or erythromycin for 14 days in children older than one month and in adults with suspected pertussis based on recent exposure or for postexposure prophylaxis. For children younger than one month, azithromycin is recommended. TMP-SMX is an alternative for infants older than two months. 21.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^114bSWeV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

Some unanswered questions in CRS antibiotic research are listed in Table II. Several expert guidelines call for RCTs to study the widespread practice of antibiotics for CRS. 3,72 Due to the variable quality of much of the existing evidence, it remains uncertain whether the use of short or long-term antibiotics have an impact on patient outcomes in adults with CRS. Further randomised studies with larger population sizes are needed. Unlike macrolides, the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not believed to have direct sinonasal anti-inflammatory properties, and so studies are needed to determine conclusively its effectiveness in CRS given the frequency of its prescription for CRS.

Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health that demands ongoing attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 2 million patients suffer from complications of antibiotic resistance, with 23,000 patients dying from such complications annually in the United States. 73 Furthermore, the CDC estimates that at least 1 in 3 prescriptions for antibiotics are unnecessary, and the majority of the unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed for respiratory disease caused by viruses. 73 Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use is critical to combating antibiotic resistance. CRS is an ideal condition to clarify the appropriateness and efficacy of antibiotic prescriptions, which is very pertinent in the context of the global crisis of resistance to antibiotics. 3

### Variability in antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory illnesses by provider specialty [^116aMeCw]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate variation in antibiotic prescribing between pediatric and nonpediatric providers for common upper respiratory illnesses.

Study Design

Patient encounters for children aged < 18 years from a regional health care system were identified. Electronic medical records from 2011 to 2016 were extracted for diagnoses of upper respiratory infection, pharyngitis, acute otitis media, and sinusitis. Encounters with competing medical diagnoses, recent hospitalization, and antibiotic prescriptions within 30 days were excluded. Adherence to antibiotic guidelines was assessed by provider training (pediatric, nonpediatric physicians, and advance practice providers). Additional factors assessed were calendar year, and patient's age, sex, insurance status, and number of sick visits in the prior year.

Results

Across 6 years, 141 361 visits were examined: 43 914 for upper respiratory infection, 43 701 for pharyngitis, 43 925 for acute otitis media, and 9821 for sinusitis. Pediatricians were more likely than Advanced practice providers (APP) and nonpediatric providers to have guideline-concordant prescribing for pharyngitis (pediatricians, 66.7% [95% CI, 54.5–77.0]; nonpediatricians, 49.1% [95% CI, 36.3–62.0], APPs, 52.2% [95% CI, 39.4–64.7]; P < .0001) and sinusitis (pediatricians, 70.8% [95% CI, 53.8–83.4], nonpediatricians, 63.3% [95% CI, 46.8–77.2], APPs, 62.1% [95% CI, 45.1–76.5]; p = 0.48) and to withhold antibiotics for upper respiratory infection than APPs and nonpediatric providers (pediatricians, 86.6% [95% CI, 81.2–90.6], nonpediatricians, 80.8% [95% CI, 73.0–86.8], APPs, 76.8% [95% CI, 68.4–83.5]; P < .0001). Pediatricians were less likely to prescribe antibiotics for pharyngitis without a positive test for group A Streptococcus than APPs and nonpediatric providers (pediatricians, 15.1% [95% CI, 10.4–21.6], nonpediatricians, 29.4% [95% CI, 20.8–39.6], APPs, 27.2% [95% CI, 19.3–36.9]; P < .0001). First-line antibiotic prescribing for acute otitis media did not differ between provider specialties. A trend toward more guideline-concordant prescribing was seen for pharyngitis and sinusitis over the study period.

Conclusions

Pediatricians were more likely to adhere to guidelines for management of pediatric acute respiratory infections. Pediatric antibiotic stewardship efforts should also target nonpediatricians.

### A critical assessment of published guidelines and other decision-support systems for the antibiotic treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections [^114nxguC]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines are an important means by which professional associations and governments have sought to improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of disease management for infectious diseases. Prescribing of initial antibiotic therapy for community-acquired respiratory tract infections (RTIs) is primarily empiric and physicians may often have a limited appreciation of bacterial resistance. Recent guidelines for managing RTIs have adopted a more evidence-based approach. This process has highlighted important gaps in the existing knowledge base, e.g. concerning the impact of resistance on the effectiveness of oral antibiotics for outpatient community-acquired pneumonia and the level of resistance that should prompt a change in empiric prescribing. In upper RTIs, the challenge is to identify patients in whom antibiotic therapy is warranted. Concentrated, sustained efforts are needed to secure physicians' use of guidelines. The information should be distilled into a simple format available at the point of prescribing and supported by other behavioral change techniques (e.g. educational outreach visits). Advances in information technology offer the promise of more dynamic, computer-assisted forms of guidance. Thus, RTI prescribing guidelines and other prescribing support systems should help control bacterial resistance in the community. However, their effect on resistance patterns is largely unknown and there is an urgent need for collaborative research in this area. Rapid, cost-effective diagnostic techniques are also required and new antibiotics will continue to have a role in disease management.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis: background [^1152zHys]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute bronchitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease. The evaluation of adults with an acute cough illness or a presumptive diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis should focus on ruling out serious illness, particularly pneumonia. In healthy, nonelderly adults, pneumonia is uncommon in the absence of vital sign abnormalities or asymmetrical lung sounds, and chest radiography is usually not indicated. In patients with cough lasting 3 weeks or longer, chest radiography may be warranted in the absence of other known causes. Routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis is not recommended, regardless of duration of cough. If pertussis infection is suspected (an unusual circumstance), a diagnostic test should be performed and antimicrobial therapy initiated. Patient satisfaction with care for acute bronchitis depends most on physician — patient communication rather than on antibiotic treatment.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^111a6ygf]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

'Complete the antibiotic course', a dogma to be debunked

In medical schools we have been taught to advise our patients to always complete an antibiotic course once initiated. This was deemed suitable to minimise the development of AMR. However, this often-heard statement that to prevent AMR it is necessary for patients to complete the entire course, even after the resolution of symptoms, by eradicating every bacterium that could result in a future relapse, remains unproved. To the contrary, the longer patients and the environment are exposed to antibiotics, the greater the selective pressure driving AMR.

Even short courses of antibiotics can have long-term effects causing persistence of resistant organisms lasting years and altering the normal gut microbiome and might be detrimental. By shortening antibiotic duration, overall antibiotic exposure is lessened, reducing the selection pressure for multidrug-resistant organisms. This is particularly evident in patients with pneumonia as some randomised clinical trials have demonstrated that shorter treatments yield similar clinical outcomes to longer courses but are associated with lower rates of infection recurrence and AMR. This observation is consistent with what we know about natural selection. AMR emerges at the site of infection in only a few types of infections; moreover, resistance typically emerges off target, among colonising flora away from the site of infection. A recent study showed that for eight of nine potential pathogens of interest, over 80% of their exposures to commonly used antibiotic classes in the outpatient setting occur when the organisms are asymptomatically colonising the microbiome, not causing disease.

Over the last years there has been an increasing number of independent bodies, scientific academies and institutions abandoning this principle on completing antibiotic courses. In addition, in 2017, the World Health Organization abandoned this dogma. The best way to contravene this historical belief is by providing new evidence from randomised clinical trials setting a revised standard for antimicrobial therapy durations. Conventional stewardship strategies aimed at patients not requiring antibiotics do not help those who truly need them but receive excessively long treatment. However, encouraging a minimum duration of therapy might be more attainable than completely refraining from antibiotic therapy, as shown in qualitative studies. In such instances, the potential harm posed by unnecessary therapy to patients without bacterial infections is considerably lower compared to adhering to standard durations, and it can prove beneficial to those with genuine bacterial infections.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^113CWCdx]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — Statement 1a (differential diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis) states that clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions. A clinician should diagnose ABRS when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis (purulent nasal drainage accompanied by nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both) persist without evidence of improvement for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening). This is a strong recommendation based on diagnostic studies with minor limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile notes a quality improvement opportunity to avoid inappropriate use of antibiotics for presumed viral infections, aggregate evidence quality Grade B and Level of Confidence in Evidence Medium, a benefits-harm assessment of preponderance of benefit over harm, and harms including the risk of misclassifying acute bacterial rhinosinusitis as viral, or vice-versa, with intentional vagueness and role of patient preferences listed as none.

### Reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in upper respiratory tract infection in a primary care setting in kolkata, India [^111dibF2]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotic resistance is a matter of global concern; increasing antibiotic use drives the emergence of resistance. Hence, as well as risking unwarranted side effects to the individual patient (such as drug side effects), inappropriate use of antibiotics also poses risks to community and public health. Patients treated with antibiotics for respiratory infections in primary care develop bacterial resistance to that antibiotic. This can persist for up to 12 months, increasing the prevalence of resistant organisms in the community. In developed countries, 80%–90% of antibiotics are prescribed in primary care settings; the majority of these are prescribed for respiratory tract infections. The rates of inappropriate antibiotic prescription are worryingly high; a major study of US ambulatory care visits estimated a third of all antibiotics prescribed were inappropriate.

Antibiotic prescribing in primary care varies markedly within European countries. In 2015, antibiotic prescribing ranged from 10.7 defined daily dose per 1000 inhabitants per day in the Netherlands to 36.1 in Greece. In Dutch primary care, 19% of patients presenting with URTI in 2010 were prescribed antibiotics. In the UK, the median general practice in a large study prescribed antibiotics at 38% of consultations for URTI. Antibiotic prescribing for URTI in primary care in developing and transitional countries has increased from rates of approximately 44% in 1982 to 71% in 2006. In China and Thailand, over 80% were prescribed antibiotics. Pooled data for India shows antibiotic prescribing in URTI of over 70%.

Why do doctors prescribe antibiotics inappropriately? Doctors' knowledge of antibiotic prescribing guidelines and the risks of antimicrobial resistance may be inadequate. Older GPs are less likely to prescribe according to antibiotic guidelines, suggesting difficulty changing established practice in light of new evidence. Doctors may disagree with evidence-based guidelines, instead relying on their own clinical experience to guide them; for example, doctors in India report using antibiotics as prevention in patients from poorer communities due to concerns about higher prevalence of bacterial infection. Barriers towards putting evidence into practice include time pressure, financial considerations and doctors' perceptions of patients' expectations.

A number of randomised controlled trials in primary care in Europe have shown significant reductions in antibiotic prescribing (both all cause and specifically in URTI) through programmes comprising educational events and feedback on practice prescribing habits. For example, the Stemming the Tide of Antibiotic Resistance (STAR) programme, consisting of prescribing feedback, seminars and online education, led to a 4.2% reduction in all-cause antibiotic prescribing without increased hospital admissions or reconsultations in a Welsh primary care setting.

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections during influenza seasons [^1179AaFn]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study adds to evidence that misuse of antibiotics, characterized by antibiotic overuse and inappropriate antibiotic selection, is widespread in the treatment of outpatient ARIs. The study indicates a number of potential targets to achieve the goal of the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria of reducing inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020. We must strengthen outpatient antibiotic stewardship efforts to eliminate antibiotic treatment for viral URIs and acute bronchitis, which our study indicates would make the largest contribution to decreasing unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions. Increased efforts are needed to support improved adherence to guidelines for antibiotic prescribing for common diagnoses, including more stringent adherence to GAS pharyngitis testing guidelines and clinical criteria for antibiotic treatment of sinusitis, as well as interventions focused on appropriate selection of first-line antibiotics for these conditions if treatment is indicated. In addition, our findings indicate that improved point-of-care influenza diagnostics and increased recognition and appropriate treatment of influenza virus infection may also aid in decreasing unnecessary antibiotic use for ARIs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published "Core Elements of Outpatient Antibiotic Stewardship", which provides guidance to clinicians and facility leadership to implement activities to improve antibiotic use. Improving antibiotic prescribing for ARIs during the influenza season represents an important opportunity to improve the long-term quality of patient care.

### Appropriate antibiotic use for acute respiratory tract infection in adults: advice for high-value care from the American College of Physicians and the centers for disease control and prevention [^111pTD8o]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is the most common reason for antibiotic prescription in adults. Antibiotics are often inappropriately prescribed for patients with ARTI. This article presents best practices for antibiotic use in healthy adults (those without chronic lung disease or immunocompromising conditions) presenting with ARTI.

Methods

A narrative literature review of evidence about appropriate antibiotic use for ARTI in adults was conducted. The most recent clinical guidelines from professional societies were complemented by meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized clinical trials. To identify evidence-based articles, the Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched through September 2015 using the following Medical Subject Headings terms: "acute bronchitis", "respiratory tract infection", "pharyngitis", "rhinosinusitis", and "the common cold".

High-Value Care Advice 1

Clinicians should not perform testing or initiate antibiotic therapy in patients with bronchitis unless pneumonia is suspected.

High-Value Care Advice 2

Clinicians should test patients with symptoms suggestive of group A streptococcal pharyngitis (for example, persistent fevers, anterior cervical adenitis, and tonsillopharyngeal exudates or other appropriate combination of symptoms) by rapid antigen detection test and/or culture for group A Streptococcus. Clinicians should treat patients with antibiotics only if they have confirmed streptococcal pharyngitis.

High-Value Care Advice 3

Clinicians should reserve antibiotic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis for patients with persistent symptoms for more than 10 days, onset of severe symptoms or signs of high fever (> 39 °C) and purulent nasal discharge or facial pain lasting for at least 3 consecutive days, or onset of worsening symptoms following a typical viral illness that lasted 5 days that was initially improving (double sickening).

High-Value Care Advice 4

Clinicians should not prescribe antibiotics for patients with the common cold.

### Comparative safety and attributable healthcare expenditures following inappropriate versus appropriate outpatient antibiotic prescriptions among adults with upper respiratory infections [^116UQvDn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Little is known about the clinical and financial consequences of inappropriate antibiotics. We aimed to estimate the comparative risk of adverse drug events and attributable healthcare expenditures associated with inappropriate versus appropriate antibiotic prescriptions for common respiratory infections.

Methods

We established a cohort of adults aged 18 to 64 years with an outpatient diagnosis of a bacterial (pharyngitis, sinusitis) or viral respiratory infection (influenza, viral upper respiratory infection, nonsuppurative otitis media, bronchitis) from 1 April 2016 to 30 September 2018 using Merative MarketScan Commercial Database. The exposure was an inappropriate versus appropriate oral antibiotic (ie, non-guideline-recommended vs guideline-recommended antibiotic for bacterial infections; any vs no antibiotic for viral infections). Propensity score-weighted Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the association between inappropriate antibiotics and adverse drug events. Two-part models were used to calculate 30-day all-cause attributable healthcare expenditures by infection type.

Results

Among 3 294 598 eligible adults, 43% to 56% received inappropriate antibiotics for bacterial and 7% to 66% for viral infections. Inappropriate antibiotics were associated with increased risk of several adverse drug events, including Clostridioides difficile infection and nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain (hazard ratio, 2.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–6.41 and hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.18, respectively, for pharyngitis). Thirty-day attributable healthcare expenditures were higher among adults who received inappropriate antibiotics for bacterial infections ($18-$67) and variable (-$53 to $49) for viral infections.

Conclusions

Inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory infections were associated with increased risks of patient harm and higher healthcare expenditures, justifying a further call to action to implement outpatient antibiotic stewardship programs.

### Accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis: minimizing bacterial resistance [^112iN1Xj]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance in respiratory pathogens has become a common clinical problem that has serious public health implications. Inappropriate use of antibiotics for the treatment of viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) has contributed to the development of resistant microorganisms. Health care providers can help control the spread of resistance by limiting the use of antimicrobial agents to infections that meet clinical guidelines for a bacterial cause.

Objective

This article examines the means of accurately diagnosing and appropriately treating acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in an effort to control increasing levels of resistance.

Methods

This article discusses current treatment guidelines that provide the evidenced-based rationale for choosing the most appropriate antimicrobial agents for suspected ABRS in adults and children. An evidence-based approach can help minimize the public health threat posed by the continuing increase in microbial resistance.

Results

Although definitive clinical criteria that differentiate between ABRS and viral URTI are lacking, careful evaluation of the duration and severity of symptoms provides a rational basis for diagnosing ABRS in primary care settings.

Conclusions

Once a diagnosis of ABRS has been made, empiric antibiotic therapy may be justified. When it is, the first-line agent should be the narrowest spectrum antibiotic that would be expected to eradicate the most common causative organisms. The antibiotic selection process should take into account prevailing patterns of resistance and the presence of risk factors for infection with resistant pathogens, as well as published evidence-based guidelines.

### Reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in upper respiratory tract infection in a primary care setting in kolkata, India [^111nRPxu]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Inappropriate antibiotic use is a key factor in the emergence of antibiotic resistance. The majority of antibiotics are prescribed in primary care, where upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common presentation. Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in URTI is common globally and has increased markedly in developing and transitional countries. Antibiotic stewardship is crucial to prevent the emergence and spread of resistant microbes. This project aimed to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in URTI in a non-governmental organisation's primary care outreach clinics in Kolkata, India, from 62.6% to 30% over 4 months. A multifaceted intervention to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in non-specific URTI was implemented. This consisted of a repeated process of audit and feedback, interactive training sessions, one-to-one case-based discussion, antibiotic guideline development and coding updates. The primary outcome measure was antibiotic prescribing rates. A baseline audit of all patients presenting with non-specific URTI over 8 weeks in November and December 2016 (n = 222) found that 62.6% were prescribed antibiotics. Postintervention audit over 4 weeks in April 2017 (n = 69) showed a marked reduction in antibiotic prescribing to 7.2%. An increase in documentation of examination findings was also observed, from 52.7% to 95.6%. This multifaceted intervention was successful at reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, with sustained reductions demonstrated over the 4 months of the project. This suggests that approaches previously used in Europe can successfully be applied to different settings.

### Effect of using an interactive booklet about childhood respiratory tract infections in primary care consultations on reconsulting and antibiotic prescribing: a cluster randomised controlled trial [^115RkJYR]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory tract infections are the most common reason for patients to consult in primary care, with children consulting more than any other age group. One in five children who consult for a respiratory tract infection returns during the same illness episode, and many of these visits are unnecessary. Unnecessary re-consulting represents an opportunity cost and can increase the pressure on clinicians to prescribe antibiotics. Acute cough in children alone is estimated to cost the NHS at least £31.5m (€36.8m;$51.4m), with most of this cost arising from consultations with general practitioners.

Complications of respiratory tract infections are rare, and there is little or no benefit from treatment with antibiotics. Guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommend against the immediate use of antibiotics for most children who have respiratory tract infections, and promote effective communication and information provision including an indication of the likely duration of illness. Nevertheless, antibiotics continue to be overprescribed for these illnesses, with children receiving more antibiotics than any other age group. Prescribing for non-specific upper respiratory tract infections, which declined in the late 1990s, is once again increasing. Unnecessary antibiotic use wastes healthcare resources, encourages further consulting in the future for similar illnesses, contributes to the problem of antibiotic resistance, and unnecessarily exposes patients to risk of adverse effects.

Parental beliefs, fears, and expectations play an important part in both consulting behaviour and determining whether an antibiotic is prescribed. Parents fear serious illness, and worry that they will not be able to recognise the symptoms. Few are aware of the likely risks and benefits from antibiotic treatment and the normal duration of illness. Providing information on recognising the signs of serious illness and the likely duration of illness can reduce anxiety, increase confidence, and empower parents to manage their child's illness without needing to consult a healthcare professional. A nurse administered educational intervention aimed at helping parents cope with ear pain in the United States resulted in a reduction in consultations for ear pain over the following year. Patient information leaflets for adults with lower respiratory tract infections that describe expected duration of illness and suggest simple self-help measures reduce reconsultationsand antibiotic prescribing.

### Development and internal validation of a clinical rule to improve antibiotic use in children presenting to primary care with acute respiratory tract infection and cough: a prognostic cohort study [^116w5Sks]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Combating the present and future threats of antimicrobial resistance is high on policy agendas internationally. A key goal of the UKstrategy is to slow emergence of antimicrobial resistance through judicious antibiotic prescribing. The vast majority of infections are managed outside of secondary care, with more than 80% of all health-service antibiotics prescribed by primary care clinicians. Antibiotic prescribing in primary care is increasingand directly affects antimicrobial resistance. Given that up to 50% of prescribed antibiotics are considered unnecessary, primary care is a high priority area for antimicrobial stewardship research.

Respiratory tract infections and cough in children (due to upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, infective exacerbation of asthma, and pneumonia) are the most common respiratory tract infection syndromes managed by health services internationally. Primary care clinicians acknowledge that they prescribe antibiotics for a range of medical and non-medical reasons, particularly in children, who are seen as vulnerableand whose clinical state can change rapidly. Many clinicians report that they prescribe antibiotics just in case, to mitigate perceived risk of future hospital admission and complications, and that failing to provide a prescription for a child who subsequently becomes seriously unwell is professionally unacceptable. If primary care clinicians could identify children at low (or very low) risk of such future complications, the reduced clinical uncertainty could lead to a reduced use of antibiotics in these groups of patients.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

At the time of funding, we did a systematic review for previous studies investigating factors associated with poor prognosis in children presenting to primary care with acute cough and respiratory tract infection. We searched MEDLINE for articles published from 1966 to January, 2012) using the following search terms: "respiratory tract infection [MeSH Terms] OR respiratory infection* OR rti OR lrti OR urti OR lri OR uri OR chest infection* OR cough OR dyspnoea OR congestion OR (lung consolidation) OR (lobar pneumonia) OR (difficult breath*) OR respiration disorder* AND child* OR schoolchild* OR preschool* OR pediatric* OR paediatric* OR parent OR parents OR parental OR mother OR father OR mom OR dad OR mum OR caregiver OR guardian OR carer OR infant OR infancy AND primary care OR family practice OR general practice OR family medicine OR community healthcare OR primary healthcare OR ambulatory care NOT asthma OR malaria OR tuberculosis". We found no prognostic evidence to support GPs in identifying children at lowest or highest risk of future complications.

### Reply to huttner: 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^117Dmz7Y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We appreciate this additional letter submitted in response to the recently published guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.

Huttner and colleagues emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship principles in shaping antibiotic treatment guidelines. We strongly agree. The adult CAP guideline emphasizes that when multiple options are presented the final antibiotic choice should be influenced by local and individual patient factors. We also emphasized the importance of deescalating antibiotics when appropriate and limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, our highest priority was to assure that adequate empiric treatment is provided, especially for patients with more severe CAP. We did recommend amoxicillin as monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, but the recommendation for expanded antibiotic therapy for outpatients with comorbidities reflected the need to cover for a broader range of potential pathogens. These outpatients represent a group that has not been clearly shown to be safely treated with β-lactam monotherapy. Ceftaroline was included as an option for treatment of inpatients with CAP given the available high-grade evidence (cited by Huttner and colleagues) that it is at least equivalent if not superior to ceftriaxone without evidence of an increased adverse event profile.

Finally, although we acknowledge that antimicrobial stewardship is relevant for all antibiotic prescribing decisions, it is important to highlight that, in a recent analysis of all outpatient antibiotic prescribing in the United States, pneumonia was only the 14th most common diagnosis, accounting for a small percentage of all antibiotics prescribed. For antimicrobial stewardship to actually impact the individual and population risks of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, including the risks attributed to respiratory fluoroquinolones, more gains will be achieved by focusing on treatment strategies for upper respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal infections.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^114RCeCn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and 3 new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy, which includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should distinguish presumed ABRS from acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions and (2) should confirm a clinical diagnosis of CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should either offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) or prescribe initial antibiotic therapy for adults with uncomplicated ABRS; (2) should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as ﬁrst-line therapy for 5 to 10 days (if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic); (3) should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days after diagnosis or worsens during the initial management; (4) should distinguish CRS and recurrent ARS from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms; (5) should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent ARS for multiple chronic conditions that would modify management, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia; (6) should confirm the presence or absence of nasal polyps in a patient with CRS; and (7) should recommend saline nasal irrigation, topical intranasal corticosteroids, or both for symptom relief of CRS. The update group stated as options that clinicians may (1) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief of viral rhinosinusitis; (2) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation) for symptomatic relief of ABRS; and (3) obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent ARS. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should not obtain radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for ARS, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected, and (2) should not prescribe topical or systemic antifungal therapy for patients with CRS.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: background [^116JknDp]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms-especially those with unilateral facial pain-regardless of duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, should be used.

Reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment for respiratory tract infections to combat antimicrobial resistance

Most bacterial RTIs show equal efficacy with fewer adverse events in shorter compared to standard antibiotic courses in clinical trials. This is based on the principle of 'shorter is better', initially conceived one decade ago. However, there are two notable exceptions: otitis media among children under the age of two and streptococcal pharyngitis, in which shorter first-line antibiotic courses are less effective than standard antibiotic courses.

Over the last few decades, most guidelines have recommended standard antimicrobial therapy durations of seven to ten days for lower RTIs. However, few randomised clinical trials have been conducted to determine the minimal effective treatment durations. Despite the low number of patients included in some of these studies, shorter treatment durations, such as two to three days, have been demonstrated not to be inferior to longer durations in terms of clinical efficacy. Initially advocated for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in the early 2000s, an increasing body of evidence suggests that shorter durations of antibiotics are also effective in treating most RTIs (Table 2). Some recent clinical guidelines, like the WHO AWaRe antibiotic book, advocate for five-day courses of antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis, COPD exacerbations, and community-acquired pneumonia. Despite this evidence, most clinicians still use standard or longer courses.

### SHEA statement on antibiotic stewardship in hospitals during public health emergencies [^1165Hsai]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

SHEA — empiric antibiotics and viral coinfections during respiratory viral pandemics: If treated at the time of hospital admission, HCP should prescribe antibiotics recommended in guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) for patients presenting from the community with coinfection, and antibiotics for pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, seen more typically in healthcare-associated infection, are not recommended. HCP may consider coinfection with other viruses, such as influenza, and if influenza is diagnosed, addition of therapy, such as oseltamivir, may be indicated; NIH guidelines suggest HCP initiate empiric oseltamivir pending the exclusion of influenza by nucleic acid detection assay in upper-respiratory-tract specimens for non-intubated patients and in both upper- and lower-respiratory-tract specimens for intubated patients. HCP may consider antibiotics, including broad-spectrum coverage, for patients hospitalized for > 48 hours who are at greater risk for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), when there are new clinical signs that are consistent with healthcare-associated bacterial or fungal infection; patients who are admitted for > 48 hours are at increased risk for HAI, and it is reasonable to consider antibiotic choices that include activity against healthcare-associated pathogens such as P. aeruginosa, and fungal infection, such as bloodstream infection in patients with prolonged central venous catheters, should also be considered if appropriate.

### Improving antibiotic initiation and duration prescribing among nursing home physicians using an audit and feedback intervention: a theory-informed qualitative analysis [^113eUour]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Appropriate prescriber

All physicians reported their role to provide appropriate treatment to achieve 'good patient care and outcomes' 004 (medical director). Participants considered many factors to determine appropriate initiation, including clinical features, lab test results, patient/family preferences, and care goals. Consideration of antibiotic duration (specifically, shorter durations) was not common practice for many participants, and some needed to verify the evidence (ie, asking a pharmacist) before considering changing their practice. A few physicians saw their role as an Appropriate prescriber to prescribe for the shortest duration possible, however, it was not always clear what was meant by 'shortest'.

[I] always write the prescription initially as a low duration or slow duration. Not only does that help conserving antibiotics, but it kind of is a reminder to myself and to staff to reassess the patient, because we have to decide whether or not to increase the length of the prescription. 017

An identified knowledge gap (Knowledge and Skills) for upper respiratory tract infections negatively interacted with (and challenged the integrity of) the Appropriate prescriber role.

We've had tons of focus on reducing the antibiotics for UTIs, for instance, in long-term care, but there's not a really great approach to deciding whether to treat upper respiratory symptoms with antibiotics. 013 (medical director)

The ability to apply existing Knowledge and Skills in line with the evidence was influenced by Social influence and Beliefs about consequences. Physicians described navigating a tension between appropriate prescribing, maintaining good relationships with families and staff (who often advocated for antibiotic use), considering resident wishes regarding receipt of treatment, and applying comfort measures during end of life care. Most physicians felt it was more important to avoid the negative consequences of inappropriate prescribing (Beliefs about consequences) than the potential negative consequences of not following the pressure from staff and family to prescribe (Social influence), although participants reported occasionally succumbing to the pressure.

### Procalcitonin-guided diagnosis and antibiotic stewardship revisited [^111FjFmk]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Infections of the respiratory tract

Infections of the respiratory tract, including bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and acute exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), are the most important drivers for antibiotic (over-) treatment and thereby contribute to the increasing rate of antibiotic multi-resistance. The diagnosis of respiratory infections relies mainly on clinical criteria (e.g. cough, dyspnea, fever) and chest radiography to document infiltration of the lung. Identification of the pathogen by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods has low sensitivity, and thus may not rule out bacterial infection. For some types of infections, such as Legionella, clinical scores can help to assess the risk of infection. Several observational studies as well as interventional trials have established the usefulness of PCT in patients with respiratory infections.

A 2012 Cochrane meta-analysis based on individual patient data from 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focused on effects of PCT in patients with respiratory infections. The studies had somewhat similar PCT protocols with recommendations for or against initiation or continuation of antibiotic therapy based on initial PCT levels, PCT kinetics over time (i.e. 80% PCT decrease from peak), or both, in combination with the clinical presentation and resolution of illness (Figs. 2 and 3). The cut-offs were adapted to the clinical setting and the acuity of presentation, with cut-offs of 0.25 (0.1) ng/ml in respiratory infections and 0.5 ng/ml in sepsis. The meta-analysis found a strong reduction in the initial use of antibiotics, by around 60–70%, for low-severity respiratory infection (i.e. bronchitis, upper respiratory infections, AECOPD). In cases of higher-severity respiratory infection (i.e. pneumonia), monitoring of PCT resulted in earlier cessation of antibiotic treatment with a relative reduction in the duration of antibiotic treatment of around 40% for pneumonia and around 25% in the critical care of patients with sepsis caused by lung infections. Based on these studies, recent respiratory infection guidelines state that "… biomarkers can guide treatment duration by the application of predefined stopping rules for antibiotics. It has been shown that such rules work even in most severe cases, including pneumonia with septic shock… ", thereby emphasizing the concept of using a biomarker to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^117QokeH]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary care antimicrobial stewardship programs have limited success in reducing antibiotic use, prompting the search for new strategies. Convincing general practitioners to resist antibiotic prescription amid uncertainty or patient demands usually poses a significant challenge. Despite common practice, standard durations for common infections lack support from clinical studies. Contrary to common belief, extending antibiotic treatment beyond the resolution of symptoms does not seem to prevent or reduce antimicrobial resistance. Shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy has shown to be effective in mitigating the spread of resistance, particularly in cases of pneumonia. Recent hospital randomised trials suggest that ending antibiotic courses by day three for most lower respiratory tract infections is effective and safe. While community studies are scarce, it is likely that these shorter, tailored courses to meet patients' needs would also be effective and safe in primary care. Therefore, primary care studies should investigate the outcomes of advising patients to discontinue antibiotic treatment upon symptom resolution. Implementing patient-centred, customised treatment durations, rather than fixed courses, is crucial for meeting individual patient needs.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is a common complication of viral upper respiratory tract infections and is associated with a significant socioeconomic burden. Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ABRS have been produced in association with a number of societies in the United States; these guidelines aim to promote the rational selection of antibiotic therapy to optimize clinical outcomes while minimizing the potential for selection of antibiotic resistance. This article provides an overview of current U.S. guidelines for the treatment of ABRS, focusing on the impact of antibiotic resistance on treatment options.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis: background [^113ptkgp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute bronchitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease.1. The evaluation of adults with an acute cough illness or a presumptive diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis should focus on ruling out serious illness, particularly pneumonia. In healthy, nonelderly adults, pneumonia is uncommon in the absence of vital sign abnormalities or asymmetrical lung sounds, and chest radiography is usually not indicated. In patients with cough lasting 3 weeks or longer, chest radiography may be warranted in the absence of other known causes.2. Routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis is not recommended, regardless of duration of cough. If pertussis infection is suspected (an unusual circumstance), a diagnostic test should be performed and antimicrobial therapy initiated.3. Patient satisfaction with care for acute bronchitis depends most on physician-patient communication rather than on antibiotic treatment.

### Antibiotic prescription in the outpatient paediatric population attending emergency departments in lombardy, Italy: a retrospective database review [^113xMmBj]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

What is known about the subject?

Antibiotics are overused in outpatient children in Italy, more often than in other European countries.
The antibiotic prescribing pattern of Italian primary care physicians is frequently inadequate.

What this study adds?

In all, 56% of children attending an emergency department (ED) for a new episode of upper respiratory tract infections were treated with antibiotics, but only 22% received amoxicillin.
The low prescription of amoxicillin was shared by primary care and ED physicians (24% vs 20%, respectively).
The likelihood of receiving second-choice antibiotics was greater when the prescriber was the primary care physician.

Most upper respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses and require no antibiotics. This clinical report focuses on antibiotic prescribing strategies for bacterial upper respiratory tract infections, including acute otitis media, acute bacterial sinusitis, and streptococcal pharyngitis. The principles for judicious antibiotic prescribing that are outlined focus on applying stringent diagnostic criteria, weighing the benefits and harms of antibiotic therapy, and understanding situations when antibiotics may not be indicated. The principles can be used to amplify messages from recent clinical guidelines for local guideline development and for patient communication; they are broadly applicable to antibiotic prescribing in general.

### Current concepts in adult acute rhinosinusitis [^1156AdH2]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions that physicians treat in ambulatory care. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by viral upper respiratory infections. A meta-analysis based on individual patient data found that common clinical signs and symptoms were not effective for identifying patients with rhinosinusitis who would benefit from antibiotics. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are somewhat useful tests for confirming acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis. Four signs and symptoms that significantly increase the likelihood of a bacterial cause when present are double sickening, purulent rhinorrhea, erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 10 mm per hour, and purulent secretion in the nasal cavity. Although cutoffs vary depending on the guideline, antibiotic therapy should be considered when rhinosinusitis symptoms fail to improve within seven to 10 days or if they worsen at any time. First-line antibiotics include amoxicillin with or without clavulanate. Current guidelines support watchful waiting within the first seven to 10 days after upper respiratory symptoms first appear. Evidence on the use of analgesics, intranasal corticosteroids, and saline nasal irrigation for the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis is poor. Nonetheless, these therapies may be used to treat symptoms within the first 10 days of upper respiratory infection. Radiography is not recommended in the evaluation of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. For patients who do not respond to treatment, computed tomography of the sinuses without contrast media is helpful to evaluate for possible complications or anatomic abnormalities. Referral to an otolaryngologist is indicated when symptoms persist after maximal medical therapy and if any rare complications are suspected.

### Rational use of antibiotics for the management of children's respiratory tract infections in the ambulatory setting: an evidence-based consensus by the Italian society of preventive and social pediatrics [^111Qq2e1]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Several guidelines for the management of respiratory tract infections in children are available in Italy, as well as in other European countries and the United States of America. However, poor adherence to guidelines and the sustained inappropriate use of antibiotics have been reported. In the outpatient setting, almost half of antibiotics are prescribed for the treatment of common respiratory tract infections. In Italy the antibiotic prescription rate is significantly higher than in other European countries, such as Denmark or the Netherlands, and also the levels of antibiotic resistance for a large variety of bacteria are higher. Therefore, the Italian Society of Preventive and Social Paediatrics organised a consensus conference for the treatment of respiratory tract infections in children to produce a brief, easily readable, evidence-based document.

Methods

The conference method was used, according to the National Institute of Health and the National Plan Guidelines. A literature search was performed focusing on the current guidelines for the treatment of airway infections in children aged 1 month-18 years in the ambulatory setting.

Results

Recommendations for the treatment of acute pharyngitis, acute otitis media, sinusitis, and pneumonia have been summarized. Conditions for which antibiotic treatment should not be routinely prescribed have been highlighted.

Conclusion

This evidence-based document is intended to accessible to primary care pediatricians and general practice physicians in order to make clinical practice uniform, in accordance with the recommendations of the current guidelines.

### Delayed antibiotics for respiratory infections [^114dExCM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Modest benefits of antibiotics for acute upper respiratory tract infections have to be weighed against common adverse reactions, cost and antibacterial resistance. There has been interest in ways to reduce antibiotic prescribing. One strategy is to provide the prescription, but advise delay of more than 48 hours before use, in the hope symptoms resolve first. Advocates suggest this will preserve patient satisfaction. This review asks what effect delayed antibiotics have on clinical outcomes of respiratory infections, antibiotic use and patient satisfaction.

Objectives

To evaluate the prescribing strategy of delayed antibiotics for acute respiratory tract infections compared to immediate or no antibiotics for clinical outcomes, antibiotic use and patient satisfaction.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2006); MEDLINE (January 1966 to January Week 2, 2007), EMBASE (1990 to Week 2, 2007) and Current Contents - ISI Web of Knowledge (1998 to January 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving patients of all ages defined as having an acute respiratory infection were included in which delayed antibiotics were compared to antibiotics used immediately or no antibiotics. Outcomes measured included clinical outcomes, antibiotic use and patient satisfaction.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were collected and analysed by three review authors.

Main Results

Nine trials were eligible on the basis of design and relevant outcomes. For most clinical outcomes there was no difference between delayed, immediate and no antibiotics. Antibiotics prescribed immediately were more effective than delayed for fever, pain and malaise in some studies of patients with acute otitis media and sore throat but for other studies there was no difference. There was no difference for the common cold and bronchitis. Delaying antibiotic prescriptions reduced antibiotic use, and in three studies, reduced patient satisfaction compared to immediate antibiotics. In the other two studies comparing delayed and immediate antibiotics measuring satisfaction, there was no difference. Two studies also included a 'no antibiotics' arm for bronchitis and sore throat: there was no difference in symptom resolution nor patient satisfaction from antibiotic delay. In one study, but not the other, antibiotic use was significantly decreased with no, rather than delayed, antibiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

For most clinical outcomes there is no difference between the strategies. Immediate antibiotics was the strategy most likely to provide the best clinical outcomes in patients with sore throat and otitis media. Delaying or avoiding antibiotics, rather than providing them immediately, reduces antibiotic use for acute respiratory infections. Delay also reduced patient satisfaction in three trials, compared to immediate antibiotics with no difference in two other trials. Delaying antibiotics seems to have little advantage over avoiding them altogether where it is safe to do so.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections in adults: background [^1178gHjL]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease.1. The diagnosis of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection or acute rhinopharyngitis should be used to denote an acute infection that is typically viral in origin and in which sinus, pharyngeal, and lower airway symptoms, although frequently present, are not prominent. 2. Antibiotic treatment of adults with nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection does not enhance illness resolution and is not recommended. Studies specifically testing the impact of antibiotic treatment on complications of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections have not been performed in adults. Life-threatening complications of upper respiratory tract infection are rare.3. Purulent secretions from the nares or throat (commonly observed in patients with uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection) predict neither bacterial infection nor benefit from antibiotic treatment.

### Leveraging existing and soon-to-Be-available novel diagnostics for optimizing outpatient antibiotic stewardship in patients with respiratory tract infections [^116xThAv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) drive many outpatient encounters and, despite being predominantly viral, are associated with high rates of antibiotic prescriptions. With rising antibacterial resistance, optimization of prescribing of antibiotics in outpatients with RTIs is a critical need. Fortunately, this challenge arises at a time of increasing availability of novel RTI diagnostics to help discern which patients have bacterial infections warranting treatment. Effective implementation of antibiotic stewardship is needed, but optimal approaches for ambulatory settings are unknown. Future research needs are reviewed in this summary of a research summit convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America in the fall of 2019.

### Inappropriate antibiotic prescription for respiratory tract indications: most prominent in adult patients [^112rg1CD]. Family Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Numerous studies suggest overprescribing of antibiotics for respiratory tract indications (RTIs), without really authenticating inappropriate prescription; the strict criteria of guideline recommendations were not taken into account as information on specific diagnoses, patient characteristics and disease severity was not available.

Objective

The aim of this study is to quantify and qualify inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for RTIs.

Methods

This is an observational study of the (antibiotic) management of patients with RTIs, using a detailed registration of RTI consultations by general practitioners (GPs). Consultations of which all necessary information was available were benchmarked to the prescribing guidelines for acute otitis media (AOM), acute sore throat, rhinosinusitis or acute cough. Levels of overprescribing for these indications and factors associated with overprescribing were determined.

Results

The overall antibiotic prescribing rate was 38%. Of these prescriptions, 46% were not indicated by the guidelines. Relative overprescribing was highest for throat (including tonsillitis) and lowest for ear consultations (including AOM). Absolute overprescribing was highest for lower RTIs (including bronchitis). Overprescribing was highest for patients between 18 and 65 years of age, when GPs felt patients' pressure for an antibiotic treatment, for patients presenting with fever and with complaints longer than 1 week. Underprescribing was observed in < 4% of the consultations without a prescription.

Conclusion

Awareness of indications and patient groups provoking antibiotic overprescribing can help in the development of targeted strategies to improve GPs' prescribing routines for RTIs.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^116GSbUg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common reasons for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, though there is little clinical evidence to support this practice, especially for chronic rhinosinusitis. Despite considerable research, the etiology of chronic rhinosinusitis, including the pathogenic role of microbes, remains poorly understood. Rigorous studies of the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of chronic sinusitis are surprisingly few in number and the results are somewhat conflicting. This article will review the rationales for and against the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with antibiotics, based on current evidence and understanding of pathophysiology, and will also summarize the current guidelines.

### The safety of delayed versus immediate antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections [^113RgQqm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics are frequently prescribed for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs; including sore throat, cough, and colds). In the United Kingdom, about 40% of antibiotics are given to patients with URTIs. Overuse of antibiotics is a major public health concern as it can lead to antimicrobial resistance. Several initiatives have been implemented to reduce the levels of antibiotic prescribing by UK clinicians. In primary care in England, these include development and implementation of the TARGET (Treat Antibiotics Responsibly, Guidance, Education, Tools) toolkit and treatment guidelines. The toolkit helps influence prescribers' and patients' personal attitudes, social norms, and perceived barriers for optimal antibiotic prescribing. In 2008, a treatment guideline was introduced in the United Kingdom for self-limiting respiratory tract infections. It recommends that no antibiotic- or a delayed antibiotic–prescribing strategy should be used in URTIs except in more severe cases. An editorial proposed that delayed antibiotic prescribing should be embraced in order to reduce antibiotic use in respiratory infections. A Cochrane review of 11 randomized trials including 3555 patients with a variety of respiratory infections concluded that delayed antibiotic prescribing reduced antibiotic use compared with immediate antibiotic prescribing and there were no differences between these strategies in symptom control and clinical complications. However, major clinical complications, including risk of infection-related hospital admission, were not evaluated. An observational study found that suppurative complications were rare with sore throat (1.2% in antibiotic users), with limited statistical power to detect a difference between the immediate and delayed antibiotic groups. The objectives of this study were to evaluate in 2 large cohorts the clinical safety of delayed antibiotic prescribing for URTIs and the targeting to patients with low risk of infection-related complications.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^116HBEpY]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Results

Between 2013 and 2015, 931 015 consultations for the 13 included indications led to antibiotic prescriptions. This subset — which focused on common conditions, but excluded chronic and recurrent cases, repeat prescriptions, and antibiotic prophylaxis — covered about 20% of total antibiotics being prescribed (for any condition) during the study period. The most common indications were acute cough and bronchitis (386 972, 41.6% of the included consultations), acute sore throat (239 231, 25.7%), acute otitis media (83 054, 8.9%), acute sinusitis (76 683, 8.2%), cellulitis (54 610, 5.9%), and acute cystitis (53 010, 5.7%). Durations of antibiotic treatment for the included indications showed poor guideline adherence for several indications (fig 1 and supplementary figs S1-S8).

Fig 1
Durations of antibiotic prescriptions for various indications

For all conditions grouped together, about 1.3 million days beyond the durations recommended by guidelines (table 2), which remained the same during 2013–15.

Table 2
Percentage of antibiotics with a duration exceeding guideline recommendations for all patients and antibiotics

COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Most of the excess days were due to respiratory indications (table 2). Antibiotic treatments for respiratory indications, including otitis media, accounted for more than two thirds of the total prescriptions considered, and 80% or more of these treatment courses exceeded guideline recommendations (table 2). A notable exception was acute sinusitis, for which only 9.6% (95% confidence interval 9.4% to 9.9%) of prescriptions were longer than the seven days recommended by the PHE 2013 guidance. For some indications, guidelines recommend longer durations for patients who are more unwell, such as those with pneumonia and a CRB65 (confusion, respiratory rate, blood pressure, 65 years and older) score of 1 or 2, or a range of appropriate durations (supplementary table S1). A much smaller proportion of patients received antibiotic prescriptions exceeding these upper boundaries (table 2 and supplementary table S3).

### Impact of an enterprise-wide ambulatory antibiotic stewardship bundle on patient satisfaction surveys [^116V3DCS]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

An association between antibiotic prescribing in upper respiratory infection and improved patient satisfaction has been documented, though data are mixed. Following implementation of a multifaceted antimicrobial stewardship bundle, no difference in patient satisfaction was observed between groups, despite a reduction in antibiotic prescribing from 28.3% to 14.1%.

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections during influenza seasons [^113n6h24]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are targets for improving antibiotic stewardship for outpatient acute respiratory infections?

Findings

Among 14 987 outpatients with acute respiratory infections enrolled in this cohort study during influenza seasons, 41% were prescribed antibiotics, 41% of whom had diagnoses for which antibiotics are not indicated, primarily viral upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis; 29% of patients with influenza confirmed through research testing were prescribed antibiotics. Among patients prescribed antibiotics, 38% with pharyngitis tested negative for group A streptococcus and 38% with sinusitis had symptoms for 3 days or less before the visit, suggesting antibiotic therapy was not required.

Meaning

Eliminating antibiotic treatment of viral upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis, improving influenza diagnosis and treatment, and reinforcing prescription guidelines for pharyngitis and sinusitis could improve outpatient antibiotic stewardship.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^115VbnNo]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Outstanding questions

It is hard to convince doctors not to prescribe antibiotics at all when they are in doubt or in the face of patient expectations. The limited to moderate impact in reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in primary care observed in antimicrobial stewardship programmes necessitates the exploration of new strategies. We need to change the message to healthcare professionals, policymakers, and educators regarding the idea of always completing a full course of antibiotics. Several systematic reviews show that shorter antibiotic courses are as effective as standard durations for most RTIs. Studies focused on reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and on tailoring antibiotic therapy, dose, and length of therapy to patients' needs, present a promising strategy in primary care. This can be encouraged based on randomised clinical trials indicating that patients most often recover within three days. In the end, we are not treating RTIs, we are treating patients with RTIs.

### Immediate versus delayed versus no antibiotics for respiratory infections [^1113PHUr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Concerns exist regarding antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) owing to adverse reactions, cost and antibacterial resistance. One proposed strategy to reduce antibiotic prescribing is to provide prescriptions, but to advise delay in antibiotic use with the expectation that symptoms will resolve first. This is an update of a Cochrane Review originally published in 2007, and updated in 2010, 2013 and 2017.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects on duration and/or severity of clinical outcomes (pain, malaise, fever, cough and rhinorrhoea), antibiotic use, antibiotic resistance and patient satisfaction of advising a delayed prescription of antibiotics in respiratory tract infections.

Search Methods

From May 2017 until 20 August 2022, this was a living systematic review with monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 20 August 2022. Due to the abundance of evidence supporting the review's key findings, it ceased being a living systematic review on 21 August 2022.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials involving participants of all ages with an RTI, where delayed antibiotics were compared to immediate or no antibiotics. We defined a delayed antibiotic as advice to delay the filling of an antibiotic prescription by at least 48 hours. We considered all RTIs regardless of whether antibiotics were recommended or not.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

For this 2022 update, we added one new trial enrolling 448 children (436 analysed) with uncomplicated acute RTIs. Overall, this review includes 12 studies with a total of 3968 participants, of which data from 3750 are available for analysis. These 12 studies involved acute RTIs including acute otitis media (three studies), streptococcal pharyngitis (three studies), cough (two studies), sore throat (one study), common cold (one study) and a variety of RTIs (two studies). Six studies involved only children, two only adults and four included both adults and children. Six studies were conducted in primary care, four in paediatric clinics and two in emergency departments. Studies were well reported and appeared to provide moderate-certainty evidence. Randomisation was not adequately described in two trials. Four trials blinded the outcome assessor, and three included blinding of participants and doctors. We conducted meta-analyses for pain, malaise, fever, adverse effects, antibiotic use and patient satisfaction. Cough (four studies): we found no differences amongst delayed, immediate and no prescribed antibiotics for clinical outcomes in any of the four studies. Sore throat (six studies): for the outcome of fever with sore throat, four of the six studies favoured immediate antibiotics, and two found no difference. For the outcome of pain related to sore throat, two studies favoured immediate antibiotics, and four found no difference. Two studies compared delayed antibiotics with no antibiotic for sore throat, and found no difference in clinical outcomes. Acute otitis media (four studies): two studies compared immediate with delayed antibiotics - one found no difference for fever, and the other favoured immediate antibiotics for pain and malaise severity on Day 3. Two studies compared delayed with no antibiotics: one found no difference for pain and fever severity on Day 3, and the other found no difference for the number of children with fever on Day 3. Common cold (two studies): neither study found differences for clinical outcomes between delayed and immediate antibiotic groups. One study found delayed antibiotics were probably favoured over no antibiotics for pain, fever and cough duration (moderate-certainty evidence).

Adverse Effects

there were either no differences for adverse effects or results may have favoured delayed over immediate antibiotics with no significant differences in complication rates (low-certainty evidence). Antibiotic use: delayed antibiotics probably resulted in a reduction in antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics (odds ratio (OR) 0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.07; 8 studies, 2257 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). However, a delayed antibiotic was probably more likely to result in reported antibiotic use than no antibiotics (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.69 to 3.75; 5 studies, 1529 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Patient satisfaction: patient satisfaction probably favoured delayed over no antibiotics (OR 1.45, 1.08 to 1.96; 5 studies, 1523 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was probably no difference in patient satisfaction between delayed and immediate antibiotics (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.29; 7 studies, 1927 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No studies evaluated antibiotic resistance. Reconsultation rates and use of alternative medicines were similar for delayed, immediate and no antibiotic strategies. In one of the four studies reporting use of alternative medicines, less paracetamol was used in the immediate group compared to the delayed group.

Authors' Conclusions

For many clinical outcomes, there were no differences between prescribing strategies. Symptoms for acute otitis media and sore throat were modestly improved by immediate antibiotics compared with delayed antibiotics. There were no differences in complication rates. Delaying prescribing did not result in significantly different levels of patient satisfaction compared with immediate provision of antibiotics (86% versus 91%; moderate-certainty evidence). However, delay was favoured over no antibiotics (87% versus 82%). Delayed antibiotics achieved lower rates of antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics (30% versus 93%). The strategy of no antibiotics further reduced antibiotic use compared to delaying prescription for antibiotics (13% versus 27%). Delayed antibiotics for people with acute respiratory infection reduced antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics, but was not shown to be different to no antibiotics in terms of symptom control and disease complications. Where clinicians feel it is safe not to prescribe antibiotics immediately for people with RTIs, no antibiotics with advice to return if symptoms do not resolve is likely to result in the least antibiotic use while maintaining similar patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes to delayed antibiotics. Where clinicians are not confident in not prescribing antibiotics, delayed antibiotics may be an acceptable compromise in place of immediate prescribing to significantly reduce unnecessary antibiotic use for RTIs, while maintaining patient safety and satisfaction levels. Further research into antibiotic prescribing strategies for RTIs may best be focused on identifying patient groups at high risk of disease complications, enhancing doctors' communication with patients to maintain satisfaction, ways of increasing doctors' confidence to not prescribe antibiotics for RTIs, and policy measures to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing for RTIs.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis [^115vXTiX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, resulting in about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline target patient is aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote appropriate use of ancillary tests that include nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. In creating this guideline the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions, and a clinician should diagnose ABRS when (a) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis are present 10 days or more beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or (b) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening), and 2) the management of ABRS should include an assessment of pain, with analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The panel made a recommendation against radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for acute rhinosinusitis, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected. The panel made recommendations that 1) if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin as first-line therapy for most adults, 2) if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications, 3) clinicians should distinguish chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms, 4) clinicians should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis for factors that modify management, such as allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, ciliary dyskinesia, and anatomic variation, 5) the clinician should corroborate a diagnosis and/or investigate for underlying causes of CRS and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, 6) the clinician should obtain computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 7) clinicians should educate/counsel patients with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis regarding control measures. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing viral rhinosinusitis, 2) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing ABRS, 3) observation without use of antibiotics is an option for selected adults with uncomplicated ABRS who have mild illness (mild pain and temperature < 38.3 degrees C or 101 degrees F) and assurance of follow-up, 4) the clinician may obtain nasal endoscopy in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 5) the clinician may obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis.

Disclaimer

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance for managing adults with rhinosinusitis. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Effect of a training and educational intervention for physicians and caregivers on antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections in children at primary care facilities in rural China: a cluster-randomised controlled trial [^111JPneT]. The Lancet: Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing contributes to the generation of drug resistance worldwide, and is particularly common in China. We assessed the effectiveness of an antimicrobial stewardship programme aiming to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in paediatric outpatients by targeting providers and caregivers in primary care hospitals in rural China.

Methods

We did a pragmatic, cluster-randomised controlled trial with a 6-month intervention period. Clusters were primary care township hospitals in two counties of Guangxi province in China, which were randomly allocated to the intervention group or the control group (in a 1:1 ratio in Rong county and in a 5:6 ratio in Liujiang county). Randomisation was stratified by county. Eligible participants were children aged 2–14 years who attended a township hospital as an outpatient and were given a prescription following a primary diagnosis of an upper respiratory tract infection. The intervention included clinician guidelines and training on appropriate prescribing, monthly prescribing peer-review meetings, and brief caregiver education. In hospitals allocated to the control group, usual care was provided, with antibiotics prescribed at the individual clinician's discretion. Patients were masked to their allocated treatment group but doctors were not. The primary outcome was the antibiotic prescription rate in children attending the hospitals, defined as the cluster-level proportion of prescriptions for upper respiratory tract infections in 2–14-year-old outpatients, issued during the final 3 months of the 6-month intervention period (endline), that included one or more antibiotics. The outcome was based on prescription records and analysed by modified intention-to-treat. This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN14340536.

Findings

We recruited all 25 eligible township hospitals in the two counties (14 hospitals in Rong county and 11 in Liujiang county), and randomly allocated 12 to the intervention group and 13 to the control group. We implemented the intervention in three internal pilot clusters between July 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2015, and in the remaining nine intervention clusters between Oct 1, 2016 and March 31, 2016. Between baseline (the 3 months before implementation of the intervention) and endline (the final 3 months of the 6-month intervention period) the antibiotic prescription rate at the individual level decreased from 82% (1936/2349) to 40% (943/2351) in the intervention group, and from 75% (1922/2548) to 70% (1782/2552) in the control group. After adjusting for the baseline antibiotic prescription rate, stratum (county), and potentially confounding patient and prescribing doctor covariates, this endline difference between the groups represented an intervention effect (absolute risk reduction in antibiotic prescribing) of -29% (95% CI -42 to -16; p = 0·0002).

Interpretation

In China's primary care setting, pragmatic interventions on antimicrobial stewardship targeting providers and caregivers substantially reduced prescribing of antibiotics for childhood upper respiratory tract infections.

### Antibiotics for the common cold [^112ykxLB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The common cold is considered to be caused by viruses and it has long been believed that antibiotics have no role in treating this condition. In many countries doctors will often prescribe antibiotics for the common cold in the belief that they may prevent secondary bacterial infection and in some cases to respond to patient demand. There is also increasing concern over the resistance of common bacteria to commonly used antibiotics. A crucial step in reducing the use of antibiotics for the common cold is to examine the evidence to see if there is any benefit or if there is benefit for some subgroups or symptom constellations.

Objectives

(1) To determine the efficacy of antibiotics in comparison with placebo in the treatment of acute upper respiratory tract infections (common colds) in terms of the proportion of patients in whom the clinical outcome was considered to be a reduction in general symptoms and specific nasopharyngeal symptoms. (2) To determine whether there are significant adverse outcomes associated with antibiotic therapy for patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute upper respiratory tract infection.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Family Medicine Database, and reference lists of articles, and we contacted principal investigators. The most recent search was in May 2001 SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo in acute upper respiratory tract infections with less than 7 days of symptoms

Data Collection and Analysis

Both reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

All analyses used fixed effects unless otherwise stated Main results: Nine trials involving 2249 (2157 analysed) people aged between two months and 79 years (and adults with no upper age limit) years were included. The overall quality of the included trials was variable. People receiving antibiotics did not do better in terms of lack of cure or persistence of symptoms than those on placebo (odds ratio 0.8, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.59 to 1.08). Only one study Taylor et al (1977) specifically reported persistence of clear rhinitis with a small benefit to those on antibiotics. Two studies found a significant benefit for antibiotics compared with placebo for runny nose (clear) odds ratio 0.42 (0.22–0.78). Two studies also found a significant benefit in patients with sore throat odds ratio 0.27 95% CI (0.10–0.74). Only one study reported work time lost with 22% of those on antibiotic treatment and 25% of those on placebo but this was not significant. Adult patients treated with antibiotics had a significant increase in adverse effects (odds ratio 3.6 95% CI 2.21 to 5.89) while there was no significant increase in children odds ratio 0.90 95% CI (0.44–1.82).

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is not enough evidence of important benefits from the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections with antibiotics to warrant their routine use in children or adults and there is a significant increase in adverse effects associated with antibiotic use in adult patients.

### Procalcitonin testing to guide antibiotic therapy in acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections [^113ccWbX]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Is the use of procalcitonin for guiding antibiotic decisions in patients with acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with usual care?

Bottom Line

Among patients with varying types and severity of acute respiratory infection, using procalcitonin to guide decisions about antibiotics is associated with lower rates of antibiotic exposure, antibiotic-related adverse effects, and mortality.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^112tcK7A]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Primary care antimicrobial stewardship programs have limited success in reducing antibiotic use, prompting the search for new strategies. Convincing general practitioners to resist antibiotic prescription amid uncertainty or patient demands usually poses a significant challenge. Despite common practice, standard durations for common infections lack support from clinical studies. Contrary to common belief, extending antibiotic treatment beyond the resolution of symptoms does not seem to prevent or reduce antimicrobial resistance. Shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy has shown to be effective in mitigating the spread of resistance, particularly in cases of pneumonia. Recent hospital randomised trials suggest that ending antibiotic courses by day three for most lower respiratory tract infections is effective and safe. While community studies are scarce, it is likely that these shorter, tailored courses to meet patients' needs would also be effective and safe in primary care. Therefore, primary care studies should investigate the outcomes of advising patients to discontinue antibiotic treatment upon symptom resolution. Implementing patient-centred, customised treatment durations, rather than fixed courses, is crucial for meeting individual patient needs.

### Desire for antibiotics and antibiotic prescribing for adults with upper respiratory tract infections [^113Veh33]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Prior studies have shown that 60% to 75% of adults with upper respiratory tract infections want antibiotics. More recent research indicates declines in antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections. To investigate whether there has been a comparable decrease in patients' desire for antibiotics, we measured the proportion of adults with upper respiratory tract infections who wanted antibiotics in the winter of 2001–2002. We also sought to identify factors independently associated with wanting antibiotics and antibiotic prescribing.

Design

Prospective survey of adults with upper respiratory tract infections prior to visiting an acute care clinic from November 2001 to February 2002.

Measurements and Main Results

Thirty-nine percent of 310 patients wanted antibiotics. Many patients wanted relief from symptoms (43%) or pain (24%) and many patients expected to receive a diagnosis (49%) or reassurance during the visit (13%). In multivariable modeling, independent predictors of wanting antibiotics were prior antibiotic use (odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 to 4.7) and current smoking (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.3 to 7.3). Physicians prescribed antibiotics to 46% of patients who wanted antibiotics and 29% of patients who did not want antibiotics (P = .01). In multivariable modeling, wanting antibiotics was an independent predictor of antibiotic prescribing (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.4).

Conclusions

Only 39% of adults seeking care for upper respiratory tract infections wanted antibiotics, less than in previous studies. In continuing efforts to break the cycle of inappropriate antibiotic use, physicians should not assume that most patients with upper respiratory tract infections want antibiotics.

### The safety of delayed versus immediate antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections [^1121CL7t]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical safety of delayed antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), which is recommended in treatment guidelines for less severe cases.

Methods

Two population-based cohort studies used the English Clinical Practice Research Databank and Welsh Secure Anonymized Information Linkage, containing electronic health records from primary care linked to hospital admission records. Patients with URTI and prescriptions of amoxicillin, clarithromycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, or phenoxymethylpenicillin were identified. Patients were stratified according to delayed and immediate prescribing relative to URTI diagnosis. Outcome of interest was infection-related hospital admission after 30 days.

Results

The population included 1.82 million patients with an URTI and antibiotic prescription; 91.7% had an antibiotic at URTI diagnosis date (immediate) and 8.3% had URTI diagnosis in 1–30 days before (delayed). Delayed antibiotic prescribing was associated with a 52% increased risk of infection-related hospital admissions (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.43–1.62). The probability of delayed antibiotic prescribing was unrelated to predicted risks of hospital admission. Analyses of the number needed to harm showed considerable variability across different patient groups (median with delayed antibiotic prescribing, 1357; 2.5% percentile, 295; 97.5% percentile, 3366).

Conclusions

This is the first large population-based study examining the safety of delayed antibiotic prescribing. Waiting to treat URTI was associated with increased risk of hospital admission, although delayed antibiotic prescribing was used similarly between high- and low-risk patients. There is a need to better target delayed antibiotic prescribing to URTI patients with lower risks of complications.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of acute respiratory tract infections in adults: background, specific aims, and methods [^111wvbPt]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The need to decrease excess antibiotic use in ambulatory practice has been fueled by the epidemic increase in antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The majority of antibiotics prescribed to adults in ambulatory practice in the United States are for acute sinusitis, acute pharyngitis, acute bronchitis, and nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections (including the common cold). For each of these conditions — especially colds, nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections, and acute bronchitis (for which routine antibiotic treatment is not recommended) — a large proportion of the antibiotics prescribed are unlikely to provide clinical benefit to patients. Because decreasing community use of antibiotics is an important strategy for combating the increase in community-acquired antibiotic-resistant infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a panel of physicians representing the disciplines of internal medicine, family medicine, emergency medicine, and infectious diseases to develop a series of "Principles of Appropriate Antibiotic Use for Treatment of Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Adults". These principles provide evidence-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment of adults with acute respiratory illnesses. This paper describes the background and specific aims of and methods used to develop these principles. The goal of the principles is to provide clinicians with practical strategies for limiting antibiotic use to the patients who are most likely to benefit from it. These principles should be used in conjunction with effective patient educational campaigns and enhancements to the health care delivery system that facilitate nonantibiotic treatment of the conditions in question.

### Influencing antibiotic prescribing by prescriber feedback and management guidelines: a 5-year follow-up [^114huZry]. Family Practice (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The extent of use of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) prompted a previous study of an educational intervention based on prescriber feedback and management guidelines. This study demonstrated a reduction in antibiotic prescribing for URTI and a more appropriate choice of antibiotic for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis. There are few long-term follow-up studies of educational programmes of this kind.

Objectives

This follow-up study aimed to examine if the reduction in antibiotic prescribing observed in the intervention group of the original study remained present after 5 years, and how the prescribing behaviour of the GPs involved in the follow-up differed from a large national survey of GP prescribing.

Methods

Attempts were made to contact the 157 GPs involved in the original study. Of these, 121 were both located and currently working in general practice. Ninety-six consented to take part and, of these, 79 completed a morbidity and treatment survey of 100 patient encounters (response rate 65.3%).

Results

The intervention group (n = 37) maintained their pattern of prescribing of antibiotics for URTI and choice of antibiotic for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis, with no significant change between the completion of the original study and the 5-year follow-up. The control group (n = 42) showed a downward trend in antibiotic prescribing for URTI, with the effect that no significant differences remained between groups at the 5-year follow-up. At the 5-year follow-up, both groups prescribed significantly fewer antibiotics for URTI and showed greater adherence to prescribing guidelines for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis than participants in a large national GP survey (n = 984).

Conclusion

This study demonstrated maintenance of prescribing behaviour in the intervention group in the long term. However, the changes in prescribing observed in the control group and the power limitations of the study make it uncertain whether this was the result of a sustained effect of the educational intervention. The differences in both groups from the large national GP survey suggest that other influences on prescribing (such as participation in vocational training for general practice) were also having an important effect.

Infections: bacterial, viral, and mycobacterial — tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors carry an increased infection risk, with upper respiratory tract infections most common, and rare opportunistic infections reported more often with infliximab or adalimumab than with etanercept; careful monitoring and early evaluation is critical. In the event of an infection requiring antibiotics, "the TNF inhibitor should be withheld" and for more serious or opportunistic infections "the TNF inhibitor should be discontinued", and "treatment with TNF inhibitors should be avoided if possible in patients with chronic, serious, or recurring infections".
