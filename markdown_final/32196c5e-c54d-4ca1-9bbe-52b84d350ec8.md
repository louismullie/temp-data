## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage endometriomas across common scenarios, with explicit self-verification and stepwise thinking. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and risk stratification, including symptoms, reproductive goals, age, and ovarian reserve. Then, I should verify imaging and diagnostic strategy and how that guides whether surgery is indicated. Next, I will consider fertility-sparing management in those pursuing pregnancy versus symptom-control strategies in those not pursuing pregnancy, followed by a detailed surgical approach and alternatives. After that, I should review postoperative recurrence prevention and follow-up, special populations, and finally align choices with high-quality guidelines to synthesize a concise recommendation by scenario, ensuring I double-check conflicting evidence along the way [^115Z5oaN] [^1175sbab] [^113CRM7G].

> Let me first confirm the clinical assessment pillars because they anchor everything: reproductive goals and timeline, pain phenotype and severity, age and ovarian reserve markers, cyst size and laterality, prior surgeries, and risk factors for malignancy or torsion, since these drive whether to observe, treat medically, or operate and which operation to choose [^116CFuFc] [^113MDpHX].

> I need to check the diagnostic strategy next; transvaginal ultrasound with appropriate pattern recognition is first-line and can confidently diagnose typical endometriomas, reserving MRI for atypical or indeterminate cases or suspected deep disease, while remembering that histology remains the definitive diagnostic gold standard if surgery is performed [^116djLAc] [^113Xahfr] [^1114Vaox].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about indications for surgery; I should confirm thresholds that trigger intervention versus observation: large or growing cysts, persistent pain refractory to medical therapy, concern for malignancy, impaired access to follicles for oocyte retrieval, torsion risk, and recurrent disease despite medical therapy, while asymptomatic small lesions under roughly 5 cm may reasonably be observed with serial imaging in selected patients [^115Z5oaN] [^114d7yzc] [^116CFuFc].

> Now, for patients pursuing fertility, I will examine the delicate balance between surgical and non-surgical pathways; routine surgery before IVF does not improve live birth rates and can reduce ovarian response, so expectant management or proceeding to IVF is often appropriate unless pain, access issues, or large size mandate intervention, in which case excisional cystectomy is preferred over drainage or ablation, and preoperative medical suppression may optimize planes and reduce blood loss, while postoperative hormonal suppression is deferred if pregnancy is planned imminently [^113MDpHX] [^112NXjBy] [^112gBv8L] [^111j2fGG].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit with excision versus ablation; randomized data and contemporary systematic reviews consistently show excision reduces recurrence of cyst and pain and need for reoperation, with possible improvement in spontaneous pregnancy, though benefits on ART outcomes are uncertain, which reinforces caution about routine surgery solely to enhance IVF success [^112qdz8s] [^116NmDbu] [^1116iKLz].

> For patients not currently pursuing pregnancy, I should confirm that symptom control is prioritized and medical therapy is first-line; combined hormonal contraceptives, progestins, and GnRH analogs reduce pain and can shrink cysts, with ESHRE endorsing these options and recommending continuous regimens for dysmenorrhea, while surgery is reserved for refractory symptoms or diagnostic uncertainty [^114KkaoY] [^111CDXdg] [^112gBv8L].

> I will now examine surgical technique and fertility-sparing principles; laparoscopy is preferred over laparotomy, cystectomy is favored over drainage or ablation when feasible to lower recurrence, and meticulous hemostasis with suture or hemostatic agents rather than prolonged electrosurgery may better preserve ovarian reserve, with CO2 laser or plasma energy offering precise, tissue-sparing ablation when planes are obliterated or in selected large cysts [^1114Vaox] [^112qdz8s] [^113KHuFC].

> But wait, what if the cyst is very large or densely adherent; I should double-check whether a two-step approach with sclerotherapy followed by laser ablation preserves ovarian tissue better, and while emerging data suggest comparable recurrence with potentially less ovarian trauma, I need to emphasize that high-quality evidence remains limited and technique selection should be individualized and expert-dependent [^111EGkgb] [^116kDCUW].

> Next, I should review recurrence prevention; endometriomas recur in roughly 30–50% over time, with risk higher after ablation, with bilateral disease, and when postoperative ovulation is not suppressed, so initiating long-term hormonal suppression after surgery reduces recurrence and is guideline-supported in those not pursuing immediate pregnancy [^114ryJqD] [^111j2fGG].

> I need to ensure postoperative follow-up is structured; baseline and interval assessment of symptoms, a pelvic exam, and transvaginal ultrasound at 6–12 months with periodic checks thereafter help detect recurrence early, and I should confirm that surveillance intensity is tailored to symptoms, prior disease burden, and adherence to suppression [^notfound].

> Let me consider special populations; in adolescents and young adults, I should confirm a conservative approach with maximal ovarian preservation and judicious use of medical therapy, while in those with diminished ovarian reserve or bilateral disease I should avoid surgery whenever possible to protect follicular pool and consider oocyte cryopreservation if surgery is unavoidable or recurrence risk is high [^111x7jaD] [^113CRM7G] [^1176zTLw].

> I should double-check the malignancy dimension; although malignant transformation is rare, clear cell and endometrioid carcinomas are overrepresented in endometriosis, and for patients who have completed childbearing or have complex, recurrent, or atypical lesions, discussing cancer risk reduction with bilateral salpingectomy and in select cases oophorectomy is appropriate alongside counseling that cystectomy alone does not eliminate cancer risk [^116SANr1] [^11482ve8].

> Let me align with guidelines to synthesize recommendations; ESHRE favors cystectomy over drainage and coagulation, ACOG advises surgery for large, symptomatic, or growing masses with surveillance otherwise, and SOGC stresses counseling on ovarian reserve risk with endometrioma surgery, which together reinforce individualized, fertility-aware decision-making rather than a one-size-fits-all approach [^1175sbab] [^115Z5oaN] [^113CRM7G].

> Putting this together, I should confirm a concise clinical algorithm: assess symptoms, fertility goals, and ovarian reserve; use ultrasound to diagnose and MRI when needed; observe small asymptomatic cysts with low-risk features; for those pursuing pregnancy, avoid routine pre-IVF surgery unless pain, access, or size warrant it, and if surgery is needed choose excision with fertility-sparing technique; for those not pursuing pregnancy, start medical suppression and reserve surgery for refractory symptoms; after any surgery, provide long-term hormonal suppression and structured surveillance to mitigate recurrence, while continually revisiting reproductive plans and ovarian reserve at each visit [^115Z5oaN] [^113MDpHX] [^111j2fGG].

Endometriomas are **ovarian cysts filled with old blood** ("chocolate cysts") that arise from endometriosis [^112XdVLr]. They are best diagnosed by **transvaginal ultrasound** [^116WWVfW] showing homogeneous ground-glass echogenicity with no internal vascularity, with MRI reserved for atypical cases or surgical planning [^116djLAc]. Management is individualized: **medical therapy** (combined hormonal contraceptives, progestins, or GnRH analogs) is first-line for symptom control and cyst shrinkage, but rarely resolves lesions [^112gBv8L]; **surgery** (laparoscopic cystectomy) is indicated for persistent pain, infertility, or cysts > 4–5 cm, with a focus on ovarian reserve preservation [^114d7yzc] [^1176zTLw]. Excision reduces recurrence and pain more than drainage/ablation [^116NmDbu], but can diminish ovarian reserve, especially with electrosurgery or bilateral disease [^1114Vaox]. Recurrence is common (30–50%) and mitigated by postoperative hormonal suppression [^114ryJqD]; fertility-sparing strategies, including oocyte cryopreservation, should be considered in women of reproductive age [^1176zTLw].

---

## Pathophysiology

Two main mechanisms are proposed: **endometriotic invasion or metaplasia** — invasion or metaplasia of functional ovarian cysts with bleeding into the ovarian cortex [^112XdVLr] — and **retrograde menstruation** — reflux of endometrial tissue into the pelvis with implantation on the ovary [^113Qs3mc]. Both lead to **chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and adhesions** that impair ovarian function and fertility [^11482ve8].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Pelvic pain**: Dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, chronic pelvic pain [^116SJhqY].
- **Infertility**: Associated with subfertility in 30–50% of women with endometriosis [^116yyRb1].
- **Adnexal mass**: Palpable or incidentally found on imaging [^116ovXRD].
- **Asymptomatic**: Common, especially with small cysts [^116CFuFc].

---

## Diagnostic methods

### Imaging

- **Transvaginal ultrasound**: First-line; homogeneous ground-glass echogenicity, no internal vascularity [^116WWVfW].
- **MRI**: Problem-solving for atypical lesions or surgical planning [^116djLAc].
- **O-RADS**: Risk stratification system for adnexal lesions [^116djLAc].

---

### Laboratory tests

AMH may be reduced, reflecting diminished ovarian reserve [^113MDpHX]; **CA-125** can be elevated but is nonspecific [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Medical management

Medical therapy aims to **suppress ovulation and reduce lesion activity**, thereby shrinking cysts and controlling pain, but it rarely leads to cyst resolution [^112gBv8L]. Combined hormonal contraceptives reduce pain and cyst size; **progestins** (including norethindrone, dienogest) reduce pain and cyst size [^116aMqDJ]; **GnRH agonists/antagonists** are second-line for refractory pain [^116zB7fw] [^111ozreq].

---

### Surgical management

- **Indications**: Persistent pain, infertility, cysts > 4–5 cm, suspected malignancy [^114d7yzc] [^115Z5oaN].
- **Techniques**: Laparoscopic cystectomy (excision) is preferred over drainage/ablation due to lower recurrence and better pain control [^116NmDbu].
- **Risks**: Reduced ovarian reserve, especially with electrosurgery or bilateral disease [^1114Vaox] [^112eoYBP].

---

## Impact on fertility

Endometriomas **impair fertility** via inflammation, oxidative stress, and mechanical distortion of the ovary [^113MDpHX]. Excision can improve spontaneous pregnancy rates but may reduce ovarian reserve; IVF outcomes are generally not improved by pre-IVF cystectomy, except for access issues [^113MDpHX] [^1176zTLw]. Management should be individualized based on age, ovarian reserve, and reproductive goals [^11164iEv].

---

## Recurrence and long-term outcomes

Recurrence is common (30–50%) and is influenced by **younger age, bilateral disease, ablation (vs excision), and lack of postoperative suppression** [^114ryJqD]. Long-term outcomes include chronic pain, infertility, and a small but increased risk of ovarian cancer (clear cell, endometrioid) [^116SANr1].

---

## Current research and controversies

Controversies include the **role of surgery before IVF** (generally not recommended unless for access), the **optimal surgical technique** (excision vs energy-based ablation) [^113KHuFC], and the **value of long-term hormonal suppression** to prevent recurrence [^111j2fGG]. Emerging therapies include sclerotherapy and two-step approaches to preserve ovarian reserve [^111EGkgb].

---

Endometriomas are common ovarian cysts from endometriosis, best diagnosed by ultrasound and managed with **individualized medical or surgical care** [^11482ve8]. Excision reduces recurrence but can impair ovarian reserve; recurrence is common, so long-term suppression and fertility-sparing planning are key [^114ryJqD].

### Managing endometrioma to optimize future fertility [^1176zTLw]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

The management of endometriomas in women wishing to preserve their fertility is complex. While surgery can help to achieve pregnancy in some, it may also have a detrimental effect on a woman's ovarian reserve. The present article reviews the impact of endometriomas on fertility and the different management approaches that should be considered in women who wish to preserve their fertility. This study also reviews the role of assisted reproduction in the setting of endometriomas, and the evolving role of oocyte cryopreservation for this benign but progressive disease. Using evidence from the latest guidelines and major publications, we emphasize the need to consider the woman's future fertility when navigating the diverse range of management strategies available, and outline an evidence-based framework to help facilitate fertility-friendly discussion, counseling and management of this complex disease.

### Pathophysiology and clinical implications of ovarian endometriomas [^11482ve8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Endometriomas affect up to 6% of patients with ovaries and carry risks of chronic pain, infertility, pregnancy complications, and potential for malignant transformation. Two pathways of endometrioma formation have been proposed, endometriotic invasion or metaplasia of preexisting functional ovarian cysts and bleeding of ovarian endometriotic implants directly into the ovarian cortex, that may account for the phenotypic variability observed among endometriomas. Future research evaluating the recapitulation of these mechanisms at a molecular level is anticipated to shed light on the genesis of endometriomas, with likely implications for the prevention of endometrioma formation. Whether endometriomas of different phenotypes have identifiably disparate effects on fertility or risk of malignancy is an important clinical question that has not been fully explored.

Medical management may shrink endometrioma size but rarely leads to cyst resolution and forgoes the opportunity for pathologic diagnosis; therefore, surgical management is often indicated for purposes of diagnosis and symptom management. Benefits of surgery for fertility optimization and cancer risk reduction have been suggested by retrospective studies. The precise role of surgery for these goals is yet to be defined, particularly with regard to a stratification of benefit by cyst phenotype or size. Moving forward, continued attention to cyst phenotype or size in the design of studies on the management and implications of endometriomas will continue to better inform ability to make evidence-based clinical recommendations tailored to patients' unique clinical presentations.

TREATMENT INDICATIONS

Goals of treatment for endometrioma include relieving symptoms, ruling out malignancy, treating or preventing ovarian torsion, improving fertility outcomes, preserving ovarian hormonal function, and minimizing recurrence. Because ovarian endometriomas are rarely isolated and more commonly occur concurrently with nonovarian endometriosis, surgical excision of both ovarian and nonovarian lesions is often indicated. In some circumstances, surveillance may be appropriate for asymptomatic patients who are evaluated to be at low risk for torsion or malignancy on the basis of mass size (generally less than 5 cm) and appearance and patient characteristics, including age and family history.

### Endometriosis and infertility: a committee opinion [^114d7yzc]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Endometrioma management before assisted reproduction indicates that for women with an asymptomatic endometrioma planning IVF/ICSI, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that removal will improve IVF success rates; however, if the endometrioma is large (> 4 cm), surgery should be considered to confirm the diagnosis histologically, improve access to follicles during oocyte retrieval, and possibly improve ovarian response. Surgical management should include resection or ablation, rather than drainage, with resection preferred, and patients should be informed that extensive ovarian surgery could compromise ovarian function and diminish the response to ovarian stimulation.

### Introduction: management of endometriosis: moving toward a problem-oriented and patient-centered approach [^1164mTCn]. Fertility and Sterility (2015). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a protean disease, and its manifestations, associated clinical problems, and possible treatments are numerous. Deep endometriosis that infiltrates multiple pelvic organs should be considered the most severe endometriotic form that poses the most difficult therapeutic uncertainties in both infertility and pelvic pain symptoms limiting quality of life. The available evidence demonstrates that endometriosis is not only a gynecologic disorder but, contrary to previous belief, its impact extends into pregnancy, delivery, and the post-partum period. The old clinical tenet that pregnancy is a cure for endometriosis may be revealed as fallacious. Safe and effective modalities to reduce the risk of the recurrence of symptoms and lesions after conservative surgery for endometriosis are now available. These treatment options should be offered post-operatively to women not immediately seeking conception. Endometriosis is associated with a moderate increase in ovarian cancer risk. However, as there are no definitive demonstrations that endometriosis constitutes per se a pre-neoplastic condition, it seems currently unwise to set-up a screening program to detect undiagnosed endometriosis in asymptomatic women. Endometriosis is not a cancer; therefore a paradigm shift from treatment of lesions to treatment of symptoms is warranted. Management should be shaped on the main clinical problem, taking into consideration a woman's preferences and priorities. Quantitative information should be provided to describe the potential benefits, potential harms, and costs of each treatment alternative. Counseling should be complete and transparent, and the duty of the caring gynecologist is to inform the woman on the pros and cons of each option and support her in the shared decision-making process. The physician should be able to explain in detail all the available treatments, and not only those that the physician prefers or is able to offer.

Regarding surgical interventions for endometriosis, more specifically with respect to excision of endometrioma, ACOG 2016 guidelines recommend to perform surgical intervention for suspected endometrioma if the mass is large, symptomatic, or growing in size on serial imaging or if malignancy is suspected. Obtain follow-up surveillance if managed expectantly.

### Current strategies for endometriosis management [^1137Wa6q]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a common gynecologic disorder that persists throughout the reproductive years. Although endometriosis is a surgical diagnosis, medical management with ovarian suppression remains the mainstay of long-term management with superimposed surgical intervention when needed. The goal of surgery should be excision or ablation of all visible disease to minimize risk of recurrence and need for repeat surgeries. When infertility is the presenting symptom, surgical therapy in addition to assisted reproductive technology can improve chances of conception; however, the treatment approach depends on stage of disease and other patient characteristics that affect fecundity.

### Clinical management of endometriosis [^115dnnW3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a common and challenging condition of reproductive-aged women that carries a high individual and societal cost. The many molecular dissimilarities between endometriosis lesions and eutopic endometrium create difficulties in the development of new drug therapies and treatments. Surgery remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis, but it must be weighed against the risks of surgical morbidity and potential decreases in ovarian reserve, especially in the case of endometriomas. Safe and effective surgical techniques are discussed within this article for various presentations of endometriosis. Medical therapy is suppressive rather than curative, and regimens that are long-term and affordable with minimal side effects are recommended. Recurrences are common and often rapid when medical therapy is discontinued. Endometriosis in the setting of infertility is reviewed and appropriate management is discussed, including when and whether surgery is warranted in this at-risk population. In patients with chronic pain, central sensitization and myofascial pain are integral components of a multidisciplinary approach. Endometriosis is associated with an increased risk of epithelial ovarian cancer; however, the risk is low and currently no preventive screening is recommended. Hormone therapy for symptomatic women with postsurgical menopause should not be delayed as a result of concerns for malignancy or recurrence of endometriosis.

### Pathophysiology and clinical implications of ovarian endometriomas [^112XdVLr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ovarian endometriomas affect many patients with endometriosis and have significant effects on quality of life, fertility, and risk of malignancy. Endometriomas range from small (1–3 cm), densely fibrotic cysts to large (20 cm or greater) cysts with varying degrees of fibrosis. Endometriomas are hypothesized to form from endometriotic invasion or metaplasia of functional cysts or alternatively from ovarian surface endometriosis that bleeds into the ovarian cortex. Different mechanisms of endometrioma formation may help explain the phenotypic variability observed among endometriomas. Laparoscopic surgery is the preferred first-line modality of diagnosis and treatment of endometriomas. Ovarian cystectomy is preferred over cyst ablation or sclerotherapy for enabling pathologic diagnosis, improving symptoms, preventing recurrence, and optimizing fertility outcomes. Cystectomy for small, densely adherent endometriomas is made challenging by dense fibrosis of the cyst capsule obliterating the plane with normal ovarian cortex, whereas cystectomy for large endometriomas can carry unique challenges as a result of adhesions between the cyst and pelvic structures. Preoperative and postoperative hormonal suppression can improve operative outcomes and decrease the risk of endometrioma recurrence. Whether the optimal management, fertility consequences, and malignant potential of endometriomas vary on the basis of size and phenotype remains to be fully explored.

### Excisional surgery versus ablative surgery for ovarian endometriomata [^112qdz8s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Endometriomata are endometriotic deposits within the ovary. The surgical management of these blood filled cysts is controversial. The laparoscopic approach to the management of endometriomata is favoured for as it offers the advantage of a shorter hospital stay, faster patient recovery and decreased hospital costs. Currently the commonest procedures for the treatment of ovarian endometriomata are either excision of the cyst capsule or drainage and electrocoagulation of the cyst wall.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to determine the most effective technique of treating an ovarian endometrioma; either excision of the cyst capsule or drainage and electrocoagulation of the cyst wall, with regard to relief of pain, recurrence of the endometrioma, recurrence of symptoms and the subsequent spontaneous pregnancy rate.

Search Strategy

The reviewers searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group specialised register of trials (searched 15 Nov 2004), the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (1966-Nov 2004), EMBASE (1980- Nov 2004) and reference lists of articles, the handsearching of relevant journals and conference proceedings and by contacting leaders in the field of endoscopic surgery throughout the world.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of excision of the cyst capsule versus drainage and electrocoagulation of the cyst in the management of ovarian endometriomata.

Data Collection and Analysis

Reviewers assessed eligibility and trial quality.

Main Results

No randomised studies of the management of endometriomata by laparotomy were found. Two randomised studies of the laparoscopic management of ovarian endometriomata of greater than 3cm in size were included. Laparoscopic excision of the cyst wall of the endometrioma was associated with a reduced rate of recurrence of the endometrioma (OR 0.41 CI 0.18–0.93), reduced requirement for further surgery (OR 0.21 CI 0.05–0.79), reduced recurrence rate of the symptoms of dysmenorrhoea (OR 0.15 CI 0.06–0.38), dyspareunia OR 0.08 CI 0.01–0.51) and non-menstrual pelvic pain (OR 0.10 CI 0.02–0.56). It was also associated with a subsequent increased rate of spontaneous pregnancy women who had documented prior sub-fertility (OR 5.21 CI 2.04–13.29).

Authors' Conclusions

There is some evidence that excisional surgery for endometriomata provides for a more favourable outcome than drainage and ablation, with regard to the recurrence of the endometrioma, recurrence of symptoms and subsequent spontaneous pregnancy in women who were previously subfertile. Consequently this approach should be the favoured surgical approach. However we found no data as to the effect of either approach in women who subsequently undergo assisted reproductive techniques.

### Pathophysiology and clinical implications of ovarian endometriomas [^114ryJqD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Recurrence of endometrioma after surgical management is on the order of 30–50%. – Risk factors for cyst recurrence include younger age, prior treatment of endometriosis, larger cyst size, bilateral ovarian involvement, ablation or sclerotherapy rather than cystectomy, and overall burden of endometriosis at surgery. Ovulation inhibition, through either postoperative hormonal treatment or pregnancy, has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrence, and medical ovulation inhibition should be considered in patients who do not desire immediate pregnancy.–

### Relationship between ovarian cysts and infertility: what surgery and when? [^117E4zpo]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

The relationship between ovarian cysts and infertility is a subject of debate, mainly because it is difficult to determine the real impact of the cyst and its treatment on later fertility. For a long time it was hoped that surgical treatment could prevent potential complications (such as rupture or malignancy). For presumed benign ovarian tumors, fertility sparing should be the main concern. The goal of this survey of current knowledge on the subject is to thoroughly explore the potential relationship between cysts, their treatment, and infertility. Our study is based on a review of the literature dealing with the epidemiology of ovarian cysts and the effects of their surgical management in relation to infertility. Analysis of the epidemiologic data, drawn mainly from comparative studies and cohorts, shows that the role of cysts in infertility is controversial and that the effects of surgical treatment are often more harmful than the cyst itself to the ovarian reserve. Surgery does not seem to improve pregnancy rates. When a surgical option is nonetheless chosen, a conservative laparoscopic approach is more suitable. Besides excision, sclerotherapy and plasma vaporization are promising, offering a greater preservation of the ovarian parenchyma, especially in endometriomas. These techniques must be better defined. The context of the infertility is essential, and surgeons and specialists in reproductive medicine should decide management jointly.

Endometriomata are endometriotic deposits within the ovary. The surgical management of these blood filled cysts is controversial. The laparoscopic approach to the management of endometriomata is favoured over a laparotomy approach as it offers the advantage of a shorter hospital stay, faster patient recovery and decreased hospital costs.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to determine the most effective technique of treating an ovarian endometrioma; either excision of the cyst capsule or drainage and electrocoagulation of the cyst wall. The end-points assessed were the relief of pain, recurrence of the endometrioma, recurrence of symptoms and in women desiring to conceive the subsequent pregnancy rate, either spontaneous or as part of fertility treatment.

Search Strategy

The reviewers searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group specialised register of trials (searched 3rd March 2007), the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2007), MEDLINE (1966-August 2007), EMBASE (1980- March 2007) and reference lists of articles, the handsearching of relevant journals and conference proceedings and by contacting leaders in the field of endoscopic surgery throughout the world. The Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL and CENTRAL.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of excision of the cyst capsule versus drainage and electrocoagulation of the cyst in the management of ovarian endometriomata.

Data Collection and Analysis

Reviewers assessed eligibility and trial quality.

Main Results

No randomised studies of the management of endometriomata by laparotomy were found. Two randomised studies of the laparoscopic management of ovarian endometriomata of greater than 3cm in size, for the primary symptom of pain were included. Laparoscopic excision of the cyst wall of the endometrioma was associated with a reduced recurrence rate of the symptoms of dysmenorrhea (OR 0.15 CI 0.06–0.38), dyspareunia (OR 0.08 CI 0.01–0.51) and non-menstrual pelvic pain (OR 0.10 CI 0.02–0.56), a reduced rate of recurrence of the endometrioma (OR 0.41 CI 0.18–0.93) and with a reduced requirement for further surgery (OR 0.21 CI 0.05–0.79) than surgery to ablate the endometrioma. For those women subsequently attempting to conceive it was also associated with a subsequent increased spontaneous pregnancy rate in women who had documented prior sub-fertility (OR 5.21 CI 2.04–13.29). A further randomised study was identified that demonstrated an increased ovarian follicular response to gonadotrophin stimulation for women who had undergone excsional surgery when compared to ablative surgery (WMD 0.6 CI 0.04–1.16). There is insufficient evidence to favour excisional surgery over ablative surgery with respect to the chance of pregnancy after controlled ovarian stimulation and intra-uterine insemination (OR 1.40 CI 0.47–4.15).

Authors' Conclusions

There is good evidence that excisional surgery for endometriomata provides for a more favourable outcome than drainage and ablation with regard to the recurrence of the endometrioma, recurrence of pain symptoms, and in women who were previously subfertile, subsequent spontaneous pregnancy. Consequently this approach should be the favoured surgical approach. However in women who may subsequently may undergo fertility treatment insufficient evidence exists to determine the favoured surgical approach.

MEDICAL MANAGEMENT

Hormonal treatment of endometriomas may be associated with cyst size reduction and symptom improvement but is unlikely to impart cyst resolution. – A recent meta-analysis has comprehensively reviewed the effect of medical management on ovarian endometrioma size and concluded that dienogest, oral contraceptive pills, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, norethindrone acetate, and danazol have all been shown to reduce cyst diameter by a mean of 0.6–1.95 cm, with oral contraceptive pills having been studied most extensively and danazol showing the largest mean reduction in cyst size. Medical management alone foregoes the opportunity for histologic diagnosis, and surgery is generally preferred for both diagnosis and treatment. However, medical therapy before surgery can provide symptom management and improve operative outcomes. For most patients, we recommend hormonal suppressive therapy for at least 4–8 weeks before surgery to prevent ovulation and corpus luteum formation and to decrease risks of bleeding and ovarian damage during cystectomy.

### Excisional surgery versus ablative surgery for ovarian endometrioma [^116NmDbu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Endometrioma are endometriotic deposits within the ovary. Laparoscopic management of endometriomas is associated with shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, and decreased hospital costs compared with laparotomy. The previous version of this systematic review (2008), including randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical interventions for endometrioma, concluded that laparoscopic cystectomy (excision) was preferable to drainage and ablation of endometrioma. We aimed to update the evidence comparing excision with drainage and ablation for improving pain and fertility-related outcomes.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic excision (cystectomy) compared with laparoscopic drainage and ablation of endometrioma in women of reproductive age.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, two trials registries, grey literature sources, and conference proceedings on 19 December 2022. We also checked the reference lists of relevant papers and contacted leaders in the field of endoscopic surgery for any additional trials.

Selection Criteria

Eligible studies were RCTs that compared excision with drainage and ablation of endometriomas.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and applied the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We identified nine studies (involving 578 women) that investigated laparoscopic excision versus drainage and ablation of endometriomas measuring at least 3 cm in diameter. Participants were women of reproductive age who presented to an outpatient gynaecology clinic with pain, infertility, or both. For most outcomes, we downgraded the certainty of evidence for risk of bias due to lack of blinding and for imprecision due to low participant numbers. At up to two years after surgery, excisional surgery compared with ablative surgery may reduce the risk of dysmenorrhoea recurrence (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.52; 2 studies, 140 women; low-certainty evidence;). Recurrence of dysmenorrhoea may occur in 49% of women after ablative surgery compared with 10% to 34% after excisional surgery. At up to two years after surgery, excisional surgery compared with ablative surgery may reduce the risk of dyspareunia recurrence (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.22; 2 studies, 131 women; low-certainty evidence). Recurrence of dyspareunia may occur in 58% of women after ablative surgery compared with 4% to 23% after excisional surgery. At one year after surgery, excisional surgery may reduce the risk of endometrioma recurrence compared with ablative surgery (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.34; 4 studies, 264 women; low-certainty evidence). Recurrence of endometrioma may occur in 37% of women after ablative surgery compared with 5% to 17% after excisional surgery. At one year after surgery, excisional surgery may reduce the need for further endometrioma surgery compared with ablative surgery (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.41; 2 studies, 178 women; low-certainty evidence). Our results suggest that 32% of women require further endometrioma surgery after ablative surgery compared with 3% to 16% after excisional surgery. There may be little or no difference between excisional surgery and ablative surgery in terms of their effect on spontaneous pregnancy during the first year after surgery (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.87; 3 studies, 101 women; low-certainty evidence). Five studies reported that there were no conversions to laparotomy. No studies provided data about any other surgical complications or adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Surgical management of endometrioma with excision (cystectomy) may be more effective than drainage and ablation for reducing painful menstrual periods, pain during sexual intercourse, endometrioma recurrence, and the need for further endometrioma surgery. However, there may be little or no difference between the techniques in their effect on subsequent pregnancy rates. We found limited evidence on the safety of excisional surgery compared with ablative surgery. Future trials should recruit adequate numbers of women and measure outcomes relating to adverse events and clinical pregnancy.

### Surgery for endometriosis: beyond medical therapies [^115MpK3Q]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

Endometriosis-associated pelvic pain and subfertility may be managed medically in many cases; however, the surgical management of this insidious disease remains a necessary part of the treatment algorithm. Laparoscopy for diagnosis alone is rarely indicated with the advancements in preoperative imaging. When surgery is performed, the ideal goal would be a therapeutic and effective surgical intervention based on the preoperative evaluation. Surgery for women with pain due to endometriosis may be indicated in patients who cannot or do not wish to take medical therapies; acute surgical or pain events; deep endometriosis; during concomitant management of other gynecologic disorders; and patients seeking fertility with pain. The role of surgery for endometriosis-related subfertility may be considered in those with hydrosalpinges undergoing IVF; management of ovarian endometriomas in specific circumstances; and when a patient requests surgery as an alternative to assisted reproductive technology (ART). Surgery for ovarian endometriomas requires special attention due to the risk of potential harm on future fertility. Finally, a combined approach of surgery followed by postoperative medical therapy offers the best long-term outcomes for recurrence of disease and symptoms. A patient-centered approach and a goal-oriented approach are essential when determining the options for care in this population.

### Pathophysiology and clinical implications of ovarian endometriomas [^1114Vaox]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

SURGICAL MANAGEMENT

Definitive diagnosis of endometrioma is histologic, and surgery can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Since the 1980s, video laparoscopy with and without robotic assistance has become the preferred approach over laparotomy on account of improved operative outcomes and visualization of anatomy. – In 1986, Nezhat et alreported video laparoscopic management of all stages of endometriosis, including endometriomas. Risk of conversion to open surgery is low but relatively higher for patients with endometriomas than with other types of adnexal masses (5.1% vs 3.5%).

Surgical approaches include ovarian cystectomy with stripping of the cyst wall, cyst drainage and ablation, and sclerotherapy. Cyst aspiration alone is associated with high recurrence rates (greater than 80%) and is not recommended as sole treatment. Cystectomy is associated with reduced rates of recurrence, reoperation, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and nonmenstrual pelvic pain, as well as increased spontaneous pregnancy rate, compared with ablation. – In the short term, postoperative anti-müllerian hormone decline may be the highest after cystectomy, but cystectomy is also associated with higher postoperative conception rates and lower rates of cyst recurrence compared with ablation and sclerotherapy.

Endometrioma surgery begins with inspection of the pelvis and adhesiolysis. Peritoneal washings should be collected before cyst manipulation. Cystectomy typically proceeds with creation of an incision along the cyst away from the hilum. Laparoscopic graspers are then used to create traction and countertraction and to strip the cyst wall from the ovary. Care should be taken to avoid excess trauma to the normal ovarian tissue and damage to the ovarian hilum. Injection of dilute vasopressin under the cyst capsule defines the plane between the cyst and the normal ovary and decreases bleeding. To achieve hemostasis of the ovarian bed, hemostatic sealants, suture, and sparing electrosurgery may be used. A number of small, randomized trials have demonstrated greater decline in ovarian reserve markers with the use of electrosurgery for hemostasis compared with hemostatic agents or suture.

### Medical management of ovarian endometriomas: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116aMqDJ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To estimate the effect of medical management on the size of ovarian endometriomas.

Data Source

Online databases were searched from inception to October 2022, including Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, PubMed, EBM Reviews-Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov, and Web of Science.

Methods Of Study Selection

Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, we included all English-language, full-text articles that reported on change in endometrioma size (either diameter or volume) after medical interventions. Studies evaluating surgical interventions or postoperative recurrence were excluded. All screening and data extraction were performed independently by two authors. Risk of bias assessment was performed with either the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized controlled trials or a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

After removal of duplicates, 9,332 studies were screened, with 33 full-text articles deemed eligible for inclusion. In the meta-analysis, dienogest showed significant reduction in cyst diameter (reduction 1.32 cm, 95% CI, 0.91–1.73, eight studies, n = 418 cysts) and volume (mean difference of log-transformed volume 1.35, 95% CI, 0.87–1.83, seven studies, n = 282 cysts). Similarly, significant reductions were seen with the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) (1.06 cm, 95% CI, 0.59–1.53, nine studies, n = 455), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists (1.17 cm, 95% CI, 0.42–1.92, four studies, n = 128 cysts), norethindrone acetate (0.6 cm, 95% CI, 0.27–0.94, two studies, n = 88 cysts), and danazol (1.95 cm, 95% CI, 1.18–2.73, two studies, n = 34 cysts). Norethindrone acetate with aromatase inhibitor was also effective in reducing endometrioma volume (mean difference of log-transformed volume 1.47, 95% CI, 0.16–2.78, two studies, n = 34 cysts).

Conclusion

Medical management with dienogest, OCPs, GnRH agonists, norethindrone acetate, norethindrone acetate with aromatase inhibitor, or danazol can reduce the size of ovarian endometriomas.

### Endometriosis and infertility: pathophysiology and management [^11164iEv]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Endometriosis and infertility are associated clinically. Medical and surgical treatments for endometriosis have different effects on a woman's chances of conception, either spontaneously or via assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Medical treatments for endometriosis are contraceptive. Data, mostly uncontrolled, indicate that surgery at any stage of endometriosis enhances the chances of natural conception. Criteria for non-removal of endometriomas are: bilateral cysts, history of past surgery, and altered ovarian reserve. Fears that surgery can alter ovarian function that is already compromised sparked a rule of no surgery before ART. Exceptions to this guidance are pain, hydrosalpinges, and very large endometriomas. Medical treatment-eg, 3–6 months of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues-improves the outcome of ART. When age, ovarian reserve, and male and tubal status permit, surgery should be considered immediately so that time is dedicated to attempts to conceive naturally. In other cases, the preference is for administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues before ART, and no surgery beforehand. The strategy of early surgery, however, seems counterintuitive because of beliefs that milder non-surgical options should be offered first and surgery last (only if initial treatment attempts fail). Weighing up the relative advantages of surgery, medical treatment and ART are the foundations for a global approach to infertility associated with endometriosis.

### Ten principles for safe surgical treatment of ovarian endometriosis [^111qyUuE]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To show a step-by-step laparoscopic approach for excision of an ovarian endometrioma following surgical principles for safety and maximal preservation of ovarian function.

Design

Video. Medical management of ovarian endometriomas is not recommended. Operative laparoscopy is the treatment of choice. Although considered a simple procedure, ovarian cystectomy requires a precise and correct technique in order to preserve ovarian function.

Setting

A private hospital.

Patient

An asymptomatic, 27-year-old woman with ultrasound imaging suggesting a 6.2 × 5.4 cm left endometrioma. Additional findings of endometriotic implants were noted in the posterior aspect of the left broad ligament, retrocervical region, Douglas pouch, and left round ligament.

Interventions

After trocar insertion, standard inspection of the pelvic cavity with identification of endometriosis lesions and adhesions was performed. The endometrioma was drained with direct trocar puncture to avoid spillage of the endometriotic contents. Cyst aspiration and saline cleaning were executed. After drainage, a cold cut was performed at the puncture site for better identification of the cyst capsule. Through gentle traction and countertraction, the capsule was peeled from the ovarian cortex, preserving as much ovarian tissue as possible followed by careful hemostasis with a bipolar instrument. The ovary is fixed, anatomy re-established, and concomitant pelvic endometriosis resected. We aim for complete surgical excision in order to avoid leaving disease behind. The ovarian edges were reapproximated using simple interrupted stitches.

Measurements and Main Results

The total procedure time was 40 minutes.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic endometrioma stripping offers an effective option for ovarian endometriosis treatment, reducing recurrence and being reproducible by gynecologic surgeons after proper training.

### Optimal management of endometriosis and pain [^1127jVeL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology of endometriosis-associated pain involves inflammatory and hormonal alterations and changes in brain signaling pathways. Although medical treatment can provide temporary relief, most patients can achieve long-term sustained pain relief when it is combined with surgical intervention. Owing to its complexity, there is an ongoing debate about how to optimally manage endometriosis-associated pain. We believe optimal management for this condition requires: 1) possible egg preservation in affected young patients with and without endometriomas; 2) preoperative medical suppression to inhibit ovulation and to avoid removal of functional cysts that might look like endometriomas; and 3) postoperative hormonal suppression to decrease recurrence, but this treatment should be modified according to disease severity, symptoms, and fertility goals.

### The impact of surgical intervention on time to conception and obstetric outcomes in women with endometriomas: a retrospective cohort study [^113Qs3mc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrium-like tissue outside the uterine cavity. It is a chronic condition affecting approximately 10% of women of reproductive age. Retrograde menstruation is considered the most common potential cause for its pathogenesis. The ovaries are the most commonly known location for the development of endometriosis, where it presents as an endometrioma. Endometriomas are found in 17–44% of patients with endometriosis and are considered an indicator of advanced disease. Endometriomas can impair fertility; however, they do not always cause infertility.

There is no consensus on the optimal management strategy for endometriomas in patients planning pregnancy. Depending on the patients' symptoms and clinical presentations, endometriomas may be managed conservatively or surgically. However, surgical treatment carry potential risks, such as reduced ovarian reserve. Some studies have suggested that surgical treatment of endometriomas may improve spontaneous conception rates. According to the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine (rASRM) guidelines, operative laparoscopic surgery may enhance the likelihood of successful conception in patients with stage 1–2 endometriosis. Surgical intervention remains a controversial alternative in patients with endometriosis due to the uncertainty of the balance between the risk of reduced ovarian reserve and the possibility of a favorable impact on pregnancy by the reduction in levels of inflammatory factors. Because of this uncertainty, surgery is often recommended for patients with considerable symptoms, such as pain or mass effect, that compromise their quality of life. Among surgical options, laparoscopic cyst excision is preferred over other techniques, as it is associated with a lower risk of recurrence and higher pregnancy rates.

Several studies have compared pregnancy rates and outcomes between patients with endometriomas who are treated conservatively and those treated surgically. The achievement of pregnancy and the time to conception are crucial in women desiring pregnancy. Time to conception is also a critical clinical parameter for clinicians to provide appropriate counseling and plan individualized treatment strategies. Although previous studies have evaluated time to conception following different surgical techniques for endometriomas, to our knowledge, no study has directly compared time to conception between surgically and nonsurgically managed patients. The aim of this study was to compare the time to conception, mode of conception, and pregnancy outcomes between the patients with endometriomas who were managed conservatively and those who underwent surgical intervention.

### Endometriosis and infertility: a committee opinion [^112NXjBy]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Endometrioma management before assisted reproductive technology — there are no randomized trials comparing laparoscopic excision to expectant management before IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). A case-control study involving 189 patients found no improvement in fertility outcomes after laparoscopic cystectomy before IVF, and a retrospective comparison of 171 subjects concluded that aspiration before controlled ovarian stimulation did not increase the number of follicles > 17 mm, the number of metaphase II oocytes retrieved, or clinical pregnancy rates. Evidence suggests surgery does not benefit asymptomatic women with an endometrioma prior to scheduled IVF/ICSI; in each case the benefits and risks should be balanced by clinicians, and disadvantages include surgical trauma, surgical complications, economic costs, potential decreased ovarian response, and lack of evidence for improved IVF pregnancy rates.

### Endometriosis and infertility [^1174ntkd]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Women with endometriosis typically present with pelvic pain, infertility or an adnexal mass. Surgery for persistent adnexal masses may be indicated to remove an endometrioma or other pelvic pathology. Surgical or medical therapy is efficacious for pelvic pain due to endometriosis, but treatment of endometriosis in the female partner of an infertile couple raises a number of complex clinical questions that do not have simple answers.

### Efficacy of intrauterine insemination in women with endometrioma-associated subfertility: analysis using propensity score matching [^116yyRb1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Endometriosis is one of the most common chronic gynecologic disorders and is frequently associated with female subfertility (up to 50% subfertile women with endometriosis). Approximately 190 million women worldwide are currently affected by endometriosis and 30% to 50% of women with endometriosis are infertile. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) frequently is used as the first-line therapy to endometriosis-associated infertility. Guidelines of both the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology and American Society for Reproductive Medicine, state that intrauterine insemination (IUI) treatment is only recommended in subfertile women with minimal-to-mild endometriosis. Werbrouck et al. reported no difference in cycle pregnancy rate between women with surgically treated minimal to mild endometriosis and women with unexplained infertility after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IUI program. The cumulative live-birth rate within four cycles of IUI was also comparable in women with minimal endometriosis, mild endometriosis, and unexplained infertility (70.2%, 68.2%, 66.5%, respectively).

Ovarian endometriomas are found in 17%‐44% of women with endometriosis. Although the exact pathophysiology of the reduced fertility is not clear, toxic content from an endometrioma may play a crucial role. Endometrioma is also usually overlap with those a more advanced stage of disease (stages III and IV of endometriosis according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) classification).

A significant number of women with endometrioma will eventually seek ART to achieve a pregnancy, which is more often in those with reduced ovarian reserve or other identifiable infertility factor. However, for subfertile patients with presence of endometrioma alone (i.e.normal ovarian reserve and patency of fallopian tubes), is IUI treatment effective for subfertility associated with endometrioma? The optimal management often poses a clinical debate and little evidence exists to provide robust guidance to clinicians.

Considering a sequence of IUI cycles is less aggressive and less expensive than an IVF procedure, should IUI treatment be encouraged as a valuable or viable approach to achieve a natural pregnancy? The aim of the present study was to test the efficacy of IUI treatment on women with endometrioma-associated subfertility, comparing the fertility outcomes (per-cycle-pregnancy rate [PR], and cumulative pregnancy rates [CPRs] after IUI treatment in subfertile women with endometrioma and women with unexplained subfertility by using propensity matching (PSM) analysis.

### Gynecologic surgery for benign disease: preserving reproductive potential [^112v35Ts]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Preserving fertility is essential when managing benign gynecologic disorders in reproductive-aged women. Surgical interventions can impact future fertility, therefore requiring an evidence-based, individualized approach. The FIGO Committee on Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility reviewed current literature to develop recommendations for fertility-sparing surgical management. Effective treatment must balance disease control with fertility preservation. Evidence supports refined surgical techniques and alternative methods that minimize reproductive harm. In pregnancy loss management, medical treatment is preferred; however, if surgery is needed, hysteroscopic evacuation is safer than sharp curettage, reducing the risk of intrauterine adhesions. Similarly for other operative hysteroscopic procedures or abdominal procedures, including myomectomy, the use of an adhesion-reducing substance is recommended. During abdominal myomectomy, only symptomatic or fertility-impairing fibroids should be removed, as excessive resection may reduce pregnancy chances. In endometrioma surgery, preserving ovarian tissue is crucial by minimizing stripping of the pseudocapsule, or using sclerotherapy may help. Oocyte cryopreservation should be discussed when recurrence or reduced ovarian reserve is a concern. Hydrosalpinx often requires salpingectomy to enhance in vitro fertilization outcomes, but surgeons should protect ovarian blood flow by minimizing thermal injury. For adenomyosis, medical management is preferred due to the risks associated with surgical techniques like the triple-flap procedure. In polycystic ovary syndrome, laparoscopic ovarian drilling is discouraged; ovulation induction with letrozole or gonadotropins is safer and effective. In summary, fertility-sparing treatment demands personalized, evidence-based strategies that prioritize reproductive potential while managing disease. As reproductive goals evolve, continued refinement of these approaches remains vital to women's health care.

### Predicting disease recurrence in patients with endometriosis: an observational study [^1166nQYQ]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The symptoms and appearance of endometriosis are heterogeneous. Furthermore, the clinical manifestation and responsiveness to treatments can change over time in individuals. This means there is no 'one shoe fits all' approach to managing and treating endometriosis, and in the absence of a failsafe cure, endometriosis disease recurrence is common (6–67%). Some previously reported risk factors for endometriosis recurrence include severe or deep disease, younger age and conservative surgery with conservation of the ovaries and uterus. Apprehension regarding recurrent disease is high among patients. 'What is the most effective way of stopping endometriosis progressing and/or spreading to other organs (eg after surgery)?' was listed in the top 10 endometriosis research priorities by consumers and health-care professionals in the UK and Ireland in 2017.

Recurrence of endometriosis in an individual following complete surgical excision can be defined as lesion recurrence on reoperation (with or without histological confirmation) or on imaging. However, symptom-based suspected recurrence, not proven by imaging and/or surgery, may also be considered a subtype of recurrent disease. With such broad definitions encapsulating recurrent endometriosis, it is not surprising the reported range of disease recurrence is so wide. Some limitations that prevent findings from being replicated include failure to report the duration of follow-up (or short follow-up periods), examination of specific lesions types, for example, endometrioma or deep lesions only, and failure to report if excision was complete, thus bringing into question the possibility of residual, rather than recurrent disease. Hence, the determinants for recurrence have not been established and the true prevalence of endometriosis recurrence remains unknown.

To improve long-term health outcomes for patients with endometriosis, it is important that we increase our understanding of why endometriosis lesions return in some individuals and learn which risk factors contribute to the probability of the disease recurrence. The aim of this study was to identify factors that are associated with increased risk for recurrent disease, specifically lesions returning, and to help predict probable risk of endometriosis recurrence.

### Interventions for women with endometrioma prior to assisted reproductive technology [^114X9V41]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Endometriomata are cysts of endometriosis in the ovaries. As artificial reproductive technology (ART) cycles involve oocyte pickup from the ovaries, endometriomata may interfere with the outcome of ART.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of surgery, medical treatment, combination therapy or no treatment for improving reproductive outcomes among women with endometriomata, prior to undergoing ART cycles.

Search Strategy

The review authors searched: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register of trials, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, DARE, trial registers for ongoing and registered trials, citation indexes, conference abstracts on the ISI Web of Knowledge, Clinical Study Results, OpenSIGLE (July 2010) and handsearched Fertility and Sterility (2008 to 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of any medical, surgical or combination therapy or expectant management for endometriomata prior to ART.

Data Collection and Analysis

The trials were independently identified and assessed for risk of bias by two authors. The authors of the trials that were potentially eligible for inclusion were contacted for additional information. Outcomes were expressed as Peto odds ratios and mean differences (MD).

Main Results

Eleven trials were identified of which seven were excluded and four with 312 participants were included. No trial reported live birth outcomes. One trial compared gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist with GnRH antagonist. There was no evidence of a difference for clinical pregnancy rate (CPR), however the number of mature oocytes retrieved (NMOR) was greater with GnRH agonists (MD -1.60, 95% CI -2.44 to -0.76) and the ovarian response was increased (estradiol (E2) levels on day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injection) (MD -456.30, 95% CI -896.06 to -16.54). Surgery (aspiration or cystectomy) versus expectant management (EM) showed no evidence of a benefit for clinical pregnancy with either technique. Aspiration was associated with greater NMOR (MD 0.50, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.98) and increased ovarian response (E2 levels on day of hCG injection) (MD 685.3, 95% CI 464.50 to 906.10) compared to EM. Cystectomy was associated with a decreased ovarian response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) (MD -510.00, 95% CI -676.62 to -343.38); no evidence of an effect on the NMOR compared to EM. Aspiration versus cystectomy showed no evidence of a difference in CPR or the NMOR.

Authors' Conclusions

There was no evidence of an effect on reproductive outcomes in any of the four included trials. Further RCTs of management of endometrioma in women undergoing ART are required.

### Time for global health policy and research leaders to prioritize endometriosis [^111cZZ4v]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Heterogeneous presentation of endometriosis impedes diagnosis and treatment

Most pelvic endometriosis comprises three subtypes: superficial peritoneal, ovarian cysts ("endometrioma"), and deep disease. Symptom manifestation and severity vary, and underdiagnosis is common due to erroneous symptom normalization and overlap with other diseases. Recently, refined imaging techniques identify, with high accuracy, ovarian and deep disease, but reliance on surgical visualisation for the most common superficial peritoneal lesions continues to impede timely diagnosis. Surgery or imaging requires access to healthcare services, which varies significantly across socio-economic and racial/ethnically underserved groups and geographies. Average diagnostic delay is 7 years after symptom onset, with delays > 10 years not uncommon. There remains no reliable non-invasive biomarker of any endometriosis subtype.

Treatment of pain symptoms falls broadly into surgical removal of disease and associated adhesions and hormonal suppressive therapies, including combined oral contraceptive steroids, progestins, gonadotropin releasing hormone analogues, androgens and aromatase inhibitors. Medical therapies that decrease oestrogen (or counter oestrogen action) are prescribed, because steroids play a key role in the pathophysiology of endometriosis. Unfortunately, both approaches are suboptimal. Surgery is associated with recurrence rates up to 50% within 5 years, and contraceptive hormone treatments often have unacceptable side effects and are counterproductive to fertility goals. Geographic and financial barriers to accessing treatment from endometriosis-trained healthcare providers are common. Surveys of patients consistently highlight symptom relief and improved medical therapies that do not limit fertility as a top priority for research. Historically, pharmaceutical companies were reluctant to develop new drugs for endometriosis, and focus has been on variations of hormonal, anti-inflammatory, or repurposed therapies, lacking revolutionary impact. While novel treatment discovery is essential, clinical trials for endometriosis have been plagued by widespread variations in outcome reporting, and only a fraction of completed trials is published.

Emerging chronic pelvic pain-focused therapies that include considerations of neuropathic and nociceptive pathways have not been adequately studied. Those with persistent/recurrent pain have a high rate of hysterectomywhich does not eliminate pain recurrence and may heighten risks for multiple conditions later in life. Further, commonly reported life-impacting concerns including fatigue and impaired sexual functioning have yet to be targeted for treatment among patients with endometriosis. A critical impediment to discovery of novel diagnostics and treatments and personalized approaches is the lack of a prognostically correlated classification of the highly heterogenous presentation of endometriosis lesion types and symptoms, which includes variation and evolution within patients across the life-course.

### Endometriosis and infertility: a committee opinion [^1165u1cM]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Stage III/IV endometriosis — conservative surgical management and subsequent fertility: A non-randomized study reported cumulative pregnancy rates of 45% and 63% in 216 infertile patients followed for up to two years after laparoscopy or laparotomy, respectively, and laparoscopic cystectomy for ovarian endometriomas greater than 4 cm improved fertility compared to cyst drainage and coagulation. Observational studies suggest that in women with Stage III/IV endometriosis who have no other identifiable infertility factors, conservative surgical treatment with laparoscopy and possible laparotomy may increase fertility; however, a possible adverse consequence is the loss of viable ovarian cortex, and after the first infertility operation additional surgery has only rarely increased fecundability, with patients possibly better served by assisted reproductive technology (ART).

### Pictorial essay: MRI evaluation of endometriosis-associated neoplasms [^114V3PaK]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a frequent pathology mostly affecting women of young age. When typical aspects are present, the diagnosis can easily be made at imaging, especially at MRI. Transformation of benign endometriosis to endometriosis-associated neoplasms is rare. The physiopathology is complex and remains controversial. Endometrioid carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma are the main histological subtypes. Our goal was to review the main imaging characteristics that should point to an ovarian or extra-ovarian endometriosis-related tumor, especially at MRI, as it may be relevant prior to surgical management.

Key points

- Transformation of benign endometriosis to endometriosis-associated neoplasms is rare.

### Postmenopausal endometriosis [^113oTviw]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Typical symptoms of postmenopausal endometrioma are non-specific, ranging from pelvic pain, adnexal cystic mass or intestinal symptoms. When presented with a case of an adnexal mass in postmenopausal women, one must always evaluate the possibility of a malignant ovarian tumour. Postmenopausal endometriosis warrants more attention in cases with risk factors such as HRT, obesity or a previous history of endometriosis. Differentiating benign and malignant tumours in the postmenopausal population can be difficult. Postmenopausal endometriosis, for one, may have similar presentations to malignant disease as it can also infiltrate adjacent tissues and organs. In addition, ovarian endometrioma has similar risk factors to ovarian cancer, that is, longer lifetime oestrogen exposure (low parity, infertility, late childbearing age, early menarche, late menopause and oral contraceptive use). Our patient is a P0A0 postmenopausal woman who had her menopause in her late 40's with a history of oral contraceptive use, implying longer oestrogen exposure. We initially suspected ovarian cancer in this case considering her age, risk factors and presentations that are highly suggestive of an ovarian malignant tumour.

We also found M2 and M4 features (presence of ascites and an irregular multilocular solid tumour with the largest diameter > 100 mm) on both her transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS). The IOTA group developed a classification system for adnexal lesions comprising four Easy Descriptors for benign lesions and two for malignant ones. Alternative methods, such as the Simple Rules, can be employed for lesions that cannot be categorised using Easy Descriptors. These Simple Rules rely on five ultrasound characteristics indicating benign lesions (B-features) and another five features suggesting malignancy (M-features). Lesion classification is based on the exclusive presence of either B-features or M-features. If both types of features appear simultaneously or no features are detected, the lesion is deemed unclassifiable. The popularity of the IOTA Simple Rules has grown due to their ease of use, which does not require computer calculations. Recognition of this method is evident from its adoption by various professional organisations. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) incorporated the Simple Rules into their Green-top Guideline in 2011 for managing adnexal masses in premenopausal women. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists followed suit in 2016 by integrating the Simple Rules into their clinical guidelines. Notably, in 2017, a first international consensus report acknowledged the Simple Rules as the primary diagnostic strategy for evaluating adnexal masses.

### Evaluation and management of women with endometriosis [^113MzMa7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a condition that often leads to a variety of symptoms that range from pain complaints to infertility. Endometriosis is also found in women who are asymptomatic. The diagnosis of endometriosis can be made clinically with reliability similar to that of one made surgically. Medical treatment options are effective, as are surgical treatment options. Complications associated with surgery, however, push the balance in favor of medical therapy whenever possible. Based on the body of evidence available at present, women with endometriosis-related complaints should be treated with a first-line medical therapy. If that fails, a second-line medical therapy is warranted under most conditions. Laparoscopic surgery should be reserved for patients in whom second-line medical therapy has failed or is contraindicated by desire to conceive immediately or as soon as possible.

### Endometrioma excision and ovarian reserve: a dangerous relation [^112eoYBP]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Endometrioma is one of the most frequent pathologies in gynecologic surgery. Laparoscopic cyst excision is considered the best treatment in terms of lower recurrence and improved fertility. However, it was recently questioned whether the excision of the endometrioma could decrease the function of the operated ovary and if it could affect the subsequent fertility. Even if a consistent amount of ovarian tissue is unintentionally removed together with the capsule of the cyst, resulting in does not show the follicular pattern observed in working ovaries. Currently, no definitive data clarify whether the damage to the ovarian reserve, observed in patient with endometrioma, is related to the surgical procedure, to the previous presence of the cyst, or both. Electrosurgial coagulation during hemostasis could play an important role in terms of damage to ovarian stroma and vascularization. Particular attention must be paid in presence of bilateral endometriotic cysts. In fact, an increase in premature ovarian failure rate was reported when both the ovaries are involved in surgery. Incase of assisted reproductive techniques, no clear evidence indicates which is the best approach for concomitant endometriotic cyst. On the base of these considerations endometriomas Should be treated only in case of pain, infertility, and in asymptomatic patients if the cyst diameter is greater than 4 cm.

### Magnetic resonance imaging for deep infiltrating endometriosis: current concepts, imaging technique and key findings [^113Xahfr]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of deep endometriosis: current concepts

Endometriosis is a complex and heterogeneous disease that may manifest with three clinical patterns with increasing severity. Superficial peritoneal lesions are characterized by superficial implants of the pelvic peritoneum; ovarian endometriomas (OMA) are hemorrhagic cysts arising from ectopic endometrial tissue growing within the ovaries and less frequently outside the ovaries; and DIE leads to the most severe clinical pattern and is characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue penetrating deeper than 5 mm under the peritoneal surface, thus leading to local inflammation and consequently to fibrosis and muscular hyperplasia. DIE is usually found as a multifocal disease simultaneously involving multiple pelvic sites such as the Douglas pouch, the utero-sacral ligaments (USL), pelvic nerves, the rectum, the bladder, and the ureters (Table 1). The pathophysiology of such lesions is widely unknown; the type of lesion may vary over the life course, with no evidence supporting an ordered progression of endometriotic lesions. Similarly, the heterogeneity of symptoms is high. Women with endometriosis may experience dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dysuria, constipation, chronic pelvic pain and infertility; however, a clear characterization of the pain types and topologies of implants is lacking. Consequently, some women with minimal disease may report severe pelvic pain and infertility, whereas others with diffuse pelvic lesions can be almost asymptomatic. The heterogeneity of the disease and the uncertainties about its pathogenesis make its diagnosis challenging. For decades, laparoscopic visualization with histologic verification of lesions was considered the golden standard for diagnosis. However, laparoscopy, even if diagnostic, is not a risk-free surgery. Furthermore, deep infiltrating endometriosis may not be clearly seen in some cases during diagnosis laparoscopy. In fact, the diagnosis of adenomyosis and deep endometriosis involving retroperitoneal structures, particularly ureters and nerve roots, is extremely challenging, particularly when performed by non-experienced gynecologists. False negative procedures may result, thus significantly delaying the start of appropriate management and potentially leading to major complications. Symptoms and clinical findings of endometriosis can result in clinical diagnoses that may be strongly supported by imaging techniques even without histological confirmation. Transvaginal ultrasound, because of its non-invasiveness, dynamicity, ease of use, availability, cost-effectiveness and reproducibility, is currently considered by many endometriosis experts as the best first-line method for assessment of DIE. A systematic sonographic approach as defined by International Deep Endometriosis Analysis (IDEA) consensus was shown to improve detection rates of pelvic lesions. MRI is also considered a highly accurate imaging modality in the evaluation of DIE, particularly when involvement of the rectum, ureters and nerve roots is suspected; these areas are highly important for both the patient and the surgeon and may be poorly visualized even with laparoscopy. MRI is also increasingly used to assess the anatomic response to medical or surgical treatment and to differentiate endometriosis from adenomyosis; the latter is a specific and heterogeneous disease contributing, independently of endometriosis to symptoms, defined as the invasion of endometrial tissue into the myometrium occurring in different forms (diffuse, focal, cystic or superficial). Adenomyosis may exist on its own but in about 30% of cases it is associated with DIE. The shift toward clinical and imaging-based diagnosis shortens the time between the first consultation and the final diagnosis, but the use of non-invasive methods requires a rigorous approach to ensure meaningful and consistent results.

### O-RADS MRI after initial ultrasound for adnexal lesions: expert panel narrative review [^116djLAc]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2023). Medium credibility.

The Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) ultrasound (US) and MRI risk stratification systems were developed by an international group of experts in adnexal imaging to aid radiologists in assessing adnexal lesions. The goal of imaging is to appropriately triage patients with adnexal lesions. US is the first-line imaging modality for assessment, whereas MRI can be used as a problem-solving tool. Both US and MRI can accurately characterize benign lesions such as simple cysts, endometriomas, hemorrhagic cysts, and dermoid cysts, avoiding unnecessary or inappropriate surgery. In patients with a lesion that does not meet criteria for one of these benign diagnoses, MRI can further characterize the lesion with an improved specificity for cancer and the ability to provide a probable histologic subtype in the presence of certain MRI features. This allows personalized treatment, including avoiding overly extensive surgery or allowing fertility-sparing procedures for suspected benign, borderline, or low-grade tumors. When MRI findings indicate a risk of an invasive cancer, patients can be expeditiously referred to a gynecologic oncologic surgeon. This narrative review provides expert opinion on the utility of multiparametric MRI when using the O-RADS US and MRI management systems.

### A multidisciplinary, minimally invasive approach for complicated deep infiltrating endometriosis [^1118YBaa]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To present a case of complicated deep infiltrating endometriosis managed by a multidisciplinary minimally invasive approach.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Tertiary care university hospital.

Patient

A 32-year-old woman with deep infiltrating endometriosis involving the rectovaginal septum, the rectum, and the left ureter, complicated by silent left renal function loss.

Intervention(S)

Laparoscopic left nephrectomy, ureterectomy, excision of a left ovarian endometrioma, removal of a large rectovaginal nodule, and segmental bowel resection with minilaparotomic end-to-end anastomosis.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Multidisciplinary diagnosis and minimally invasive surgical approach to deep infiltrating endometriosis involving the rectum and the urinary tract.

Result(S)

### Pathophysiology and clinical implications of ovarian endometriomas [^112r6fvE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Small, densely fibrotic endometriomas (type I) often must be removed piecemeal because of circumferential fibrosis. In contrast, large, less adherent endometriomas (type II) often can be stripped more easily from the surrounding ovarian stroma. The oldest endometriotic portion of the cyst, which may be very adherent to the ovary, is typically the most difficult portion to excise.

In clinical scenarios in which cystectomy would result in excessive loss of healthy ovarian tissue, cyst drainage and vaporization or ablation may be appropriate. When possible, as much of the cyst wall as possible is removed and sent for histologic evaluation, and vaporization or ablation is used to destroy any remaining foci of endometriotic tissue. The choice of vaporization or ablation (CO 2 laser, plasma jet, or radiofrequency) is guided by surgeon expertise, and all techniques may not be widely available. In general, the depth of penetration and level of tissue trauma are least with CO 2 laser or plasma jet and highest with radiofrequency. Excess damage to adjacent ovarian tissue can theoretically be avoided by limiting exposure time and periodically cooling the ovary with irrigation fluid.

Sclerotherapy is a less common modality of endometrioma treatment in the United States but has been studied extensively in the global literature. Sclerosing agents function by direct damage to cyst wall epithelial tissue and to the endothelium of feeding blood vessels. Through either a laparoscopic or an ultrasound-guided approach, the endometrioma is punctured, aspirated, irrigated, and instilled with a sclerosing agent (ethanol 20–100%, tetracycline 1–5%, or methotrexate 1%). Ethanol dosing should be limited to 1 mL/kg to avoid alcohol intoxication. The sclerosing agent is left in situ or reaspirated. Several studies have demonstrated decreased recurrence if an ethanol indwelling time of at least 10 minutes is used to maximize tissue necrosis.– In a cyst that is densely adherent, adhesiolysis resulting in multiple cyst perforations may complicate the ability to achieve adequate indwelling time. The most common complication of sclerotherapy is abdominal pain; rare complications include postoperative fever and abscess formation.

### Combining sclerotherapy with COLaser ablation for the laparoscopic management of large endometrioma: advantages and pitfalls [^111EGkgb]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To demonstrate the feasibility of management of large endometrioma laparoscopically.

Design

Stepwise demonstration with narrated video footage of the laparoscopic 2-step procedure starting with alcohol sclerotherapy of the large endometrioma followed by CO 2 laser ablation and 6-month follow-up.

Setting

The debate surrounding the best approach for the management of large endometriomas has been ongoing. Cystectomy especially when treating large endometriomas has been shown to decrease ovarian reserve proportionally to the endometrioma's size. 2, 4 This is why 2-step approaches have been considered to preserve the ovarian reserve. 1, 3 We present the case of a 22-year-old nulliparous woman who has primary severe dysmenorrhea resistant to medical treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging shows uterine adenomyosis and a 10 cm large endometrioma of the left ovary and no signs of deep infiltrative endometriosis. She has a desire for pregnancy in the distant future.

Intervention

The first step is the laparoscopic ethanol sclerotherapy. After emptying and rinsing the endometrioma's cavity through a 5 mm suction cannula, it is then filled with ethanol through a 14 French Foley catheter to avoid any overflow. 5, 6 After a time exposure of 10 minutes, the ethanol is withdrawn and the cavity rinsed (Figure 2). The second step of the surgery is performed 12 weeks later (Figure 3). Using CO 2 laser, the untreated portion of the inner wall of the remaining endometrioma is vaporized along with remaining superficial endometriosis lesions (Figure 1).

Conclusion

Laparoscopy sclerotherapy combined to CO 2 laser ablation is a feasible technique for the management of a large endometrioma. Further research is still required to evaluate the benefit of a 2-step surgery approach over standard cystectomy and to understand the long-term effects of ethanol-induced ovarian fibrosis.

### Recurrence after surgery for endometrioma: a systematic review and meta-analyses [^112h9eSY]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Importance

Endometriosis is an inflammatory disease, with different forms of expression and a variety of complaints. An endometrioma, an ovarian cyst with endometrium-like lining, is one of the most common expressions of abdominal endometriosis. These endometriomas can, in addition to medical treatment, be treated surgically. After surgery, hormonal therapy is still frequently used for the treatment of endometriosis in general and prevention of recurrence of endometriomas specifically. However, not all women want or can receive postoperative hormonal treatment. It is important for this group to determine the risk of anatomical recurrence of ovarian endometrioma after surgery for an endometrioma.

Objective

To determine the recurrence rate for surgically treated endometrioma without postoperative hormonal treatment.

Data Sources

We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analyses, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched until May 2023. The literature search was limited to women with endometrioma who received surgical treatment without postoperative hormonal treatment.

Study Selection and Synthesis

A distinction was made in study design including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort and retrospective studies. For assessment of risk of bias, the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions assessment tool were used.

Main Outcomes

The outcome measure included in this review was endometrioma recurrence.

Results

We screened 5,367 articles, of which 97 were systematically reviewed and 55 were included in this systematic review. Twelve of these were RCTs, 11 were prospective cohort studies, and 32 were retrospective studies. Nine RCTs had a low risk of bias. For non-RCTs, only 3 studies had a low risk of bias. Data of 23 studies were pooled in meta-analyses, performed for follow-up periods of 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. These studies showed recurrence rates of 4%, 14%, 17%, and 27%, respectively.

Conclusion and Relevance

In the meta-analysis, at 24 months after surgery, the endometrioma recurrence rate showed a weighted mean of up to 27%. In this study, we aimed to determine the recurrence rate of endometrioma after surgical treatment in women without postoperative hormonal treatment use. The recurrence rates were up to 27%.

### Management of the adnexal mass [^114i2UZw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Adnexal masses are commonly encountered in gynecologic practice and often present both diagnostic and management challenges. This is partly because of the fact that the majority of adnexal masses that are identified represent benign entities that do not necessarily require active intervention, yet a small subset will represent malignant processes that require both timely and appropriate surgical intervention for optimal outcome. To determine the best diagnostic and management strategies in this setting, physicians must effectively triage risk for malignancy by having a thorough understanding of the entities on the differential diagnosis and carefully considering the clinical context for each individual patient. Optimal selection and interpretation of diagnostic tests are enhanced by both an accurate clinical risk assessment and an understanding of the inherent accuracy of diagnostic tests considered in this setting. The purpose of this document is to provide clinicians with a practical strategy for distinguishing benign and malignant masses in the nonpregnant woman. Our approach addresses the critical elements of accurate risk stratification, reviews the performance of diagnostic tests for identifying malignancy, and offers evidence-based management algorithms to optimize outcomes for women with adnexal masses.

### First International Consensus Report on adnexal masses: management recommendations [^1134QZKG]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The First International Consensus Conference on Adnexal Masses was convened to thoroughly examine the state of the science and to formulate recommendations for clinical assessment and management. The panel included representatives of societies in the fields of gynecology, gynecologic oncology, radiology, and pathology and clinicians from Europe, Canada, and the United States. In the United States, there are approximately 9.1 surgeries per malignancy compared to the European International Ovarian Tumor Analysis center trials, with only 2.3 (oncology centers) and 5.9 (other centers) reported surgeries per malignancy, suggesting that there is room to improve our preoperative assessments. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Practice Bulletin on "Management of Adnexal Masses", reaffirmed in 2015 (Obstet Gynecol 2007; 110:201–214), still states, "With the exception of simple cysts on a transvaginal ultrasound finding, most pelvic masses in postmenopausal women will require surgical intervention". The panel concluded that patients would benefit not only from a more conservative approach to many benign adnexal masses but also from optimization of physician referral patterns to a gynecologic oncologist in cases of suspected ovarian malignancies. A number of next-step options were offered to aid in management of cases with sonographically indeterminate adnexal masses. This process would provide an opportunity to improve risk stratification for indeterminate masses via the provision of alternatives, including but not limited to evidence-based risk-assessment algorithms and referral to an "expert sonologist" or to a gynecologic oncologist. The panel believed that these efforts to improve clinical management and preoperative triage patterns would ultimately improve patient care.

### Pathophysiology and clinical implications of ovarian endometriomas [^116SANr1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

SURGICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR PATIENTS NOT DESIRING FERTILITY

For patients not desiring fertility, oophorectomy is sometimes considered in place of cystectomy, particularly in the setting of large or recurrent cysts. Patients should be counseled on the risk of contralateral ovary recurrence after unilateral oophorectomy. In one study of 50 patients who underwent laparoscopic unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for unilateral endometrioma, the risk of recurrence on the contralateral ovary during the first 5 years after unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was 24.7%.

A distinct benefit of salpingo-oophorectomy is cancer risk reduction. A population-based study in Sweden found a significant negative association between history of oophorectomy or history of radical endometriosis surgery and ovarian cancer incidence after controlling for salpingectomy, hysterectomy, and use of medical therapies. In addition, one retrospective case series of 33 patients in Japan with histologically confirmed ovarian cancer arising in the setting of an endometrioma found that 6 of the 33 patients with ovarian cancer had a history of cystectomy of the ipsilateral ovary, suggesting that cystectomy alone was not protective against ovarian cancer in those cases. The majority of cancers were of clear cell or endometrioid histology, consistent with the well-established association between endometriosis and these ovarian cancer subtypes. –

An additional opportunity for ovarian cancer risk reduction at the time of endometrioma surgery for patients who have completed childbearing is concurrent bilateral salpingectomy. Histologic and molecular studies over the past 20 years have provided compelling evidence that the high-grade serous subtype of ovarian cancer commonly originates in the fallopian tube epithelium. Accordingly, retrospective studies show a risk reduction for ovarian cancer after bilateral salpingectomy on the order of 65%. An increasing number of international societies recommend that patients who do not desire future fertility be counseled on the option to have concurrent bilateral salpingectomy at the time of other gynecologic surgery. –

### Does current ovarian endometrioma increase the time for DOR patients to reach live birth in IVF? [^115xmqLD]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we found that pregnancy outcomes of multiple IVF cycles were similar in DOR women with or without current endometrioma. Thus, our study revealed that surgery of endometrioma may not be considered in patients with poor ovarian reserve.

Previous studies indicated that surgical management of endometriomas negatively affected ovarian reserve, due to unintentional removal of normal tissue during ovarian cystectomy. Raffi and Alborzi reported a significant decrease in AMH level and an increase in FSH after OMA surgery. Furthermore, current evidence suggested that ovarian cystectomy prior to IVF failed to improve IVF outcomes in infertile women with OMA. A recent study reported that poor response to ovarian stimulation and cycle cancellation were more frequent in patients who had previous endometrioma surgery compared to patients with non-operated endometrioma. This study also reported that the pregnancy rates were similar in patients who had previous endometrioma surgery compared to patients with non-operated endometrioma, which was consistent with our study. However, the majority of published studies suggested that ovarian surgery for endometrioma was associated with impaired IVF outcome in DOR patients. A recent retrospective case–control study demonstrated that DOR women by endometrioma cystectomy had significantly lower clinical pregnancy and live birth rates per IVF cycle than women with idiopathic DOR diagnosed by the Bologna criteria. On the contrary, it has been reported that the IVF outcomes were promising even with the presence of ovarian endometriomas. Therefore, surgical excision of endometriomas prior to IVF was not recommended especially for the patients who already have a decreased ovarian reserve.

### Surgical management of endometriosis-associated pain [^115APepd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

General surgical guidelines are reasonable, but treatment frequently must be individualized. Laparoscopic coagulation can be used for many cases of superficial endometriosis. Resection seems to be associated with an increased resolution of endometriosis. Resection increases the difficulty of the procedure, the time of the operation, and the cost, however. When endometriosis is found coincidentally, it may need no treatment because many women have endometriosis as a self-limited disease. Distinguishing patients who need no treatment from patients who need intermediate or extensive treatment can be difficult. Care is needed to attempt to ensure that patients are neither overtreated nor undertreated.

3 | MATERIALS AND METHODS

Best practice evidence-based guideline development methods were applied and are detailed in the full guideline and the technical reports and outlined in Figure 1 and available at. The process aligns with all elements of the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II tool for quality guideline assessment. This involved extensive evidence synthesis and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework covering evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation, and ultimately recommendation strength. Evidence synthesis methods are outlined in the full guideline and followed best practice. – Categories include evidence-based or consensus recommendations with accompanying clinical practice points (Table 1).

Terms include "should", "could", and "should not", are informed by the nature of the recommendation (evidence or consensus), the GRADE framework and quality of the evidence and are independent descriptors reflecting the judgement of the multidisciplinary GDG including consumers. They refer to overall interpretation and practical application of the recommendation, balancing benefits and harms. "Should" is used where benefits of the recommendation exceed harms, and where the recommendation can be trusted to guide practice. "Could" is used where either the quality of evidence was limited or the available studies demonstrate little clear advantage of one approach over another, or the balance of benefits to harm was unclear. "Should not" is used where there is either a lack of appropriate evidence, or the harms may outweigh the benefits.

The GRADE of the recommendation is determined by the GDG based on comprehensive structured consideration of all elements of the GRADE framework, including desirable effects, undesirable effects, balance of effects, resource requirements and cost effectiveness, equity, acceptability and feasibility and includes:

* Conditional recommendation against the option;
 Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison;

### Recurrence rate after "One-step" COFiber laser vaporization versus cystectomy for ovarian endometrioma: a 3-year follow-up study [^116kDCUW]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To assess postoperative recurrence rates in patients with endometriomas managed by either "one-step" CO 2 fiber laser vaporization or cystectomy.

Design

Retrospective study with prospective recording of data.

Setting

University hospital.

Patients

One hundred twenty-five patients with symptomatic endometriomas.

Interventions

Patients underwent a standardized laparoscopic stripping technique (group 1) or cyst vaporization with CO 2 fiber laser (group 2). After surgery, patients were incorporated in a prolonged surveillance program with periodic clinical follow-up to check for recurrence of the cyst and/or recurrence of symptoms. Endometrioma recurrence was defined as an ovarian cyst (> 10 mm) with a typical aspect arising on the operated ovary identified by transvaginal ultrasound.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary endpoint was the comparison of recurrence rates between the 2 groups. The secondary endpoint was the evaluation of endometriosis-related pain recurrence in the 2 groups. Other endpoints selected for analysis included the identification of risk factors for the recurrence of endometrioma and of endometriosis-related symptoms. The mean follow-up was 29 ± 13 months (range, 13–49). Recurrence of ovarian endometriosis was recorded in 6.3% of patients (n = 4) treated with cystectomy and in 4.9% of patients (n = 3) managed with CO 2 fiber laser (p = .74). Recurrence of endometriosis-related pain was observed in 5 patients (7.8%) in group 1 and in 6 patients (9.8%) in group 2 (p = .67). Mean endometrioma diameter > 5 cm at the time of surgery was identified as the only independent poor prognostic indicator for cyst recurrence (p = .008; odds ratio [OR], 2.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.19–3.32). Moreover, the presence of deep endometriosis at surgery (p = .032; OR, 4.60; 95% CI, 1.14–18.57) and discontinuation of hormonal treatment (p = .015; OR, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.25–8.06) were independent poor prognostic indicators for pain recurrence.

Conclusion

This study suggests that one-step CO 2 fiber laser vaporization may be effective for endometrioma treatment because it is associated with recurrence rates comparable with those occurring after cystectomy, with the advantage of being an ovarian tissue-sparing technique.

Patient Selection

Diagnosis

Historically, a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis required laparoscopic lesion visualization and excision with histologic confirmation of endometrial gland, endometrial stroma, and/or hemosiderin-laden macrophage presence. However, even in the absence of a definitive diagnosis, many professional society treatment recommendations permit the use of empiric therapy when there is a strong suspicion or clinical evidence of endometriosis. For example, guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) give a Level B recommendation to empiric therapy with a 3-month course of a GnRH agonist in women with chronic pelvic pain who have undergone an appropriate pretreatment evaluation and in whom oral contraceptives and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have failed, noting the patient should be informed that treatment response does not confirm an endometriosis diagnosis.

The criteria for suspecting endometriosis differ among guidelines, but generally include the presence of pelvic pain symptoms (progressively worsening dysmenorrhea [particularly when severe and unresponsive to NSAIDs and/or hormonal-based therapies], NMPP, and deep dyspareunia), which may be augmented by physical findings (e.g. pelvic tenderness and nodularity on palpation of the uterosacral ligaments and rectovaginal septum), imaging results, and/or cyclical nongynecologic symptoms (dyschezia, dysuria, hematuria and rectal bleeding, diarrhea/irritable bowel syndrome, and shoulder pain). When symptoms are cyclic in nature and progressive over time, endometriosis is by far the most likely clinical diagnosis.

It is increasingly recognized that identification of endometriosis can be achieved with reasonable certainty using nonsurgical methodologies (i.e. a clinical diagnosis), which include evaluation of pelvic pain symptoms, patient history, physical examination findings, and appropriately performed imaging studies. Although there has yet to be identified a replacement test or tests for diagnostic surgery, clinicians with expertise in endometriosis diagnosis and management have suggested that symptoms, patient history, and clinical assessments taken in totality provide a basis for clinical diagnosis.

The benefits of undertaking a clinical diagnosis approach are that it does not require surgery and the attendant risks thereof, utilizes assessment tools that are readily available to most clinicians, and may reduce the delay frequently observed in endometriosis diagnosis. In clinical practice, presumptive diagnosis of endometriosis is often made without laparoscopy or other surgical procedure, and can facilitate early and effective management of patients' symptoms.

### Endometriosis: clinical features, MR imaging findings and pathologic correlation [^115f4cZQ]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Endometriosis is a chronic condition affecting women during the reproductive lifespan. Diagnosis of endometriosis must take into account clinical symptoms, physical examination, laboratory tests and different imaging techniques. Since pelvic anatomy is complex and may vary with distortion by invasive endometriosis, the radiologist must be aware of both normal and deranged anatomy.

The ideal purpose of surgery is a therapeutic and effective intervention based on a careful preoperative evaluation. From this point of view, the role of MR imaging to help diagnose and plan surgical strategy is critical in the management of the disease. Preoperative detection of all endometriotic lesions is recommended to choose the surgical approach and to plan a multidisciplinary team work. This multidisciplinary approach including radiologists, gynaecologists, urologists, gastrointestinal surgeons, and (in selected cases) neurosurgeons, is recommended to improve diagnostic imaging accuracy and patients' outcome, and to reduce postoperative complication rates. The recent awareness that endometriosis may be medically treated based on strong clinical suspicion and that laparoscopy should be intended for surgical treatment, not for diagnostic purposes, furtherly enhance the role of non-invasive diagnostic procedures and particularly of MR imaging.

In any case, due to the complexity of the disease, it is appropriate to centralize the overall care of endometriosis patients to reference centres in order to pursue a patient-centred approach tailored to the patient's specific condition and desires.

### Endometriosis: current concepts and therapy [^113WDPMv]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is the growth of endometrial tissue in ectopic locations. The clinical picture is extremely pleiomorphic, which can make the diagnosis difficult. Despite 70 years of theories and experimentation, the cause is not clear, and it is likely that more than one mechanism is at work in most patients. Both medical and surgical treatments are available. In each case, the woman and her physician should formulate a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses the primary complaint as well as the patient's reproductive desires.

Introduction

Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue (glands and stroma) outside the uterine cavity; it is found primarily in the pelvis and can involve all organs but particularly the ovaries and pelvic peritoneum. It is a common condition affecting an unknown number of women of reproductive age. Typical symptoms include pain and subfertility, and the complexity and severity of the pain can present major management challenges 1, 2. Dysmenorrhoea affects up to 62% of women with endometriosis, and is incapacitating in up to 28% 3.

Definitive diagnosis requires laparoscopy or laparotomy and histological confirmation, but there is often a protracted time to diagnosis (mean of 8.0 and 11.7 years in the UK and USA, respectively) 4, due to the complexity of the presenting symptoms. The annual economic costs associated with delays in diagnosis are substantial and were estimated at approximately $50 billion in the United States 5. Management of pain symptoms often combines analgesia, hormonal therapies such as hormonal contraceptives, progestagens (either systemic or more commonly local delivery of levonorgestrel to the uterus), or gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues. Surgical treatments include ablation or excision of endometriotic lesions or ovarian cystectomy and occasionally hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo‐oophorectomy. The treatment of associated subfertility is challenging and may be surgical or by the use of assisted reproduction such as IVF. However, surgery carries risks of complications which may themselves compromise fertility. Finally, adhesiolysis and treatment of lesions carries a risk of injury to all pelvic structures 6. These treatment modalities vary in their effectiveness in relieving the pain and increasing pregnancy rates, and also in their side‐effect profiles 7.

The concentration of a range of inflammatory mediators – cytokines, growth factors, eicosanoids, and angiogenic factors – is altered in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis 8, 9, 10. Disturbance of several of the immunomodulators has been implicated in the endometriosis‐associated infertility 11. Here, we review the relationship between endometriosis and clear cell and endometrioid ovarian cancers and the experimental models that may be used to investigate the mechanisms underlying disease progression.

### Recurrence of endometriomas after laparoscopic removal: sonographic and clinical follow-up and indication for second surgery [^115VZs9Z]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Study Objective

This study involved patients who, after laparoscopic surgery, had recurrence of endometriomas detected by sonography. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of transvaginal sonography (TVS) in the management of recurrent endometriomas and to establish ultrasonographic criteria that would direct the therapy toward additional surgery versus medical or expectant management.

Design

Retrospective analysis of 62 reproductive-age women who showed recurrence of endometriomas on TVS after laparoscopic removal of an ovarian endometrioma by the stripping technique (Canadian Task Force classification II-1).

Setting

Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, University of Rome Tor Vergata.

Patients

Sixty-two patients with recurrent endometriomas after first-line treatment with laparoscopy.

Interventions

Ultrasonographic follow-up and/or second surgery.

Measurements and Main Results

Recurrence of an ovarian endometrioma was defined as the presence of ovarian cysts with the typical sonographic criteria of endometriomas and a diameter of more than 10 mm. The clinical and sonographic postoperative follow-up period lasted from 6 to 97 months (median 24.6) after the first procedure. Of 62 patients with recurrent endometriomas, 50 had recurrence on the treated ovary, 7 on the contralateral untreated ovary, and 5 on both the treated and untreated ovaries. Recurrence of endometriomas was associated with symptoms (pain or infertility) in 47 patients (76%), while the remaining 15 (24%) were asymptomatic. Of the 47 symptomatic patients with recurrence detected by TVS, a second procedure was performed in 15. Second surgery in these patients was indicated by the larger size of the recurrent cysts, a poor response to medical treatment, the presence on TVS of pelvic adhesions and nodules of deep endometriosis, and overall progression of the disease. Symptomatic patients who did not undergo a second procedure (32) had smaller recurrent endometriomas. However of the 31 symptomatic patients with large recurrent endometriomas (> 3 cm), only 45% had repeat surgery.

Conclusion

Recurrent endometriomas, as detected by TVS, can remain asymptomatic and do not necessarily progress in size with or without medical treatment. The decision to reoperate depends less on the endometrioma's size than on symptoms, in particular severe pain, and failure of medical treatment. However such patients are also more likely to have signs of deep nodules and adnexal/bowel adhesions and larger endometriomas on TVS scan, thus predisposing them to require a second procedure.

### Ovarian reserve following laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy vs cyst deroofing for endometriomas [^113nY1hf]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Because laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy of endometriomas is known to adversely impact patient ovarian reserve, the search for other techniques of surgical management is ongoing. The present study was undertaken to evaluate laparoscopic cyst deroofing as a feasible alternative.

Study Design

Prospective, randomized clinical trial (Canadian Task Force classification I).

Setting

University maternity hospital.

Patients

Women diagnosed with unilateral or bilateral ovarian endometriomas.

Interventions

Patients were managed with either laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy or cyst deroofing.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 122 women with endometriomas were randomized to either laparoscopic cystectomy (group 1) or laparoscopic cyst deroofing (group 2). The primary endpoint was the effect on ovarian reserve based on changes in anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) values. At 1 month postsurgery, anti-Müllerian hormone values were significantly decreased (p < .001) from preoperative values, from 4.25 ± 0.87 ng/mL to 1.66 ± 1.02 ng/mL in group 1 and from 4.2 ± 1.69 ng/mL to 2.15 ± 1.48 ng/mL in group 2. In addition, antral follicle count and ovarian volume decreased significantly (p < .001) in both groups by 1 month postsurgery. The decreases in these 3 parameters were more significant (p < .001) in group 1 than in group 2.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic cyst deroofing of endometriomas appears to be a promising alternative to laparoscopic cystectomy, with less postoperative decrease in ovarian reserve; however, the higher rate of endometrioma recurrence warrants future clinical research to determine the optimal surgical management of endometriomas.

### Postmenopausal endometriosis [^113cuGXw]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Patient's perspective

I was relieved by the result of the tumour showed a benign tumour. However, I understand that the tumour may have the possibility to convert into cancer and therefore I should maintain my physical health well. I will also come for a routine gynaecology check-up to make sure the tumour has not grown back.

Learning points

Postmenopausal endometriosis is rare and may present with signs and symptoms suggestive of malignancy.
Approximately 2–3% of patients with ovarian endometrioma are at risk of developing malignant transformation into ovarian cancer, particularly clear cell carcinoma and endometrioid type carcinoma.
Comprehensive surgical management and follow-up after surgery are recommended in such cases. The risk of malignant transformation might originate from microscopic lesions from the ruptured mass during surgery.

FERTILITY CONSIDERATIONS

Endometriosis in general is associated with infertility, although a causal relationship has not been proven. The specific contributions of endometriomas and other features of endometriosis to infertility are difficult to separate. Endometriomas contain increased concentrations of free iron, reactive oxygen species, and proteolytic enzymes that have been demonstrated to negatively affect surrounding ovarian tissue. A number of studies have documented decreased anti-müllerian hormone levels in patients with unoperated endometriomas. Among a series of patients with unilateral endometriomas undergoing oocyte retrieval, a decreased response to ovarian stimulation was observed on the endometrioma-containing ovary compared with the contralateral ovary. However, patients with and without endometriomas undergoing assisted reproduction cycles appear to have similar live birth rates. This may be caused in part by compensation by the contralateral ovary in patients with unilateral endometriomas, as well as a selection bias in which patients with endometriomas are more likely to cancel assisted reproduction cycles.

Cystectomy is associated with an increased spontaneous pregnancy rate for patients with a history of subfertility. For patients planning medically assisted reproduction for endometriosis-related infertility, no benefit of endometrioma surgery on pregnancy rate or live birth rates has been shown in two large meta-analyses. In addition, the rate of cycle cancellation attributable to poor ovarian response or failed oocyte retrieval has been shown to be significantly higher among patients who underwent surgery for endometrioma compared with patients who did no undergo surgery. The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology guidelines (2022) recommend against routine surgery for endometrioma before assisted reproduction cycles for the sole purpose of improving reproductive outcomes, given the lack of benefit and potential for harm, although surgery may still be appropriate for treatment of symptoms or in cases in which the location of cysts prevents oocyte retrieval. In contrast, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine 2012 guidelines recommend that patients with American Society for Reproductive Medicine stage III–IV endometriosis with endometrioma larger than 4 cm should consider cystectomy for diagnosis, oocyte access, and possibly ovarian response. Of note, some studies comparing pregnancy rates after second endometriosis surgery with proceeding with in vitro fertilization have not shown a benefit of repeat surgery. –

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Best practice evidence-based guideline development methods were applied and are detailed in the full guideline and the technical reports and outlined in Figure 1 and available at. The process aligns with all elements of the AGREEII tool for quality guideline assessment. This involved extensive evidence synthesis and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework covering evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation, and ultimately recommendation strength. Evidence synthesis methods are outlined in the full guideline and followed best practice. Categories include evidence-based or consensus recommendations with accompanying clinical practice points (Table 1).

Terms include "should", "could", and "should not", are informed by the nature of the recommendation (evidence or consensus), the GRADE framework and quality of the evidence and are independent descriptors reflecting the judgement of the multidisciplinary guideline development group (GDG), including consumers. They refer to overall interpretation and practical application of the recommendation, balancing benefits and harms. "Should" is used where benefits of the recommendation exceed harms, and where the recommendation can be trusted to guide practice. "Could" is used where either the quality of evidence was limited or the available studies demonstrate little clear advantage of one approach over another, or the balance of benefits to harm was unclear. "Should not" is used where there is either a lack of appropriate evidence, or the harms may outweigh the benefits.

The GRADE of the recommendation is determined by the guideline development group based on comprehensive structured consideration of all elements of the GRADE framework, including desirable effects, undesirable effects, balance of effects, resource requirements and cost effectiveness, equity, acceptability and feasibility and includes:

* Conditional recommendation against the option;
 Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison;
* Conditional recommendation for the option;
Strong recommendation for the option.

Quality of the evidence is categorized according to: the number and design of studies addressing the outcome; judgments about the quality of the studies and/or synthesized evidence, such as risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and any other considerations that may influence the quality of the evidence; key statistical data; and classification of the importance of the outcomes (Table 2). The quality of evidence reflects the extent of confidence in an estimate of the effect to support a particular recommendation and was largely determined by the expert evidence synthesis team.
