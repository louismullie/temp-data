## Question

What are the common indications for Uro MP medication?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common indications for Uro-MP and how to contextualize its use relative to standard UTI care and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indications and whether they imply treatment of infection or only symptom relief. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic rationale and whether it supports infection control or purely symptomatic management. Next, I will compare these labeled uses with contemporary UTI guidelines to ensure alignment or identify conflicts. After that, I should consider special populations and contraindications that would modify use. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable summary with appropriate cautions and counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the labeled indications so I don't overstate anything. The FDA labeling for Uro-MP states it is indicated for the treatment of symptoms of irritative voiding, relief of local symptoms such as inflammation, hypermotility, and pain accompanying lower urinary tract infections, and relief of urinary tract symptoms caused by diagnostic procedures; importantly, it does not claim to treat the underlying infection itself, which is a key distinction I need to preserve [^115xqETS] [^112dWi5c] [^115mGKN2] [^111oqZgk] [^1152xUoP] [^113Dishp].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacologic rationale to ensure I'm not inferring antimicrobial efficacy where it doesn't exist. Methenamine requires acidic urine to generate formaldehyde and exerts bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects in that narrow pH window, while sodium phosphate monobasic helps acidify urine to enable methenamine activation; phenyl salicylate provides mild analgesia, methylene blue adds weak antiseptic properties, and hyoscyamine offers antispasmodic smooth muscle relaxation, which together target dysuria, frequency, urgency, and bladder spasms rather than eradicating active infection per se [^114542Hh] [^113EYTHF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using Uro-MP as primary therapy for UTI. Contemporary guidelines for acute uncomplicated cystitis and complicated UTI prioritize culture-directed antibiotics as first-line treatment, with nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, or fosfomycin commonly recommended based on local resistance patterns; methenamine-containing regimens are not endorsed as treatment for active infection, reinforcing that Uro-MP's role is adjunctive symptom control rather than definitive antimicrobial therapy [^115fXgm6] [^115RNX8k] [^114H5gB2].

> I should double-check where methenamine fits in guideline-based care so I don't misapply it. Methenamine hippurate is recognized as a non-antibiotic prophylactic option for recurrent UTI prevention after infection eradication, leveraging its urinary formaldehyde mechanism to suppress bacteriuria without driving resistance; this is distinct from treating acute infection and supports the conceptual separation between Uro-MP's symptomatic role and methenamine's prophylactic role in rUTI strategies [^113oJ9jL] [^1165uq3u] [^114H5gB2].

> Next, I should review special populations and contraindications to ensure safe use. Uro-MP is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any component and should be used with caution or avoided in those with cardiac disease, glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, gastrointestinal obstruction, or obstructive uropathy due to risk of urinary retention; it is not recommended in children six years and younger, and pregnancy category C labeling advises use only if clearly needed given placental transfer of hyoscyamine and methenamine, with similar caution during breastfeeding [^1116N3Mc] [^115TnD3r] [^115vcfi8].

> Let me consider the practical clinical scenarios where Uro-MP is reasonable. It can be used as adjunctive therapy to relieve irritative voiding symptoms during an active lower urinary tract infection while definitive antibiotic therapy is provided, and it may be appropriate short term after urologic diagnostic procedures such as cystoscopy or urodynamics to mitigate procedural irritation; in both cases, counseling on expected blue-green discoloration of urine and anticholinergic side effects is important, and clinicians should monitor for adverse effects like tachycardia, blurred vision, or urinary retention, especially in older adults [^115xqETS] [^116yysD7].

> But wait, what if someone proposes Uro-MP as an antibiotic-sparing treatment for acute UTI? I need to ensure I correct that misconception. The evidence base and labeling do not support using Uro-MP to eradicate infection; guideline-concordant antimicrobial therapy remains the standard for acute UTI, and relying on Uro-MP alone risks undertreatment and complications, so it should be framed explicitly as symptom control alongside appropriate antibiotics when infection is present [^115xqETS] [^115RNX8k] [^112BXcnZ].

> I will now examine the bottom line to synthesize the indications succinctly. Uro-MP is indicated for symptomatic relief of irritative voiding associated with lower urinary tract infections and for relief of urinary tract symptoms caused by diagnostic procedures; it is a multi-component, non-antibiotic adjunct that addresses pain, spasm, and discomfort without treating the underlying infection, and its use should be aligned with standard UTI treatment pathways and patient-specific contraindications [^115xqETS] [^114542Hh] [^113EYTHF].

---

Uro-MP is indicated for **symptomatic relief of irritative voiding** [^115xqETS] due to lower urinary tract infections, including inflammation, hypermotility, and pain [^115xqETS]. It is also used for **symptom relief after diagnostic urologic procedures** [^111oqZgk] and for discomfort from catheterization or instrumentation [^notfound]. It is not indicated to treat the underlying infection [^notfound] and should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, or urinary retention risk [^1116N3Mc].

---

## Indications for Uro-MP

Uro-MP is indicated for the following clinical scenarios:

- **Irritative voiding symptoms**: Relief of local symptoms such as inflammation, hypermotility, and pain accompanying lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) [^115xqETS].

- **Diagnostic procedure-related symptoms**: Relief of urinary tract symptoms caused by diagnostic procedures, such as cystoscopy or catheterization [^115xqETS].

- **Catheterization or instrumentation discomfort**: Alleviation of discomfort associated with urinary catheterization or other urologic instrumentation [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios for Uro-MP use

Uro-MP is commonly used in the following clinical scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) | Symptomatic relief of dysuria, frequency, urgency, and suprapubic discomfort [^115xqETS] |
| Diagnostic urologic procedures | Relief of symptoms following cystoscopy, catheterization, or other urologic instrumentation [^111oqZgk] |
| Catheterization discomfort | Alleviation of discomfort associated with urinary catheterization [^notfound] |

---

## Limitations and precautions

While Uro-MP is effective for symptomatic relief, it is **not indicated to treat the underlying infection** [^113wS4eQ]. Patients should receive appropriate antimicrobial therapy if an infection is present. Additionally, the following precautions should be considered:

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Use with caution in patients with cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, or mitral stenosis [^1116N3Mc].

- **Glaucoma**: Contraindicated in patients with glaucoma due to the anticholinergic effects of hyoscyamine [^notfound].

- **Myasthenia gravis**: Use with caution due to potential exacerbation of symptoms [^1116N3Mc].

- **Urinary retention**: Risk of acute urinary retention, particularly in patients with obstructive uropathy or prostatic hypertrophy [^1116N3Mc].

---

## Summary of indications

Uro-MP is primarily indicated for **symptomatic relief of irritative voiding symptoms** associated with lower urinary tract infections, diagnostic procedures, and catheterization or instrumentation discomfort. It is not intended to treat underlying infections and should be used with caution in patients with specific medical conditions.

DRUG INTERACTIONS

As a result of hyoscyamine's effects on gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying, absorption of other oral medications may be decreased during concurrent use with this combination medication.

Urinary alkalizers and thiazide diuretics: May cause the urine to become alkaline reducing the effectiveness of methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde.

Antimuscarinics: Concurrent use may intensify antimuscarinic effects of hyoscyamine because of secondary antimuscarinic activities of these medications.

Antacids/antidiarrheals: Concurrent use may reduce absorption of hyoscyamine resulting in decreased therapeutic effectiveness. Concurrent use with antacids may cause urine to become alkaline reducing the effectiveness of methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde. Doses of these medications should be spaced 1 hour apart from doses of hyoscyamine.

Antimyasthenics: Concurrent use with hyoscyamine may further reduce intestinal motility, therefore, caution is recommended.

Ketoconazole and hyoscyamine may cause increased gastrointestinal pH.

Concurrent administration with hyoscyamine may result in marked reduction in the absorption of ketoconazole. Patients should be advised to take this combination at least 2 hours after ketoconazole.

Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors: Concurrent use with hyoscyamine may intensify antimuscarinic side effects.

Opioid (narcotic) analgesics may result in increased risk of severe constipation.

Sulfonamides: These drugs may precipitate with formaldehyde in the urine increasing the danger of crystalluria.

Patients should be advised that the urine and/or stools may become blue to blue-green as a result of the excretion of methylene blue.

Drug Abuse And Dependence

A dependence on the use of Uro-MP Capsules has not been reported and due to the nature of its ingredients, abuse of Uro-MP Capsules is not expected.

### Dosage and duration of medication for men with lower urinary tract symptoms: two questions without definitive answers [^114zKk6Z]. Current Opinion in Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In this review, the dosage and duration of medication in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia are discussed. There is no official guideline, however, and even no professional agreement on these points.

Recent Findings

Considering the dosage, dose-titration is probably not a drawback as there is a high risk of undertreatment or overtreatment when using a single dosage for every patient. Duration of treatment is a matter of concern. A quarter of patients discontinue their treatment early. For the others, a long period of treatment may be mandatory for those patients who are at risk of progression. After a course of medication (6 months to 1 year), a trial without treatment may help to decide whether treatment must be continued if symptoms relapse.

Summary

For men with lower urinary tract symptoms, there seems to be no definitive answer about the appropriate dosage and duration of medicine.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^116bZiyi]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association guideline scope and limitations — these guidelines "do not necessarily establish the standard of care" and "represent not absolute mandates but provisional proposals for treatment", and "the guidelines do not pre-empt physician judgment in individual cases". "Conformance with any clinical guideline does not guarantee a successful outcome". The text may include information about certain drug uses "off label", and the AUA "urges strict compliance with all government regulations and protocols for prescription and use of these substances", with physicians encouraged to follow all prescribing information.

### Urologic complications of nonurologic medications [^1168r7pE]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

A physician must be aware of common drug side effects and interactions before prescribing a certain agent. In addition to the drugs that we, as urologists, prescribe, we must also be aware of the urologic side effects of drugs that are commonly prescribed by nonurologists. The mechanisms of the pharmacologic causes for voiding dysfunction, erectile and sexual dysfunction, infertility, and urolithiasis are often mutifactorial and incompletely understood. The recognition and association of a particular drug's potential side effects may save valuable time and money involved in the workup of a patient with a new urologic complaint. It is incumbent on the practicing urologist to be able to recognize the common, and sometimes subtle, urologic complications of medications that are used for nonurologic conditions.

### Methenamine, sodium phosphate, monobasic, anhydrous, phenyl salicylate, methylene blue and hyoscyamine sulfate (uro-MP) [^114542Hh]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

METHENAMINE degrades in an acidic urine environment releasing formaldehyde which provides bactericidal or bacteriostatic action. It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. 70 to 90% reaches the urine unchanged at which point it is hydrolyzed if the urine is acidic. Within 24 hours it is almost completely (90%) excreted; of this amount at pH 5, approximately 20% is formaldehyde. Protein binding - some formaldehyde is bound to substances in the urine and surrounding tissues. Methenamine is freely distributed to body tissue and fluids but is not clinically significant as it does not hydrolyze at a pH greater than 6.8.

SODIUM PHOSPHATE MONOBASIC an acidifier, helps to maintain an acid pH in the urine necessary for the degradation of methenamine.

PHENYL SALICYLATE releases salicylate, a mild analgesic for pain.

METHYLENE BLUE possesses weak antiseptic properties. It is well absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and is rapidly reduced to leukomethylene blue which is stabilized in some combination form in the urine. 75% is excreted unchanged.

HYOSCYAMINE SULFATE is a parasympatholytic drug which relaxes smooth muscles and thus produces an antispasmodic effect. It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is rapidly distributed throughout the body tissues. Most is excreted in the urine within 12 hours, 13% to 50% being unchanged. Protein binding for hyoscyamine sulfate is moderate and biotransformation is hepatic.

### Compliance to international guidelines and rational use of antibiotics in urinary tract infections in a country without national guidance: a cross-sectional study [^11389yui]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in humans. Women are significantly more affected than men: one in three women will have at least one episode of UTI by the age of 24, and roughly 50% of women will experience a UTI in their lifetime.

UTIs are classified according to the site of infection (pyelonephritis, cystitis, urethritis and prostatitis) and the presence of risk factors for complications. While asymptomatic UTIs are left untreated in most cases according to guidelines, the high incidence of symptomatic UTIs that require antibiotics (ATBs) emphasises the need to ensure appropriate therapy with agents that maximise success and minimise the risk of resistance.

According to the WHO, rational drug use requires that patients receive drugs appropriate to their clinical condition, in doses that suit their needs, for an adequate period of time and at the lowest cost for themselves and their community.

### Appropriateness of oral drugs for long-term treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in older persons: results of a systematic literature review and international consensus validation process (LUTS-FORTA 2014) [^1165eXNV]. Age and Ageing (2015). Low credibility.

Procedure

The present expert rating procedure evolved from a previous conference during which the situation of older people with urinary incontinence was evaluated. The procedure was performed in the following steps:

- Identification of the rater team members: The initiators of the project (M.W. and M.O.) identified raters based on available information on the internet. Experts were eligible if they met the following criteria: geriatric internists/geriatricians, general practitioners or urologists with documented clinical experience in the pharmacotherapy of (multimorbid) older people; high academic status; prominent standing in the leading geriatric/urological medical associations; substantial number, quality and relevance of publications. Accordingly, five raters (K.B. D.C. E.C.K. M.K. A.W.) were identified who met those criteria and could also accept the invitation to participate.
- Selection of drugs to be assessed: In the first step, the initiators M.W. and M.O. selected groups of drugs used orally for long-term treatment of LUTS and listed relevant agents in each group. Urological drugs were chosen if they are typically used as long-term treatment. Given this limitation, antibiotics drugs were not considered. The proposed choice of drugs was refined by the raters who voted for removing non-oral drugs (e.g. oestrogen ointment).
- The relevant drug classes were 5α-reductase inhibitors, α 1 -blockers, antimuscarinics, β 3 -agonists and PDE5 inhibitors (Table 1). Medication codes using the WHO Drug Reference List, which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system, were added for completeness and to facilitate subsequent searches.
- Systematic literature review: A literature search in PubMed/Medline and the Cochrane library was performed in March 2014 using the search terms [drug name] in the INN terminology plus the standard filters [clinical trials] [full text available] [age 65+ years], and [age 80+ years]. The aim of the search was to identify appropriate clinical trials to examine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of drugs used for the treatment of LUTS in older people. A total of 835 abstracts were retrieved and reviewed by M.W. and M.O. for appropriateness, in particular whether the article explicitly reported results in the age groups ≥ 65 years, ≥ 70 years, ≥ 75 years, ≥ 80 years, ≥ 85 years. In a second step, [drug name] and the terms [elderly] or [older] in the title were searched. In total, 62 additional abstracts were retrieved and checked for appropriateness. A duplicate article was removed. Analysis of studies as full texts: A total of 34 potentially appropriate articles were identified. They were reviewed as full texts and key information extracted by M.W. and M.O. into an extensive Microsoft Excel file with particular focus on the presence of information on particular side effects (see). No attempt was made to contact authors to acquire additional data or unpublished data.
- Analysis of summary of product characteristics: The most recent summary of product characteristics (SmPC) was downloaded for all drugs from the EMA website, or if not available, from other reliable sources (e.g.). For generic drugs, the most frequently used brand was selected based on the prescription volume in Germany. The texts were thoroughly analysed by M.W. and M.O. using the same template as for the full texts above. From this material, the initiators, M.W. and M.O. derived a proposal for initial FORTA labels. The proposal together with the spreadsheet and full texts/abstracts were forwarded to the rater team for review and addition of further articles that were felt to be relevant.
- Two-step Delphi process: The initiators and members of the rater group convened at a meeting at the annual EAU congress in Stockholm on 15 April 2014 and were instructed by M.W. and M.O. about the process with particular focus on the FORTA procedure.

### Current and emerging strategies to curb antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infections [^113w9t1z]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2024). High credibility.

Rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria compromise patient outcomes and prolong hospital stays. Consequently, new strategies are needed to prevent and control the spread of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria. Over the past two decades, sizeable clinical efforts and research advances have changed urinary tract infection (UTI) treatment and prevention strategies to conserve antibiotic use. The emergence of antimicrobial stewardship, policies from national societies, and the development of new antimicrobials have shaped modern UTI practices. Future UTI management practices could be driven by the evolution of antimicrobial stewardship, improved and readily available diagnostics, and an improved understanding of how the microbiome affects UTI. Forthcoming UTI treatment and prevention strategies could employ novel bactericidal compounds, combinations of new and classic antimicrobials that enhance bacterial killing, medications that prevent bacterial attachment to uroepithelial cells, repurposing drugs, and vaccines to curtail the rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria and improve outcomes in people with UTI.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^113zsepW]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) treatment research needs and medical therapy evidence gaps include that behavioral modifications and non-invasive treatments have been well studied and are relatively effective particularly in milder cases, yet they are time consuming or difficult to implement and adherence is limited by self-efficacy and discipline; individualized recommendations and phenotyping for biological and psychological attributes are proposed to personalize care. In medical therapy, many insurance providers mandate step therapy trialing one or more antimuscarinic medications before other therapies, evidence for advanced therapies in treatment-naive patients is scant, and a key unanswered question is the timepoint (in hours or days) after pharmacotherapy when maximum symptoms control is achieved; most studies assessed patient response at twelve weeks of follow-up even though steady state occurs within days.

### Methenamine, sodium phosphate, monobasic, methylene blue, and hyoscyamine sulfate (Urogesic blue) [^112dWi5c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

UROGESIC-BLUE™ is indicated for the treatment of symptoms of irritative voiding. Indicated for the relief of local symptoms, such as hypermotility which accompany lower urinary tract infections and as antispasmodic. Indicated for the relief of urinary tract symptoms caused by diagnostic procedures.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^113xRPiM]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU OAB medication substitution — In patients with OAB who experience intolerable side effects or who do not achieve adequate improvement with an OAB medication, clinicians may offer a different medication in the same class or a different class of medication to obtain greater tolerability and/or efficacy. (Clinical Principle) Overall, there are limited data that support substituting one agent for another; in one survey of patients with OAB who were enrolled in a regional medical group, 65% of the study population used only one antimuscarinic medication, while 35% used ≥ two during the follow-up period, and among those who switched to a different agent, none reported improvement in their frequency of UUI episodes; because β3 agonists appear to have lower rates of common side-effects as compared to antimuscarinic medications, switching to a β3 agonist may be more tolerable for patients while maintaining efficacy.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^113kSjAX]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Self-treatment with antibiotics for recurrent UTI — Self-treatment can be paired with standing physician orders for urine culture before and possibly after treatment, but compared with continuous prophylaxis it is associated with a higher rate of infection (2.2 UTI per year vs 0.2 UTI per year). Self-treatment is an option for women with the ability to reliably recognize UTI symptoms and start antibiotics, those not suitable for long-term prophylaxis, or those who do not wish to take long-term therapy, and patients should contact their clinician if symptoms progress or fail to resolve within 48 hours. Fluoroquinolones are not preferred agents for self-treatment regimens, and we recommend use of other agents whenever possible.

### Lower urinary tract symptom: still too much focus on the prostate? [^115FLN7v]. Current Opinion in Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms have historically been managed in a prostate centric fashion. Population studies highlighting the prevalence and significance of storage symptoms, including nocturia, have meant a shift in the way men with lower urinary tract symptoms are assessed and managed. We review the recent guidelines and publications that have addressed this change in approach.

Recent Findings

A new β-3 adrenoreceptor agonist has demonstrated significant improvement in storage symptoms and appears to be well tolerated.

Summary

We support a continued move towards a patient-focused and management using the current guidelines.

### Pharmacotherapy of urolithiasis: evidence from clinical trials [^112Tj8yd]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Urolithiasis is a worldwide problem with significant health and economic burdens. Medical therapy that alters the course of stone disease has enormous medical and financial impact. Urolithiasis is a final manifestation of a broad range of etiologies and pathogenesis. The modest progress in understanding the pathophysiology has hampered successful development of targeted therapy. Current regimens are based mostly on rational alteration of urinary biochemistry and physical chemistry to lower the risk of precipitation. In terms of pharmacotherapy, there are drugs to successfully improve hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia, aciduria, hyperuricosuria, and hypercystinuria. These agents have been proven to be effective in randomized controlled trials in improving urinary biochemical and physicochemical risk factors, as well as clinical outcomes. Although our current regimens have clearly improved the management and lives of stone formers, there are still clearly identifiable immense voids in the knowledge of pathophysiology of stone disease that can be filled with combined basic science and clinical studies.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^112q9TeR]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU overactive bladder — use of urodynamics: Clinicians may perform urodynamics in patients with OAB who do not adequately respond to pharmacotherapy or minimally invasive therapies or procedures to further evaluate bladder function and exclude other disorders (Clinical Principle), and UDS are not required to make the diagnosis of OAB. Detrusor overactivity (DO) can be seen in 20% of asymptomatic patients and is seen in about 50% of women with OAB, and the urodynamic presence of DO does not predict the success of medical therapy for OAB; except for cases with elevated PVR requiring further management, no urodynamic parameter is an absolute contraindication to an interventional therapy trial. UDS may be particularly helpful when a physician is suspicious of other diagnoses, and UDS should be considered in patients with OAB and suspicion of poor bladder compliance.

### Recalcitrant chronic bladder pain and recurrent cystitis but negative urinalysis: what should we do? [^115q49hU]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

In summary, the evolved treatment strategy is as follows: UTI diagnosis rests on symptoms, signs and microscopic pyuria. Without the latter, we do not initiate antibiotic treatment. We combine methenamine hippurate with a first-generation, narrow-spectrum antibiotic against urinary infection to find a tolerated regime that mediates a symptomatic response and a reduction in pyuria. If urethral pain and dysuria are prominent, macrolides and tetracyclines are favoured. We continue treatment until symptom control is optimal and pyuria has cleared before trialling treatment withdrawal. More than one cycle is frequently required to achieve lasting symptom resolution.

We provide all patients who have completed their treatment with a short course of first-generation antibiotic used for urinary infection that can be self-initiated at the very first hint of symptom resurgence. Patients are advised to take 3–7 days of antimicrobial treatment, dependening on how quickly the new symptoms settle, and this approach is advocated to prevent chronic symptoms reasserting themselves after an acute infection. In the medium term, this approach seems to be effective, although we have yet to collect data on the long-term success of this strategy.

Given these data, an RCT is the next logical step. We believe that the correct design should be a comparative trial of the management protocol evolved here against treatment stipulated by current guidelines. We hope that these data will help in the design of future studies.

### Medical treatment for urinary tract infections [^113wS4eQ]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

### Appropriateness of oral drugs for long-term treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in older persons: results of a systematic literature review and international consensus validation process (LUTS-FORTA 2014) [^113UFTsG]. Age and Ageing (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations of the study

It is possible that some inconsistencies were related to the multidisciplinary nature of this Delphi exercise. For instance, not all of the respondents had equal practical experience with the various drugs (e.g. mirabegron was launched in June 2014 in Germany and Spain but is still not available in France). Furthermore, the group was small and a larger set of experts (also from additional countries) might come to slightly different conclusions. However, the degree of consensus was notable given the fact that experts with different specialisations voted without knowing their colleagues' opinions. This is in line with the degree of rating consensus for the first round of the Delphi process for the published FORTA list which was almost the same (92%) for a much larger group of raters (20 from different countries).

As the raters were collectively instructed about FORTA at the inaugural meeting, anonymity could not be warranted; however, communication of any voting opinion was suppressed at this meeting, and independence was ensured by formal agreement on not communicating the individual votes during the Delphi rounds.

Consensus aspects cannot be excluded from drug assessments in older people as limited evidence is the rule rather than the exception, and integration of all data including SmPC undoubtedly relies on personal assessment. This is underlined by the fact that even in the fesoterodine studies of older patients, those with significant cognitive impairment at baseline were excluded from participation, illustrating a typical gap of clinical evidence.

In some larger studies, which included patients with a mean age of 60–65 years with a typical age distribution, a substantial proportion of elderly/geriatric patients will be present but not reported separately. If the subgroups were not explicitly reported, these data remained unnoticed in our systematic review. For urological drugs, a limited amount of scientific evidence is currently available for the evaluation of active substances, potential therapeutic alternatives and indicated monitoring procedures.

Although SmPC were thought to yield unpublished information, some valuable information from trials may not be detected by the screening procedure. The experiences from uncontrolled trials or even case reports are lost in such an approach, but they may add relevant information. The gold standard would have been a qualified meta-analysis which, however, would have failed in most instances or not added information as in most instances only singular or heterogeneous studies could have been included.

FORTA does not specifically address drug–drug interactions or contraindications that still need to be checked individually. Thus, (in)appropriateness in general terms does not necessarily imply the same in individual patients.

Stone disease may also be induced by drugs that are used to treat a number of disease processes. When this occurs, the drug will usually need to be discontinued and alternative therapy should be instituted.

Methods

Study design

This was a retrospective, descriptive, observational database study of LUTS treatment in the UK primary care setting. Data were extracted from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD, a national longitudinal primary care database, which contains anonymized electronic health records of over 15.6 million patients (September 2018 version). Only de-identified data were obtained, and patients could opt out if they did not wish to have their data used for research purposes. CPRD GOLD was linked to the Hospital Episode Statistic database in England for the exploration of resource use, and the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). The IMD provides an indication of patients' socio-economic status measured at the GP surgery level. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^112BXcnZ]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI — In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, sepsis or septic shock, immunocompromised states, severe renal insufficiency, and functional or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and some patients in these subpopulations may need an individualized plan of therapy. An effective antimicrobial agent means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

### Urodynamic studies in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^113pejSY]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The authors of this guideline reviewed the literature regarding use of urodynamic testing in common lower urinary tract symptoms. The findings are intended to assist clinicians in the appropriate selection of urodynamic tests, following an evaluation and symptom characterization.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review of the literature using the MEDLINE® and EMBASE databases (searched from 1/1/90 to 3/10/11) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications relevant to using urodynamic tests for diagnosis, determining prognosis, guiding clinical management decisions and improving patient outcomes in patients with various urologic conditions. The review yielded an evidence base of 393 studies after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the evidence basis for characterizing the statements presented in the guideline as Standards, Recommendations or Options. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate) or C (low). In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion.

Results

The evidence-based guideline statements are provided for diagnosis and overall management of common LUTS conditions.

Conclusions

The Panel recognizes that each patient presenting with LUTS is unique. This Guideline is intended to serve as a tool facilitating the most effective utilization of urodynamic testing as part of a comprehensive evaluation of patients presenting with LUTS.

Adverse Events

The incidence of adverse events in clinical trials of SGLT2i is similar to that observed with other anti-diabetic drugs. The overall incidence of adverse events has ranged from 57.3 to 83.0%, while that of serious adverse events have varied between 1.0% and 12.6%.

Uro-genital tract infections are the most frequently noticed adverse events in subjects on SGLT2i, especially in women and in uncircumcised men. Pooled data from 12 placebo-controlled clinical trials of dapagliflozin reveal that when used in dose 2.5, 5, and 10 mg per day, the incidence of clinically diagnosed uro-genital tract infection was 4.1%, 5.7% and 4.8%, respectively, while it was 0.9% in the placebo group. Common infections include vulvitis and vulvo-vaginitis in women, as well as balanitis and balanoposthitis in men. These can be prevented by maintaining adequate perineal hygiene, and through treatment with antifungal therapy. Genital infections are thought to be caused by an increased glucose load in the urinary tract, which encourages fungal growth. The incidence of urinary tract infections does not increase with SGLT2i therapy.

### Appropriateness of oral drugs for long-term treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in older persons: results of a systematic literature review and international consensus validation process (LUTS-FORTA 2014) [^111aYJHz]. Age and Ageing (2015). Low credibility.

When used appropriately, there are health benefits associated with multiple appropriate drugs but adverse reactions reported by the Food and Drug Administration tripled between 1995 and 2005. These reactions have been shown to be the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Choosing the right drug, for the right patient, at the right time, is also critically important in the management of LUTS in older people, because they are highly prevalent and bothersome in both men and women.

The FORTA (Fit fOR The Aged) classification was introduced in 2008 with the aim of guiding physicians in their screening process for inappropriate or harmful medications and drug omissions in older patients in an everyday clinical setting. FORTA represents the first classification system in which both negative and positive labelling is combined at the level of individual drug or drug groups. The system aims at the individual indications (implicit listing requiring patient characteristics/diagnoses) and is therefore different from negative lists such as the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria list, the STOPP (Screening Tool of Older Person's Prescriptions) criteria or the German PRISCUS list. Involving a two-step Delphi process and rating by a total of 25 experts, the FORTA classification has led to a listing (FORTA list) of > 200 different drugs/drug groups for over 20 main therapeutic areas with relevance to older people which is continuously expanded and refined.

In brief (for details, see ref.), the FORTA classification labels, depending on the state of evidence for safety, efficacy and overall age-appropriateness, are assigned for individual drugs as follows:

- Class A (absolutely): indispensable drug, clear-cut benefit in terms of efficacy/safety ratio proven for a given indication in older people.
- Class B (beneficial): drugs with proven or obvious efficacy in older people, but limited extent of effect or safety concerns.
- Class C (careful): drugs with questionable efficacy/safety profiles in older people, to be avoided or omitted in the presence of too many other drugs, lack of benefits or emerging side effects; review/find alternatives.
- Class D (don't): avoid in older people, omit first, review/find alternatives.

1 Introduction

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs that may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. Use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments; prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTI may be inappropriate, which contributes to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Current treatment guidelines from the American Urological Society (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture‐proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women to 16% in older women in the community and as high as 50% for older women in long‐term care facilities, demonstrating why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to current clinical practice guidelines. Patients who have been inappropriately treated with antibiotics for a UTI (e.g. treating those with asymptomatic bacteriuria) have worse outcomes, which may include subsequent infections with multidrug‐resistant organisms or substantial medication side effects. Patients who have an inappropriate initial antibiotic prescription are also subjected to additional drug costs and are at risk of antibiotic switching which can cost up to $2000 more per patient.

Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of UTIs produce worse patient outcomes, increased healthcare costs, and higher societal antibiotic burden. The goals of our study were to evaluate the factors associated with inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of cystitis in the outpatient setting in a set of patients diagnosed with UTI without signs of bacteremia.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^1151WYAL]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

The effectiveness of continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis against UTIs in users of CISC who had repeated episodes increases the number of patient groups with repeated or chronic infections who have been shown to benefit from this strategy. The increased frequency of antimicrobial resistance in potential urinary pathogens to antibiotics that are used for treatment of UTIs is a concern for individuals and for public health. Increased resistance occurred in the prophylaxis group despite reduced use of antibiotics to treat symptomatic UTIs. The mechanism by which low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis provides a benefit is uncertain. Our results show that episodes of symptomatic UTIs (indicating infection with urinary pathogens) are suppressed while the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (indicating urinary colonisation) was unchanged. It is possible that pathogenic bacterial strains with particular virulence factors are preferentially targeted by low-dose continuous therapy, or changes in the host response might be induced, allowing tolerance of colonisers but eradication of pathogens. Alternatively, bacteria colonising the bladder could be protected in specific niches that cannot be accessed by low urinary concentrations of antibiotic.

Evidence-based alternative ways of reducing the risk of UTIs and the severity of symptoms in women include non-antibiotic prophylaxis with methenamine hippurateand vaginal oestrogen supplementation; however, neither has been tested for CISC users. Frequency of use of non-antibiotic preventative strategies was similar in both groups of this trial: increased fluid intake, increased frequency of catheterisation, and ingestion of cranberry products and probiotics were the most popular interventions (data not shown). Cranberry extracts, although often taken, do not appear effective in reducing the risk of UTIs in CISC users.

An alternative antibiotic-based strategy is so-called self-start therapy, whereby patients have a supply of antibiotics at home and can start a treatment course when their typical symptoms occur. In the present trial, participants in the control group reported self-start therapy to be the source of their treatment antibiotics more often than the prophylaxis group, but we cannot speculate further from these data as to whether this treatment option is a viable alternative to continuous prophylaxis in our trial population.

### Comparison of treatments for preventing lower urinary tract symptoms after BCG immunotherapy of bladder tumors: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116TDxd3]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy is the standard adjuvant treatment for high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). However, BCG immunotherapy is commonly accompanied by significant lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) including symptoms such as urinary urgency, frequency, dysuria and pelvic pain. These symptoms can undermine treatment adherence and clinical outcomes. In this study, the treatments for preventing LUTS after BCG instillations were compared through a systemic review and network meta-analysis (NMA).

Methods

Eligible studies were obtained from the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. We also searched the references of the included studies. Our protocol followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist. We performed NMA using Review Manager 5.3 and STATA MP 18.0.

Result

The analysis included 6 studies with 556 participants. The results of the NMA revealed that celecoxib and prulifloxacin effectivelty reduce the incidence of LUTS including frequency, urgency and dysuria. Phenazopyridine showed the best performance in improving pelvic pain.

Conclusion

The NMA indicated that medications such as celecoxib, prulifloxacin and phenazopyridine are effective in reducing the incidence of LUTS after BCG immunotherapy of bladder tumors.

### Multimorbidity patterns, polypharmacy and their association with liver and kidney abnormalities in people over 65 years of age: a longitudinal study [^113i88gA]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Key results

This study informs on the use of medication by the elderly population during 5 years of follow up, according to the ten most common MP. Predictably, the most overrepresented drugs in each MP coincide with the most overrepresented disorders in that same MP. Also, the medicines most prescribed in the study population remain unchanged throughout the follow up period. The analysis of polypharmacy based on specific MP and their association with abnormal liver and kidney function has revealed that the patients included in the various MP present high rates of abnormal liver and kidney function when compared to the MP C1-Non-Specific, underlining the need for new safety criteria in these patients.

Polypharmacy and their evolution

In C2-Eye Impairment and Mental, the medicines most frequently prescribed correspond to the ocular disorders diagnosed. However, in other groups of diseases of this MP, for instance the Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform diseases, which correspond mainly to cigarette consumption, the pharmacological treatment is not subsidised by the public health system and consequently does not appear in the Pharmacy Invoice Registry.

In C3-Minority Metabolic Autoimmune-Inflammatory, over 50% of diseases are exclusive of this cluster. However, even if the medication is associated with overrepresented conditions, it does not have high exclusivity since these medicines have different authorised indications, for instance glucocorticoids and Vitamin D and analogues, which are even indicated off-label.

The MP C4-Cardio-Circulatory and Renal and C5-Cardio-Circulatory, Mental, Respiratory and Genitourinary, illustrate the patients with multimorbidity who are prescribed polypharmacy to treat overrepresented diseases. In addition, some diseases as diabetes that are not overrepresented might need various medicines to control the condition. Moreover, recent intensification of treatments has translated into an increase in drug prescription.

In C9-Neurological, Musculoskeletal and Minor, metamizole has replaced traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), probably due to emerging safety concerns of NSAIDs regarding the kidney, cardiovascular, and digestive systems.

Our aim was to assess TikTok videos on third-line therapies for OAB for misinformation and quality.

Study Design

In this cross-sectional analysis, we abstracted the top 50 TikTok videos for keywords: "Axonics", "sacral neuromodulation", "Interstim", "PTNS", "posterior tibial nerve stimulation", and "bladder Botox". Videos were scored for quality by 3 independent reviewers using the Medical Quality Video Evaluation Tool (MQ-VET). Two reviewers determined if videos contained misinformation.

Results

Of 300 videos screened, 119 videos were included. Twenty-four (21%) were created by medical professionals (MPs). Medical professional videos were more frequently shared (5 vs 1, P < 0.01) but had similar views, likes, comments, and length. Although MP videos had significantly higher MQ-VET scores (43 vs 27, P < 0.01), there was no difference in the rate of misinformation between MP and non-MP videos (21% vs 18%). Twenty-two videos (18.4%) contained misinformation, which were 3 times longer (50.5 vs 15 seconds, P < 0.01) and had higher MQ-VET scores (34.5 vs 27, P = 0.03) than those without misinformation. Common themes of misinformation pertained to therapy indication, mechanism of action, and patient limitations after undergoing therapy.

Conclusions

Many TikTok videos on OAB third-line therapies contain misinformation. Most of these videos were not of high quality and created by the public. Medical professionals should be aware of misinformation permeating TikTok, given its large audience, and aim to promote or offer educational material of better accuracy and quality.

### Meta-analyses in prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections [^113TeMWT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common, and complications result in significant morbidity and mortality and also consume resources. This overview summarizes the current evidence for the prevention and treatment of UTI in adults and children from meta-analyses. The quality and applicability of this evidence in clinical practice for different patient groups is discussed. Suggestions are made for future research, because it is apparent that there are evidence gaps for particular subgroups of people.

Forming recommendations — wording and strength uses explicit phrasing tied to benefit, harm, and legal or economic context: recommendations stating that an intervention "must" are reserved for circumstances with a legal obligation or very serious consequences, exemplified by the prohibition "Ultra-rapid detoxification under general anesthesia or heavy sedation (where the airway needs to be supported) must not be used. This is because of the risk of serious adverse events, including death". A "strong" recommendation is made when benefit and cost-effectiveness are clear, illustrated by "Offer an alpha blocker (alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin or terazosin) to men with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms". If an intervention does more harm than good or is less cost-effective than alternatives, the guideline may recommend it "should not be used", as in "Do not offer a tilt test to people who have a diagnosis of vasovagal syncope". When a strong recommendation is not appropriate — such as when similarly cost-effective options exist or patients may prefer a cheaper, less effective option — the guidance may be to "consider" an intervention, for example, "Consider a serum natriuretic peptide test (if not already performed) when heart failure is suspected after transthoracic Doppler 2D echocardiography has shown a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction".

Antimicrobials reach high urinary concentrations, yet barriers include adherence to a daily regimen, adverse effects, and emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Evidence of effectiveness with a well-tolerated, safe product and parent education are needed; a urinary antiseptic that could be taken indefinitely without resistance is particularly desirable, and probiotics are another possible strategy.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in women — non‑antibiotic and host‑directed strategies include that bacteriophage therapies are a "promising option" with "promising efficacy similar to antibiotics with few side effects". Host response modulation "is a key dynamic for which limited information currently exists but may represent a future direction for prevention strategies". Vaccines "have demonstrated efficacy in reducing the UTI recurrence and are already in use in many nations", yet "these are not yet available in the U.S"., even though "numerous high quality, prospective trials demonstrate their utility in women with rUTI", and "significant uncertainty remains, however, about when or if these will become available for use in the U.S. in the future". The "use of mannosides as therapeutic entities" to prevent adhesion "may represent a narrow-spectrum treatment strategy" but "clinical outcomes using such approaches have been equivocal". As an adjunct, "the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, have been suggested as a useful adjunct in both preclinical and clinical studies". Prevention research infrastructure exists: "an NIH-funded research consortium… the Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (PLUS) Research Consortium", which is "dedicated to promoting prevention of LUTS (including UTIs)", aims to discover "methods to suppress symptoms without use of antibiotics" and "seeks to identify modifiable risk factors for acute cystitis which can be tested in a prospective prevention trial".

### Prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of urinary tract infections after urodynamic studies [^111J6J4C]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There is a risk that people who have invasive urodynamic studies (cystometry) will develop urinary tract infections or bacteria in the urine or blood. However, the use of prophylactic antibiotics before or immediately after invasive cystometry or urodynamic studies is not without risks of adverse effects and emergence of resistant microbes.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of administering prophylactic antibiotics in reducing the risk of urinary tract infections after urodynamic studies. The hypothesis was that administering prophylactic antibiotics reduces urinary tract infections after urodynamic studies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trial Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2009), CINAHL (January 1982 to January 2009), EMBASE (January 1966 to January 2009), PubMed (1 January 1980 to January 2009), LILACS (up to January 2009), TRIP database (up to January 2009), and the UK NHS Evidence Health Information Resources (searched 10 December 2009). We searched the reference lists of relevant articles, the primary trials and the proceedings of the International Urogynaecological Association International Continence Society and the American Urological Association for the years 1999 to 2009 to identify articles not captured by electronic searches. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials comparing the use of prophylactic antibiotics versus a placebo or no treatment in patients having urodynamic studies were selected. Two authors (PL and RF) independently performed the selection of trials for inclusion and any disagreements were resolved by discussion.

Data Collection and Analysis

All assessments of the quality of trials and data extraction were performed independently by two authors of the review (PL and RF) using forms designed according to Cochrane guidelines. We attempted to contact authors of the included trials for any missing data. Data were extracted on characteristics of the study participants including details of previously administered treatments, interventions used, the methods used to measure infection and adverse events. Statistical analyses were performed according to Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Data from intention-to-treat analyses were used where available. For the dichotomous data, results for each study were expressed as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and combined for meta-analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel method. The primary outcome was urinary tract infection. Heterogeneity was assessed by the P value and I(2) statistic.

Main Results

Nine randomized controlled trials involving the prophylactic use of antibiotics in patients having urodynamic studies were identified and these included 973 patients in total; one study was an abstract. Two further trials were excluded from the review. The methods of the included trials were poorly described. The primary outcome in all trials was the rate of developing significant bacteriuria, defined as the presence of more than 100,000 bacteria per millilitre of a mid-stream urine sample on culture and sensitivity testing. The other outcomes included pyrexia, haematuria, dysuria and adverse reactions to antibiotics. The administration of prophylactic antibiotics when compared to a placebo reduced the risk of significant bacteriuria (4% with antibiotics versus 12% without, risk ratio (RR) 0.35, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.56) in both men and women. The administration of prophylactic antibiotics also reduced the risk of haematuria (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.91). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome, risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection (40/201, 20% versus 59/214, 28%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.03); or in the risk of fever (RR 5.16, 95% CI 0.94 to 28.16) or dysuria (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.36). Only two of 135 people had an adverse reaction to the antibiotics. The number of patients needed to treat with antibiotics to prevent bacteriuria was 12.3. Amongst women, the number needed to treat to prevent bacteriuria was 13.4; while amongst men it was 9.1 (number needed to treat = 1/ absolute risk reduction).

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylactic antibiotics did reduce the risk of bacteriuria after urodynamic studies but there was not enough evidence to suggest that this effect reduced symptomatic urinary tract infections. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of fever, dysuria or adverse reactions. Potential benefits have to be weighed against clinical and financial implications, and the risk of adverse effects.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in women who experience post-coital UTIs — prophylaxis taken before or after sexual intercourse has been shown to be effective and safe, with a significant reduction in recurrence rates, and intermittent dosing is associated with decreased risk of adverse events including gastrointestinal symptoms and vaginitis. Evidence includes a 1990 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 27 sexually active women with a median age of 23 showing post-coital antibiotics were more effective than placebo in reducing UTI recurrences, and a study of 135 women where post-coital dosing was as effective as daily dosing. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be offered to women with sexual activity-related rUTIs, with recommended instructions to take a single dose of an antibiotic immediately before or after sexual intercourse. Dosing options for prophylaxis include: TMP-SMX 40 mg/200 mg; TMP-SMX 80 mg/400 mg; Nitrofurantoin 50 to 100 mg; Cephalexin 250 mg.

INDICATIONS

Methenamine hippurate tablets USP are indicated for prophylactic or suppressive treatment of frequently recurring urinary tract infections when long-term therapy is considered necessary. This drug should only be used after eradication of the infection by other appropriate antimicrobial agents.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of methenamine hippurate and other antibacterial drugs, methenamine hippurate should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Utilization review in workers' compensation: review of current status and recommendations for future improvement [^113B6SPC]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Utilization review (UR) in workers' compensation — goals, scope, and operational standards are summarized as follows: UR is a process that assesses aspects of a treating provider's care plans and then provides recommendations to payors/insurance carriers, TPAs or UROs/URACs concerning the appropriateness of the proposed care, and the purpose of UR is to review the safety and efficacy of treatment requests for consultations, durable medical equipment (DME), rehabilitation, complementary and alternative medicine, behavioral health care, diagnostics, procedures, surgery, medication requests, etc, for prospective, concurrent and retrospective reviews. UR is intended to be a collaborative process in which proposals to perform medical service for reimbursement are compared with high-quality, evidence-based guidelines for the purpose of assuring that patients receive the appropriate care necessary while avoiding ineffective, potentially harmful, and low-value care; UR looks solely at the medical necessity of a request and not at the issues surrounding compensability or causation, and financial analysis is not typically part of the peer UR reviewer decision-making process. UR recommendations may then be used to authorize payment and for QA review. The standards state that UR should emphasize patient welfare and proven clinical outcomes derived from the use of transparent evidence-based decision making resulting in UR determinations that are factual, consistent with evidence-based medicine, and understandable to all parties including patients, providers, insurers, and other stakeholders, and the UR process should incorporate oversight mechanisms, including quality assurance (QA) and continuous quality improvement (CQI) efforts, to ensure sound evidence-based treatment determinations within a timely, efficient and effective process. UR has influenced medical care within the workers' compensation system and is mandated in several states and jurisdictions.

### Sleep disorders, comorbidities, actions, lower urinary tract dysfunction, and medications ("Sleep C. A.L.M".) in the evaluation and management of nocturia: a simple approach to a complex diagnosis [^112Kjd5T]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nocturia arises from a fundamental mismatch between nocturnal urine production, storage capacity, and sleep architecture, which may be driven by abnormalities of the genitourinary tract, but also by sleep disorders, medical diseases, patient actions/lifestyle factors, or medications. This article introduces a novel system for organizing the complex differential diagnosis for nocturia, as proposed by an international collective of practicing urologists, physician specialists, and sleep experts: "Sleep CALM"-Sleep Disorders, Comorbidities, Actions, Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction, and Medications.

Methods

Narrative review of current evidence regarding the relevance of each "Sleep CALM" factor to nocturia pathogenesis, evaluation, and management.

Results

Nocturia and sleep disorders are highly intertwined and often bidirectional, such that nocturnal awakenings for reasons other than a sensation of bladder fullness should not be used as grounds for exclusion from nocturia treatment, but rather leveraged to broaden therapeutic options for nocturia. Nocturia is an important potential harbinger of several serious medical conditions beyond the genitourinary tract. Urologists should have a low threshold for primary care and medical specialty referral for medical optimization, which carries the potential to significantly improve nocturnal voiding frequency in addition to overall health status. Adverse patient actions/lifestyle factors, lower urinary tract dysfunction, and medication use commonly coexist with disordered sleep and comorbid medical conditions, and may be the primary mediators of nocturia severity and treatment response, or further exacerbate nocturia severity and complicate treatment.

Conclusion

"Sleep CALM" provides a memorable and clinically relevant means by which to structure the initial patient history, physical exam, and clinical testing in accordance with current best-practice guidelines for nocturia. Although not intended as an all-encompassing diagnostic tool, the "Sleep CALM" schema may also be useful in guiding individualized ancillary testing, identifying the need for specialty referral and multidisciplinary care, and uncovering first-line treatment targets.

### Surgical treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic obstruction: an analysis and meta-synthesis of available guidelines [^112SW85h]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lower urinary tract symptoms supposed secondary to benign prostatic obstruction (LUTS/BPO) are among the most prevalent conditions in older males. Surgical treatment is usually recommended if pharmacotherapy fails, is not well tolerated, or when BPO-related complications arise. Surgical options can also be used at an earlier stage after a thorough joint decision has been made. As established surgical therapies have drawbacks and the threshold for surgical treatment seems to have become much lower with the implementation of minimally invasive treatments (MITs), LUTS/BPO surgery has become an economically significant area. Consequently, novel therapeutic devices and procedures are being developed at an unprecedented rate.

The rapid adoption of new surgical techniques is influenced by a range of factors, including patient demand, competitive healthcare dynamics, and regulatory pathways that are often less stringent than those applied to pharmaceuticals. Consequently, some interventions may enter clinical use before a comprehensive evidence base is available. A comprehensive understanding of the array of procedures, including their benefits and risks, safety profiles, and ideal indications, is essential for successful, individualized treatment. However, for physicians not deeply specialized in the field, staying abreast of these developments can be challenging. Clinical guidelines provide critical support in this context.

Nonetheless, guidelines are not without their limitations. The required level of evidence for recommending novel treatments is not uniformly defined. Furthermore, while guidelines should rely on robust evidence, they also need to remain relevant and not withhold potentially beneficial novel treatments from patients. Consequently, the same body of evidence might receive varying interpretations by different guideline bodies.

The objective of this study was to analyze existing guidelines for the surgical treatment of LUTS/BPO, compare their recommendations for various surgical methods and treatment scenarios, and assess where further data could unify recommendations where discrepancies exist.

### Prevention of urinary tract infections in nursing homes: lack of evidence-based prescription? [^114UpH1x]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Prophylactic agents for UTIs

269 residents (18%) used at least one agent for UTI prophylaxis, Table 1. The proportion of residents with UTI prophylaxis varied between 0–50% among the nursing homes. Fifteen percent of the residents in homes for demented patients used prophylaxis for UTI, while 19% were prescribed UTI prophylaxis in long-term somatic and mixed institutions. However the pattern of prophylactic agents did not differ between the different types of institutions. Among residents using prophylactic agents, 74% had one agent prescribed, while 26% were prescribed two, three or four concomitant prophylactic agents, Table 1.

Table 1
Prophylaxis regimes for urinary tract infections in 1473 nursing home residents, number and proportions (%) of all residents and of residents with prophylaxis.

Methenamine was used by 48% of the residents prescribed prophylaxis, vitamin C by 32%, estrogens by 30% and cranberry products by 10%. In women receiving estrogens as prophylactic treatment, 25 (31%) had vaginal administered drugs and the others oral. Trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin were used as prophylaxis for UTIs in 9% of the residents, Table 1.

Dosages of prophylactic agents are shown in Table 2 and were within the recommended dosage range for prevention of UTIs as stated in the summary of product characteristics (SPC) for methenamine, estrogens, trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin. The prescribing of cranberry products appeared to follow suggested dosage by manufacturers in general, though recommendation sheets were not available for every commercial product used. The dosage of vitamin C varied between 60–2000 mg per day.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE Armodafinil tablets are indicated to improve wakefulness in adult patients with excessive sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, or shift work disorder. Limitations of Use In OSA, armodafinil tablets are indicated to treat excessive sleepiness and not as treatment for the underlying obstruction. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dosage of armodafinil tablets for each indication is as follows:

- OSA or Narcolepsy: 150 mg to 250 mg once a day in the morning.
- SWD: 150 mg once a day, taken approximately one hour prior to start of the work shift.
- Hepatic Impairment: reduced dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
- Geriatric Patients: consider lower dose.
- Angioedema and Anaphylaxis Reactions: if suspected, discontinue armodafinil tablets.
- Persistent Sleepiness: assess patients frequently for degree of sleepiness and, if appropriate, advise patients to avoid driving or engaging in any other potentially dangerous activity.
- Psychiatric Symptoms: use particular caution in treating patients with a history of psychosis, depression, or mania. Consider discontinuing armodafinil tablets if psychiatric symptoms develop.
- Known Cardiovascular Disease: consider increased monitoring. 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2. 1 Dosage in Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Narcolepsy

### SODIUM SULFATE, POTASSIUM SULFATE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE solution… [^114gfmyY]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution is an osmotic laxative indicated for cleansing of the colon in preparation for colonoscopy in adults. 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5. 1 Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities
5. 2 Cardiac Arrhythmias 5. 3 Seizures
5. 4 Renal Impairment 5. 5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis
5. 6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease 5. 7 Aspiration
5. 8 Not for Direct Ingestion. 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS
- Gastrointestinal obstruction
- Bowel perforation
- Gastric retention
- Ileus
- Toxic colitis or toxic megacolon
- Known allergies to components of the kit 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS. Patients with electrolyte abnormalities should have them corrected before treatment with Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution.

In addition, use caution when prescribing Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution for patients with conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment. Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution can cause temporary elevations in uric acid. Uric acid fluctuations in patients with gout may precipitate an acute flare. The potential for uric acid elevation should be considered before administering Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution to patients with gout or other disorders of uric acid metabolism.
5. 2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation.

Use caution when prescribing Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias. Pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs should be considered in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias.
5. 4 Renal Impairment Use caution when prescribing Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution for patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration, and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests in these patients.
5. 5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis Administration of osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution may increase these risks. The potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation should be considered when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease.
5. 6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering Sodium Sulfate, Potassium Sulfate and Magnesium Sulfate Oral Solution. Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis.
