## Question

What are treatment options for latent tuberculosis in a pregnant female

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in pregnancy, including when to treat versus defer, which regimens to choose, how to monitor, and how HIV coinfection changes decisions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming LTBI and excluding active TB. Then, I should stratify maternal risk of progression to active disease. Next, I will weigh the risks and benefits of treating during pregnancy versus deferring postpartum. After that, I need to select an appropriate regimen with attention to pregnancy-specific safety and drug interactions. Finally, I will outline monitoring, counseling, and special considerations such as HIV coinfection and drug-resistant exposures, and I will double-check areas where guidance conflicts or evidence is evolving.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and rule out active TB, because treatment of LTBI should never proceed until active disease is excluded. I should review symptoms and signs, obtain a chest radiograph with abdominal shielding if indicated, and, if symptoms or radiography suggest disease, pursue sputum testing with smear/culture or NAAT such as Xpert MTB/RIF; IGRA or TST can be used to detect LTBI, but I need to remember that IGRA performance may be reduced in late pregnancy, so a negative IGRA does not definitively exclude LTBI in that context, and discordant results warrant cautious interpretation and follow-up testing when appropriate [^114wXrJp] [^111VMsg7] [^117CuS9i] [^114FdV6a].

> Next, I should review risk factors for progression to active TB to decide whether treatment during pregnancy is warranted. High-risk features include HIV infection (especially with low CD4), recent close exposure to infectious TB, recent TST/IGRA conversion, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic kidney disease on dialysis, diabetes, silicosis, and recent immigration from high-burden settings; pregnancy itself modestly increases risk, and the peripartum period may carry additional risk, so I need to integrate these elements rather than rely on a single factor [^113tuZmC] [^116yrq72] [^116re3vc] [^111fGCJw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about immediate treatment in all pregnant patients. I should balance maternal-fetal risks and benefits. For most pregnant patients with LTBI and no high-risk features, deferring therapy until 2–3 months postpartum is reasonable to avoid isoniazid-associated hepatotoxicity, which appears higher in pregnancy and early postpartum, and to minimize fetal drug exposure. However, if the risk of progression is high, treatment during pregnancy is indicated despite these risks, and I should document shared decision-making with the patient [^116DXhRu] [^115fQRF5] [^111VMsg7].

> I will now examine regimen selection, keeping pregnancy-specific safety in mind. Initially, I thought the 3-month weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine regimen (3HP) might be acceptable in pregnancy because rifampin is generally considered safe; wait, let me verify that assumption, because I should not conflate rifampin with rifapentine. The CDC explicitly notes that data on rifapentine in pregnancy are extremely limited and that 3HP is not currently recommended during pregnancy, so I should avoid rifapentine-containing regimens in pregnancy despite their favorable completion rates in nonpregnant populations [^114Xipgx] [^116DXhRu] [^113nKza8].

> Let me consider safer, evidence-aligned options for pregnancy. Preferred alternatives include 4 months of daily rifampin monotherapy, which avoids isoniazid hepatotoxicity and has excellent completion, or 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin when rifampin is acceptable. If neither rifamycin-based regimen is suitable, 6 months of daily isoniazid with pyridoxine is an alternative, though I should plan for closer monitoring given hepatotoxicity risk. I should confirm that these align with current guidelines emphasizing shorter rifamycin-based regimens when feasible and note that WHO 2024 also lists rifampicin-based options and isoniazid-based therapy as acceptable preventive regimens, reinforcing the clinical choices here [^116DXhRu] [^111xc8Hc] [^115ws5Fw].

> I need to ensure supportive measures are in place. All pregnant patients receiving isoniazid should receive daily pyridoxine 25–50 mg to mitigate neuropathy risk, and baseline liver function tests should be obtained before starting therapy, with repeat testing if symptoms develop or if the patient is in the immediate postpartum period. Monthly clinical monitoring for hepatotoxicity symptoms and adherence is prudent, and I should advise patients to stop medications and seek care if they develop anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, jaundice, or persistent fatigue [^116DXhRu] [^115fQRF5] [^111eYebY].

> But wait, what if the patient has HIV coinfection? I should double-check the timing of LTBI therapy in this subgroup. The IMPAACT P1078 TB APPRISE trial showed higher adverse pregnancy outcomes with immediate isoniazid preventive therapy during pregnancy compared with deferral to 12 weeks postpartum, so for pregnant patients with HIV who are on effective ART and lack recent conversion or close household exposure, deferring LTBI treatment until after delivery is reasonable. However, if there is recent conversion or close contact, treatment during pregnancy should not be delayed, and I should coordinate with HIV and TB specialists to manage drug–drug interactions, especially with efavirenz-based regimens and rifamycins [^116hLApa] [^1125SU1q] [^114Xipgx].

> I should confirm that active TB has truly been excluded before starting any LTBI regimen, because rifampin monotherapy could select for resistance if subclinical disease is present. If there is any diagnostic uncertainty, I should broaden evaluation or observe closely and reassess. If active TB is diagnosed, standard pregnancy-adapted treatment should be initiated promptly, typically isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol for an extended course if pyrazinamide is avoided, with careful maternal-fetal monitoring and coordination with obstetrics and infectious diseases [^117Tk4rh] [^114EPDcX] [^1132Gmum].

> Next, I should review special situations such as exposure to multidrug-resistant TB. For presumed MDR-LTBI, expert consultation is essential. Fluoroquinolone-based regimens for 6–12 months are often used based on source-case susceptibilities, with avoidance of pyrazinamide as a second agent when possible due to toxicity, and decisions should be individualized with maternal-fetal risk counseling and close follow-up [^111LnoVx] [^1171EHT7].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Confirm LTBI and exclude active TB. Stratify progression risk. If low risk, defer treatment to 2–3 months postpartum. If high risk, treat during pregnancy using a rifamycin-based regimen when acceptable, or isoniazid with pyridoxine if rifamycins are contraindicated. Avoid rifapentine in pregnancy. Monitor closely for hepatotoxicity and adherence. And tailor decisions for patients with HIV or MDR exposures with multidisciplinary input and shared decision-making [^116DXhRu] [^114FQHQk] [^114Xipgx].

---

In pregnancy, **treat LTBI when risk of progression is high** (e.g. HIV, recent conversion, close contact) [^116DXhRu] [^114Xipgx]; otherwise, **defer until postpartum** to avoid hepatotoxicity [^116DXhRu]. Preferred regimens are **4 months of daily rifampin** or **3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin** [^114FQHQk]; if these are unsuitable, use 6–9 months of daily isoniazid with pyridoxine [^116DXhRu]. Avoid **rifapentine-containing regimens** (e.g. 3HP) due to limited pregnancy safety data [^114Xipgx] [^113nKza8]. Monitor liver enzymes monthly during pregnancy and postpartum, and coordinate care with obstetrics and TB programs [^111eYebY] [^111VMsg7].

---

## Indications for treatment during pregnancy

Treatment during pregnancy is indicated when the **risk of progression to active TB is high** [^116DXhRu]:

- **HIV infection**: Strong indication regardless of CD4 count [^112a62ae].

- **Recent conversion**: TST or IGRA conversion within 2 years [^1125SU1q] [^111dkW5F].

- **Close contact**: Household or prolonged exposure to infectious TB [^116DXhRu].

- **Immunosuppression**: Steroids, biologics, or other immunosuppressive therapy [^111dkW5F].

If the risk is low, **defer treatment until postpartum** to minimize maternal and fetal risks [^116DXhRu].

---

## Recommended treatment regimens

Preferred regimens are shorter, rifamycin-based options with favorable safety and completion profiles [^114FQHQk]:

| **Regimen** | **Duration** | **Efficacy** | **Safety considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Rifampin | 4 months daily | High | - Safe in pregnancy <br/> - Monitor LFTs [^113nMbut] [^116DXhRu] |
| Isoniazid + rifampin | 3 months daily | High | - Safe in pregnancy <br/> - Monitor LFTs [^113nMbut] [^116DXhRu] |
| Isoniazid | 6–9 months daily | Moderate | - Higher hepatotoxicity risk <br/> - Use pyridoxine <br/> - Monitor LFTs [^111xc8Hc] [^113nwG8x] [^115fQRF5] |

---

Avoid **rifapentine-containing regimens** (e.g. 3HP) due to limited pregnancy safety data [^114Xipgx] [^113nKza8].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Increased risk during pregnancy and postpartum; monitor LFTs monthly [^115fQRF5] [^1132Gmum].

- **Pyridoxine**: 25–50 mg daily with isoniazid to prevent neuropathy [^116DXhRu].

- **Drug interactions**: Rifampin reduces efficacy of hormonal contraceptives; use nonhormonal methods [^notfound].

---

## Timing of treatment initiation

Initiate during pregnancy when the **risk of progression is high**, even in the first trimester [^116DXhRu]. Otherwise, **defer until 2–3 months postpartum** to reduce hepatotoxicity risk [^116DXhRu].

---

## Special considerations

### HIV coinfection

Treat **LTBI promptly** during pregnancy, as HIV significantly increases progression risk [^112a62ae] [^116yrq72]. Regimens may be **rifampin-based or isoniazid-based**, tailored to ART interactions and patient tolerance [^116DXhRu] [^116bRpXw].

---

### Drug-resistant TB exposure

For **MDR contacts**, consult TB specialists; fluoroquinolone-based regimens may be considered with caution [^111LnoVx].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **High risk**: Treat during pregnancy with rifampin-based regimens or isoniazid with pyridoxine [^116DXhRu] [^114Xipgx].

- **Low risk**: Defer treatment until 2–3 months postpartum [^116DXhRu].

- **Avoid**: Rifapentine-containing regimens during pregnancy [^114Xipgx].

- **Monitor**: Monthly LFTs and clinical assessments during pregnancy and postpartum [^115fQRF5] [^1132Gmum].

---

Treatment of LTBI in pregnancy balances maternal and fetal risks; **use rifampin-based regimens or isoniazid with pyridoxine** when risk is high, defer when low, and monitor closely for hepatotoxicity [^116DXhRu].

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1600 Clifton Rd. Atlanta, GA 30329, USA 800-INFO TTY: 232–6348 Pregnant women can take any of the following regimens for the treatment of LTBI: Pregnant women taking isoniazid should also take vitamin B6 supplement. The 12-dose regimen of isoniazid and rifapentine is not currently recommended for pregnant women or women expecting to become pregnant during the treatment regimen. For most pregnant women with LTBI, treatment can be delayed until after delivery. If the woman does not have any risk factors for developing TB disease, treatment should be given after she has delivered her baby, so she can avoid having to take anti-TB medications during pregnancy. For women in the post-partum period, baseline liver function tests should be conducted. If the pregnant woman is a recent contact to a person with infectious TB disease, immediate treatment should be considered.

Latent Mtb infection (LTBI) — natural history and risk of progression indicates that, in the absence of treatment, approximately 4%–6% of individuals who acquire LTBI will develop active tuberculosis during their lifetime, with the greatest risk of progression during the first 2 years following exposure; risk is increased among young (< 4 years) children and those receiving corticosteroids or tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors, and persons with latent infection who acquire HIV infection will develop TB disease at an approximate rate of 5%–10% per year when not receiving effective HIV treatment.

Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) during pregnancy — A clinical trial among women with HIV in high TB prevalence settings found increased adverse pregnancy outcomes when isoniazid was given during pregnancy compared to postpartum initiation; none of the women were close household TB contacts and most were IGRA-negative and receiving efavirenz-based ART. Two smaller observational studies in South Africa and a Botswana study of 36 months of isoniazid did not report increased adverse pregnancy outcomes, and a subsequent systematic review found inconsistent associations. In the BRIEF-TB study, first-trimester IPT exposure was associated with increased risk of fetal demise, with attenuation after adjustment for covariates including ART use. Individuals with HIV not receiving ART have shown a high risk of progression from LTBI to active TB disease (10% per year); pregnant women with HIV should be receiving ART both for their own health and for prevention of perinatal transmission (AI). In the United States, isoniazid preventive therapy is recommended for pregnant women with HIV whose close household contacts include a person with TB disease or a person with a positive result from a test for LTBI.

Treatment of latent M. tuberculosis infection

Tracing contacts of infectious pulmonary TB cases (sputum smear-positive) for exposure to tubercle bacilli leading to latent M. tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and treatment of latently-infected individuals at high risk of progressing from latent infection to active disease has proven extremely effective in the control of TB in the United States and other low TB-burden countries. Treatment of LTBI in infected persons substantially reduces the likelihood of activation of dormant infection and subsequent development of active TB disease (Figure 1). The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidelines in 2000 for the treatment of LTBI which were also endorsed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and American Academy of Pediatrics. An update to these guidelines was published in 2005 that also included recommendations for pediatric subjects. The treatment options currently available for LTBI are summarized in Table 2.

### Pregnancy in patients with tuberculosis: a TBNET cross-sectional survey [^116fFBj2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis most commonly affects women during their reproductive years. Pregnancy during the treatment of tuberculosis was formerly more common due to the interaction between the oral contraceptive pill and rifampicin, such that the former was no longer effective. In pregnancy there is also a shift from cell-mediated (Th1) immunity, which protects against tuberculosis, to antibody-mediated (Th2) immunity, making reactivation of latent tuberculosis and susceptibility to recent infection progressing to active disease more likely.

The diagnosis of tuberculosis is often delayed as many of the symptoms are non-specific and may be present during normal pregnancy, e.g. tiredness, feeling hot and sweating at night. Exposure of the fetus to x-rays from chest radiography raises concerns in pregnant women and health care workers and so the usual process of diagnosis for those with a cough may be delayed. The World Health Organization recommends screening for tuberculosis in those with HIV co-infection and those with symptoms of tuberculosis using two-three sputum smears stained for tubercle bacilli and/or PCR tests for tuberculosis such as Xpert MTB/RIF. However, the sputum smear is less frequently positive during pregnancy than in others with tuberculosis; the value of PCR tests is in the early stages of evaluation. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis requires tissue sampling and culture and screening pregnant women with symptoms is often provoked by a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay. Estimates have suggested that 26% of all preventable deaths in pregnancy worldwide are directly attributable to tuberculosis and children are especially susceptible to forms of tuberculosis with a high mortality. Late diagnosis of active tuberculosis in pregnant women has significant cost implications. The possible transmission of tuberculosis to the baby and also to other mothers and their children requires extensive contact tracing and constitutes a "serious untoward incident".

Our aim was to determine whether tuberculosis was in fact more common in pregnancy and whether the developed health care systems in Europe and the United States were still associated with a diagnostic delay of tuberculosis in pregnant women.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^11483xEJ]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) can progress to active tuberculosis disease, causing morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To review the evidence on benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of LTBI in adults to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through December 3, 2021; references; experts; literature surveillance through January 20, 2023.

Study Selection

English-language studies of LTBI screening, LTBI treatment, or accuracy of the tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs). Studies of LTBI screening and treatment for public health surveillance or disease management were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; qualitative synthesis of findings; meta-analyses conducted when a sufficient number of similar studies were available.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Screening test accuracy; development of active tuberculosis disease, transmission, quality of life, mortality, and harms.

Results

A total of 113 publications were included (112 studies; N = 69 009). No studies directly evaluated the benefits and harms of screening. Pooled estimates for sensitivity of the TST were 0.80 (95% CI, 0.74–0.87) at the 5-mm induration threshold, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76–0.87) at the 10-mm threshold, and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.46–0.74) at the 15-mm threshold. Pooled estimates for sensitivity of IGRA tests ranged from 0.81 (95% CI, 0.79–0.84) to 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87–0.92). Pooled estimates for specificity of screening tests ranged from 0.95 to 0.99. For treatment of LTBI, a large (n = 27 830), good-quality randomized clinical trial found a relative risk (RR) for progression to active tuberculosis at 5 years of 0.35 (95% CI, 0.24–0.52) for 24 weeks of isoniazid compared with placebo (number needed to treat, 112) and an increase in hepatotoxicity (RR, 4.59 [95% CI, 2.03–10.39]; number needed to harm, 279). A previously published meta-analysis reported that multiple regimens were efficacious compared with placebo or no treatment. Meta-analysis found greater risk for hepatotoxicity with isoniazid than with rifampin (pooled RR, 4.22 [95% CI, 2.21–8.06]; n = 7339).

Conclusions and Relevance

No studies directly evaluated the benefits and harms of screening for LTBI compared with no screening. TST and IGRAs were moderately sensitive and highly specific. Treatment of LTBI with recommended regimens reduced the risk of progression to active tuberculosis. Isoniazid was associated with higher rates of hepatotoxicity than placebo or rifampin.

### Congenital tuberculosis: a rare manifestation of a common infection [^112KSeNP]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The epidemiology of tuberculosis has changed dramatically over the past 5 years with significant shifts in at-risk populations, resulting in increased disease among young adults and children, especially among those from developing countries. Congenital tuberculosis is rare, and the clinical presentation of tuberculosis during pregnancy and infancy is often non-specific, making recognition difficult. Advances have been made with diagnostic tools, in public health practices, and with treatment recommendations. Controversy and debate continue regarding the safety and use of isoniazid for latent tuberculosis infection during pregnancy. New vaccine development may be promising for the future, but much work is needed to understand the complicated immune response to tuberculosis.

### Use of infliximab in particular clinical settings: management based on current evidence [^116n1M2G]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

With the increasingly widespread use of the anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha agent infliximab for the treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, there have been some concerns raised about the potential consequences of such therapy in particular clinical settings. In this review, we report the current strategies for optimizing treatment outcomes and minimizing the risks of some of the most serious events attributable to infliximab therapy. In particular, an up-to-date overview is provided on how to treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease using infliximab therapy, with regard to the diagnosis and management of latent tuberculosis infection and the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B and C infections. Furthermore, based on the available evidence, we evaluate the possibility of using infliximab during pregnancy. Finally, we evaluate whether patients with malignancies or pre-neoplastic lesions could be candidates for infliximab therapy. Overall, this review will provide physicians who use infliximab for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease with several practical recommendations for the management of some complex situations that may occur in daily clinical practice.

### Tuberculosis and pregnancy [^115jjVv2]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide a summary of the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, including risks and benefits of treatment, of tuberculosis and latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection during pregnancy.

Recent Findings

Recent developments in diagnostic options have added to the armamentarium of tests available to diagnose latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Increasing evidence supports the potential for successful treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis during pregnancy with good maternal and neonatal outcomes. The impact of genital tuberculosis on the outcome of assisted in-vitro fertilization techniques is noted.

Summary

The diagnostic approach for the evaluation of tuberculosis or latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is unchanged by pregnancy, and includes clinical suspicion of disease, tuberculin skin testing or interferon-gamma-based assay, chest radiography with appropriate shielding when indicated, and acid-fast bacillus stain and culture of clinical material. For patients with active tuberculosis, therapy should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is established. Initiation of treatment for latent infection during pregnancy should be considered based on the risk for progression to active disease.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1132Gmum]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Treatment of tuberculosis disease during pregnancy with HIV — TB therapy should not be withheld because of pregnancy (AIII), and treatment should be the same as for any other patient with HIV, but with attention to specified considerations (AIII). Although isoniazid is not teratogenic in animals or humans, hepatotoxicity caused by isoniazid might occur more frequently during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and monthly monitoring of liver transaminases during pregnancy and the postpartum period is recommended (BIII). Rifampin is not teratogenic in humans. Ethambutol is teratogenic in rodents and rabbits at doses that are much higher than those used in humans; no evidence of teratogenicity has been observed in humans, and ocular toxicity has been reported in adults taking ethambutol but changes in visual acuity have not been detected in infants exposed to ethambutol in utero. Pyrazinamide is not teratogenic in animals; the WHO and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases have made recommendations for the routine use of pyrazinamide in pregnant women, and pyrazinamide has been recommended for use during pregnancy in the United States, although data characterizing its safety in this setting are limited.

### Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. An official ATS / CDC / ERS / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^111LnoVx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

MDR latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) contacts — treatment recommendations: For contacts with presumed multidrug-resistant (MDR) LTBI due to exposure to an infectious patient with MDR-TB, we suggest offering treatment for LTBI versus following with observation alone. For treatment of MDR LTBI, we suggest 6 to 12 months' treatment with a fluoroquinolone alone or with a second drug, on the basis of source-case isolate drug susceptibility testing (DST). On the basis of evidence of increased toxicity, adverse events, and discontinuations, pyrazinamide should not be routinely used as the second drug, and in lieu of fluoroquinolone-based treatment there are few data for other second-line medications and, because of toxicity, they are not recommended by experts. For contacts to fluoroquinolone-resistant, pre–extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (pre–XDR-TB), pyrazinamide/ethambutol may be an effective option if source-case isolate DST shows susceptibility to these drugs, and in children levofloxacin is preferred because of the availability of an oral suspension formulation.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) treatment during pregnancy — first-line regimen and drug-specific considerations state that treatment of TB disease for pregnant women should be the same as for non-pregnant women, but with attention to the following considerations (BIII). Although isoniazid is not teratogenic in animals or humans, hepatotoxicity caused by isoniazid might occur more frequently during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and monthly monitoring of liver transaminases during pregnancy and the postpartum period is recommended (CIII). Rifampin is not teratogenic in humans, and for ethambutol, no evidence of teratogenicity has been observed in humans and changes in visual acuity have not been detected in infants exposed to ethambutol in utero. If pyrazinamide is not included in the initial treatment regimen, the minimum duration of TB therapy should be 9 months (AII). Considering the information above, the preferred first-line treatment for drug-susceptible TB in pregnancy is isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol for a duration of 9 months.

Table 2
Currently available drug regimens for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection

INH, isoniazid; RMP, rifampicin; PZA, pyrazinamide; RPE, rifapentine; DOT, directly observed treatment; 2/Wk, twice weekly; 1/Wk, once weekly; CDC, Center for Disease Control and Prevention; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; IUAT, international Union Against Tuberculosis; LTBI, latent tuberculosis infection

The standard regimen for the treatment of LTBI in United States and Canada is daily self-administered therapy with isoniazid (INH) for nine months based on clinical trial data but the duration of treatment can be reduced to 6 months for adults seronegative for HIV-infection. The International Union Against Tuberculosis (IUAT) recommends daily therapy with INH for 12 months as it is more effective than the 6-month course (75% vs. 65%). The preferred duration of treatment for most patients with LTBI in the United States and European countries is 9 months since clinical trial data showed that the efficacy of 6-month regimen is reduced to 60% while 12-month regimen is advocated for individuals at higher risk of developing active disease. According to the CDC guidelines, the frequency can also be reduced from daily therapy to twice weekly therapy with increased dosage of INH, however, the twice weekly regimen must be given as directly observed treatment (DOT). Inclusion of DOT adds a substantial additional expense to the treatment strategies. The efficacy of INH treatment in preventing active TB exceeds 90% among persons who complete treatment. However, the overall effectiveness of these regimens is severely limited as the completion rates in clinical settings have been rather low, ranging from 30% to 64% only. Completion rates in other settings have been even lower. Although INH is tolerated fairly well by most of the individuals, there is a risk of hepatic toxicity in selected populations. Studies have shown that 10% to 22% of participants taking INH for LTBI have at least one episode of elevated serum transaminase levels. Although the rates of clinically significant hepatitis were much lower (< 2%), the risk and severity increased with age and concomitant alcohol consumption. INH can also cause peripheral neuropathy but the risk can be lowered by concomitant use of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Poor adherence due to the long duration of treatment and concerns for hepatotoxicity in selected patient populations resulted in development of shorter and more effective treatment options for LTBI.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115fQRF5]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) treatment monitoring in people with HIV — evaluation, laboratory checks, risk factors, stopping thresholds, and consultation — are specified as follows: individuals receiving TB-preventive therapy should be evaluated by a clinician monthly, and people with HIV should have aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin measured before starting LTBI and repeated if abnormal, with closer monitoring for those with concomitant chronic viral hepatitis or older age. Following initiation of isoniazid, ALT and AST often increase during the first 3 months but typically return to normal despite continued therapy. Factors that increase the risk of drug-induced clinical hepatitis include daily alcohol consumption, underlying liver disease, pregnancy and early postpartum, and concurrent treatment with other hepatotoxic drugs. At each visit, patients should be asked about adherence, new medications, and alcohol use, screened for adverse effects including unexplained anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, icterus, rash, persistent paresthesia of the hands and feet, persistent fatigue, weakness or fever lasting 3 or more days, abdominal tenderness, easy bruising or bleeding, and arthralgia, and told to stop medications immediately and return for assessment if any occur (AIII). LTBI therapy should be stopped (AIII) if ALT or AST rise to greater than five times the upper limit of normal without symptoms, greater than three times the upper limit of normal AND total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of normal without symptoms, or greater than three times the upper limit of normal with symptoms (or greater than two times the baseline value for patients with baseline abnormal transaminases). Decisions about resuming therapy should weigh hepatic risk versus TB prevention benefit and ideally involve consultation with an expert in treating LTBI in people with HIV; if a local expert is not available, clinicians can contact the CDC (tbinfo@cdc.gov) to utilize remote TB medical consultation services through the CDC-funded TB Center of Excellence.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) screening and treatment in children — risk-based testing and DOT: The optimal approach is to perform tuberculin skin testing only on those children with specific risk factors for LTBI, using a questionnaire as the screening tool; only those children whose answers indicate that they are at risk for LTBI should receive a tuberculin skin test. Risk factors that have correlated highly with LTBI include previous positive tuberculin skin test result, birth in a foreign country with high prevalence, nontourist travel to a high-prevalence country for more than 1 week, contact with a person with TB, and presence in the household of another person with LTBI. For LTBI treatment among children, directly observed therapy (DOT) is recommended, and children most likely to benefit include contacts of persons with recently diagnosed pulmonary TB, infants and young children, and children with immunologic deficiencies, especially HIV infection.

### WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis: tuberculosis preventive treatment: module 1: prevention [^117PZEfw]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for pulmonary tuberculosis, more specifically with respect to management of latent tuberculosis, WHO 2020 guidelines recommend to administer any of the following regimens for the treatment of latent tuberculosis regardless of HIV status:

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^112qWMWC]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

These updated guidelines were developed by NTCA and CDC. The LTBI treatment guidelines committee members, who are the authors of this report, were nominated on the basis of their expertise in treatment of LTBI. The committee had expertise in epidemiology, domestic and international TB control, clinical trials, and treatment of LTBI in adults and children. A methodologist with expertise in the GRADE approach served as a consultant to the guideline development committee.

Evidence Search

The committee determined that the following clinical question should be addressed in the updated guidelines: "Which regimens for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection have the greatest effectiveness and least toxicity?" The question was written in the population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICO) format, and then the outcomes were rated as critical, important, or not important. Comparison of regimen toxicities was limited to hepatotoxicity because this was the only toxicity that could be consistently compared across studies.

A systematic literature review was initiated in December 2017. Electronic databases including MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and gray literature were searched for studies evaluating the effectiveness of LTBI treatment regimens. Search terms included "latent tuberculosis", "latent TB", "LTBI", " Mycobacterium tuberculosis, " "tuberculosis infection" AND "isoniazid", "rifampin", "rifapentine", or "pyrazinamide". Articles were included if the study design was a randomized controlled trial and outcomes included prevention of TB disease and drug-related hepatotoxicity. Studies that included persons with suspected or confirmed TB disease were excluded from the review.

The initial search located a high-quality systematic review and meta-analysis published in August 2017 that examined the effectiveness of LTBI treatment regimens. The study authors were contacted and asked for access to the extracted data. Study characteristics, types of participants, interventions, the outcomes measured, and results were extracted from each study. If the data were amenable to pooling, effects were estimated via meta-analysis. For the meta-analyses, a random effects model was used unless otherwise specified, and effect estimates were reported as odds ratios. All statistical analyses were conducted using the "metafor" package in R, versions 3.4.3. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to conduct a bias assessment. Analyses conducted in 2018 included combined data from the studies in the previous review and articles identified during an updated search for studies published during June 2017–August 2018 (Figure).

Four Months of Daily Rifampin

A regimen of 4 months of daily rifampin is a preferred treatment that is strongly recommended for HIV-negative adults and children of all ages. (No evidence is available for effectiveness in HIV-positive persons.) The effectiveness of this regimen was clinically equivalent to, and less toxic than, the standard regimen of 9 months of daily isoniazid in adults and children. Four months of daily rifampin had noninferior effectiveness in preventing TB disease compared with 9 months of daily isoniazid, as well as a lower rate of treatment discontinuation because of adverse effects, a lower rate of hepatotoxicity, and a higher rate of treatment completion.

The potential disadvantages of the rifamycin-based regimens are the many drug interactions, including warfarin, oral contraceptives, azole antifungals, and HIV antiretroviral therapy. Rifabutin has fewer or less pronounced drug interactions and may be used in place of rifampin when rifampin is contraindicated due to drug-drug interactions and isoniazid cannot be used. Drug interactions with weekly rifapentine are fewer than with rifampin and appear to be fewer than with rifabutin; therefore, weekly isoniazid and rifapentine could be considered when rifampin is contraindicated, although clinical data are limited. Drug-drug interactions between rifamycins and antiretroviral therapy are regularly updated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In HIV-positive persons with low CD4+ lymphocyte counts, the risk for asymptomatic or subclinical TB disease increases, possibly facilitating rifampin resistance if TB disease is inadvertently treated with rifampin monotherapy.

### Notes from the field: undiagnosed tuberculosis during pregnancy resulting in a neonatal death-United States, 2021 [^115Rm5nF]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

The mother's chest radiograph demonstrated bilateral reticular nodular opacities. Acid-fast bacilli were identified on sputum smear microscopy, and a sputum sample tested positive for M. tuberculosis by polymerase chain reaction; a sputum culture was also positive. The mother recovered while completing a full course of treatment for drug-susceptible pulmonary TB, the same treatment that would have been recommended if a diagnosis had occurred during pregnancy. The only other household contact was determined not to have TB disease or latent TB infection after evaluation. This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed research not involving human subjects, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. ††

PICO Question 2: In children and adolescents with nonsevere DS pulmonary TB, is a 4-month regimen composed of standard-dose 2 months of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol followed by 2 months of isoniazid and rifampin (2HRZE/2HR) as efficacious and safe as the standard 6-month DS-TB regimen of 2 months of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol followed by 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin (2HRZE/4HR) endorsed by the ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA guidelines?
1 Topic/overview/background Currently recommended treatment regimens are ⩾6 months in duration, regardless of disease severity. The SHINE (Shorter Treatment for Minimal TB in Children) trial was a multicenter, randomized, controlled, two-arm noninferiority trial comparing 4 months with 6 months of standard treatment for nonsevere TB. This was defined as intrathoracic lymph node TB without airway obstruction, uncomplicated TB pleural effusion, or paucibacillary and noncavitary disease confined to one lobe of the lungs, or without a miliary pattern. Data from this clinical trial informed these recommendations. As part of the ADOLOPMENT process, we adapted the WHO guideline question, evidence table, EtD framework, and recommendation to the scope and audience of this guideline. We performed a literature search to update the evidence base. The literature search revealed no other clinical trials to include in this question, and only the one study and corresponding analysis from the WHO guideline were used.
2 Summary of evidence, benefits, and harms SHINE enrolled 1,204 children and adolescents < 16 years old weighing ⩾3 kg with nonsevere TB disease (Table 5). Exclusion criteria included known drug resistance, contact to persons with DR-TB, pregnancy, and more severe TB disease (e.g. miliary TB, TB meningitis). The SHINE trial demonstrated a success rate of 97.1% for participants receiving the 4-month regimen (2 mo of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide, with or without ethambutol, followed by 2 mo of isoniazid and rifampin [2HRZ(E)/2HR]) compared with 96.9% among those receiving the 6-month regimen (2HRZ(E)/4HR; Table 5). Noninferiority of the 4-month regimen compared with the 6-month regimen was consistent across the intention-to-treat, per-protocol, and key secondary analyses, including the analyses restricted to patients independently adjudicated to have TB disease. Adverse event incidence was similar between the 4-month (7.8%) and 6-month regimens (8.0%) (Table 5). The SHINE trial documented similar treatment success rates and adverse events between the 4-month and 6-month regimens, supporting a recommendation for the 4-month regimen. The shortened treatment duration is a significant benefit and could reduce the use of healthcare services and potentially improve adherence. Relying on the noninferior outcome between the 4-month regimen and the current standard, the Panel judged both desirable and undesirable effects to be trivial in difference. The Joint Panel agreed that implementing the regimen would be cost saving for programs, although the size of this effect is uncertain.
3 Monitoring and additional considerations Although the SHINE trial enrolled children and adolescents with symptomatic TB disease, many children are diagnosed during contact investigations with TB disease while asymptomatic. The Joint Panel agreed that, provided patients meet the demographic, radiographic, epidemiologic, and clinical criteria for nonsevere TB, without suspicion of RR/MDR-TB, these patients should also be eligible for the 4-month regimen. Recommendations for other specific subgroups are provided in Table 6. Because there is an age overlap between the RPT/MOX regimen and this 4-month regimen, some children may be eligible for either regimen. Figure 1 provides information on how to identify children eligible for the 4-month regimens, based on the data on children in the SHINE trial and Study 31/A5349. Children and adolescents who do not meet the criteria for nonsevere TB should receive the standard 6-month treatment regimen (2HRZ(E)/4HR) or other recommended regimens for which they are eligible or for severe forms of EPTB. The clinical monitoring requirements for the shorter regimen remain the same as for the 6-month regimen. Monitoring for potential recurrence is a priority for shorter regimens, and programs should have plans to monitor children after treatment. TB programs should also assess for barriers to offering this regimen.
4 Certainty of evidence The Joint Panel concurred with the WHO GDG that certainty in the estimated effect was judged to be high for treatment success. Specifically, the Joint Panel judged the certainty of the evidence to be high for treatment success and moderate for both all-cause death and adverse events. This was due to imprecision for estimates of treatment failure, relapse, adherence, and loss to follow-up. The Joint Panel agreed with the WHO that overall certainty of the evidence is moderate. This was not downgraded for indirectness, because the trial population may be representative of patients with TB treated in the countries represented by the Joint Panel. The Joint Panel concurred with the WHO GDG that the certainty in the estimated effects was judged to be moderate for all-cause death and adverse events. The Joint Panel agreed with the WHO that the overall certainty of evidence is moderate.
5 Panel Recommendation In children and adolescents between 3 months and 16 years of age with nonsevere TB (without suspicion or evidence of MDR/RR-TB), we recommend the use of a 4-month treatment regimen of 2HRZ(E)/2HR rather than the 6-month DS-TB regimen of 2HRZ(E)/4HR (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence; Table E2). See Table 1 for dosing details.

### An official ATS statement: hepatotoxicity of antituberculosis therapy [^113nMbut]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a problem of increasing significance, but has been a long-standing concern in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) infection. The liver has a central role in drug metabolism and detoxification, and is consequently vulnerable to injury. The pathogenesis and types of DILI are presented, ranging from hepatic adaptation to hepatocellular injury. Knowledge of the metabolism of anti-TB medications and of the mechanisms of TB DILI is incomplete. Understanding of TB DILI has been hampered by differences in study populations, definitions of hepatotoxicity, and monitoring and reporting practices. Available data regarding the incidence and severity of TB DILI overall, in selected demographic groups, and in those coinfected with HIV or hepatitis B or C virus are presented. Systematic steps for prevention and management of TB DILI are recommended. These include patient and regimen selection to optimize benefits over risks, effective staff and patient education, ready access to care for patients, good communication among providers, and judicious use of clinical and biochemical monitoring. During treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) monitoring is recommended for those who chronically consume alcohol, take concomitant hepatotoxic drugs, have viral hepatitis or other preexisting liver disease or abnormal baseline ALT, have experienced prior isoniazid hepatitis, are pregnant or are within 3 months postpartum. During treatment of TB disease, in addition to these individuals, patients with HIV infection should have ALT monitoring. Some experts recommend biochemical monitoring for those older than 35 years. Treatment should be interrupted and, generally, a modified or alternative regimen used for those with ALT elevation more than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in the presence of hepatitis symptoms and/or jaundice, or five times the ULN in the absence of symptoms. Priorities for future studies to develop safer treatments for LTBI and for TB disease are presented.

Tuberculosis (TB) in pregnancy — first-line regimen without pyrazinamide: If pyrazinamide is not included in the initial treatment regimen, the minimum duration of TB therapy with isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol should be 9 months for drug-susceptible TB (AII). The decision regarding whether to include pyrazinamide in treatment regimens during a pregnancy should be made after consultation among obstetricians, TB specialists, and the patient, while considering gestational age and likely susceptibility pattern of the TB strain.

Patient monitoring and adverse events. Hepatic enzymes and other blood tests should be performed for certain patients before initiation of 3HP therapy (Box 2). Approximately 4% of all patients using 3HP experience flu-like or other systemic drug reactions, with fever, headache, dizziness, nausea, muscle and bone pain, rash, itching, red eyes, or other symptoms. Approximately 5% of persons discontinue 3HP because of adverse events, including systemic drug reactions; these reactions typically occur after the first 3–4 doses, and begin approximately 4 hours after ingestion of medication. Hypotension and syncope have been reported rarely (two cases per 1,000 persons treated). If symptoms suggestive of a systemic drug reaction occur, patients should stop 3HP while the cause is determined. Symptoms usually resolve without treatment within 24 hours. Neutropenia and elevation of liver enzymes occur uncommonly. CDC recommends that health care providers educate patients to report adverse events. Patient use of symptom checklists might facilitate timely recognition and reporting. †

BOX 2
Guidance to health care providers during treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) with a combination regimen of isoniazid and rifapentine in 12 once-weekly doses (3HP)

Evaluate all patients for active tuberculosis disease both before and during treatment of LTBI.
Inform the patient or parents or legal guardians about possible adverse effects and instruct them to seek medical attention when symptoms of possible adverse reaction first appear; particularly drug hypersensitivity reactions, rash, hypotension, or thrombocytopenia.
Conduct monthly evaluations to assess treatment adherence and adverse effects, with repeated patient education regarding adverse effects at each visit.
Order baseline hepatic chemistry blood tests (at least aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) for patients with the following specific conditions: human immunodeficiency virus infection, liver disorders, postpartum period (≤ 3 months after delivery), regular alcohol use, injection drug use, or use of medications with known possible interactions.
Conduct blood tests at subsequent clinical encounters for patients whose baseline testing is abnormal and for others at risk for liver disease. Discontinue 3HP if a serum AST concentration is ≥ 5 times the upper limit of normal in the absence of symptoms or ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal in the presence of symptoms.
In case of a possible severe adverse reaction, discontinue 3HP and provide supportive medical care. Conservative management and continuation of 3HP under observation can be considered in the presence of mild to moderate adverse events as determined by health care provider.

### Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: an updated network meta-analysis [^115iBgZC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is an important component of tuberculosis (TB) control, and this study updates a previous network meta-analysis of the best LTBI treatment options to inform public health action and programmatic management of LTBI.

Purpose

To evaluate the comparative efficacy and harms of LTBI treatment regimens aimed at preventing active TB among adults and children.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from indexing to 8 May 2017; clinical trial registries; and conference abstracts. No language restrictions were applied.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials that evaluated human LTBI treatments and recorded at least 1 of 2 prespecified end points (hepatotoxicity and prevention of active TB).

Data Extraction

2 investigators independently extracted data from eligible studies and assessed study quality according to a standard protocol.

Data Synthesis

The network meta-analysis of 8 new and 53 previously included studies showed that isoniazid regimens of 6 months (odds ratio [OR], 0.65 [95% credible interval {CrI}, 0.50 to 0.83]) or 12 to 72 months (OR, 0.50 [CrI, 0.41 to 0.62]), rifampicin-only regimens (OR, 0.41 [CrI, 0.19 to 0.85]), rifampicin-isoniazid regimens of 3 to 4 months (OR, 0.53 [CrI, 0.36 to 0.78]), rifampicin-isoniazid-pyrazinamide regimens (OR, 0.35 [CrI, 0.19 to 0.61]), and rifampicin-pyrazinamide regimens (OR, 0.53 [CrI, 0.33 to 0.84]) were efficacious compared with placebo. Evidence existed for efficacy of weekly rifapentine-isoniazid regimens compared with no treatment (OR, 0.36 [CrI, 0.18 to 0.73]). No conclusive evidence showed that HIV status altered treatment efficacy.

Limitation

Evidence was sparse for many comparisons and hepatotoxicity outcomes, and risk of bias was high or unknown for many studies.

Conclusion

Evidence exists for the efficacy and safety of 6-month isoniazid monotherapy, rifampicin monotherapy, and combination therapies with 3 to 4 months of isoniazid and rifampicin.

### Tuberculosis in pregnant women and neonates: a meta-review of current evidence [^116re3vc]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Pregnant women and their infants are a vulnerable but neglected population in tuberculosis (TB) control efforts. Recent advances in TB prevention, diagnosis and treatment have implications for their care, despite their frequent exclusion from research. We have conducted a meta-review of current evidence and clinical guidelines for TB prevention, diagnosis and management in pregnant women and neonates, focusing on review articles published since 2010. The actual burden of TB in pregnancy is unmeasured, but has been estimated at 216,500 cases per year. Although the effect of pregnancy on TB risk is uncertain and controversial, two large whole-of-population studies found that pregnancy was associated with a two- to three-fold increase in risk of TB. Congenital TB is rare but extremely serious. Neonates exposed to TB after delivery will be at high risk of disease, and preventive therapy is recommended once disease has been ruled out. At present, there is limited evidence regarding the performance of different screening strategies for pregnant women, appropriate drug dosing for either pregnant women or neonates, and the safety of most second-line drugs in pregnancy. High quality evidence on these topics is needed, as are detailed guidelines to inform efforts by TB control programs and clinicians working with pregnant women and their infants.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116bRpXw]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in people with HIV — after excluding active TB and other medical contraindications, people with HIV with a positive TB screening test should receive LTBI treatment (AI), and those in close contact with anyone with infectious TB should receive LTBI treatment regardless of screening test results and CD4 count (AII). In the United States, people with HIV who have a negative tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) and no recent contact with a person with infectious TB likely will not benefit from LTBI treatment, and preventive therapy is not generally recommended (AIII). LTBI treatment and antiretroviral therapy (ART) act independently to decrease TB risk; therefore, the use of both interventions is recommended for people with LTBI and HIV (AI), and deferring ART until after completion of LTBI treatment is not recommended (AI). People with HIV successfully treated for LTBI should not have repeat testing with TST or IGRA. Given important drug–drug interactions between rifamycins and antiretroviral agents, selection of an LTBI regimen will depend on a patient's current or planned ARV regimen, and use of rifapentine in pregnancy is not currently recommended (BIII).

### Tuberculosis in pregnancy [^111VMsg7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) in pregnancy poses a substantial risk of morbidity to both the pregnant woman and the fetus if not diagnosed and treated in a timely manner. Assessing the risk of having Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is essential to determining when further evaluation should occur. Obstetrician-gynecologists are in a unique position to identify individuals with infection and facilitate further evaluation and follow up as needed. A TB evaluation consists of a TB risk assessment, medical history, physical examination, and a symptom screen; a TB test should be performed if indicated by the TB evaluation. If a pregnant woman has signs or symptoms of TB or if the test result for TB infection is positive, active TB disease must be ruled out before delivery, with a chest radiograph and other diagnostics as indicated. If active TB disease is diagnosed, it should be treated; providers must decide when treatment of latent TB infection is most beneficial. Most women will not require latent TB infection treatment while pregnant, but all require close follow up and monitoring. Treatment should be coordinated with the TB control program within the respective jurisdiction and initiated based on the woman's risk factors including social history, comorbidities (particularly human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection), and concomitant medications.

### A community perspective on the inclusion of pregnant women in tuberculosis drug trials [^115LdEJk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Affecting both mother and the existing pregnancy, tuberculosis (TB) increases the likelihood of poor birth outcomes. Despite substantial clinical need for TB prevention and treatment, pregnant women remain neglected by research initiatives. As members of 3 community advisory boards that provide input into TB drug trials, we offer a community perspective on the inclusion of pregnant women in TB drug research and discuss (1) our perspective on the risk/benefit tradeoff of including pregnant women in research to address different forms of TB; (2) recent examples of progress in this area; (3) lessons learned from the human immunodeficiency virus research field, where pregnant women have enjoyed better-although imperfect-representation in research; and (4) recommendations for different stakeholders, including researchers, regulatory authorities, ethics committees, and policymakers.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) screening and latent TB infection (LTBI) management during pregnancy in women with HIV: Pregnant women with HIV who lack documentation of a prior negative TB screening result or are at high risk for exposure should be tested for TB during pregnancy (AIII), and the frequency of anergy is not increased so routine anergy testing is not recommended. In a study of pregnant women with HIV, a positive IGRA result was associated with a 4.5-fold increased risk of developing active TB disease; in those with CD4 cell counts < 250 cells/mm3, a positive IGRA was associated with a five-fold increased risk of maternal mortality or active TB disease and a three-fold increased risk of either active TB disease or mortality in infants. If LTBI is diagnosed during pregnancy and active TB disease has been ruled out, treatment with isoniazid should be delayed until after delivery (BI); however, IPT is still recommended for pregnant women with close household contacts with TB. Individuals with HIV who are not receiving ART have a high risk of progression from LTBI to active TB disease (10% per year), whereas the risk on ART is significantly decreased, and pregnant women with HIV should be receiving ART for their own health and to prevent perinatal transmission.

Tuberculosis (TB) treatment — four-month rifapentine–moxifloxacin regimen is supported by a randomized trial and is now recommended as an alternative option for eligible patients: a 4-month regimen of 2 months (8 weeks) of rifapentine, moxifloxacin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide followed by 2 months (9 weeks) of rifapentine, moxifloxacin, and isoniazid was as effective as a standard 6-month regimen and was non-inferior in microbiologically eligible and assessable populations; this four-month regimen is now recommended as an alternative option for people with and without HIV who are 12 years of age or older (AI), but it is not recommended for children under 12 years of age, pregnant women, people with extrapulmonary TB, or people with HIV who are taking a non-efavirenz-based antiretroviral regimen (AII); during the trial the only antiretroviral therapy allowed was efavirenz-containing, and a similar 4-month regimen without moxifloxacin was inferior to the control arm.

### Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. An official ATS / CDC / ERS / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^1171EHT7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Pregnant women with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) had reported treatment outcomes and fetal events as follows: Of the 65 pregnant women with available outcomes, 49% (n = 32) were cured and 20% (n = 13) completed treatment for a treatment success proportion of 69%; 14% (n = 9) died, 9% (n = 6) had treatment failure, 3% (n = 2) were lost to follow-up, and four women were still receiving treatment at publication. Fetal outcomes included 78.5% (n = 51) healthy births, with eight children premature or of low birth weight; medical abortions occurred in 12% (n = 8), spontaneous abortions in 3% (n = 2), stillbirth in one child (1.5%), 3% (n = 2) of children were born with HIV, and 1.5% (n = 1) had TB/HIV coinfection. Most second-line drugs are FDA pregnancy category C, with bedaquiline and meropenem category B and aminoglycosides category D. The authors state there is little evidence to support treatment of MDR-TB during pregnancy, yet "believe that the benefits of treatment to mother, child, and the community outweigh the harms", and note "most MDR-TB experts avoid aminoglycosides and ethionamide in pregnant women if alternative agents can be used"; a consensus statement "advocated for allowing pregnant and lactating women to remain eligible for phase III MDR-TB trials".

### Tuberculosis prevention for non-US-born pregnant women [^116EnYxK]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether non-US-born pregnant women receiving prenatal care are targeted for treatment of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) with isoniazid (INH) to prevent active TB.

Study Design

This was a retrospective chart review study of 730 non-US-born pregnant women receiving care at 5 New York City prenatal clinics from 1999 to 2000.

Results

Among 678 women with known tuberculin skin test (TST) status, 341 (50.3%) had a TST-positive result, including 200 who were newly diagnosed. Of 291 TST-positive women with no previous LTBI treatment or history of TB, 27 (9.3%) completed ≥ 6 months of INH. In a subset with detailed follow-up, the most important reasons for not completing treatment were nonreferral for evaluation of a TST-positive result (30.9%), not keeping the appointment (17.9%), and nonadherence with prescribed treatment (34.6%).

Conclusion

The prenatal setting represents a missed opportunity to link TST-positive non-US-born women with LTBI treatment and support for treatment completion.

Methods

Data Collection

Porter Novelli conducts online surveys of U.S. HCPs. TB questions were included in the 2020, 2021, and 2022 DocStyles annual fall surveys. Each year Porter Novelli sets quotas to collect completed surveys from 1,000 primary care physicians (i.e. family practitioners and internists) and 250 each of obstetricians/gynecologists, pediatricians, and nurse practitioners or physician assistants. Respondents must practice in the United States; actively see patients; work in an individual, group, or inpatient or hospital practice; and have been practicing for ≥ 3 years. Respondents were asked, "Do you routinely test non–U.S.-born patients for tuberculosis (TB)?" and instructed to select one of the following response options: "Yes, with a TB blood test", "Yes, with a TB skin test", "Yes, with a TB blood test and skin test", "No, I do not regularly test for TB", "I refer patients to the health department", and "Prefer not to answer". Respondents were also asked to select all of the following LTBI treatment regimens they prescribe: "Isoniazid & Rifapentine - 3 months (3HP)", "Rifampin - 4 months (4R)", "Isoniazid & Rifampin - 3 months (3HR)", "Isoniazid - 6 months (6H)", "Isoniazid - 9 months (9H)", "I refer patients to the health department", and "None of these". Additional information on methods and response rates is available on the Porter Novelli website. †

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^114opoTs]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Comprehensive guidelines for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among persons living in the United States were last published in 2000 (American Thoracic Society. CDC targeted tuberculin testing and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2000;161:S221–47). Since then, several new regimens have been evaluated in clinical trials. To update previous guidelines, the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) and CDC convened a committee to conduct a systematic literature review and make new recommendations for the most effective and least toxic regimens for treatment of LTBI among persons who live in the United States. The systematic literature review included clinical trials of regimens to treat LTBI. Quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) from clinical trial comparisons was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. In addition, a network meta-analysis evaluated regimens that had not been compared directly in clinical trials. The effectiveness outcome was tuberculosis disease; the toxicity outcome was hepatotoxicity. Strong GRADE recommendations required at least moderate evidence of effectiveness and that the desirable consequences outweighed the undesirable consequences in the majority of patients. Conditional GRADE recommendations were made when determination of whether desirable consequences outweighed undesirable consequences was uncertain (e.g., with low-quality evidence). These updated 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines include the NTCA- and CDC-recommended treatment regimens that comprise three preferred rifamycin-based regimens and two alternative monotherapy regimens with daily isoniazid. All recommended treatment regimens are intended for persons infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is presumed to be susceptible to isoniazid or rifampin. These updated guidelines do not apply when evidence is available that the infecting M. tuberculosis strain is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin; recommendations for treating contacts exposed to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis were published in 2019 (Nahid P, Mase SR Migliori GB, et al. Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. An official ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA clinical practice guideline. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2019;200:e93-e142). The three rifamycin-based preferred regimens are 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine, 4 months of daily rifampin, or 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin. Prescribing providers or pharmacists who are unfamiliar with rifampin and rifapentine might confuse the two drugs. They are not interchangeable, and caution should be taken to ensure that patients receive the correct medication for the intended regimen. Preference for these rifamycin-based regimens was made on the basis of effectiveness, safety, and high treatment completion rates. The two alternative treatment regimens are daily isoniazid for 6 or 9 months; isoniazid monotherapy is efficacious but has higher toxicity risk and lower treatment completion rates than shorter rifamycin-based regimens. In summary, short-course (3- to 4-month) rifamycin-based treatment regimens are preferred over longer-course (6–9 month) isoniazid monotherapy for treatment of LTBI. These updated guidelines can be used by clinicians, public health officials, policymakers, health care organizations, and other state and local stakeholders who might need to adapt them to fit individual clinical circumstances.

### Update of recommendations for use of once-weekly isoniazid-rifapentine regimen to treat latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [^114GvApq]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Rifapentine is a rifamycin compound; like rifampin, it induces metabolism of many medications. CDC recommends monitoring of patients when 3HP is prescribed with interacting medications (e.g. methadone or warfarin). Rifapentine can reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives; therefore, women who use hormonal birth control should be advised to add, or switch to, a barrier method. Women should be advised to inform their health care provider if they decide to try to become pregnant or become pregnant during 3HP treatment.

Because altered dosing might reduce effectiveness or safety, patients on 3HP SAT should be encouraged to record medication intake and report deviations from the prescribed regimen. Persons on 3HP regimens should be evaluated monthly (in person or by telephone) to assess adherence and adverse effects.

Additional studies are needed to understand the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerance of 3HP in children aged < 2 years; adherence and safety of 3HP-SAT in persons aged < 18 years; and safety of 3HP during pregnancy.

Any LTBI treatment–associated adverse effect leading to hospital admission or death should be reported by health care providers to local or state health departments for inclusion in the National Surveillance for Severe Adverse Events Associated with Treatment for LTBI (e-mail:). Serious drug side effects, product quality problems, and therapeutic failures should be reported to the Food and Drug Administration's MedWatch program or by telephoning 1–800-FDA-1088.

Additional information regarding 3HP is available at. Questions also can be directed to CDC's Division of Tuberculosis Elimination by e-mail or by telephoning 800-INFO (800–232–4636).

### Treatment for latent tuberculosis infection… [^112tSutD]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points People with latent tuberculosis infection can be treated to prevent TB disease. CDC and the National Tuberculosis Coalition of America preferentially recommend short-course, rifamycin-based, 3- or 4-month latent TB infection treatment regimens. Overview Finding and treating people with latent TB infection is essential for controlling and eliminating TB disease. Treatment for latent TB infection prevents TB disease. For Everyone: Treating Inactive Tuberculosis. Treatment Recommendations Health care providers may consider several recommended regimens for the treatment of latent TB infection. Treatment can take three, four, six, or nine months, depending on the regimen. Regimens use one or more of the following drugs:

- Isoniazid
- Rifapentine
- Rifampin.

CDC and the National Tuberculosis Coalition of America preferentially recommend short-course, rifamycin-based, 3- or 4-month latent TB infection treatment regimens over 6- or 9-month isoniazid monotherapy. Short-course regimens are effective, safe, and have higher completion rates than longer regimens. Treatment for latent TB infection can be administered by directly observed therapy or by self-administered therapy. Isoniazid monotherapy regimens Regimens of six to nine months of isoniazid monotherapy are alternative, effective latent TB infection treatment regimens if a short-course treatment regimen is not an option. Although effective, 6H and 9H have higher toxicity risk and lower treatment completion rates than most short-course treatment regimens. People can be treated daily or twice weekly with isonaizid. Patients being treated twice weekly should receive directly observed therapy.

Patient monitoring and education Health care providers should assess the patient's progress at least monthly. This evaluation includes clinical monitoring, laboratory testing, and patient education. Laboratory testing at the start of latent TB infection therapy is recommended for patients with any of the following factors:

- Liver disorders
- History of liver disease
- Regular use of alcohol or injection drugs
- Risks for chronic liver disease
- HIV infection
- Pregnancy or the immediate post-partum period.

### State-of-the-art review of HIV-TB coinfection in special populations [^116RTHFS]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Children and pregnant and postpartum women experience an undue burden of HIV-associated tuberculosis (TB), but data are lacking on key aspects of their complex management. Often excluded from clinical trials, they are left with limited options for HIV-TB cotreatment. This review will focus on pharmacologic aspects of the treatment of HIV-TB coinfection in the special populations of children and pregnant and postpartum women. Pharmacogenomic considerations, rational dosing, drug-drug interactions, safety, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, and ethical and policy aspects of the inclusion of special populations in research will be surveyed. Considerations related to the treatment of both HIV-associated TB disease and HIV-associated latent TB infection will be summarized. Relevant knowledge gaps and research priorities in special populations will be outlined.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112bsb6y]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Low credibility.

This report updates and combines earlier versions of guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections (OIs) in HIV-infected adults (i.e., persons aged ≥ 18 years) and adolescents (i.e., persons aged 13–17 years), last published in 2002 and 2004, respectively. It has been prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA) of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). The guidelines are intended for use by clinicians and other health-care providers, HIV-infected patients, and policy makers in the United States. These guidelines address several OIs that occur in the United States and five OIs that might be acquired during international travel. Topic areas covered for each OI include epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prevention of exposure; prevention of disease by chemoprophylaxis and vaccination; discontinuation of primary prophylaxis after immune reconstitution; treatment of disease; monitoring for adverse effects during treatment; management of treatment failure; prevention of disease recurrence; discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis after immune reconstitution; and special considerations during pregnancy. These guidelines were developed by a panel of specialists from the United States government and academic institutions. For each OI, a small group of specialists with content-matter expertise reviewed the literature for new information since the guidelines were last published; they then proposed revised recommendations at a meeting held at NIH in June 2007. After these presentations and discussion, the revised guidelines were further reviewed by the co-editors; by the Office of AIDS Research, NIH; by specialists at CDC; and by HIVMA of IDSA before final approval and publication. The recommendations are rated by a letter that indicates the strength of the recommendation and a Roman numeral that indicates the quality of evidence supporting the recommendation, so that readers can ascertain how best to apply the recommendations in their practice environments. Major changes in the guidelines include 1) greater emphasis on the importance of antiretroviral therapy for the prevention and treatment of OIs, especially those OIs for which no specific therapy exists; 2) information regarding the diagnosis and management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes; 3) information regarding the use of interferon-gamma release assays for the diagnosis of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection; 4) updated information concerning drug interactions that affect the use of rifamycin drugs for prevention and treatment of TB; 5) the addition of a section on hepatitis B virus infection; and 6) the addition of malaria to the list of OIs that might be acquired during international travel. This report includes eleven tables pertinent to the prevention and treatment of OIs, a figure that pertains to the diagnois of tuberculosis, a figure that describes immunization recommendations, and an appendix that summarizes recommendations for prevention of exposure to opportunistic pathogens.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^113v2fGP]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Other Considerations

Following are several considerations for the use of these guidelines. First, the committee did not include cost-effectiveness in evaluating the evidence; recommendations were based on evaluating effectiveness and toxicity of the regimens. Second, the committee did not evaluate evidence regarding how to implement these regimens programmatically (e.g. who to test and treat and management of side effects). Third, these guidelines focus on treatment regimens for persons with LTBI living in countries with low TB disease incidence. These guidelines do not address other empiric TB prevention strategies (e.g. 1 month of isoniazid plus rifapentine among HIV-positive persons living in settings with a high TB incidence regardless of results from the TST or an interferon-gamma release assay). Finally, shorter regimens should not be used for patients in whom rifamycins are contraindicated, including those taking medications with significant drug-drug interactions with rifamycins.

### Drug-drug interactions of infectious disease treatments in low-income countries: a neglected topic? [^1167ZhKP]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Treatment of TB in pregnant women is also not immune from this imbalance in research. Currently, the WHO does not recommend any changes in treatment protocol for pregnant women. 16 Although first‐line treatments are currently considered safe for both mother and fetus, there is little research supporting this and at least three medications — isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol — are able to cross the placental barrier and are known to have an increased risk for adverse events, such as hepatotoxicity. 45 Research on treatment of TB in children also lags behind that of adults in LICs. Historically, a combined approach of 2HRZE/4HR, the same as what is preferred with adults, has been used to treat TB in children without appreciating developmental and ontogeny changes. Whereas the 2014 WHO guidance on treatment of TB in children did propose updated daily doses, these changes are based primarily on observational studies and "moderate‐quality" evidence. 46, 47 Although dose modification could help to ensure that sufficient concentrations of drug are reached, there is little evidence on the safety of these doses in children and limited understanding of the potential for hepatotoxicity. These populations become more complex when coinfection exists. It is estimated that almost half of adult HIV‐related TB deaths in 2017 were in women of childbearing age. 48 Pregnant women with concurrent TB/HIV infection face higher risk of poor delivery outcomes and higher mortality rates. 49, 50 Coinfection and subsequent comedication increase the potential for drug interactions far beyond what is predicted for nonpregnant adults due to the physiological changes during pregnancy that can dramatically affect drug exposures in both pregnant women and fetuses.

Conclusion

For patients without drug intolerability or drug-drug interactions, short-course (3–4 months) rifamycin-based treatment regimens are preferred over the longer-course (6–9 months) isoniazid monotherapy for treatment of LTBI. These guidelines can be used by clinicians, public health officials, policymakers, health care organizations, and other state and local stakeholders who might need to adapt these guidelines for individual clinical circumstances. Local and state TB programs in the United States answer questions about diagnosing and treating persons with LTBI in their jurisdictions.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^115etmR2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — anti-TNF safety, pregnancy, and pretreatment screening: The safety profile of anti-TNF agents is generally favorable, but a small percentage of patients may experience severe adverse events, and a meta-analysis of 21 anti-TNF clinical trials including 5,356 patients with CD found that anti-TNF therapy did not increase the risk of serious infection, malignancy, or death compared with placebo. In addition, these agents are safe to use during preconception planning, throughout pregnancy and post partum. Before anti-TNF therapy is considered for use in patients with CD, pretreatment screening for infections and laboratory abnormalities is required; testing for latent and active tuberculosis should be undertaken as well as assessment of particular risk factors for exposure. Interferon-γ release assays are likely to complement the tuberculin skin test and are preferred in patients who are Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccinated, if available. If latent tuberculosis is detected, initiation of chemoprophylaxis with antituberculous therapy should be initiated for several weeks before administration of anti-TNF therapy.

Tuberculosis is most common during a woman's reproductive years and is a major cause of maternal-child mortality. National guidelines for screening and management vary widely owing to insufficient data. In this article, we review the available data on (1) the global burden of tuberculosis in women of reproductive age; (2) how pregnancy and the postpartum period affect the course of tuberculosis; (3) how to screen and diagnose pregnant and postpartum women for active and latent tuberculosis; (4) the management of active and latent tuberculosis in pregnancy and the postpartum period, including the safety of tuberculosis medications; and (5) infant outcomes. We also include data on HIV/tuberculosis coinfection and drug-resistant tuberculosis. Finally, we highlight research gaps in tuberculosis in pregnant and postpartum women.

### Update on latent tuberculosis infection [^111bmnAW]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection refers to an asymptomatic, nontransmissible infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, carrying a 5% to 10% lifetime risk of progressing to active disease. One-half of this risk occurs within the first two years after infection. High-risk groups include recent immigrants from high-incidence countries, health care professionals, persons living or working in institutional settings, and homeless persons. Risk factors for progression to active disease include immunodeficiency, recent exposure to tuberculosis, and chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis. Tuberculin skin testing has several limitations, including the need for multiple office visits and the potential for false-positive results in patients who have received the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine or been exposed to environmental mycobacteria. Interferon-gamma release assays address these deficiencies but are limited by their cost and requirement for blood processing. Interferon-gamma release assays are preferred in immigrants exposed to bacillus Calmette-Guérin and in patients who are not likely to return for interpretation of skin test results. Tuberculin skin testing is preferred for children younger than five years. Active disease should be excluded before initiating treatment. The newest treatment option of 12 weekly doses of isoniazid and rifapentine has similar or better effectiveness than standard nine-month therapy with daily isoniazid. A four-month regimen of daily rifampin is another alternative.

### Drug-induced liver injury in pregnancy: the U.S. drug-induced liver injury network experience [^1141AU4S]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

There are limited data on the causative agents and characteristics of drug-induced liver injury in pregnant individuals. Data from patients with drug-induced liver injury enrolled in the ongoing multicenter Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network between 2004 and 2022 and occurring during pregnancy or 6 months postpartum were reviewed and compared with cases of drug-induced liver injury in nonpregnant women of childbearing age. Among 325 individuals of childbearing age in the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network, 16 cases of drug-induced liver injury (5%) occurred during pregnancy or postpartum. Compared with drug-induced liver injury in nonpregnant women, pregnancy-related drug-induced liver injury was more severe (P < .05). One elective termination and three miscarriages were documented; there were no maternal deaths. We recommend that isoniazid for latent tuberculosis be deferred to the postpartum period whenever feasible and that β-blockers or calcium channel blockers rather than methyldopa be used for hypertension management during pregnancy.

### Rifapentine (Priftin) [^113nKza8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Human data

Fourteen patients with active tuberculosis treated with multiple antituberculosis drugs including PRIFTIN became pregnant during clinical studies. Six delivered normal infants, four had first trimester spontaneous abortions (of these, one patient abused ethanol and another patient was HIV-infected), one had an elective abortion, and outcome was unknown in three patients. These data are, however, limited by the quality of reporting and confounded by comorbid medical conditions and multiple antituberculosis drug exposures.

In the trial that compared the safety and effectiveness of PRIFTIN in combination with isoniazid to isoniazid alone for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection, a total of 45 (2.5%) women in the PRIFTIN/isoniazid arm and 71 (4.1%) women in the isoniazid arm became pregnant. Among the 46 total pregnancies in the PRIFTIN/isoniazid arm, there were 31 live births, 6 elective abortions, 7 spontaneous abortions, and 2 unknown outcomes. Of the 31 live infants, 21 were reported healthy while in the other ten cases no further details were available. The rate of spontaneous abortion in the PRIFTIN/isoniazid arm (15%) and the rate of spontaneous abortion in the isoniazid arm (19%) did not represent an increase over the background rate of 15 to 20 percent reported in the general population. Further interpretation of these results is limited by the quality of adverse event reporting.

### The clinical management of drug-resistant tuberculosis [^112oqu9b]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a growing problem, with almost half a million cases worldwide. In spite of the difficulty in its management, drug-resistant tuberculosis can be successfully treated, even in poor settings.

Recent Findings

This article will review key findings in the areas of epidemiology, diagnosis and management of drug-resistant tuberculosis, including new antituberculous drugs. The issue of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis will also be reviewed and discussed. Finally, novel approaches to the management of drug-resistant tuberculosis in populations with HIV, as well as in pediatric populations, among pregnant women, and among patients requiring surgical therapy, will be reviewed.

Summary

New advances in the diagnosis and management of drug-resistant tuberculosis allow for excellent clinical outcomes to be achieved, even in difficult-to-treat populations. This is possible with timely diagnosis of disease and rapid initiation of appropriate therapy in supported settings.

We expected that there would be publications after the Joint Panel's review of available evidence that would address implementation issues. In particular, evidence is needed to recognize which of the implementation issues are actual significant problems to overcome. We note the retrospective review by Louie and colleagues that identified adherence issues with even low-grade adverse events, highlighting differences between clinical trial conditions and medical practice. We look forward to emerging and future publications that will provide evidence regarding the implementation challenges of the new regimens and for steps to lift barriers to short-regimen implementation.

Just as we have several options for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection, it is desirable to have several options for treating tuberculosis, which may be tailored to the patient and the resources of the tuberculosis program.

### Tuberculosis infection in women of reproductive age: a cross-sectional study at antenatal care clinics in an Ethiopian city [^111fGCJw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Early diagnosis and treatment of active TB, as well as prevention, is of special importance in pregnant women. Symptom-based screening for active TB is recommended as part of ANC in Ethiopia, but evidence is lacking on how such screening should be performed. As illustrated by the finding of 2 cases of active TB in HIV-positive women without TB-related symptoms, active TB during pregnancy can be asymptomatic or have atypical presentation.

Our findings highlight the need of improved TB control in connection to pregnancy. Since the incidence of active TB has been reported to be higher postpartum compared to during pregnancy, assessment of women after delivery should also be considered. Further research is required in this field, including the role of diagnosis and treatment of LTBI.

To reflect the cumulative burden of TB in young women, we used a broad definition of TB infection, including both active and latent infection as well as self-reported history of previous treatment for active TB. For determination of LTBI status among women without active TB, we used the novel QFT assay. Similar to previous versions of QFT assays, this method is based on measurement of IFN-γ in plasma after whole-blood incubation with Mtb specific antigens. While initially considered as a binary test, the choice of a threshold level for definition of a positive reaction has been debated, especially since results close to the recommended cutoff level (0.35 IU/mL) are subject to variability on repeat testing. We and other researchers have presented data suggesting that a lower threshold level (0.20 IU/mL) could be considered for identification of LTBI in persons with immunosuppressive conditions, to increase assay sensitivity in such individuals. In our cohort, 69 of 1749 women had IFN-γ levels in the low borderline range (0.20–0.34 IU/mL). The proportions of persons displaying this pattern did not differ with regard to HIV serostatus, nor for other characteristics.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^111Q3gwt]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

One fourth of the global population (approximately 2 billion persons) is estimated to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including approximately 13 million in the United States. Most infected persons are asymptomatic and classified as having latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). If untreated, approximately 5%–10% of persons with LTBI progress to tuberculosis (TB) disease during their lifetime. Progression from untreated LTBI accounts for approximately 80% of U.S. TB disease cases. Treatment of LTBI is effective in preventing progression to TB disease. The most recent comprehensive guidelines for treatment of LTBI in the United States were published in 2000. In 2003, CDC and the American Thoracic Society recommended against use of the 2-month regimen of rifampin plus pyrazinamide because of the risk for severe hepatotoxicity. Since then, several new regimens have been evaluated in clinical trials. To update the 2000 and 2003 treatment guidelines, the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) and CDC convened a committee to conduct a systematic literature review of clinical trials for the treatment of LTBI. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria were applied to the evidence of effectiveness, a network meta-analysis of selected evidence was performed, and the evidence was used to support 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines.

These updated 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines apply to persons with LTBI who live in the United States. In addition, these guidelines apply to persons infected with M. tuberculosis that is presumed to be susceptible to isoniazid or rifampin; they do not apply when evidence is available that the infecting M. tuberculosis strain is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin. Local and state TB programs in the United States answer questions about diagnosing and treating persons with LTBI in their jurisdictions.­

### Isoniazid preventive therapy in HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women [^116hLApa]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

The safety, efficacy, and appropriate timing of isoniazid therapy to prevent tuberculosis in pregnant women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are receiving antiretroviral therapy are unknown.

Methods

In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned pregnant women with HIV infection to receive isoniazid preventive therapy for 28 weeks, initiated either during pregnancy (immediate group) or at week 12 after delivery (deferred group). Mothers and infants were followed through week 48 after delivery. The primary outcome was a composite of treatment-related maternal adverse events of grade 3 or higher or permanent discontinuation of the trial regimen because of toxic effects. The noninferiority margin was an upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference in the rate of the primary outcome of less than 5 events per 100 person-years.

Results

A total of 956 women were enrolled. A primary outcome event occurred in 72 of 477 women (15.1%) in the immediate group and in 73 of 479 (15.2%) in the deferred group (incidence rate, 15.03 and 14.93 events per 100 person-years, respectively; rate difference, 0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] -4.77 to 4.98, which met the criterion for noninferiority). Two women in the immediate group and 4 women in the deferred group died (incidence rate, 0.40 and 0.78 per 100 person-years, respectively; rate difference, -0.39; 95% CI, -1.33 to 0.56); all deaths occurred during the postpartum period, and 4 were from liver failure (2 of the women who died from liver failure had received isoniazid [1 in each group]). Tuberculosis developed in 6 women (3 in each group); the incidence rate was 0.60 per 100 person-years in the immediate group and 0.59 per 100 person-years in the deferred group (rate difference, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.94 to 0.96). There was a higher incidence in the immediate group than in the deferred group of an event included in the composite adverse pregnancy outcome (stillbirth or spontaneous abortion, low birth weight in an infant, preterm delivery, or congenital anomalies in an infant) (23.6% vs. 17.0%; difference, 6.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.8 to 11.9).

Conclusions

The risks associated with initiation of isoniazid preventive therapy during pregnancy appeared to be greater than those associated with initiation of therapy during the postpartum period.

### Toward earlier inclusion of pregnant and postpartum women in tuberculosis drug trials: consensus statements from an international expert panel [^112af42W]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in women of childbearing age (15–44 years). Despite increased tuberculosis risk during pregnancy, optimal clinical treatment remains unclear: safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data for many tuberculosis drugs are lacking, and trials of promising new tuberculosis drugs exclude pregnant women. To advance inclusion of pregnant and postpartum women in tuberculosis drug trials, the US National Institutes of Health convened an international expert panel. Discussions generated consensus statements (> 75% agreement among panelists) identifying high-priority research areas during pregnancy, including: (1) preventing progression of latent tuberculosis infection, especially in women coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus; (2) evaluating new agents/regimens for treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; and (3) evaluating safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of tuberculosis drugs already in use during pregnancy and postpartum. Incorporating pregnant women into clinical trials would extend evidence-based tuberculosis prevention and treatment standards to this special population.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^116rEKeE]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

Comprehensive guidelines for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among persons living in the United States were last published in 2000 (American Thoracic Society. CDC targeted tuberculin testing and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2000;161:S221–47). Since then, several new regimens have been evaluated in clinical trials. To update previous guidelines, the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) and CDC convened a committee to conduct a systematic literature review and make new recommendations for the most effective and least toxic regimens for treatment of LTBI among persons who live in the United States.

The systematic literature review included clinical trials of regimens to treat LTBI. Quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) from clinical trial comparisons was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. In addition, a network meta-analysis evaluated regimens that had not been compared directly in clinical trials. The effectiveness outcome was tuberculosis disease; the toxicity outcome was hepatotoxicity. Strong GRADE recommendations required at least moderate evidence of effectiveness and that the desirable consequences outweighed the undesirable consequences in the majority of patients. Conditional GRADE recommendations were made when determination of whether desirable consequences outweighed undesirable consequences was uncertain (e.g. with low-quality evidence).

These updated 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines include the NTCA- and CDC-recommended treatment regimens that comprise three preferred rifamycin-based regimens and two alternative monotherapy regimens with daily isoniazid. All recommended treatment regimens are intended for persons infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is presumed to be susceptible to isoniazid or rifampin. These updated guidelines do not apply when evidence is available that the infecting M. tuberculosis strain is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin; recommendations for treating contacts exposed to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis were published in 2019 (Nahid P, Mase SR Migliori GB, et al. Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. An official ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA clinical practice guideline. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2019;200:e93–e142). The three rifamycin-based preferred regimens are 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine, 4 months of daily rifampin, or 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin. Prescribing providers or pharmacists who are unfamiliar with rifampin and rifapentine might confuse the two drugs. They are not interchangeable, and caution should be taken to ensure that patients receive the correct medication for the intended regimen. Preference for these rifamycin-based regimens was made on the basis of effectiveness, safety, and high treatment completion rates. The two alternative treatment regimens are daily isoniazid for 6 or 9 months; isoniazid monotherapy is efficacious but has higher toxicity risk and lower treatment completion rates than shorter rifamycin-based regimens.

In summary, short-course (3- to 4-month) rifamycin-based treatment regimens are preferred over longer-course (6–9 month) isoniazid monotherapy for treatment of LTBI. These updated guidelines can be used by clinicians, public health officials, policymakers, health care organizations, and other state and local stakeholders who might need to adapt them to fit individual clinical circumstances.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^117CuS9i]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Special considerations during pregnancy — During pregnancy, if there is no documentation of a prior negative TB screening test result or there is a high risk for repeated or ongoing exposure to people with active TB disease, then test for TB (AIII). TB rates in pregnant and postpartum women are higher than in other people with HIV. Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) for diagnosis of latent TB infection (LTBI) appear to perform well in pregnant women with or without HIV, but longitudinal studies in high-burden countries suggest test performance may be compromised in late pregnancy versus postpartum, especially at delivery.

### Pregnancy and birth outcomes in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treated with regimens that include new and repurposed drugs [^113zeaKf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Pregnant women who received effective MDR/RR-TB treatment regimens had excellent outcomes, and no major negative impacts were detected in their infants. These data could be accentuated by comparisons with other cohorts not affected by TB or exposed to different MDR/RR-TB treatments and identification of factors that contribute to low birthweight in babies born to mothers with MDR/RR-TB. Inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials would facilitate generation of these data. Finally, a global registry is urgently needed to contribute to the evidence base to assist parents, clinicians, and TB programs with informed decision-making.

Isoniazid

In the United States, an estimated 13 million individuals have latent TB, but > 10,000 individuals are treated for active TB each year. Although the incidence of severe DILI appears to be lower than previously appreciated, isoniazid continues to be a leading cause of DILI‐related ALF in the United States and worldwide (Table 2).–The recommended treatment for latent TB has recently changed from 6 to 9 months of isoniazid monotherapy to regimens with a lower risk of hepatoxicity, including 3–4‐month regimens of isoniazid with other agents. Whereas the treatment for active TB still consists of isoniazid, rifamycin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, alternative strategies are now available that depend on various individual patient characteristics.

Over the past 40 years, various recommendations for laboratory monitoring while receiving isoniazid have been proposed that begin with baseline liver assessments for all patients. However, this approach has not been shown to be better than assessing for clinical symptoms of hepatitis at detecting toxicity.–Although the specific details are left to individual local and state programs to adopt, monthly liver test monitoring is generally reserved for those with baseline liver test abnormalities, viral hepatitis, heavy alcohol use, use of other hepatotoxic medications, underlying liver disease or HIV infection, and current or recently pregnant women. Periodic liver tests can also be performed in those older than 35 years of age. Underreporting and poor adherence to American Thoracic Society guidelines are common in cases of isoniazid hepatotoxicity and are associated with hospitalization, death, and liver transplantation. However, when patients are educated to self‐monitor and stop drugs when symptoms occur, ALF and death can be averted. Finally, reintroduction of isoniazid after a DILI episode leads to recurrent liver injury in only 10% of patients but should only be done for patients with active, drug‐resistant TB.

### Congenital tuberculosis in an extremely preterm infant conceived after in vitro fertilization: case report [^113iLoph]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Our case report highlights the need to raise awareness about the possibility of latent genital tuberculosis in an infertile woman and initiating timely anti-tuberculous therapy in newborns. Genital TB is a common cause of infertility in women from areas where TB is prevalent. However, with increasing global migration, genital TB is being increasingly recognized in developed countries. Although congenital TB due to maternal genitourinary TB is uncommon, the increasing availability of assisted reproductive technologies, especially IVF, has the potential to increase the prevalence of congenital TB. Currently, IVF is one of the commonest treatment for infertility, and the number of babies conceived through IVF is increasing. Presently, many women whose infertility was caused by genital TB choose IVF as an option to conceive. In developed countries, immigrants for endemic areas, such as the mother of our patient and HIV infected mothers in resource limited countries would be at high risk for TB. Screening for latent TB during pregnancy can, however, be problematic. The tuberculin skin test can be false positive in mothers who have received BCG vaccine and be false negative in mothers with HIV. Some investigators do not recommend chest X-ray in pregnancy and the AFB smear has a low sensitivity. AFB culture is time consuming and may not be easily available everywhere. The interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) test is recommended by some investigators as the results are not affected by BCG vaccination or HIV status. Thus, a high level of clinical suspicion has to be maintained in high risk populations with a thorough assessment including a detailed clinical history at the time of prenatal visits. Importantly, pregnant women with TB who are treated appropriately do not have increased levels of maternal or neonatal complications.

### Effects of pregnancy and isoniazid preventive therapy on Mycobacterium tuberculosis interferon gamma response assays in women with HIV [^114FdV6a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pregnancy is accompanied by immune suppression. We hypothesized that Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific inflammatory responses used to identify latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) lose positivity during pregnancy. We also hypothesized that isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) may revert LTBI diagnoses because of its sterilizing activity.

Methods

944 women with human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) participating in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing 28 weeks of IPT antepartum versus postpartum, were tested by QuantiFERON-gold-in-tube (QGIT) antepartum and by QGIT and tuberculin skin test (TST) at delivery and postpartum. Serial QGIT positivity was assessed by logistic regression using generalized estimating equations.

Results

From entry to delivery, 68 (24%) of 284 QGIT-positive women reverted to QGIT-negative or indeterminate. Of these, 42 (62%) recovered QGIT positivity postpartum. The loss of QGIT positivity during pregnancy was explained by decreased interferon gamma (IFNγ) production in response to TB antigen and/or mitogen. At delivery, LTBI was identified by QGIT in 205 women and by TST in 113 women. Corresponding numbers postpartum were 229 and 122 women. QGIT and TST kappa agreement coefficients were 0.4 and 0.5, respectively. Among QGIT-positive women antepartum or at delivery, 34 (12%) reverted to QGIT-negative after IPT. There were no differences between women who initiated IPT antepartum or postpartum.

Conclusions

Decreased IFNγ responses in pregnancy reduced QGIT positivity, suggesting that this test cannot reliably rule out LTBI during pregnancy. TST was less affected by pregnancy, but had lower positivity compared to QGIT at all time points. IPT was associated with loss of QGIT positivity, the potential clinical consequences of which need to be investigated.

### Tuberculosis infection in women of reproductive age: a cross-sectional study at antenatal care clinics in an Ethiopian city [^116sRSNo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Apart from rising age, TB infection was also strongly associated with HIV infection. Interestingly, no association between TB infection and age was found among HIV-positive participants. Furthermore, the excess burden of TB infection in HIV-positive persons was due to a higher frequency of previous and current active TB, whereas the proportions with LTBI were similar with regard to HIV serostatus. This finding is in agreement with previous studies, showing no association between LTBI prevalence and HIV. In our cohort, 9.3% of women were HIV positive, which is higher than the Ethiopian estimate of 1.4% for women of fertile age. A majority of HIV-positive women had been diagnosed with HIV before the current pregnancy, and 110 (74%) were on ART since > 1 year.

Latent tuberculosis infection represents a reservoir for Mtb, and testing and treatment for LTBI is considered as a key component of TB control programs in low-endemic countries. Although treatment of LTBI might be considered during pregnancy, this has mainly been studied in the context of HIV coinfection, and the efficacy of such treatment in areas with ongoing TB transmission for prevention of active TB is uncertain due to the high risk of reinfection. In settings such as the one in which this study was conducted, case-finding of individuals with contagious TB in the community, with adequate linkage to care and completion of treatment, should probably be prioritized for reduction of TB exposure in the community. The Global Tuberculosis Report 2019 estimated that almost one-third of active TB cases in Ethiopia are not diagnosed, demonstrating the need for improvement of existing TB control programs.

### Psoriasis: which therapy for which patient: focus on special populations and chronic infections [^112YMQrj]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite the availability of several new systemic agents for psoriasis treatment, choosing the right therapy in certain patient populations can be challenging. There are few up-to-date reviews on systemic drugs for moderate to severe psoriasis in pregnant and pediatric patients and in patients with concomitant chronic infections, such as hepatitis, HIV, and latent tuberculosis. These groups are usually excluded from clinical trials, and much of the available evidence is based on anecdotal case reports and case series. As a chronic disease, psoriasis requires long-term treatment, and there are concerns of adverse maternal-fetal outcomes, long-term side effects in children, and the reactivation of latent infections with the use of systemic agents in these patients. The second article in this continuing medical education series provides insights for choosing appropriate systemic agents for treating moderate to severe psoriasis in pregnant and pediatric patients and in the setting of chronic infections, such as hepatitis, HIV, and latent tuberculosis.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116yrq72]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection — latent TB infection (LTBI) and progression risk: Following infection, the immune response usually limits bacillary multiplication within 2 to 12 weeks, but viable bacilli can persist for years as LTBI; people with LTBI are asymptomatic and not infectious, and TB disease can develop soon after exposure or after reactivation. For people with untreated HIV, the risk of TB disease due to reactivation of LTBI is estimated as 3% to 16% per year, approximating the lifetime risk for those with LTBI who do not have HIV (approximately 5%); the risk begins in the first year following HIV infection and TB disease can occur at any CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count with increasing risk as immunodeficiency progresses. The estimated annual risk of developing TB disease among people with LTBI is 3 to 12 times greater for people with untreated HIV than for those without HIV, and even with effective ART, the risk among people with HIV remains greater than that among the general population; since 2006, TB incidence in people with HIV has been lower than in previous years but still substantially higher than among people without HIV, and in the United States the most common predisposing factor for TB infection is birth or residence outside of the United States.

### A series of critically challenging case scenarios in moderate to severe psoriasis: a Delphi consensus approach [^117J4NrV]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical trials for systemic psoriasis therapy typically enroll healthy patients and exclude patients with cardiovascular disease, latent tuberculosis, liver disease, histories of malignancies, viral infections, children, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. Physicians often require guidance for optimum management of severe psoriasis in patients that have a combination of underlying disease states. To provide treatment recommendations for complex psoriasis scenarios, a consensus panel comprising 15 experts in psoriatic disease convened to review and discuss available evidence-based data and to arrive at a consensus for treatment options of difficult cases. An application of the Delphi Method was used to select case scenarios, provide medical treatment options, present the case study with existing medical evidence, and anonymously vote on treatment options. The top 10 treatment options were ranked and statistically analyzed to compare the differences between treatments. The final rankings and analysis provide guidance for practical, safe, and efficacious treatment options in a number of complex psoriasis scenarios.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^111xc8Hc]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary of Evidence and Recommendations

The recommended treatment regimens include three preferred and two alternative treatment regimens (Tables 3 and 4). Rifamycin-based regimens, including 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine, 4 months of daily rifampin, and 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin are the preferred recommended regimens because of their effectiveness, safety, and high treatment completion rates. Regimens of 6 or 9 months of daily isoniazid are alternative recommended regimens; although efficacious, they have higher toxicity risk and lower treatment completion rates, which decrease effectiveness. On the basis of the most recent comprehensive LTBI treatment guidelines in the United States, which were published in 2000, 9 months of daily isoniazid was considered the standard comparator regimen to evaluate shorter-course regimens. Data on the effectiveness and toxicity of 9 months of daily isoniazid are provided, as are data on the other recommended regimens. A rifamycin-based regimen refers to treatment that includes either rifampin or rifapentine.

Among HIV-positive persons living in areas with a high TB incidence, isoniazid is complementary to antiretroviral therapy in preventing TB disease. Two randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that isoniazid plus antiretroviral therapy decreased the incidence of TB disease to a greater extent than either isoniazid alone or antiretroviral therapy alone. Potential disadvantages of the regimen include its long duration, hepatoxicity, and low treatment completion rates (primarily due to the first two factors).

Discussion

A systematic literature review was performed of clinical trial data pertaining to effectiveness and toxicity of treatment of LTBI, including studies published since the 2018 World Health Organization LTBI guidelines. Evidence quality was evaluated using the GRADE approach, and a network meta-analysis was performed, updated to include data from studies published since a previous network meta-analysis, to compare regimens not evaluated head-to-head in clinical trials.

Recommendations were formulated on the basis of the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences of the intervention, the quality of evidence, patient values and preferences, and feasibility. These factors also informed the priority rank of the regimens as preferred or alternative, with preference for shorter regimens, given their similar efficacy compared with 6–9 months of isoniazid but favorable tolerability and higher treatment completion rates. This combination of characteristics should result in greater effectiveness of the shorter regimens in clinical settings. More effective treatment of LTBI will facilitate TB elimination. Prescribing providers or pharmacists who are unfamiliar with rifampin and rifapentine might confuse the two drugs. They are not interchangeable, and caution should be taken to ensure that patients receive the correct medication for the intended regimen.

Although 9 months of isoniazid was a preferred regimen in the guidelines published in 2000, both 6 and 9 months of isoniazid were recommended at that time. In these current guidelines, application of GRADE criteria resulted in a strong recommendation for 6 months of isoniazid as an alternative for those persons unable to take a shorter preferred regimen (e.g. due to drug intolerability or drug-drug interactions), particularly in HIV-negative persons. The longer duration of isoniazid could increase the risk for hepatotoxicity and although increased effectiveness is plausible, the two treatment durations have not been directly compared.

Two months of rifampin plus pyrazinamide are not recommended for treatment of LTBI because of the hepatotoxicity risk. However, in persons treated empirically for TB disease with isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for 2 months, this regimen will effectively treat LTBI in persons subsequently determined to have LTBI rather than TB disease.

Recommendations of others regarding LTBI screening state that the CDC, together with the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, recommends screening for LTBI to identify persons who may benefit from treatment before progression to active tuberculosis infection. Joint guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended screening for latent tuberculosis in early pregnancy for women at high risk for tuberculosis, with risk examples including recent tuberculosis exposure, HIV infection, immune-suppressing drugs, kidney failure with dialysis, homelessness, living or working in long-term care facilities, being medically underserved, and being born in a country with high tuberculosis prevalence; the American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on screening for LTBI.

### New approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [^115zEnyg]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

With nearly 9 million new active disease cases and 2 million deaths occurring worldwide every year, tuberculosis continues to remain a major public health problem. Exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis leads to active disease in only ~10% people. An effective immune response in remaining individuals stops M. tuberculosis multiplication. However, the pathogen is completely eradicated in ~10% people while others only succeed in containment of infection as some bacilli escape killing and remain in non-replicating (dormant) state (latent tuberculosis infection) in old lesions. The dormant bacilli can resuscitate and cause active disease if a disruption of immune response occurs. Nearly one-third of world population is latently infected with M. tuberculosis and 5%-10% of infected individuals will develop active disease during their life time. However, the risk of developing active disease is greatly increased (5%-15% every year and ~50% over lifetime) by human immunodeficiency virus-coinfection. While active transmission is a significant contributor of active disease cases in high tuberculosis burden countries, most active disease cases in low tuberculosis incidence countries arise from this pool of latently infected individuals. A positive tuberculin skin test or a more recent and specific interferon-gamma release assay in a person without overt signs of active disease indicates latent tuberculosis infection. Two commercial interferon-gamma release assays, QFT-G-IT and T-SPOT.TB have been developed. The standard treatment for latent tuberculosis infection is daily therapy with isoniazid for nine months. Other options include therapy with rifampicin for 4 months or isoniazid + rifampicin for 3 months or rifampicin + pyrazinamide for 2 months or isoniazid + rifapentine for 3 months. Identification of latently infected individuals and their treatment has lowered tuberculosis incidence in rich, advanced countries. Similar approaches also hold great promise for other countries with low-intermediate rates of tuberculosis incidence.

Treatment for LTBI — several antibiotics are available; isoniazid was the first medication shown to prevent progression to active tuberculosis, but concerns about hepatotoxicity and drug resistance resulting from low adherence with long courses have prompted recommendations of shorter courses and use in combination with other medications such as rifampin and rifapentine. With the exception of twice-weekly isoniazid monotherapy, CDC-recommended regimens can be self-administered, including a once-weekly combination therapy with isoniazid and rifapentine taken for 3 months.

### Anti-interleukin-1 agents for pericarditis: a primer for cardiologists [^115qeHsF]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic scheme and monitoring

Currently, two anti-IL-1 agents (anakinra and rilonacept) have been proven to be efficacious and safe in the setting of recurrent pericarditis with corticosteroid dependence and colchicine resistance. Both anakinra and rilonacept provide combined IL-1α and IL-1β antagonism, which seems important to achieve optimal control of the inflammatory mechanisms in pericarditis, as compared with selective IL-1β antagonism (canakinumab).

Anti-IL-1 treatments should be commenced in a hospital or clinic environment with a first dose provided under medical supervision and then continued on an outpatient basis with scheduled follow-up blood tests and visits. Before initiating treatment, it is recommended to measure a complete blood count, renal function, and transaminases. Females of childbearing potential should be screened for pregnancy and counselled appropriately with respect to issues related to pregnancy and lactation (see below). Screening for latent tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) should be performed. The most important issue is latent tuberculosis, and appropriate discussion with an infectious disease expert should be done in individual cases to assess the use of prophylactic antituberculous therapy for those with a positive TB Quantiferon test. IL-1 inhibitors generally do not appear to complicate these conditions and, when treatment is urgently indicated, it may be reasonable to initiate therapy while waiting screening results.

### Individual and composite adverse pregnancy outcomes in a randomized trial on isoniazid preventative therapy among women living with human immunodeficiency virus [^117Wsbgq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Globally, an estimated 10 million people developed tuberculosis (TB) disease in 2018, with 251 000 deaths among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Of those who developed TB, 5.7 million were men, 3.2 million women, and 1.1 million children. People living with HIV comprise 8.6% of the total, of which the vast majority are living in Africa. Active TB is particularly prevalent during pregnancy and the postpartum period. TB disease during pregnancy or the early postpartum period is associated with adverse maternal, pregnancy, and infant outcomes. Active TB in women living with HIV is an independent risk factor for nonobstetric maternal mortality. According to national maternal mortality data in South Africa, for example, nonpregnancy related infections are the leading cause of maternal deaths, accounting for 968 (35.2%) of all maternal deaths between 2014 to 2016. The vast majority of deaths occurred in women living with HIV, and TB was the most common final cause of death in 336 (34.7%) women.

A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of the treatment of latent TB infection, comparing 6 months of INH versus a placebo in adults and children, showed a reduction of active TB, with an odds ratio of 0.61 (95% confidence interval [CI].48–.77). However, this meta-analysis did not include any safety or efficacy data for isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) in pregnant women, including those taking combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), as pregnant women consistently have been excluded from IPT trials.

Small studies, however, involving women living with HIV, including those that became pregnant on IPT, as well as retrospective studies including pregnant women on IPT, did not identify any specific toxicity concerns or increased adverse pregnancy outcomes. Based on these data, the World Health Organization (WHO) strongly recommends IPT for latent TB infection in people living with HIV, including pregnant women. However, pregnant women living with HIV, especially if on ART, may have a higher risk of adverse events. Understanding the relative risks and benefits of therapies used in pregnancy is critical.

Tuberculosis (TB) in pregnancy — diagnosis and maternal–fetal considerations include that the diagnostic evaluation for TB disease in pregnant women is the same as for non-pregnant adults, and chest radiographs with abdominal shielding are recommended and result in minimal fetal radiation exposure. While treatment with isoniazid should be delayed until after delivery, if the risk of progression to active TB disease is considered to outweigh the risk of adverse birth outcomes with isoniazid and isoniazid is prescribed, frequent monitoring is needed, and pregnant women receiving isoniazid should receive daily pyridoxine supplementation as they are at risk of isoniazid-associated peripheral neuropathy. In one study of 107 women with active TB disease during pregnancy in South Africa, M. tuberculosis was detected in 16% of neonates (n = 16) tested within the first 3 weeks of life (12 by culture and 4 by smear microscopy).

HIV-related antepartum screenings and assessments during pregnancy include assessment of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, adherence challenges, and facilitators; assessment of the need for prophylaxis against opportunistic infections, e.g. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia; screening for HAV, HBV, and HCV and assessment of vaccination or treatment needs; assessment and provision of other vaccination needs, e.g., influenza, pneumococcus, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine (Tdap), SARS-CoV-2 (including boosters); tuberculosis screening; and sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening, e.g., syphilis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Neisseria gonorrhea, along with screening for depression and anxiety, screening for intimate partner violence (IPV), and assessment of the need for supportive care, with provision or referral for needed services based on screening results. Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is recommended during pregnancy when CD4 count is < 200 cells/mL; tuberculosis screening includes screening for active and latent tuberculosis, with stepwise screening for active tuberculosis that may begin with exposure history and symptom screening and, if screening for latent tuberculosis was performed and negative in the last year, repeat testing is not necessary for those at low risk for repeated or ongoing exposure to people with active tuberculosis; and repeat STI screening, particularly for syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea, is often repeated in the third trimester.

HIV-associated latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in pregnancy — For those receiving effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) and without recent TST or IGRA conversion or close household contacts with infectious TB, therapy for LTBI may be deferred until after delivery (BIII). The risk of isoniazid-associated hepatotoxicity may be increased in pregnancy and in the first 2 to 3 months post-partum; therefore, if isoniazid is prescribed, frequent monitoring is needed, and pregnant women receiving isoniazid should receive daily pyridoxine supplementation (AII). Limited data exist on alternatives to isoniazid for LTBI therapy in pregnant women with HIV; in the IMPAACT 2001 study, pregnant women with and without HIV received 3HP and no serious adverse pregnancy outcomes were observed, and drug exposures were similar to non-pregnant populations, suggesting this regimen does not require dose adjustment in pregnancy. Despite these promising data and although rifampin generally is considered safe in pregnancy, data on the use of rifapentine remain extremely limited and the use of rifapentine during pregnancy is not currently recommended (BIII). The DOLPHIN Moms trial (NCT05122026) is examining the pharmacokinetics and safety of 3HP and 1HP in pregnant women with HIV who are virally suppressed on a dolutegravir-based regimen.

Alternative Regimens: Six or Nine Months of Daily Isoniazid

Regimens of 6 or 9 months of daily isoniazid are alternative recommended regimens; 6 months daily is strongly recommended for HIV-negative adults and children of all ages and conditionally for HIV-positive adults and children of all ages and 9 months daily is conditionally recommended for adults and children of all ages, both HIV-negative and HIV-positive. Isoniazid reduces the risk for developing TB disease in persons with a positive TST, including HIV-negative adults and children, HIV-positive adults, and presumably also HIV-positive children. The drug can cause hepatotoxicity and be associated with discontinuation because of adverse effects, although these effects are more common in adults than children.

In HIV-positive persons who have a negative TST, anergy, or an unknown TST, the benefit of isoniazid is uncertain in settings with low TB incidence. For these HIV-positive persons, the potential exists for a reduction in the incidence of TB disease and an increase in adverse effects with isoniazid therapy; however, the likelihood of these effects remains uncertain because of wide confidence intervals resulting from too few events.

The evidence synthesis included multiple durations of isoniazid therapy in persons with a positive TST (3, 6, and 12 months in HIV-negative persons and 6 months in HIV-positive persons). Among HIV-negative persons with inactive TB (defined as the presence of tuberculin positivity, stable fibrotic lung lesions, and negative sputum cultures in persons not previously treated), 6 and 12 months of therapy were more effective than 3 months of therapy, demonstrating the benefit of LTBI treatment with isoniazid in this high-risk subset of patients with LTBI. Studies of other regimens have persons with LTBI and fibrotic lesions but in much smaller numbers. According to the results of the systematic review process, among HIV-positive persons, 6 months of therapy was highly effective, and the effect of other durations was unknown. Also reviewed was an analysis that included different, fewer trials than included in this report and found that 9 months of daily isoniazid therapy was perhaps more effective than 6 months and similar to 12 months (,–). However, no clinical trial data were available directly comparing 9 months of isoniazid to placebo, 6 months of isoniazid, or 12 months of isoniazid.

### Tuberculosis clinical care and treatment during pregnancy… [^116DXhRu]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Testing for and treating latent tuberculosis infection or TB disease during pregnancy requires special considerations.
- Pregnant women diagnosed with TB disease should start treatment right away. Treatment options Latent TB infection Most pregnant women can delay treatment for latent TB infection until two-three months post-partum. It may be reasonable to delay treatment until after delivery to avoid the risk of liver toxicity as an adverse effect of treatment for latent TB infection, which is higher during pregnancy. However, pregnant women who are at higher risk for developing TB disease should not delay treatment, even during the first trimester. This includes pregnant women:

- Who have weakened immune systems, such as a person with HIV and a low CD4 count
- Who recently spent time with someone with infectious TB disease.

Treatment regimens for latent TB infection There are several treatment regimens recommended to treat latent TB infection during pregnancy. Health care providers can consult TB experts for additional information.
- Four-month daily regimen of rifampin
- Three-month daily regimen of isoniazid and rifampin
- Six- or nine-month daily regimen of isoniazid, with pyridoxine supplementation. Pregnant women taking isoniazid should take 25–50 mg/day of pyridoxine to reduce possible adverse effects of isoniazid. Women taking isoniazid in the post-partum period should have blood tests checked for liver function before starting treatment. Pregnant women or women expecting to become pregnant during treatment should not take the three-month weekly isoniazid and rifapentine regimen. Its safety during pregnancy has not been studied.

Treatment guidelines for latent TB infection. If pyrazinamide is excluded from the treatment regimen, a minimum of nine months of isonaizid, rifampin, and ethambutol is used for most pregnant women with drug-susceptible TB disease. It includes:

- Isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol daily for two months, followed by
- Isoniazid and rifampin daily, or twice weekly for seven months. Health care providers can contact their state or local TB program or the TB Centers of Excellence for expert consultation. Treatment guidelines for TB disease.

### Adverse pregnancy outcomes among women with human immunodeficiency virus taking isoniazid preventive therapy during the first trimester [^112VrEfV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is recommended for tuberculosis prevention yet data on the safety of first-trimester pregnancy exposure are limited.

Methods

Planned secondary analysis in a TB prevention trial of adverse pregnancy outcomes among participants assigned to 9-month IPT who became pregnant during (IPT-exposed) or after (unexposed) IPT. Regression models compared binary outcomes of a composite adverse outcome (any non-live birth, excluding induced abortion); preterm delivery < 37 weeks; and low birth weight < 2500g) among exposure groups. Models were adjusted for latent TB infection, maternal age, CD4 count, and antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Results

In total, 128 participants had a known pregnancy outcome; 39 IPT-exposed and 89 unexposed. At pregnancy outcome, ART use was lower in IPT-exposed (79%) than unexposed women (98%). Overall, 29 pregnancies ended in a composite adverse outcome (25 spontaneous abortions, 2 stillbirths and 2 ectopic pregnancies), 15 preterm deliveries, and 10 infants with low birth weight. IPT was associated with the composite adverse outcome adjusting for covariates at enrollment (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.98; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15, 3.41), but the effect was attenuated when adjusted for covariates at pregnancy outcome (aRR 1.47; 95% CI .84, 2.55); IPT was not associated with preterm delivery (relative risk [RR] 0.87; 95% CI .32–2.42) or low birth weight (RR 1.01; 95% CI .29, 3.56).

Conclusions

First-trimester IPT exposure was associated with nearly two-fold increased risk of fetal demise, mostly spontaneous abortion, though the association was attenuated when adjusted for covariates proximal to pregnancy outcome including ART use. Further study is needed to inform TB prevention guidelines.
