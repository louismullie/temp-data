## Question

Cause of elevated platelets in adolescent

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of elevated platelets (thrombocytosis) in adolescents. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define thrombocytosis and what thresholds matter clinically. Then, I should categorize etiologies into primary clonal, secondary reactive, and spurious causes. Next, I will prioritize the most common causes in adolescents and outline a practical diagnostic approach. After that, I need to consider special scenarios like extreme thrombocytosis, iron deficiency, and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, prioritized list of causes and note management implications where relevant, making sure I verify each claim against the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and clinical significance. Thrombocytosis is generally defined as a platelet count greater than 450 × 10⁹/L, with extreme thrombocytosis typically defined as greater than 1000 × 10⁹/L; in pediatrics, extreme thrombocytosis is uncommon but most often reactive rather than clonal, and thrombotic complications are rare in the absence of additional risk factors, so I should keep that in mind as I interpret counts in adolescents [^111kB47k] [^112MuYup] [^117W5qbk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to categorize the causes before listing them. The standard framework separates primary clonal myeloproliferative disorders, secondary reactive processes, and spurious or artifactual elevations, and this classification guides both the differential and the workup in adolescents as it does in adults, so I will anchor on this structure [^115dVSvN] [^114uHrPC].

> Next, I should review the most common causes in adolescents. Reactive thrombocytosis dominates in pediatrics, with infections, inflammatory conditions, and iron deficiency accounting for the majority of cases; extreme thrombocytosis in hospitalized children is overwhelmingly secondary, with 98–99.8% due to reactive causes, which reinforces that I should exhaust secondary etiologies before labeling a case as primary [^112MuYup] [^117W5qbk] [^1128Rs92].

> I will now examine iron deficiency as a key driver. Iron deficiency is a classic cause of reactive thrombocytosis and can occasionally produce extreme platelet counts; importantly, iron repletion typically normalizes the platelet count, so I should double-check iron studies early in the evaluation and remember that iron deficiency itself can increase thrombotic risk, which may influence decisions about antiplatelet therapy in select contexts [^116Dsjse] [^11318giR] [^117Npo84].

> But wait, what if the platelet count is extremely high and I am worried about a clonal process? Primary thrombocytosis from myeloproliferative neoplasms, including essential thrombocythemia, is rare in adolescents but does occur; AYA patients can comprise up to about 20% of MPN diagnoses, and driver mutations such as JAK2, CALR, and MPL are less frequent in pediatrics, so a negative molecular panel does not exclude disease and bone marrow examination may be necessary when suspicion remains high [^1179YT4f] [^112s6yZ8] [^112k81Zq].

> Let me consider the diagnostic approach so I do not miss anything. First, confirm persistence with a repeat CBC and smear to exclude spurious causes and platelet clumping; then screen comprehensively for reactive causes including infection, inflammation, iron deficiency, hemolysis, and medications; if thrombocytosis persists without a secondary cause, proceed to molecular testing for JAK2, CALR, MPL, and BCR-ABL, and consider bone marrow biopsy to distinguish ET from other myeloid neoplasms and to assess megakaryocytic morphology and fibrosis, aligning with pediatric and adult guidance [^114uHrPC] [^117FrQx7] [^112k81Zq].

> I should double-check special scenarios that change pretest probabilities. Extreme thrombocytosis in children and adolescents is most often reactive and, in the absence of additional risk factors, does not mandate antiplatelet therapy; conversely, in adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding and thrombocytosis, I need to ensure I evaluate for iron deficiency and consider gynecologic contributors, while remembering that thrombocytosis itself is not a typical cause of menorrhagia and that platelet function disorders or thrombocytopenia are more common bleeding etiologies in this group [^112MuYup] [^117W5qbk] [^115Sg1ik].

> Let me synthesize the causes in order of likelihood in adolescents. Most common are reactive causes including iron deficiency, acute and chronic infections, inflammatory conditions, and post-surgical or post-traumatic states; less common but important are primary clonal myeloproliferative neoplasms such as essential thrombocythemia, which require molecular and marrow evaluation when secondary causes are excluded; rare entities include hereditary thrombocytosis and spurious counts from platelet clumping or instrument artifacts, so I should verify morphology on smear before concluding [^1128Rs92] [^112k81Zq] [^114uHrPC].

> I need to ensure I note management implications tied to etiology. For reactive thrombocytosis, treat the underlying cause and observe; for iron deficiency, replete iron and recheck the platelet count; for extreme reactive thrombocytosis, routine antiplatelet therapy is not indicated unless there are additional thrombotic risk factors; for confirmed ET in adolescents, risk stratification and cytoreduction decisions should be individualized, with interferon often favored in younger patients when treatment is indicated, and aspirin considered for vasomotor symptoms or vascular risk, balancing long-term risks and benefits in this age group [^112MuYup] [^111vJqzt] [^115TTp89].

---

Elevated platelets in adolescents are most often due to **reactive thrombocytosis** from infection, inflammation, iron deficiency, or recent surgery [^1128Rs92] [^112MuYup]. Less commonly, **primary thrombocytosis** results from myeloproliferative neoplasms (ET, PV, CML) or hereditary thrombocytosis [^112k81Zq] [^1121uisV]. Evaluation should start with a **repeat CBC and smear**, iron studies, CRP/ESR, and infection screening; if persistent or unexplained, test for JAK2/CALR/MPL and BCR-ABL, and consider bone marrow biopsy [^114uHrPC] [^117FrQx7]. Management targets the underlying cause; cytoreduction is reserved for symptomatic or very high counts in primary thrombocytosis [^115TTp89].

---

## Classification of thrombocytosis

Thrombocytosis is classified as **primary (clonal)** — due to intrinsic bone marrow disorders — or **secondary (reactive)** — due to external triggers such as infection, inflammation, or iron deficiency [^115dVSvN] [^1128Rs92]. Spurious thrombocytosis from platelet clumping is rare but should be excluded with a peripheral smear [^notfound].

---

## Common causes of elevated platelets in adolescents

### Reactive (secondary) thrombocytosis

Reactive thrombocytosis accounts for **> 80% of cases** in adolescents and is typically transient, resolving with treatment of the underlying cause [^notfound].

- **Infection**: Acute bacterial, viral, or fungal infections are the most common cause, with thrombocytosis reflecting cytokine-driven megakaryopoiesis [^notfound].
- **Inflammation**: Chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g. IBD, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE) can cause persistent thrombocytosis via IL-6/TPO signaling [^notfound].
- **Iron deficiency anemia**: Strongly associated with thrombocytosis; platelets normalize after iron repletion [^116Dsjse] [^117Npo84].
- **Recent surgery or trauma**: Tissue injury and inflammation drive reactive thrombocytosis [^114jAcbW].
- **Medications**: Glucocorticoids, epinephrine, and some antibiotics can transiently elevate platelets [^114jAcbW].

---

### Primary (clonal) thrombocytosis

Primary thrombocytosis is rare in adolescents but carries higher thrombotic risk; **careful evaluation is essential** [^1169mFr8].

- **Essential thrombocythemia (ET)**: A clonal MPN driven by JAK2/CALR/MPL mutations; rare in adolescents but reported [^112k81Zq] [^112tpsMq].
- **Polycythemia vera (PV)**: Often presents with thrombocytosis alongside erythrocytosis; JAK2 V617F is common [^112k81Zq].
- **Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)**: Thrombocytosis can occur with BCR-ABL1 fusion; typically presents with leukocytosis [^111kB47k].
- **Hereditary thrombocytosis**: Germline mutations in THPO, MPL, or JAK2 cause familial thrombocytosis; evaluate family history [^1121uisV].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A structured approach is critical to distinguish reactive from primary thrombocytosis:

| **Step** | **Evaluation** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Repeat CBC with peripheral smear | Confirm thrombocytosis; exclude spurious causes |
| 2 | History and exam | Identify infection, inflammation, iron deficiency, medications, family history |
| 3 | Iron studies (ferritin, transferrin, iron) | Detect iron deficiency anemia |
| 4 | Inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR) | Assess for inflammation |
| 5 | Infection screening (urine, throat, chest X-ray) | Identify occult infection |
| 6 | Molecular testing (JAK2, CALR, MPL, BCR-ABL) | If persistent/unexplained, evaluate for MPNs |
| 7 | Bone marrow biopsy | If MPN suspected or diagnosis unclear |

---

## Clinical significance and complications

Reactive thrombocytosis is usually benign and resolves with treatment of the underlying cause; **thrombotic events are rare** unless additional risk factors are present [^112MuYup] [^117W5qbk]. Primary thrombocytosis carries a **higher risk of thrombosis** (arterial and venous) and, less commonly, bleeding, especially at very high platelet counts (> 1,500 × 10⁹/L) [^112k81Zq] [^111BqbRx].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Reactive thrombocytosis**: Treat the underlying infection, inflammation, or iron deficiency; platelets normalize with correction of the cause [^1128Rs92].
- **Primary thrombocytosis**: Risk-stratify; low-risk patients may receive aspirin, while high-risk patients (prior thrombosis, very high counts) may require cytoreduction (hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha, anagrelide) [^notfound].
- **Extreme thrombocytosis (> 1,000 × 10⁹/L)**: Consider low-dose aspirin if no contraindications; cytoreduction if symptomatic or high risk [^114qxXds].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent for reactive thrombocytosis**, with resolution after treatment of the cause. Primary thrombocytosis has a favorable prognosis in adolescents, but lifelong monitoring is required due to chronicity and thrombotic risk [^112k81Zq] [^111BqbRx].

---

Elevated platelets in adolescents are most often reactive from infection, inflammation, or iron deficiency; **primary clonal causes are rare** but require targeted testing when thrombocytosis persists or is unexplained. A structured, cause-directed approach ensures accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.

The purpose of this article is to provide the reader with a firm knowledge of the major causes of thrombocytopenia and their treatments, and to form a broad differential diagnosis, so that it will be clearer when to consider a rare etiology. The various etiologies are presented by known disease entities, grouped by age, and described as they would occur and be considered in a realistic clinical setting. A brief categorization of causes of thrombocytopenia by mechanism, notably abnormal platelet production, platelet destruction, or sequestration, is included. With each disease process, the pathophysiology as it is currently known is described and discussed.

### Primary thrombocytosis in children [^1131ih5H]. Haematologica (2014). Low credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms are uncommon disorders in children, for which we have limited understanding of the pathogenesis and optimal management. JAK2 and MPL mutations, while common drivers of myeloproliferative neoplasms in adult patients, are not clearly linked to pediatric disease. Management and clinical outcomes in adults have been well delineated with defined recommendations for risk stratification and treatment. This is not the case for pediatric patients, for whom there is neither a standard approach to workup nor any consensus regarding management. This review will discuss thrombocytosis in children, including causes of thrombocytosis in children, the limited knowledge we have regarding pediatric primary thrombocytosis, and our thoughts on potential risk stratification and management, and future questions to be answered by laboratory research and collaborative clinical study.

Thrombocytosis is a common clinical problem frequently encountered during routine evaluation. The diagnostic workup entails a step-by-step approach, which allows for an accurate assessment of the underlying cause. A thorough clinical history and physical examination may help differentiate thrombocytosis secondary to a reactive process versus an underlying clonal proliferation process. Once essential thrombocytosis is evident, relevant laboratory evaluation for an ongoing myeloproliferative disorder is paramount. Various treatment modalities have been proven to be beneficial. With further scientific investigation underway, molecular therapies may soon be cornerstones of therapy in essential thrombocytosis.

### Immune or inherited thrombocytopenia? A population-based cohort study on children and adolescents presenting with a low platelet count [^115dR2qT]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic finding in children and adolescents. Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is the most common cause of this finding, but the differential diagnosis includes a growing list of genetic disorders. We aimed to report differences in phenotypes of patients with ITP, inherited platelet disorder (IPD)/primary immunodeficiency disorder (PID), and other causes, with a focus on differentiating ITP from inherited thrombocytopenia.

Procedure

This retrospective, population-based observational cohort from 2006 to 2020 involved 506 Finnish children under 16 years of age presenting with isolated thrombocytopenia.

Results

Of the 506 participants, 79.7% had ITP, 6.7% had IPD/PID, and 13.6% had other causes of thrombocytopenia. A platelet count of ≤ 12 × 10⁹/L best distinguished between ITP and other reasons with a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 80%. Among patients with the lowest platelet count of less than 10 × 10⁹/L, 95.9% had ITP, 3.3% had IPD/PID, and 0.8% had other causes. Severe bleeding events were reported in 20 patients (4.0%), but there were no cases of intracranial or fatal bleeding due to thrombocytopenia. Up to 50% of patients with a high suspicion of inherited thrombocytopenia remained without a specific diagnosis despite genetic testing.

Conclusions

ITP remains the most common cause of thrombocytopenia. A platelet count of ≤ 12 × 10⁹/L often leads to an ITP diagnosis. Genetic disorders are rare but should be suspected in patients with persisting thrombocytopenia, especially with platelet counts constantly above 12 × 10⁹/L, a positive family history, or atypical clinical features.

Inherited platelet function disorders are of variable severity and unknown frequency and may be difficult to diagnose. Nevertheless, they are increasingly recognized as an important cause of bleeding in pediatrics, particularly in adolescent girls with menorrhagia, where they may be more common than von Willebrand disease. This article reviews the presentation of these disorders, summarizes the most common types of platelet function disorders, discusses the challenges in diagnostic testing, and details treatment and supportive care options.

### Paediatric essential thrombocythaemia: clinical and molecular features, diagnosis and treatment [^1169mFr8]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

The incidence of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) in children (age ≤ 18 years) is extremely low. The natural course of the disorder in children has not been clarified. The rarity of patients and the variability of tested parameters make it difficult to draw any definitive conclusion in pathogenesis and diagnosis of paediatric ET. What makes the onset of thrombocytosis earlier in children is still uncertain. A diagnostic algorithm for paediatric ET has not been established, and current risk stratification used to guide therapeutic decisions in adults has not been validated in children. Vascular complications and transformation to myelofibrosis and leukaemia in this special entity have been reported, suggesting that ET in children is not an entirely benign disease. The crucial question is how to identify patients who are at high risk of complications and need treatment. There are insufficient data to recommend a specific agent in children. The purpose of this review is to outline the most recent progress in paediatric ET and to help with understanding the clinical course, molecular features, diagnosis and treatment strategies in this special group.

### Management of MPN beyond JAK2 [^111qoYsh]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis has a large number of potential underlying causes, but the dominant group of hematological conditions for consideration in this setting are the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). In this chapter, we consider several key linked questions relating to the management of thrombocytosis in MPNs and discuss several issues. First, we discuss the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis, which myeloid disorders to consider, and practical approaches to the discrimination of each individual MPN from other causes. Second, there have been several major advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of these conditions and we discuss how these findings are likely to be practically applied in the future. Third, we consider whether there is evidence that thrombocytosis contributes to the complications known to be associated with MPN: thrombosis, hemorrhage and transformation to leukemia and myelofibrosis. Last, we review current ideas for risk stratification and management of essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera as the 2 entities within the MPN family that are most frequently associated with thrombocytosis.

### Primary and secondary thrombocytosis in childhood [^1128Rs92]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

This review summarizes current data on the pathomechanisms and clinical aspects of primary and secondary thrombocytosis in childhood. Primary thrombocytosis is extremely rare in childhood, mostly diagnosed at the beginning of the second decade of life. As in adults, the criteria of the Polycythemia Vera Group are appropriate to diagnose primary thrombocytosis. The pathomechansims of non-familial forms are complex and include spontaneous formation of megakaryopoietic progenitors and increased sensitivity to thrombopoietin (Tpo). Familial forms can be caused by mutations in Tpo or Tpo receptor (c-mpl) genes. These mutations result in overexpression of Tpo, sustained intracellular signalling or disturbed regulation of circulating Tpo. Treatment of primary thrombocytosis is not recommended if platelet counts are < 1500/nl and bleeding or thrombosis did not occur in patient's history. In severe cases, decision on treatment should weigh potential risks of treatment options (hydroxyurea, anagrelide) against expected benefits for preventing thrombosis or haemorrhage. Secondary thrombocytosis is frequent in children, in particular in the first decade of life. Hepatic Tpo production is stimulated in acute response reaction to a variety of disorders. Thrombosis prophylaxis is not required, even at platelet counts > 1000/nl, except for cases with additional prothrombotic risk factors.

### Pediatric ITP: is it different from adult ITP? [^11553zo4]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has historically been thought to occur in 2 distinct forms: childhood ITP and adult ITP. This division is based largely on the presumption that childhood ITP is often benign and self-limited, whereas ITP in adults tends to be more chronic and difficult to treat. Although data exist to justify a different approach to the diagnosis and treatment in young children and the elderly, ITP in older children, adolescents, and younger adults is likely to share more similar pathology. This article will highlight the most recent data describing the natural history, diagnostic approach, management strategies, and disease-related outcomes in children and adults with ITP. These data reveal many unexpected similarities between the 2 groups, while confirming some of the more well-described differences. Discussion of these findings aims to highlight similarities and differences between ITP in children and adults, which will underscore important areas of future research and/or changes in management guidelines.

### Diagnostic approach to the patient with a suspected inherited platelet disorder: who and how to test [^111fhkxR]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Bleeding and thrombocytopenia are common referrals to the pediatric and adult hematology practice. The differential diagnosis encompasses a wide spectrum of entities that vary in acuity, severity, and etiology. Most will be acquired (especially in adult patients), but many can be inherited, and some may have manifestations affecting other organ systems. The first step: defining whether the symptoms and/or laboratory findings are clinically significant and warrant additional work-up, can be equally as challenging as reaching the diagnosis itself. How much bleeding is too much to be considered normal? How low of a platelet count is too low? Once the decision has been made to pursue additional studies, considering the increasing number of laboratory tests available, the diagnostic process can be complex. In this article, we outline a general approach for the evaluation of patients in whom an inherited platelet disorder is being considered. We present two clinical vignettes as introduction to the diagnostic approach to inherited platelet disorders. We describe the rationale for the different types of tests that are clinically available, their limitations, and finally the challenges that are frequently encountered in the interpretation of results. We also intend to provide some guidance on the expected phenotype in terms of severity of bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia according to the etiology of the inherited disorder. Our goal is to provide the practicing hematologist with a practical framework that is clinically applicable in their daily practice.

### Why does my patient have thrombocytopenia? [^113971re]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia, usually defined as a platelet count of less than 150,000/μL, is a common reason for a hematology consult in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. In most patients, the cause of the thrombocytopenia can be identified and treated. This article reviews the clinical approach to the patient with thrombocytopenia, the mechanisms that underlie it, and the laboratory tests available to investigate it. A practical approach to the investigation and management of thrombocytopenia in the clinical settings commonly encountered by the hematology consultant is then described.

### Platelet disorders in adolescents [^112CPd9J]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Acquired and inherited platelet disorders can present with bleeding symptoms during adolescence. Platelet disorders include disorders of platelet number and disorders of platelet function. In adolescent females with platelet disorders, menorrhagia is a common presenting bleeding symptom. Other associated bleeding symptoms are also primarily mucocutaneous, including epistaxis and bruising. Excessive bleeding may also occur after hemostatic challenges. Diagnosis of disorders of platelet function usually requires light transmission platelet aggregometry. Management of menorrhagia in the adolescent with platelet disorders requires both hematologic and gynecologic treatment.

### Pediatric extreme thrombocytosis: etiology, management, and outcomes [^112MuYup]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Extreme thrombocytosis (EXT) is defined as a platelet count > 1000×10⁹/L. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the etiology, management, and outcome of pediatric patients with EXT, focusing on thrombotic complications.

Study Design

We conducted a retrospective study at a large tertiary center, examining cases of pediatric EXT identified from electronic medical records over a 5-year period. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory data were reviewed. Additionally, the underlying etiology was documented for each case, and follow-up information was analyzed, including platelet count trends and thrombotic events within three months post-EXT.

Results

Among 204 patients with EXT, 98% were secondary thrombocytosis, predominantly attributed to infections and inflammatory conditions. EXT prevailed among infants (median age 1.3 years), with 67% aged 3 years or younger. Thrombotic events occurred in 10 cases (4.9%), primarily related to central venous lines or other risk factors rather than elevated platelet counts alone. Aspirin prophylaxis was uncommon, administered in 14% of patients, mainly in those with existing comorbidities.

Conclusions

Secondary EXT in pediatric patients is commonly associated with infections and persists for up to 2 months in many cases. While EXT alone may not significantly increase thrombotic risk, it may contribute to risk in patients with additional predisposing factors, such as central venous line. Further prospective studies are warranted to clarify thrombotic risk in children with EXT and evaluate the potential benefit of antithrombotic prophylaxis.

### Adolescents and young adults with newly diagnosed primary immune thrombocytopenia [^116Sw9Qe]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by increased platelet destruction and impaired production. Most textbooks and practice guidelines describe pediatric ITP as acute and profound but self-limiting, with a low risk of life-threatening bleeding in the majority of patients. In contrast, adult ITP is a chronic disease with an insidious onset of bleeding that is sometimes diagnosed incidentally. Adult ITP carries a high risk of severe bleeding in patients with a platelet count of < 20–30×10⁹/L, with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients aged > 60 years. Platelet-enhancing therapy is usually advised for adults with severe thrombocytopenia, especially the elderly or those with comorbidities. In contrast, a watch-and-wait strategy is recommended for children with non-severe bleeding. Recently, comparative studies in children and adults demonstrated unexpected similarities in the clinical and laboratory findings of both groups, particularly at disease onset, although differences in long-term prognosis and some aspects of patient management have been confirmed.

Adolescents and young adults (AYAS) are recognized as a specific age group with symptoms, disease course, treatment goals, side effects, needs, and expectations that differ from children and adults. AYAS are of particular interest in oncology and transition medicine. Characteristic features of AYAS include a high disease burden and poor compliance. The disease and treatment may negatively affect their personal development. Some treatment difficulties in this age group can be partly attributed to their physiological development. Adolescents have rapid hormonal, behavioral, and social changes, all of which can potentially modify the disease or symptoms. There is no international consensus on the definition of AYAS. In the literature, age differs from 12–16 years at the lower and 25–40 years at the upper limit.

AYAS are poorly studied in ITP-related literature, and clinical studies in this specific age group are lacking. Recommendations for AYAS with ITP are usually not covered by practice guidelines; therefore, the institutions providing care guide treatment options, are often designed exclusively for children or adults. However, in most ITP studies, the median age of patient cohorts is > 40–50 years for adults, and < 10 years for children. Thus, treatment goals and guidelines for AYAS are biased.

### Management of newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: can we change outcomes? [^116cAR6d]. Blood Advances (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia resulting from antibody-mediated platelet destruction combined with impaired platelet production is a common cause of thrombocytopenia. The decision to treat newly diagnosed patients is based on several factors including ceasing hemorrhagic manifestations, increasing the platelet count, prevention of bleeding, and inducing remission. Current standard first-line therapy is a course of corticosteroids. Although this treatment paradigm increases the platelet count in the majority of patients, a high percentage relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. For this reason, intensification of first-line therapy that results in superior long-term remission rates would be desirable. This manuscript focuses primarily on adults with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), highlighting pediatric data and practice when applicable. The primary aim is to outline upfront strategies for treatment-naive patients with ITP to enhance remission rates, taking into account assessment of the risks and benefits of these approaches.

### What to do when you suspect an inherited platelet disorder [^116N4hpM]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2011). Low credibility.

Inherited platelet disorders (IPDs) comprise a heterogenous group of diseases that include defects in platelet function and disordered megakaryopoiesis. Some IPDs overlap as both defects in function and thrombopoiesis, resulting in both altered aggregation and/or secretion and thrombocytopenia. This review examines the key features of the presentation of IPDs in children and adults and presents a diagnostic algorithm for the evaluation of these patients. In addition, recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of platelet disorders are addressed, with attention given to some of the novel genetic associations. Finally, treatment options and future therapies are briefly discussed.

### Impact of treatment for adolescent and young adults with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera [^113tiLJ1]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) belong to the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) category of the WHO classification. These disorders involve myeloid proliferation, presenting as thrombocytosis in ET, increased red cell mass in PV and varyingly mild leukocytosis, splenomegaly or general symptoms, and an elevated risk of arterial and venous thrombotic events. Additionally, there is a potential, albeit less common, progression to secondary myelofibrosis (sMF), acute leukemia (AL), and a reduction in life expectancy.

While ET and PV typically manifest in the sixth decade, approximately 20% of cases are diagnosed in individuals under 40, with limited available data on adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients. Current recommendations and risk classifications for ET and PV, such as ELN and IPSET-T, are primarily based on data from older patients. The primary objective in managing these conditions is thrombotic risk reduction, achieved through pharmacological cytoreduction. Hydroxycarbamide (HU), interferon (IFN), and anagrelide (ANA) are commonly employed as first-line treatments, with IFN uniquely demonstrating long-term disease modification potential, including allele burden reduction and the possibility of treatment discontinuation.

Our study aimed to explore long-term complications, evaluating the impact of treatment on thrombotic risk and sMF progression. This becomes particularly pertinent given the extended life expectancy of these patients spanning several decades.

### How to approach thrombocytopenia [^113h8nQU]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic finding with variable clinical expression. A low platelet count may be the initial manifestation of infections such as HIV and hepatitis C virus or it may reflect the activity of life-threatening disorders such as the thrombotic microangiopathies. A correct identification of the causes of thrombocytopenia is crucial for the appropriate management of these patients. In this review, we present a systematic evaluation of adults with thrombocytopenia. The approach is clearly different between outpatients, who are frequently asymptomatic and in whom we can sometimes indulge in sophisticated and relatively lengthy investigations, and the dramatic presentation of acute thrombocytopenia in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit, which requires immediate intervention and for which only a few diagnostic tests are available. A brief discussion of the most common etiologies seen in both settings is provided.

### Extreme thrombocytosis is associated with critical illness and young age, but not increased thrombotic risk, in hospitalized pediatric patients [^117W5qbk]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Extreme thrombocytosis (EXT, platelet count > 1000 × 10³/μL) is an uncommon but potentially clinically significant finding. Primary EXT in the setting of myeloproliferative disorders is linked to thrombotic and/or bleeding complications more frequently than secondary EXT, which typically occurs in reaction to infection, inflammation, or iron deficiency. However, comorbidities have been reported in adults with secondary EXT. Clinical implications of EXT in children are not well defined, as prior studies targeted small and/or specialized pediatric populations.

Objectives

Our objectives were to determine etiologies and sequelae of EXT in a hospitalized general pediatric patient population.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively analyzed EXT cases from a single-center pediatric cohort of ~80 000 patients over 8 years.

Results

Virtually all cases (99.8%) were secondary in nature, and most were multifactorial. Many cases of EXT occurred in children under 2 years old (47%) and/or during critical illness (55%). No thrombotic or bleeding events directly resulted from EXT, confirming a paucity of clinical complications associated with EXT in pediatric patients. There were indications that neonatal hematopoiesis and individual genetic variation influenced some cases, in addition to certain diagnoses (eg, sickle cell anemia) and clinical contexts (eg, asplenia).

Conclusion

Our findings confirm that thrombotic events related to EXT are rare in pediatric patients, which can inform the use of empiric anti-platelet therapy.

### Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in childhood: controversies and solutions [^117Kp6az]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a bleeding disorder in patients who are otherwise healthy and present with thrombocytopenia with normal red cells and leukocytes. ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion and is in origin heterogeneous. The unknown etiology and the lack of clinical data from controlled prospective studies are reasons for controversies in diagnosis and management. Study endpoints traditionally include the velocity of platelet increase after drug intervention or observation, although a rapid elevation of the platelet count is of questionable clinical value. Evaluation of other endpoints is needed.

### Screening and management of bleeding disorders in adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding: ACOG COMMITTEE OPINION, number 785 [^115Sg1ik]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 785 — common bleeding disorders and presenting features in adolescents — states that the most common bleeding disorders in adolescent girls who present with heavy menstrual bleeding are von Willebrand disease, platelet function defects, Thrombocytopenia, and clotting factor deficiencies. Thrombocytopenia can be congenital or acquired; heavy menses can be the presenting symptom of immune thrombocytopenic purpura or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Approximately one half of adolescent girls with bleeding disorders present with heavy menstrual bleeding at menarche; others may not present until cycles become ovulatory. Of adolescent girls and women with an inherited bleeding disorder, 75–80% report having heavy menses as the most commonly cited clinical manifestation of their disorder. Of children and adolescents with a bleeding disorder, 70% report passage of clots and bleeding through clothes and sheets. Recurrent hemorrhagic corpus luteum, with or without rupture, or hemoperitoneum with ovulation also can be gynecologic indications of a bleeding disorder. Anemia that results from bleeding can cause associated symptoms of headaches and fatigue, and low iron stores in adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding, reflected by a low ferritin level, even without anemia, are associated with fatigue and decreased cognition.

### Myeloproliferative neoplasms in the adolescent and young adult population: a comprehensive review of the literature [^1179YT4f]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are characterized by a clonal proliferation of myeloid lineage cells within the bone marrow. The classical BCR-ABL negative MPNs are comprised of polycythaemia vera, essential thrombocythaemia and primary myelofibrosis. Historically, the majority of MPNs are diagnosed in adults older than 60years of age; however, in recent years, there has been recognition of MPNs in the adolescent and young adult (AYA) population. AYAs with MPN, typically defined as between the ages of 15 and 39years old, may comprise up to 20% of patients diagnosed with MPN. They demonstrate unique patterns of driver mutations and thrombotic events and remain at risk for progression to more aggressive disease states. Given the likely long length of time they will live with their disease, there is a significant unmet need in identifying well-tolerated and effective treatment options for these patients, particularly with the advent of disease modification. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the clinical features, disease course and management of AYA patients with MPN and, in doing so, highlight key characteristics that distinguish them from their older counterparts.

### Essential thrombocythemia [^112k81Zq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on essential thrombocythemia:

- **Definition**: ET is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal proliferation of megakaryocytes leading to sustained thrombocytosis (platelets ≥ 450×10⁹/L). The disease most often results from driver mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL and manifests with increased thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk, vasomotor symptoms, and, less frequently, progression to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia.
- **Pathophysiology**: ET results from constitutive activation of cytokine signaling, most frequently through the JAK2V617F mutation, found in about 60% of patients, or through CALR or MPL mutations, found in about 20–25% and 3–4%, respectively. These driver mutations stimulate uncontrolled megakaryocytic proliferation and platelet production. Additional mutations in genes such as ASXL1, TET2, DNMT3A, SF3B1, or TP53 can influence disease behavior and risk of progression. Abnormal interactions between activated platelets and the vascular endothelium contribute to thrombotic events, while very high platelet counts may cause acquired von Willebrand syndrome and bleeding.
- **Epidemiology**: ET has an incidence of about 1.5–2 cases per 100,000 persons each year and is most common in older adults, though up to one fifth of patients are diagnosed before the age of 40. Women are slightly more often affected than men. It accounts for about one third of all myeloproliferative neoplasms. About 10–15% of patients lack detectable mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL and are referred to as triple-negative.
- **Risk factors**: The primary risk factors for ET include age and genetic predisposition.
- **Disease course**: The disease often remains stable for many years but can be interrupted by vascular complications. Thrombosis is the most frequent cause of morbidity, occurring in about 15–20% of patients, especially in those > 60 years or carrying a JAK2 mutation. Hemorrhagic events may occur, particularly in the setting of extreme thrombocytosis. Progression to post-ET myelofibrosis occurs in about 5–10% of cases, and transformation to acute leukemia in less than 2% over ten years. Median survival is about 18–20 years overall and exceeds 30 years in younger individuals. Prognostic models such as the triple A system, which considers age, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts, or mutationally enhanced models that include adverse mutations, help stratify outcomes. Triple-negative disease generally has the most favorable prognosis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Life expectancy in ET is somewhat reduced compared with the general population but remains substantially better than in other myeloproliferative neoplasms such as polycythemia vera or myelofibrosis. Median survival is approximately 18 years but can exceed 35 years in younger patients. Adverse prognostic factors include advanced age, leukocytosis, abnormal karyotype, and mutations in SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, or TP53. Patients with CALR type 2 mutations or triple-negative status have the lowest risk of thrombosis and longest survival, whereas those with CALR type 1 or MPL mutations are more prone to fibrotic transformation. The major therapeutic focus remains prevention of thrombosis and close monitoring for disease progression.

### Adolescents and young adults with newly diagnosed primary immune thrombocytopenia [^114BGHFM]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Many pediatric studies have revealed that children over the age of 10 years are at risk for chronic ITP. Therefore, it is reasonable to suppose that AYAS have a major risk of developing chronic ITP. However, assuming that the immune system of AYAS has a high potential to reverse immune dysregulation and restore self-tolerance, we hypothesize that therapeutic strategies involving immunomodulation should result in better long-term outcomes in these individuals than in adults. Most ITP treatment strategies currently focus on preventing premature platelet destruction (immunosuppression and splenectomy) and promoting platelet production (thrombopoietin-receptor agonist [TPO-RA] treatment).

It is unclear whether the initial presentation, risk of chronicity, and response to ITP treatment in AYAS are more similar to adults or children. It is important to understand the disease characteristics in AYAS to use appropriate diagnostic tools, treatment strategies, and goals. This study aimed to describe the clinical and laboratory presentation of ITP and its corresponding treatment approach for AYAS.

### Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia-NCI… [^111bmfY1]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

ALL occurs because too many stem cells become lymphoblasts that do not mature into B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes. These cells are also called leukemia cells. Leukemia cells are not able to fight infection very well. Also, as the number of leukemia cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells. This may lead to anemia, easy bleeding, and infection. ALL usually worsens quickly if it is not treated. Causes and risk factors for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia Childhood ALL is caused by changes to how the blood stem cells function, especially how they grow and divide into new cells. The exact cause of these cell changes is often unknown. Learn more about how cancer develops at What Is Cancer. A risk factor is anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Not every child with one or more of these risk factors will develop ALL.

And it will develop in some children who don't have a known risk factor. Risk factors may be genetic or due to other causes. Possible genetic risk factors for ALL include:

- Down syndrome
- neurofibromatosis type 1
- Bloom syndrome
- Fanconi anemia
- ataxia-telangiectasia
- Li-Fraumeni syndrome
- constitutional mismatch repair deficiency
- having certain changes in chromosomes or genes. Other possible risk factors for ALL include:

- being exposed to x-rays before birth
- being exposed to radiation
- past treatment with chemotherapy Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk. Symptoms of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia Symptoms of childhood ALL are caused by not having enough red blood cells and platelets and by having too many white blood cells that don't work well.

It's important to check with your child's doctor if your child has: Blood chemistry study Blood chemistry study uses a blood sample to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.
- Very high risk: Children younger than age 1, children with certain changes in the genes, children who have a slow improvement from initial treatment, and children who have signs of leukemia after the first 4 weeks of treatment. Other factors that affect the risk group include:

### Isolated congenital asplenia: an overlooked cause of thrombocytosis [^114jAcbW]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

2 DISCUSSION

Thrombocytosis is a common finding in routine blood exams and a common cause of referral to the hematologist for further investigation. From a physiopathological point of view, thrombocytosis can be categorized into primary (i.e. depending on the true hematological disease), secondary (i.e. reactive), and spurious (Table 1). As reactive thrombocytosis is more frequent than primary thrombocytosis, it is widely accepted in common clinical practice to search, at first, for causes of secondary thrombocytosis. Thus, blood tests and any other complementary examinations to search for reactive causes (e.g. iron deficiency, infection, inflammatory disease, and hemolysis) should be performed. In addition, a detailed medical history should be obtained, with particular emphasis on the present and past illness and recent surgical intervention (thrombocytosis secondary to malignancy, postoperative thrombocytosis). In addition, a comprehensive and updated list of current medications (including prescription medications, herbals, and over‐the‐counter drugs) should be noted (thrombocytosis caused by administration of corticosteroids, adrenaline, and thrombopoietin mimicking drugs).

### Impact of treatment for adolescent and young adults with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera [^115fSfCV]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) are rare in adolescent and young adult (AYA). These conditions, similar to those in older patients, are linked with thrombotic complications and the potential progression to secondary myelofibrosis (sMF). This retrospective study of ET and PV patients diagnosed before age 25 evaluated complication rates and impact of cytoreductive drugs on outcomes. Among 348 patients (278 ET, 70 PV) with a median age of 20 years, the of thrombotic events was 1.9 per 100 patient-years. Risk factors for thrombosis included elevated white blood cell count (> 11 × 10⁹/L) (HR: 2.7, p = 0.012) and absence of splenomegaly at diagnosis (HR: 5.7, p = 0.026), while cytoreductive drugs did not reduce this risk. The incidence of sMF was 0.7 per 100 patient-years. CALR mutation (HR: 6.0, p < 0.001) and a history of thrombosis (HR: 3.8, p = 0.015) were associated with sMF risk. Interferon as a first-line treatment significantly improved myelofibrosis-free survival compared to other treatments or the absence of cytoreduction (p = 0.046). Although cytoreduction did not affect thrombotic event, early interferon use reduced sMF risk. These findings support interferon use to mitigate sMF risk in AYA ET and PV patients.

### Thrombocytosis and thrombosis [^114YVDNR]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this review is to discuss current diagnostic approaches to, and classification of, patients presenting with thrombocytosis, in light of novel information derived from the discovery of specific molecular abnormalities in chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD), which represent the most common cause of primary thrombocytosis. The JAK2V617F and the MPLW515L/K mutations have been found in patients with essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and primary myelofibrosis, and less frequently in other myeloproliferative disorders complicated by thrombocytosis. However, neither mutation is disease specific nor is it universally present in patients with elevated platelet counts due to a CMPD; therefore, distinguishing between reactive and primary forms of thrombocytosis, as well as among the different clinical entities that constitute the CMPD, still requires a multifaceted diagnostic approach that includes as a key step the accurate evaluation of bone marrow histology. The role of elevated platelet counts in thrombosis, which represent the predominant complication of CMPD, significantly affecting prognosis and quality of life as well as, paradoxically, in the pathogenesis of the hemorrhagic manifestations, will be discussed. Established and novel potential risk factors for thrombosis, including the clinical relevance of the JAK2V617F mutation, and current management strategies for thrombocytosis are also briefly discussed.

### Is very high platelet count always associated with essential thrombocythemia? An unusual presentation in a child [^111kB47k]. Laboratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms are rare in childhood. They are categorized as Philadelphia chromosome-positive and Philadelphia chromosome-negative. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is the most common myeloproliferative disease in which the Philadelphia chromosome is detected as a result of BCR-ABL rearrangements. In others, the most common genetic abnormality is JAK2V617F mutation. The coexistence of these 2 abnormalities in CML is unexpected, and rare cases have recently been reported in adults. We present a child who had a very high platelet count in which we found this coexistence. The clinical presentation, laboratory findings, management, and prognosis of this coexistence is challenging in such a rare condition.

### Essential thrombocythemia: a review of diagnostic and pathologic features [^1164HjFn]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder (CMPD) characterized predominately by thrombocytosis and abnormal megakaryocyte proliferation. The current diagnostic criteria require a combination of clinical, histologic, and cytogenetic data. The diagnosis relies largely on exclusion of other causes of thrombocytosis.

Objective

Describe historical, clinical, and laboratory features of ET in order to understand, clarify, and more accurately diagnose this entity.

Data Sources

Review contemporary and historical literature on ET and other causes of thrombocytosis.

Conclusions

ET is a relatively indolent and often asymptomatic CMPD that is characterized primarily by a sustained elevation in platelets ≥ 600 × 10³/μL (≥ 600 × 10⁹/L), proliferating enlarged and hyperlobated megakaryocytes, and minimal to absent bone marrow fibrosis. Significant changes and revisions to the diagnostic requirements and criteria for ET have occurred during the last 30 years. Recently, a mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene has been found in a significant number of cases of ET and other CMPDs. In up to 57% of ET cases, a mutation in the JAK2 gene can be detected. In the absence of a JAK2 mutation and features of another CMPD, the diagnosis of ET remains a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes of thrombocytosis have been excluded.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2021 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in pediatrics [^114NthJk]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Complete blood count (CBC) parameters in pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis — The peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count can be elevated but is in the normal range in most children, and the accuracy of the WBC count for the diagnosis of AHO is less than that of CRP; WBC count may be higher on average with MRSA etiology and in complicated cases, yet WBC counts overlap considerably among these etiologies and scenarios and do not provide discriminatory value. The information provided by a CBC can provide important adjunctive information for decision-making for children with suspected or confirmed AHO, and anemia and reactive thrombocytosis may be seen in some children with AHO at presentation.

### Biological stratification of clinical disease courses in childhood immune thrombocytopenia [^115BohJT]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

In our recent randomized controlled trial, we observed that although IVIg treatment promoted platelet recovery over the short term, it had no effect on the long‐term recovery from ITP (i.e. the rate of chronic disease) at 1 year postdiagnosis. 10 It is well known that the administration of IVIg leads to a rapid resolution of thrombocytopenia in the majority of children with ITP, 4, 11 yet a proportion of patients does not respond to treatment. Variable platelet response rates to IVIg of 50% to 95% have been reported in the literature, with differences between patient cohorts and response definitions. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Moreover, it has been reported that IVIg nonresponders are more likely to develop chronic ITP (i.e. have a lower likelihood of spontaneous recovery). 12, 17

The design of prediction models in childhood ITP is challenging. First, the broad clinical diagnosis of ITP may lead to a wide range of diverse causes of thrombocytopenia (e.g. autoinflammatory and postinfectious syndromes, early signs of autoimmune diseases, immune deficiencies, or, probably more rarely, genetic thrombocytopenia). 18, 19, 20 Second, there may be heterogeneity in the underlying pathophysiology of ITP (e.g. autoantibodies specific to platelet GPIb/IX, 21 or CD8‐mediated cellular antiplatelet immunity 22). Third, a further challenge in childhood ITP is the association of age at presentation with a skewing of the disease prognosis, where both adolescents and adults display a different prognosis compared with younger children. 23, 24, 25 Age is also associated with differences in cellular subsets and other molecular markers, which needs to be considered (Schmidt et al. manuscript submitted;).

In the present study, our objective was to develop a biological risk score to identify at the diagnosis children with newly diagnosed ITP who show no response versus a complete recovery after IVIg. In line with the literature, given the relationship between IVIg response and the ITP disease course, we further tested if the factors associated with a favorable IVIg response were also associated with spontaneous recovery from ITP. Finally, we investigated if these biological factors could improve the discrimination of children with a favorable disease course, as stratified by a score using clinical characteristics alone.

### Thrombocytosis associated with malignant ovarian lesions within a pediatric / adolescent population [^1131jQfv]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To determine if there is an association between pediatric ovarian malignancies and elevated platelet counts:

Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

Large referral children's hospital.

Participants

154 patients taken to the operating room between February 1993 and February 2006 with an adnexal mass where ovarian tissue was submitted for pathological analysis.

Main Outcome Measures

The principle outcome was the presence of ovarian malignancy.

Results

We found that there is an increase in thrombocytosis among individuals with ovarian malignancy, with as high as 33% of those with ovarian germ cell tumors demonstrating preoperative thrombocytosis.

Conclusion

These results suggest that thrombocytosis may be a useful marker for ovarian malignancy in this population. Further studies will be needed to determine if there is any prognostic value to thrombocytosis among these patients, with a potential value for counseling and future intervention based on these findings.

### A case of essential thrombocythemia in an 8-year-old boy [^114TkFKK]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis in childhood is not rare but essential thrombocythemia is an extremely rare myeloproliferative disorder in childhood.

### Impact of treatment for adolescent and young adults with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera [^1112u63J]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we focused on the largest well-defined cohort of individuals diagnosed with ET and PV before the age of 25. Our investigation focused on the risks of thrombosis, evolution to sMF, and the impact of treatment modalities.

Surprisingly, our findings revealed a significant thrombotic risk despite young age, with a rate of 1.9 per 100 patient-years, irrespective of the MPN subtype. This rate is comparable to those reported in contemporary cohorts of older patients with more comorbidities, although the time to the first thrombotic event appears to be longer in our cohort (median time of 4 years for ET and 3 years for PV) compared to adult cohorts (median time of 0.9 years for ET and 0.3 years for PV). Nevertheless, given that the incidence of thrombotic events appears to be as frequent in AYA patients as in older individuals, it remains a significant concern. These patients are expected to live for several decades, and the accumulation of additional thrombotic risk factors (age, cardiovascular conditions, additional mutations) may progressively heighten this risk. This highlights a substantial and emerging concern regarding thrombotic events in this younger demographic.

### Spontaneous resolution of extreme thrombocytosis in 2 children [^114BiGYv]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Essential thrombocytosis (ET) is rare in children, sometimes difficult to be distinguished from secondary thrombocytosis. This report concerns 2 children with extreme thrombocytosis of 4100 × 10⁹/L and 1644 × 10⁹/L with partial and complete remission at 3 months and 4 years from diagnosis, with a follow-up of 4 and 17 years, respectively, with no cytoreduction therapy. Diagnosis of ET was suggested according to accepted criteria. However, spontaneous remission of the thrombocytosis argues for the diagnosis of secondary thrombocytosis. These patients highlight the complexity of distinguishing childhood ET from secondary thrombocytosis and the need for cautious personalized decision on cytoreduction therapy.

### Effects of COVID-19 vaccination on platelet counts and bleeding in children, adolescents, and young adults with immune thrombocytopenia [^1127vASU]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines rarely cause de novo immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) but may worsen preexisting ITP in adults. Whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines impact platelet counts and bleeding in children, adolescents, and young adults (C-AYA) with preexisting ITP is unknown. We report here the very limited effect of COVID-19 vaccination on platelet counts and bleeding in a single-center series of 2 C-AYA with ITP. No patient experienced worsening bleeding and only one child had a significant decrease in platelet count which improved spontaneously to her baseline without intervention. SARS-CoV2 vaccination was safe in C-AYA with ITP in this small cohort.

### Are all cases of paediatric essential thrombocythaemia really myeloproliferative neoplasms? Analysis of a large cohort [^116XQtiE]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

Sporadic essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is rare in paediatrics, and the diagnostic and clinical approach to paediatric cases cannot be simply copied from experience with adults. Here, we assessed 89 children with a clinical diagnosis of ET and found that 23 patients (25.8%) had a clonal disease. The JAK2 V617F mutation was identified in 14 children, 1 child had the MPL W515L mutation, and 6 had CALR mutations. The monoclonal X-chromosome inactivation pattern was seen in six patients (two with JAK2 V617F and two with CALR mutations). The other 66 patients (74.2%) had persistent thrombocytosis with no clonality. There were no clinical or haematological differences between the clonal and non-clonal patients. The relative proportion of ET-specific mutations in the clonal children was much the same as in adults. The higher prevalence of non-clonal cases suggests that some patients may not have myeloproliferative neoplasms, with significant implications for their treatment.

### The hospitalized adolescent [^114ffeqY]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Menstrual disorders in hospitalized adolescents — if evidence of a menstrual disorder is revealed, it can be addressed during the hospitalization, and an adolescent with a history of heavy periods, particularly if anemic, should be evaluated for the etiology of this menstrual concern with consultation from adolescent medicine or gynecology and possibly hematology, with empirical anemia treatment considered. Adolescents with irregular menses with no anemia could have the evaluation begin in the hospital and be scheduled for follow-up with their PCP, an adolescent medicine specialist, or a gynecologist. If an adolescent admitted for another medical or surgical concern is found to be anemic and is currently menstruating, treatment to stop menses or address menorrhagia can be considered during the hospitalization, and adolescent medicine or gynecology could be consulted to initiate medical treatment to stop menses, if warranted. Menstrual suppression can be addressed and initiated in the inpatient setting for those who with IDDs, those who will undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), or those who have thrombocytopenia or a functional platelet disorder or another clotting disorder.

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients with essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera diagnosed before 20 years of age: a systematic review [^115PPVCL]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

PubMed research

The purpose of this review was to learn more about young patients diagnosed with MPN: their characteristics at diagnosis and the incidence of complications. To our knowledge there has been no systematic review of the published cases. We used PubMed to identify articles related to our topic.

For this review, we analyzed papers referring only to patients with ET or PV who were under 20 years old at the time of the diagnosis. The keywords used during the research were: polycythemia vera, primary or essential thrombocythemia/thrombocytosis, myelofibrosis, myeloproliferative neoplasms or diseases, young patients/adults, children/childhood and pediatric cases. To avoid the bias of recording misdiagnosed PV cases, only papers published since 2005 were eligible, coincident with the date of the discovery of the JAK2 V617F mutation. Furthermore, we directly excluded familial MPN cases, if this was clearly specified in the title or the text. All types of articles were collected: general reviews, cohort papers (including more than 5 patients) and case reports (including fewer than 5 patients).

Selection of the articles

We identified 87 articles concerning MPN and young patients and we finally analyzed 46 articles after exclusion of redundant papers (same authors, same numbers of patients), uninformative cases (no information about diagnosis or outcomes), alternative myeloid diseases (primary myelofibrosis, acute leukemia), inadequate age identification (cohorts of young patients, but below 40 years old) as delineated in the PRISMA flowchart (Online Supplementary Figure S1) and the checklist (Online Supplementary Table S1).

In total, we identified 46 informative articles: 19 cohort papers (16 on ET and 3 on PV) and 27 case reports (23 on ET and 11 on PV, with some concerning both conditions). – We also added seven papers with useful information concerning epidemiology. –

### Recognition of thrombotic risk of thrombocytosis in iron deficiency [^11318giR]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Rates of thrombocytosis and thrombosis among patients with iron-deficiency anemia. Rates of thrombocytosis and thrombosis in a recent large clinical database study of over six million patients, supported by extensive chart review to exclude alternative confounding causes of thrombocytosis and confirm thrombotic events.

The development of a high quality animal model to lend support to the longstanding observation of iron deficiency mediated-thrombocytosis leading to a significantly higher risk of thrombosis is an important advance. Without stratifying for iron deficiency or its successful abatement by intravenous iron, the observation of a marked increment in thromboses in erythropoiesis stimulating agent-treated patients with cancer and chemotherapy-induced anemia and anemia associated with both non-dialysis and dialysis- dependent chronic kidney disease led to the near proscription of the use of a treatment which unqualifiedly leads to improvements in energy, activity and quality of life in a cohort with debilitating chronic illness. Despite a litany of prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled studies failing to show harm with the use of erythropoiesis- stimulating agents, especially in cancer and chemotherapy-induced anemia, extreme caution with their use remains the order of the day.

A now growing body of inferential evidence supports the use of intravenous iron as the preferred route of administration in most of the described conditions. This new animal model provides evidence that intravenous iron replenishment may have additional advantages in mitigating the thrombogenic potential of iron deficiency. It also suggests that intravenous iron might preferentially provide an important adjunctive therapy to mitigate the hypercoagulability associated with iron-deficiency states comorbid with multiple disorders in humans, such as cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, after bariatric surgery, abnormal uterine bleeding and pregnancy. Given that iron-deficiency anemia affects approximately 20% of the human population at any given point in time, even a modestly increased thrombotic risk imparted by iron deficiency has profound public health implications. Additionally, synergism of multiple thrombotic risk factors is well-documented, raising the specter of a potentially even greater thrombotic impact of this common problem given its frequent comorbidities. Thankfully, additional avenues of investigation to better understand these risks are open, as this animal model also suggests that critical biomarkers can now be explored and can then be correlated with objective in vivo events. Such biomarkers could also include the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1 and HIF-2, whose target genes include erythropoietin, the transferrin receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor. These targets are also associated with increased thrombogenesis.

Although thrombocytopenia is classically associated with bleeding, there are also conditions in which bleeding and thrombosis can occur. These include antiphospholipid syndrome, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathies, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

6 The pathogenesis of these conditions relates to mechanisms such as the development of immune complexes promoting excessive thrombin production, endothelial wall injury with platelet microthrombi formation, or disproportionate consumption of coagulation factors. Patients with stable chronic thrombocytopenia associated with specific medical conditions do not require increased platelet surveillance or immediate hematology consultation without other complications. 19 The mechanisms by which drugs cause thrombocytopenia include peripheral platelet destruction, bone marrow suppression, and platelet activation. 19 The severity of DIT is variable, and platelet counts rarely drop below 20 × 10³ per μL. A detailed history of medication exposure and the onset of thrombocytopenia is critical in determining the likelihood of DIT.

HEPATIC DISEASE Thrombocytopenia is present in 64% to 84% of patients with chronic hepatic disease. 27 The primary mechanism for thrombocytopenia is decreased hepatic synthesis of thrombopoietin, which is essential for the production of platelets. Other associated factors such as splenic sequestration from portal hypertension, bone marrow suppression, and medications may worsen thrombocytopenia. 28.

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients with essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera diagnosed before 20 years of age: a systematic review [^1125TiKn]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Epidemiology

Only a few papers considered epidemiological data specifically for the MPN population and, it was sometimes difficult to assess the presence or absence of chronic myelogenous leukemia among the cases described. Furthermore, there was great variability in the incidence of MPN between countries (United Kingdom, Denmark, Europe, Japan), in the timing of the observation (from 1980 to 2010) and in the age of the patients (below 14 to below 25 years old).

Overall, we found that the global incidence of MPN, in children and young adults, can be estimated to be around 0.82/100,000 patients/year (range, 0.1 to 2.25): the incidence of ET is around 0.6/100,000 patients/year (range, 0.004 to 0.9), against 0.18 for PV and 0.53 for primary myelofibrosis (range, 0.003 to 1.5).

Figure 1.
Occurrence of bleeding symptoms at diagnosis in patients with initial profound versus moderate thrombocytopenia. Median platelet count for patients without bleeding at initial diagnosis was 37.5×10⁹/L and 11×10⁹/L for patients with some bleeding symptoms (P < 0.001).

We found only minor clinical differences between adolescents (12–18 years; 59% girls) and young adults (18–25 years; 70% women), with young adults presenting more mild-to-moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet count between 20–99×10⁹/L) at diagnosis than adolescents (47% and 32%, respectively) and less initial bleeding (70% and 85%, respectively). However, the remission rate was identical in both age groups (57%). The higher median platelet count at 6 months FU in young adults compared to adolescents (114×10⁹/L; IQR, 55–222 and 93×10⁹/L, IQR 40–197, respectively) could be the result of a higher treatment rate at this time point (58% and 42%, respectively) (Table 2). Drug treatments were reported for 66% at diagnosis, 45% after initial treatment until 6 months, and 30% at 6–12 months after diagnosis. Corticosteroids were most frequently used at all time points. Among the treated patients, 74% received corticosteroids during the first 6 months (excluding initial treatment) and 68% between 6 and 12 months. Second-line treatments were heterogeneous and administered to 28% of patients receiving treatment beyond 6 months (Table 3).

### Marked thrombocytosis in a child with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome [^114E9HXB]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2004). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis with rare occurrence in childhood. Conversely to adult affected patients, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts and the 5q-syndrome, which are associated with thrombocytosis are virtually absent in the pediatric age group. We describe the case of an 1-year-old boy with advanced MDS, specifically refractory anemia with excess of blasts who presented with leukocytopenia and anemia but marked thrombocytosis at diagnosis. Thrombocytosis resolved without therapy. This case illustrates the relationship between MDS and myeloproliferative disorders.

Key Points

- At 24-, 36-, and 48-month FU, 10% of AYAs with chronic ITP attain yearly SCROT.
- Higher platelet counts and lower use of rescue therapy during the first year of the disease might be predictors of SCROT beyond 12 months.

### Recognition of thrombotic risk of thrombocytosis in iron deficiency [^111ZDgo5]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite the overwhelming preponderance of published evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of intravenous iron, reluctance to its use among practitioners prevails due to heightened concerns of danger fomented, at least in part, by misinformation and misinterpretation of the incidence and clinical nature of serious adverse events occurring in recipients of this treatment. The convincing evidence brought forth from these well-performed in vitro experiments and animal models provides information not only on a long-sought physiological mechanism for a commonly observed clinical event but more importantly on the need to heighten the awareness of a readily prescribed treatment modality which mitigates its occurrence.

### Adolescents and young adults with newly diagnosed primary immune thrombocytopenia [^1114c8xg]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Current immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) guidelines target children and adults, leading to oversimplification. Adolescents and young adults (AYAS) comprise a separate group with distinct health and psychosocial issues. This study aimed to describe the clinical presentation and therapeutic strategies of ITP among AYAS. We analyzed data from two large ITP registries (PARC-ITP; CARMEN-France) and included newly diagnosed ITP patients (aged 12–25 years) with an initial platelet counts of < 100×10⁹/L. Patients with secondary ITP or non-immune thrombocytopenia (n = 57) and pregnant women (n = 10) were excluded. Of the 656 cases of AYAS with primary ITP registered from 2004 up to 2021, 12-month follow-up data were available for 72%. The initial median platelet count was 12×10⁹/L. In 109 patients (17%), the diagnosis was incidental, without documented bleeding. Apart from gynecological bleeding, the clinical and therapeutical characteristics of females and males were similar. Platelet-enhancing drugs were reported in 66%, 45%, and 30% of patients at diagnosis, 1–6 months, and 6–12 months after diagnosis, respectively. Corticosteroids were the preferred treatment at all time points. At 12 months, 50% of all patients developed chronic ITP. In the subgroup of patients with initial severe thrombocytopenia (< 20×10⁹/L), those receiving frontline treatment had a higher remission rate at 1 year than those who followed an initial watch-and-wait strategy (53% and 32%; P < 0.05). Our analysis indicates that the remission rate at 1 year may be associated with the initial treatment strategy. This hypothesis must be confirmed in prospective studies.

### Adolescents and young adults with newly diagnosed primary immune thrombocytopenia [^1138Fi1s]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Characteristics and treatment of adolescents and young adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia.

At the 12-month FU 236 of 470 patients (50%) suffered from chronic disease, 38% were in remission, and 12% had an unclear status. Chronic disease at 12 months was identical for both sexes, and the median platelet count in chronic ITP was 57×10⁹/L (IQR, 31–85). Asymptomatic chronic ITP (no bleeding between 6 and 12 months) characterized 109 of 236 (46%) patients with chronic disease, irrespective of the treatment strategy. At 12 months, 56 patients not undergoing treatment in the last 6 months had borderline platelet counts ranging from 100×10⁹/L to 149×10⁹/L. Of these, at least 16 (29%) had a relapse (platelet count < 100×10⁹/L) at a later date, with seven of 16 harboring platelets < 50×10⁹/L (available FU differed greatly in this group of patients).

The characteristics of patients in remission compared to those with chronic ITP are shown in Table 4. Overall, 23% of chronic ITP and 15% of patients in remission tested positive for ANA at their initial visit. However, this blood test was performed in only half of the cohort, and definition of positivity may show strong variation. An initial diagnosis of severe thrombocytopenia was more prevalent among patients in remission at 12 months than those with chronic ITP (69% vs. 56%). However, patients with initial platelet counts < 20×10⁹/L (n = 256) showed a similar tendency to develop chronic disease (51%) as to go into remission (49%) at 12 months. In contrast, among the 159 patients with an initial platelet count ≥ 20×10⁹/L, only 55 (35%) were in remission at 12 months (Figure 2). The initial platelet count was a significant factor of remission in the analysis of predictors presented further down. Adolescents (12–18 years) and young adults (18–25 years) showed identical remission rates (43%). Further analyses of the different age groups (12– < 15, 15– < 18, and 18– < 21, 21– < 25 years) are shown in Figure 2A. The worst outcome, i.e. the lowest remission rate of 28%, was observed in the 15– < 18-year subgroup with an initial platelet count of ≥ 20×10⁹/L.

Discussion

In our analysis, AYAS exhibited a clinical pattern that reflected overlapping characteristics of children and adults. As for children AYAS presented with infrequent comorbidities, high initial bleeding rate, and a very low initial platelet count. Conversely, and similar to adults we found more females, a high risk of chronicity > 50%, and a prolonged need for treatment between 6–12 months in 30% of cases (Online Supplementary Table S2). The AYAS group was clinically very homogenous, and we found no reason to clinically separate young adults from adolescents given that the course of disease and risk of chronicity are similar (Table 2). Our analysis highlights that AYAS are mainly treated with corticosteroids throughout the 1-year observation period, probably leading to considerable side effects (Table 1). However, we do not have information on dose and duration. The reason for this treatment may be drug convenience, offering the possibility of on-demand treatment (especially for menstruating women); moreover, the availability of alternative treatments such as TPO-RA was limited (especially for children aged < 16 years) in the study period, and such treatments are costly. The high rate of chronic disease in AYAS confirms the poor recovery rates among older children. Many pediatric studies reveal that age > 10 years is a major risk factor for chronicity. According to the ICIS I registry, the remission rates of patients aged 10–16 and 1–10 years were 53% and 72%, respectively. Similarly, Donato et al. reported recovery rates of 49% among children aged 9–18 years and 71% in those aged 1–8 years at diagnosis. Among patients diagnosed with ITP at 10–18 years from 1976 to 2000, Lowe and Buchanan observed 57% with chronic disease, 27% in recovery, and 15% with unclear results. These values are similar to our AYAS cohort aged between 12 and 25 years. However, it is to note that definition of remission and chronicity varies in the literature and in published guidelines. The term "chronic disease" was corrected in 2009 to designate a disease lasting ≥ 12 months and with a platelet count < 100×10⁹/L. In our analysis, adolescents aged 15–18 years had a slightly higher chronic disease rate (61%) than those aged 12–15 years (55%). We found no differences in the remission rates of males and females. This finding agrees with Lowe and Buchanan.

### Impact of treatment for adolescent and young adults with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera [^113NpY7a]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

While identifying risk factors at diagnosis remains crucial for pinpointing patients prone to thrombotic complications, within our cohort, we are unable to demonstrate a discernible advantage of cytoreduction to prevent thrombosis and absence of advantage of specific agent (HU, IFN or ANA) to mitigate this risk. In light of our results, the early use of pharmacological cytoreduction solely for the purpose of reducing thrombotic risk must be weighed against the risks and complications associated with the treatment, as we did not demonstrate any benefit from its use. Given the retrospective nature of our study, data regarding blood cell counts (specifically hematocrit, PLT count, and WBC count) over time and at the time of thrombotic complications were not systematically available, precluding us from determining whether the lack of efficacy of cytoreduction in reducing thrombotic risk was related to poorly controlled blood cell counts as previously demonstrated in older populations, or to the ineffectiveness of cytoreduction in the AYA patients despite achieving target blood cell counts values. Finally, in light of our results, the use of antiplatelet therapy, has not shown a benefit in reducing thrombotic risk. However, the lack of evidence for a reduction in TFS with antiplatelet therapy may be related to the high use of these treatments in the cohort (75% in the overall cohort, 79% in ET, and 86% in PV). In the absence of more robust results, the use of antiplatelet therapy appears reasonable in AYA PV and ET patients, as recommended in the older population. This avenue warrants further investigation to refine our understanding and optimize therapeutic strategies in AYA patients.

### An unusual case of extreme thrombocytosis caused by iron deficiency [^116Dsjse]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is a common cause of reactive thrombocytosis resulting in usually mild to moderately increased but sometimes even in extreme thrombocytosis (ie, > 1000×10⁹/L). We report a case of a 34-year-old woman who developed an increased platelet count of 1953×10⁹/L. Upon admission, cytoreductive therapy was initiated until an underlying chronic myeloproliferative neoplasia was ruled out. The patient had undergone bariatric surgery 5 years previously, and surprisingly, a diagnosis of reactive thrombocytosis due to iron deficiency secondary to iron malabsorption was made. It is concluded that the degree of extreme thrombocytosis may be even fourfold to fivefold increased in patients with severe iron deficiency. Our finding emphasises the importance of regular control of possible need for iron supplementation following bariatric surgery.

### Thrombocytosis in pediatric HIV infection [^117Cd5NY]. Clinical Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia has been extensively reported in association with HIV infection. Twenty-four children (6%) from a cohort of 400 children with platelet counts > 500,000/mm³ were reviewed. All had symptomatic disease and 10 (42%) patients died. In 4 children the platelet count exceeded 700,000/mm³ and in 1 patient the platelet count was 1.5 million/mm³. There were no thrombotic complications, and no specific therapy was required for the thrombocytosis. Thus HIV-1 infection, a chronic viral infection, is another etiologic agent for thrombocytosis and is associated with severe disease.

### Inherited thrombocytopenia: when a low platelet count does not mean ITP [^111drvmc]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Congenital thrombocytopenias, once considered rare and obscure conditions, are today recognized with increasing frequency, especially due to the measurement of platelet number as part of routine blood testing. The clinical spectrum of congenital thrombocytopenia ranges from severe bleeding diatheses, recognized within the first few weeks of life, to mild conditions that may remain undetected even in adulthood. For the latter group of diseases, distinguishing between inherited (primary) and acquired (secondary) thrombocytopenia, especially immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), is essential to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful treatments. In this review, the congenital thrombocytopenia syndromes are discussed with specific attention focused on diagnostic criteria, clinical presentations, genetic etiology, and current medical management. The mutated genes responsible for each syndrome are reviewed as well as the potential implications for using gene therapy or gene repair in the future.

### Thrombocytosis in the NICU [^114qxXds]. Neurocritical Care (2008). Low credibility.

An elevated platelet count may occur during care of neurology/neurosurgical patients and is usually due to reactive or secondary thrombocytosis (ST) caused by inflammation or infection. Primary (clonal) thrombocythemia or essential thrombocythemia associated with myeloproliferative disorders is usually known before or during early patient assessment. Rarely, paraneoplastic causes of thrombocytosis may be discovered. Although no single test differentiates primary from secondary etiologies, laboratory tests that show increased acute phase responses, such as C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and interleukin-6, may be useful in diagnosing ST. Thrombosis due to ST is rare in any platelet count. ST, however, should be considered within the overall risk assessment for thromboembolism in any patient. If treatment is initiated, low-dose aspirin is sufficient.

### Essential versus reactive thrombocythemia in children: retrospective analyses of 12 cases [^114JCCAV]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) rarely occurs in the pediatric population and little is known about the clinical course and the molecular characteristics.

Procedure

In this retrospective multi-institutional study we examine the clinical, hematological, and molecular features of 12 children aged 5–16 years with thrombocytosis and a suspected diagnosis of ET.

Results

Median follow-up was 59 months (range 10–72). Seven patients presented with clinical symptoms potentially related to thrombocytosis. The remaining five patients were diagnosed incidentally. Median platelet count at diagnosis was 1,325 × 10⁹/L (range 600–3,050). In 11 out of 12 cases bone marrow morphology was consistent with ET, the remaining patient had chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis. Cytogenetic analyses were normal in all studied cases and only one out of nine analyzed cases harbored a JAK(V617F) allele. Within 6 months after initial presentation one patient who was initially asymptomatic developed thrombosis and another patient had mild bleeding. Eight patients were treated with acetylsalicylic acid, one patient received hydroxyurea, and two patients received anagrelide. At last follow-up, all patients were alive and none had developed leukemia. Five patients experienced hematological remission. Two children had not received any therapy. During the course of their disease, nine patients developed symptoms possibly attributable to an elevated platelet count.

Conclusions

In JAK2 mutation negative cases, long-term follow-up is helpful to distinguish between primary and secondary thrombocytosis. Secondary cases are not associated with organomegaly but may present with unspecific symptoms. Indications for treatment in children remain unclear.

### One thousand patients with essential thrombocythemia: the florence-CRIMM experience [^112ocnEk]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Essential thrombocythemia (ET), first described by Epstein and Goedel in 1934, is one of the classic Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), along with polycythemia vera (PV), prefibrotic and overtly fibrotic stage primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and MPN unclassifiable (MPN-U)/not otherwise specified (MPN-NOS) according to the latest International consensus (ICC) and World Health Organization (WHO) classification systems. Furthermore, ET may develop a fibrotic phenotype over time, referred to as post-ET myelofibrosis (MF).

ET is mainly characterized by the proliferation of abnormal megakaryocytes in the bone marrow (BM), resulting in an increased number of circulating platelets. Clinical manifestations include vasomotor symptoms such as erythromelalgia, migraine, and paresthesia, constitutional symptoms, and complications from thrombosis, both arterial and venous, and bleeding; mild (< 5 cm from left costal margin) splenomegaly can be seen in about 15–20% of the cases, while hepatomegaly is rare.

Rates of complications are relatively high. Of note, the incidence of thrombotic complications ranges from 9% to 84% at diagnosis and from 7% to 32% during long-term follow-up in various settings and using different definitions of events. For bleeding, the respective rates range from 4% to 63% and from 8% to 14%. However, approximately 40% to 50% of patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis, and thrombocytosis is an incidental finding on routine blood testing. Overall, ET has the most favorable prognosis among MPN but presents considerable clinical heterogeneity, and a minority of patients who develop progression to MF or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), referred to as blast-phase (BP) MPN, have a much poorer outcome.

Diagnosis of ET is made on the basis of patterns of histopathology in the BM, which is typically normocellular for patients' age and has an increased number of mostly mature-appearing megakaryocytes, either sparse and constituting loose clusters and reticulin fibrosis < grade 1; demonstration of clonality and/or the absence of a clear secondary cause of thrombocytosis, and exclusion of other hematologic disorders with thrombocytosis, are required diagnostic criteria. Among conditions associated with secondary/reactive thrombocytosis, the most frequent are infections, iron deficiency, chronic inflammation, drugs and splenectomy.

### Cystic fibrosis screening, evaluation, and management of hepatobiliary disease consensus recommendations [^113Fmaxq]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Screening recommendations

S1. The CFF recommends that annual labs [total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), platelet count] should be performed at a time of clinical stability for identification of hepatobiliary involvement in all PwCF starting at CF diagnosis.

CFHBI can manifest in childhood, adolescence, and/or adulthood. Liver test abnormalities may precede imaging abnormalitiesand correlate with fibrosis. Early identification of CFHBI affects care through staging, regular monitoring, and treatment. Common liver test abnormalities in CF may include elevations in serum AST, ALT, GGT, and/or alkaline phosphatase. Elevated conjugated bilirubin may occur in aCFLD or with biliary obstruction. Portal hypertension may also cause an absolute or relative thrombocytopenia if baseline thrombocytosis is present. Prior guidelines recommended further action at 1.5–2x upper limit of normal values for increased specificity. However, this, coupled with the use of high thresholds, can contribute to delayed diagnosis. Therefore, it is important to use age and sex-normative values, and we recommend further evaluation if any abnormalities are persistent (> 3–6 mo). Few studies have evaluated the optimal timing and frequency of lab testing; however, the CFF recommends that these tests be performed on an annual basis beginning at CF diagnosis. Many PwCF have transient elevation of liver enzymes during systemic inflammation or antibiotic treatment; however, CFHBI is characterized by persistent liver test abnormalities, and annual screening should be performed during a time of relative clinical stability (eg, no active treatment for acute pulmonary exacerbation or infection). Calculation of liver fibrosis indices based on routine laboratory tests, including AST-to-Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), fibrosis-4, and GGT-to-Platelet Ratio (GPR) can detect advanced fibrosis and portal hypertension and may be more specific than liver tests alone since they include platelet count. APRI is the most studied in CF and may be useful to identify aCFLD.– GPR may be particularly useful in detecting early biliary disease prior to significant hepatocyte injury. Optimal thresholds have not been broadly accepted in CF for any of the fibrosis indices, and therefore, the utility of these indices in screening PwCF for possible CFHBI or aCFLD is uncertain.

### Review of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [^115QVt6i]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) describes a clinical syndrome of hyperinflammation resulting in an uncontrolled and ineffective immune response. It may develop subsequent to a number of recognised genetic mutations or in association with infection, malignancy, autoinflammatory or metabolic conditions. Even with the published diagnostic criteria it can be difficult to make the diagnosis of HLH. Patients presenting acutely to the general paediatrician or paediatric intensivist with a clinical picture of likely sepsis, ie fever, laboratory evidence of inflammatory response, coagulopathy and thrombocytopaenia should be appropriately investigated and managed for sepsis, but the possible diagnosis of HLH should be borne in mind, particularly in the child who deteriorates despite maximal therapy. This review discusses current knowledge on the classification, diagnosis and management of primary and secondary HLH, and suggests a pathway of investigation for the paediatrician faced with a potential case.

Table 2.
Comparison of characteristics between adolescents and young adults (within the group of all adolescents and young adults).

Among patients with initial severe thrombocytopenia (< 20×10⁹/L, n = 256), the remission rate at 1 year depended on the initial treatment strategy, i.e. remission rates were 53% and 32% for patients receiving any frontline treatment and watch-and-wait treatment, respectively (P < 0.05) (Figures 2B, 3). These two treatment subgroups did not differ in age, sex, and bleeding occurrence. In contrast, among patients with initial moderate thrombocytopenia, those followed with the watch-and-wait approach had a higher remission rate (37/90, 41%) than those receiving any first-line treatment (18/69, 26%), particularly intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (4/24, 17%) (Figure 2B). However, the size of the last subgroup was small. Figure 3 shows the probability of remission according to the initial platelet count and initial treatment strategy, with the curves crossing at a platelet count of 30×10⁹/L (interaction). This means that the effect of initial treatment on remission depends on the magnitude of the initial platelet count.

Myelofibrosis

During the follow-up, 22 progressions to sMF were observed, 18 in ET (6%) and 4 in PV (6%). Risk of MF progression was 0.7 per 100 patient-years in the entire cohort, 0.8 per 100 patient-years in ET and 0.5 per 100 patient-years in PV. Ten-year and 20-year MFS for the entire cohort was 95.2% (95% CI: 92.4–98%) and 81.3% (95% CI: 71.5–91.1%). For ET, 10-year MFS was 94.7% (95% CI: 91.2–98.3%) and 20-year MFS was 75.7% (95% CI: 61.9–89.5%). For PV, 10-year MFS was 96.8% (95% CI: 92.4–100%) and 20-year MFS was 93.3% (95% CI: 85.1–100). There was no significant difference between ET and PV (p = 0.236). The median time from diagnosis to sMF progression was 10 years (IQR: 5.2–17.1 years) in the entire cohort, 10 years (IQR: 5.7–17.1 years) in ET and 8.5 years (IQR: 2.4–19.5 years) in PV. The median age at sMF progression was 32 years (IQR: 27.4–40.6 years) for all patients, 33 years (IQR: 29–40.6 years) in ET and 27 years (IQR: 18.1–39.2) in PV.

Thus, our knowledge about circumstances of diagnosis, outcome and treatment is limited, especially for children and young adults. We therefore performed a systematic review of cases, published since 2005, concerning patients aged below 20 years at the time of diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera. We identified 396 cases of essential thrombocythemia and 75 of polycythemia vera. The median age at diagnosis was 9.3 and 12 years, respectively, and females constituted 57.6% and 45% of the groups, respectively. Half of the patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis. The proportion of so-called triple negativity was high: 57% in essential thrombocythemia and 73% in polycythemia vera. The incidence of thrombosis during the follow-up was 9.3% in patients with polycythemia vera and less, 3.8%, in those with essential thrombocythemia. Venous events were predominant (84.2%), with hemorrhagic episodes being rarer (< 5%). The risk of evolution also seemed low (2% to myelofibrosis and no reports of acute leukemia), but the median follow-up was only 50 months. Survival curves were not available. Half of the patients received an antithrombotic drug and 40.5% received a cytoreductive drug. All data should be analyzed with care because of the proportion of missing data (10.7% to 74.7%). This review highlights interesting points concerning this population of young patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, including that such patients were identified as negative for all common driver mutations, but also shows the need for larger contemporary cohorts with longer follow-up to assess the true prognosis of these patients.

### Thrombosis with erythropoietic stimulating agents-does iron-deficient erythropoiesis play a role? [^117Npo84]. Seminars in Dialysis (2008). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is common in iron deficiency and resolves following iron repletion. Increased platelet number, whether from iron deficiency or from other causes, may increase the risk of thrombovascular events. One mechanism thought to mediate iron deficiency-induced thrombocytosis is increased erythropoietin production. Similarly, erythropoietic stimulating agents (ESA) have long been known to increase platelet number and frequently lead to functional or absolute iron deficiency. This state of relative or absolute iron deficiency may be the mechanism whereby ESA increase the platelet count. If correct, co-administration of iron should prevent or diminish ESA-driven thrombocytosis. Data from the DRIVE trial in hemodialysis patients do, in fact, suggest that this is the case. Platelet counts in patients receiving IV iron decreased, while they remained unchanged in patients not given iron (mean change -29,000/microl vs. -0/microl; p = 0.017). Other supporting data have been observed in IV iron trials in oncology patients. The harm from higher hemoglobin targets and higher ESA doses may be mediated in part through induction of iron deficiency and thrombocytosis. The major anemia trials of ESAs have not reported platelet data, but should examine the relationship of platelet count, iron deficiency, IV iron administration, and cardiovascular events in greater detail.

### Outcomes of allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation for myelofibrosis in children and adolescents: the retrospective study of the EBMT paediatric diseases WP [^112s6yZ8]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In contrast to the adult population, the classical BCR::ABL1 -negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (BCR::ABL1 -neg MPNs), i.e. polycythaemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythaemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are very rare in the paediatric population with an incidence approximately 100×lower than in adults.

The discovery of three driver mutated genes JAK2, CALR and MPL was a major landmark in the understanding of BCR::ABL1 -neg MPNs. These three mutations are detected in more than 80% of adult patients and correlate with clinical characteristics, disease-related complications as well as with prognosis and therefore are helpful in treatment stratification. However, in children the mentioned driver mutations occur in less than 50% of them, posing a significant diagnostic challenge given the lack of an objective clonal marker. In addition, the thrombocytosis and erythrocytosis not related to clonal myeloproliferation are observed much more frequently in the paediatric population than in adults. Apart from this, in children the normal range of haemoglobin level, haematocrit value and erythrocytes number depend on the child's age. Thus, in children and adolescents the utility of the WHO diagnostic criteria of ET, PV, and PMF is limited. Therefore, in the majority of paediatric patients the diagnosis of BCR::ABL1 -neg MPN is still difficult.

As a consequence of the above mentioned factors, the opportunities to perform prospective clinical trials concerning BCR::ABL1 -neg MPNs are severely limited in the paediatric population, and in contrast to adults, there is still a lack of established prognostic criteria and treatment recommendations based on these criteria, including specific recommendations for allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in paediatric patients suffering from BCR::ABL1 -neg MPNs.

In adults PMF and post-ET/PV myelofibrosis (post-ET/PV MF) are BCR::ABL1 -neg MPNs with the worst survival rates, but allo-HCT can cure a substantial number of patients, especially those younger than 70 years and with a median survival expectation of less than 5 years.

In children and adolescents myelofibrosis (MF) is the rarest type of BCR::ABL1 -neg MPNs, and so far there was no study analysing the outcomes of allo-HCT in a larger group of paediatric patients with MF, and therefore the data on allo-HCT outcomes in them remain casuistic and scant.

The peripheral blood smear shows morphological abnormalities typically described in hyposplenism (e.g. Howell‐Jolly bodies, Heinz bodies, spiculated cells, target cells) (Hematoxylin–eosin ×100). (B) Bone marrow biopsy. The bone marrow biopsy shows normal cellularity for the age, normal myelo‐erythroid ratio and maturation; megakaryocytes are scattered and without the typical cytologic modifications of myeloproliferative neoplasms (Hematoxylin–eosin, ×20) [Color figure can be viewed at]

During the assessment of a new‐onset thrombocytosis, it is of the upmost importance to distinguish secondary (or reactive) thrombocytosis from true hematological diseases. First of all, for practical purposes, we searched for causes of secondary thrombocytosis. The most common causes of reactive thrombocytosis are iron deficiency, inflammation, infection, hemolysis, and other causes that trigger an acute‐phase response (Table 1). Thus, we performed serum tests to check for the iron status (iron, transferrin, and ferritin) and for an acute‐phase reaction (CRP, ESR): all of them were normal. A normal LDH serum level, together with a normal hemoglobin concentration and reticulocyte count, excluded hemolytic processes. Despite the absence of symptoms and signs of an underlying infection, we performed a chest radiograph that ruled out a pulmonary infection, and an abdominal ultrasound that revealed no signs of abdominal infection and reported a poorly assessable spleen. The most common mutations associated with myeloid neoplasms (BCR‐ABL rearrangement for chronic myeloid leukemia and JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations for Philadelphia‐negative myeloproliferative neoplasms) were not found.

### Distinct molecular abnormalities underlie unique clinical features of essential thrombocythemia in children [^114qonGE]. Leukemia (2016). Low credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is rare in children, with an annual incidence of ~100-fold lower than that in adults. The rarity of the disease in children makes the clinical course and pathogenesis of childhood ET far less clear. It is reported that clonal markers are much less common in children with ET (25.8%) than that in adult cases (80–90%). Except for JAK2 V617F, and MPL and calreticulin (CALR) mutations, no other mutations have yet been reported in childhood ET. More molecular markers are needed to distinguish clonal from reactive thrombocytosis in children. The present study investigated the JAK2 V617F, and MPL and CALR mutations in a large cohort of children with ET. We conducted the first study to analyze the molecular profiles by targeted next-generation sequencing and to investigate the JAK2 46/1 haplotype in childhood ET.

### Use of pegylated interferon in young patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia [^111vJqzt]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are rare disorders in young patients, and because of this, standardized treatment recommendations are not available. Pediatric patients are more frequently treated with hydroxyurea than interferon, yet there are no data suggesting this is the best practice. Current treatment guidelines for adults suggest using interferon as upfront therapy in young patients. We reviewed the cases of 13 young patients with polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia, who were treated with interferon. Extreme thrombocytosis was well controlled and the medication was tolerated by many. Our work shows the need for prospective studies evaluating interferon in our youngest patients with MPN.

1 CASE PRESENTATION

We herein report on a 26‐year‐old Caucasian female who was referred to our outpatient clinic with a history of abnormal blood count, including thrombocytosis and monocytosis known for the last 7 years. No family history of hematological disorders was reported. Her past medical history was significant for a papillary thyroid carcinoma that was treated with surgery and radioiodine therapy, obtaining a complete remission; the patient is currently taking levothyroxine. Her physical exam was normal and no signs and/or symptoms of infection were noticed.

Thrombocytosis, defined as a platelet count > 450 × 10⁹/L, is a common finding in routine blood tests and a common cause of referral to hematologists for further investigation. Causes of thrombocytosis can be grouped into primary, secondary, and spurious (Table 1). To find out the etiology of the thrombocytosis, the clinical hematologist should take into consideration data from familial and medical history, physical examination, results of hematological exams, clonal genetic abnormalities and bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy for morphological features, flow cytometric data, and cytogenetic and molecular markers of clonality.

TABLE 1
Causes of thrombocytosis

During the visit, we performed additional blood tests. A complete blood count revealed the following values: Hemoglobin 150 g/L, hematocrit 42.8%, mean cell volume 88 fL, white blood cell count 10.23 × 10⁹/L, and platelet count 582 × 10⁹/L. Differential white blood cell count revealed a normal absolute neutrophil count and a slightly increased number of monocytes (1.2 × 10⁹/L). Morphological examination of peripheral blood smear confirmed the higher‐than‐normal platelet count with no significant platelet clumping and also showed several target cells, acanthocytes, and Howell‐Jolly bodies within red blood cells (Figure 1 A). C‐reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) results within the normal range. Serum levels of iron, transferrin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation were normal. Serum level of lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) was within the normal range. A chest X‐ray revealed no abnormalities attributable to pulmonary infection. Abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of infection and reported limited visualization of the spleen. The BCR‐ABL rearrangement was absent in peripheral blood. No mutations of JAK2, CALR, and MPL genes were found in DNA from peripheral blood granulocytes.

### Impact of treatment for adolescent and young adults with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera [^111ynaPD]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Unexpectedly, conventional risk scores, such as the ELN risk score, failed to predict thrombosis in our AYA cohort. Elevated WBC count (> 11 × 10⁹/L) emerged as an independent risk factor for thrombotic events (HR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.2–6.0, p = 0.012) in multivariate analysis, consistent with findings in older patient cohorts. In contrast, splenomegaly demonstrated a protective effect in terms of thrombotic risk in multivariate analysis (HR: 0.2, 95% CI: 0.1–0.8, p = 0.026), contrary to previous publications. Our study demonstrated a statistical association between splenomegaly and a reduced risk of thrombotic events. However, this study was not designed to establish causality, and we can speculate that this association reflects the influence of external factors rather than a direct causal relationship. For instance, splenomegaly was more frequently observed in patients with splanchnic thrombosis (42%) compared to those without splanchnic thrombosis (16%) (p = 0.004), which may indicate portal hypertension rather than myeloproliferative neoplasms is responsible for the splenomegaly. Additionally, patients with a history of splanchnic thrombosis are typically on long-term anticoagulation therapy, unlike others, which could partly explain the observed difference in thrombotic risk among patients with splenomegaly. Unfortunately, the data from our study cannot directly address this question. While a JAK2 mutation showed an association with increased thrombotic risk in univariate analysis (HR:2.3, 95% CI: 1.2–4.8, p = 0.026), it was no longer significant in multivariate analysis. The impact of the presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation has been well established in ET as a thrombotic risk factor. However, the allele burden is also a risk factor, and its implication could not be evaluated in this study due to incomplete data from our cohort. Moreover, the allele frequency of the JAK2 V617 mutation in our cohort is lower than the data reported in the literature for older patients, particularly for those with PV, which could provide insight into the similar thrombotic risk between ET and PV patients. The absence of a correlation between previous thrombosis history and CVRF within our cohort of AYA patients diverges from the typical risk factors identified in their older counterparts. We hypothesize that these differences can have distinct reasons. Firstly, in our AYA cohort, thrombotic events in unusual sites — such as Budd-Chiari Syndrome or other splanchnic vein thrombosis, cerebral vein thrombosis — constitute the majority (53.5%) of thrombotic occurrences at the time of diagnosis. This starkly contrasts with their relative rarity in older patient populations, suggesting unique pathophysiological mechanisms in AYA patients. Specifically, interactions between activated blood cells and the splanchnic endothelial environment appear to be unique to splanchnic vein thrombosis in this age group. Secondly, CVRF, often associated with atherosclerotic plaques as a common cause of thrombotic events, have a distinct profile in AYA patients. In our cohort, the prevalence of CVRF was notably low (13.5%) and consisted mainly of active tobacco use. Given that atherosclerosis typically necessitates decades to manifest as a chronic disease, it is not surprising that CVRF are not predictive of thrombotic events within the relatively short timeframe of AYA patient observations. This underscores the imperative for a nuanced understanding of thrombotic risk factors tailored to different age groups.

### Isolated congenital asplenia: an overlooked cause of thrombocytosis [^1166mbw3]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

After exclusion of all causes of reactive thrombocytosis, a new platelet count should be repeated to confirm the persistence of unexplained thrombocytosis. Thus, investigations to search for hematological disorders should be performed. Molecular markers for the most common myeloid neoplasms associated with thrombocytosis can be searched on peripheral blood: BCR‐ABL rearrangement for chronic myeloid leukemia and JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations for Philadelphia‐negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. Subsequently, according to the clinical suspicion, a bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy, together with cytogenetic and other molecular analysis (including a myeloid next‐generation sequencing panel), should be carried out. Bone marrow biopsy is particularly useful to exclude triple‐negative myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Hyposplenism, defined as an abnormally low rate of activity of the spleen, is one of the most overlooked causes of thrombocytosis. Irrespective of the underlying cause, hyposplenism is suggested by typical morphological abnormalities of circulating red blood cells, including acanthocytes, spiculated spherocytes, stomatocytes, target cells, pitted erythrocytes, and Howell‐Jolly bodies. Pitted red cells are erythrocytes whose membrane appears to contain the so‐called "pits". It has been shown by electron microscopy that these "pits" are large vacuoles attached to or beneath the plasma membrane. Within these vacuoles, there is waste material (e.g. ferritin, hemoglobin, and residual material of mitochondria and membranes) that confers a low optical density. Normal splenic function is characterized by pitted red cells less than 4% of total erythrocytes. A pitted erythrocyte count > 4% has been suggested as the gold standard for a diagnosis of hyposplenism. Howell‐Jolly bodies that consist of basophilic DNA remnants within erythrocytes, also strongly support a diagnosis of hyposplenism if elevated, but are considered a less sensitive morphological feature than pitted red cells. Finally, radio‐isotopic methods (e.g. 99mTc‐labeled heat‐altered autologous erythrocyte scintigraphy) allow a splenic morpho‐functional assessment by studying the uptake and clearance of an injected radiolabeled tracer. However, given their high costs, their use in clinical practice is limited. This underlies the remarkable importance of morphological examination of peripheral blood smear when assessing a patient with a new‐onset thrombocytosis. New MRI techniques have increased the detection of splenic diseases so that, nowadays, MRI is an excellent tool for diagnosis and characterization of both focal and diffuse splenic abnormalities.

### Thrombocytosis and megakaryocyte changes associated with PRCA [^113JDcwD]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Next, the mean erythropoietin (EPO) levels in patients with thrombocytosis were examined. Of the 7 patients who had EPO levels drawn at the time of diagnosis, all had levels well over the upper limit of normal (26 mU/mL), 2476.5 ± 2784.7 mU/mL (range, 72.4–10 815).

In this study, we provide a detailed characterization of a cohort of patients with PRCA exhibiting notable alterations in megakaryocytes. Our cohort was heterogenous and the etiology of each patient's PRCA was different. Therefore, there may not be 1 mechanism by which PRCA is linked to thrombocytosis. However, we theorize that there are 2 potential mechanisms that may explain the phenomenon in some cases.

We first hypothesized that the scarcity of erythroid production may redirect hematopoietic precursors toward the megakaryocytic lineage. The process of hematopoiesis, encompassing both erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages arising from bipotential megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor (MEP), is well-documented. We suggest that the interruption of erythroid differentiation at a critical stage may funnel differentiation toward the megakaryocytic lineage (Figure 1, I). Our findings lend support to this hypothesis, as the initial thrombocytosis observed before treatment resolves upon PRCA resolution with treatment.

### Real-world study of children and young adults with myeloproliferative neoplasms: identifying risks and unmet needs [^111BqbRx]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

A history of bleeding was found in 5.8% and new events in 9.5% of ET or PV cases (Table 2), which is lower than numbers observed in adults with ET or PV (12.5% and 15.3%, respectively). Here again, the cohort logistical regression model revealed that hyperviscosity symptoms (P = 0.015), splenomegaly (P = 0.026), bleeding history (P = 0.000), and platelet count > 1500 g/L (P = 0.034) were significant. Specifically for ET patients, hyperviscosity (P = 0.002), bleeding history (P < .001), platelet count > 1500 g/L (P = 0.002), and age < 20 years (P = 0.002) were all identified in the logistic regression model. Again, these are important findings and would support control of thrombocytosis even in young patients to reduce bleeding risk.

Myelofibrotic evolution was observed in 7.3% of ET and 8.8% of PV patients, respectively, comparable to the incidence observed in adults. This is in contrast with our previous review of the literature in young patients reporting low incidences of 1.8% and 2.7%, respectively. As > 45% of events have been observed > 10 years after diagnosis, the long follow-up of our cohort may explain these higher numbers, or perhaps better case ascertainment. An important difference with previous studies is that our cohort of patients has been collected from adult and not from pediatric centers, therefore allowing longer follow-up and appearance of those late transformation events. Secondary transformations to PV have been also observed in 5.8% of JAK2 -mutated ET cases. Finally, transformations to AP/AML were anecdotal, despite the same long follow-up (Table 2). Here, logistical regression identified potential important new risks, including palpable splenomegaly, cardiovascular risk factors for ET patients; thrombosis history and age < 20 years for PV. Despite those high rates of complications, there was an excellent overall survival in this population, especially for ET and PV patients (Figure 3F). Adolescents and young adults have been previously identified to have better 5-year and 10-year survival rates than older patients.

### The relationship between the systemic immune inflammation index and the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in American adolescents [^11565FtV]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

SII is reminiscent of the interaction of thrombocytosis, inflammation, and immunity. Song et al. indicated that SII could be used as a simple and affordable way to identify hepatic steatosis because there was a positive relationship between SII and hepatic steatosis. The pathological progression of NAFLD follows three steps including steatosis, lipotoxicity, and inflammation. In our study, we found that the patients with high SII had a high risk of NAFLD. SII, secreted by lymphocytes and central granulocytes, leads to NAFLD through the release of inflammatory factors such as Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), Interleukin 2(IL-2), Interleukin 2 (IL-6), Interleukin 1 (IL-1), etc. These inflammatory factors can trigger the generation of oxidative stress, disrupting the cellular redox balance and producing excessive reactive oxygen species, such as free radicals. Excessive oxidative stress can damage cell membranes, proteins, and nucleic acids, leading to cell injury and death. This cell damage, in turn, can provoke more inflammatory reactions, forming a vicious cycle and causing changes in liver cell function. In our study, there was a linear relationship between the SII and the NAFLD. The result was not consistent with the Zhao et al. Their research showed that the relationship between the SII and the risk of NAFLD was U-shaped. There was a difference in the definition of NAFLD. NAFLD was defined using the US fatty liver index (FLI) in their study, while we used the CAP to diagnose the NAFLD. In addition, our study population was adolescents, while their study population was adults. In the study of Xie et al. the CAP was used to diagnose hepatic steatosis and they found that there was an inverted U-shaped relationship between SII and CAP. This difference is likely due to dietary differences in adolescentss and adults, particularly sugar intake. Pediatric/adolescents consume more sugar compared to adults. Studies have shown that excessive sugar intake can lead to increased subclinical inflammation and is positively correlated with certain inflammatory markers. For example, fructose-induced liver fat accumulation involves stress pathways, leading to increased gluconeogenesis, fat synthesis, and reduced fat oxidation. Additionally, long-term fructose exposure in the gut can trigger inflammation by increasing serum TNF-α levels, thereby affecting the gut-liver axis and influencing the development of NAFLD.

### Bleeding and bruising: a diagnostic work-up… [^111rUeTD]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

The PFA-100 simulates the formation of the platelet plug in vivo by passing the patient's blood through an aperture coated with collagen/epinephrine and collagen/adenosine diphosphate. In patients with von Willebrand's disease and other platelet function disorders, the amount of time required for the platelets to aggregate from both collagen/epinephrine and collagen/adenosine diphosphate is prolonged. A prolonged time to clot to just collagen/epinephrine usually indicates a drug effect, such as from aspirin. MIXING STUDIES AND INHIBITOR AND FACTOR ASSAYS A mixing study determines if the patient has a clotting factor deficiency or an inhibitor to a factor. When one part of the patient's blood is mixed with one part of normal blood, the inhibitor in the patient's blood disables the factor in the normal blood. The PTT stays prolonged and does not "correct. " Inhibitor assays are then performed to identify which inhibitor is present.

When the blood from a patient with a factor VIII deficiency is mixed with normal blood, the PTT should normalize or correct. Factor assays are then performed to identify which factor is deficient. RESOLUTION OF CASE STUDIES Case One. Laboratory testing included a normal blood count and platelet count. A PFA-100 test was abnormal to collagen/epinephrine and collagen/adenosine diphosphate. Further testing was diagnostic for von Willebrand's disease. Case Two. A complete blood count, PT, PTT, and PFA-100 were normal. The patient was reassured that with a low bleeding score, a negative family history, and an unremarkable physical examination, she most likely has purpura simplex. She was told to follow up if her symptoms got worse or if she had any new symptoms. Case Three. Laboratory evaluation included a hemoglobin count of 7 g per dL, a platelet count of 400 × 10³ per μL, a PT of 12 seconds, and a PTT of 100 seconds.

A mixing study did not return the PTT to normal. Measurement of factor VIII showed a level of 1 percent, and an assay for the presence of a factor VIII inhibitor showed a high-titer inhibitor.

Thrombosis

During the follow-up 44 patients presented 57 thrombotic events (venous: 40 (70%), arterial: 17 (30%)); 42 in ET (venous: 31 (74%), arterial: 11 (26%)); and 15 in PV (venous: 9 (60%), arterial: 6 (40%)). The risk of a thrombotic event was 1.9 per 100 patients-years for the whole cohort, 1.8 per 100 patient-years for ET and 2.0 per 100 patient-years for PV. Ten and 20-year probability of TFS was 86.8% (95% CI: 82.4–91.2%) and 78.8% (95% CI: 71.5–85.9%) for the entire cohort, 86.9% (95% CI: 81.9–91.9%) and 80.0% (95% CI: 71.8–88.2%) for ET and 84.4% (95% CI: 77.2–95.6%) and 76.3% (95% CI: 62.5–90.1%) for PV. There was no significant difference between ET and PV (p = 0.790). The median age at the first thrombotic event was 26 years (IQR: 23.2–29.5 years) in the entire cohort, 26 years (IQR: 13.9–28.8 years) in ET and 27 years (IQR: 22.8–30.4 years) in PV. Additionally, the median time from diagnosis to the first thrombotic event was 3.6 years (IQR: 2.2–8.7 years) in all patients, 4.0 years (2.2–8.2 years) in ET and 3.0 (IQR: 1.9–9.9 years) in PV. This time was shorter for patients with a previous history of thrombosis (median 3.0 years, IQR: 2.0–4.0 years) compared to those without a history of thrombosis (median 4.2 years, IQR: 2.1–9.4 years).

Then we investigated the impact of the ELN risk scores (for the entire cohort and ET and PV separately), and the IPSET-T score for ET. For the whole cohort, ET and PV ELN risk score was not prognostic of TFS. In the entire cohort, 10-year and 20-year TFS for low risk was 88.0% (95% CI: 83.6–92.4%) and 80.9% (95% CI: 73.9–87.9%) and for high-risk 77.8% (95% CI: 62.6–93%) and 77.8 (95% CI: 62.6–93.0%), p = 0.208 respectively. For ET, 10-year and 20-year TFS for low risk was 88.3% (95% CI: 83.3–93.3%) and 81.0% (95% CI: 72.4–89.6%) and for high-risk 73.2% (95% CI: 52.0–94.4%) and 73.2% (95% CI: 52.0–94.4%), p = 0.131. For PV, 10-years and 20-years TFS for low risk was 86.7% (95% CI: 76.3–97.1%) and 79.7% (95% CI: 66.3–93.1%) and for high-risk 84.6% (95% CI: 64.6–100%) and 84.6% (95% CI: 64.6–100%), p = 0.880. In contrast, IPSET-T score for ET was prognostic of TFS (p = 0.009); 10-year and 20-year TFS for low risk was 94.1% (95% CI: 89.3–98.9%) and 91.8 (95% CI: 85.4–98.2%), for intermediate 82.5% (95% CI: 73.3–91.7%) and 74.3% (95% CI: 56.5–92.1%) and for high-risk 77.1% (95% CI: 60.3–93.9%) and 65.3% (95% CI: 44.3–86.3%).

The pathogenic mechanisms of cytopenia in IEI are multifactorial. They are commonly attributed to cell‐mediated and humoral immune dysfunction or dysregulation, driving autoimmunity and autoinflammation. However, non‐immune causes should also be considered. B‐ and T‐cell responses have a complex interdependent relationship, primary defects resulting in altered maturation and regulation with subsequent decreased number and function. Haemophagocytosis is an important cause of cytopenia, particularly in the paediatric population, and may herald an underlying primary aetiology. Secondary factors such as splenic sequestration and bone‐marrow infiltration by malignancy or infection are non‐immune causes that should not be overlooked (Figure 1).,

FIGURE 1
Mechanisms contributing to cytopenia in inborn errors of immunity (IEI). (A) The pathogenic mechanisms of cytopenia are multifactorial and include: humoral and cell‐mediated immune dysfunction and/or dysregulation, haemophagocytosis, splenic sequestration (secondary to abnormal lymphoproliferation), bone‐marrow dysfunction including ineffective maturation, myelodysplasia, primary bone‐marrow failure and myelosuppression due to secondary infections and bone‐marrow infiltration.(B) Cytoskeletal dysfunction with megakaryocyte dysfunction, increased apoptosis and splenic platelet destruction. Contributory causes of non‐immune thrombocytopenia in IEI include: increased clearance and apoptosis; myelosuppression by infections, myelofibrosis/bone‐marrow malignancy, cytotoxic drugs or transplant are also contributory.(C) Defective myeloid cell differentiation or release of granulocytes from the bone marrow, enhanced apoptosis and increased destruction of peripheral‐blood granulocytes are the main physiological mechanisms underlying chronic severe or intermittent neutropenia in primary immunodeficiency patients.(D) Lymphopenia driven by B‐ and T‐cell‐intrinsic defect with abnormal maturation and defective function, negative selection of autoreactive T lymphocytes in the thymus as well as defects in the number or function of regulatory T‐cells, impaired apoptosis of autoreactive lymphocytes, loss or breakage of tolerance, increased lymphoid production and cytokine secretion which likely also drives the immune dysregulation and associated autoimmune cytopenia.

Essential thrombocythemia in the realm of myeloproliferative neoplasms

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) belongs to the group of BCR-ABL1 -negative myeloproliferative neoplasms, which also includes polycythemia vera and primary myelofibrosis. Myeloproliferative neoplasms are hematopoietic stem-cell disorders that are characterized by the presence of mutually exclusive driver mutations of the downstream kinase JAK2 (Janus kinase 2), the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone CALR (calreticulin) or the thrombopoietin receptor MPL (myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene), which are associated with constitutive activation of hematopoietic pathways. In ET, the most frequent mutation is JAK2 V617F (present in about 55% of cases), followed by CALR mutations (about 20%) and MPL mutations (about 4%); no known mutation is detected in about 20% of ET patients. Isolated thrombocytosis may be the first manifestation of polycythemia vera or primary myelofibrosis. It is indispensable to distinguish ET from pre-fibrotic primary myelofibrosis or other myeloid neoplasms, mostly by means of morphological examination of the bone marrow. Rare cases have been described of hereditary, familial thrombocythemia associated with germline mutations of JAK2, MPL or the thrombopoietin gene (THPO). Major criteria for a diagnosis of ET are: (i) platelet count > 450×10⁹/L, (ii) bone marrow megakaryocyte proliferation and loose clusters, (iii) not meeting World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for other myeloid neoplasms, and (iv) mutated JAK2/ CALR/MPL. Minor criteria include the presence of other clonal markers and no evidence of reactive thrombocytosis. All four major or three major plus one minor criteria are required to make the diagnosis.
