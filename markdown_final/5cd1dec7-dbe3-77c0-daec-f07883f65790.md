## Question

Maximum Tylenol daily dose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the maximum daily dose of Tylenol (acetaminophen). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard adult maximum and how it varies by formulation and route. Then, I should verify pediatric weight-based limits and the "not to exceed 4,000 mg" cap. Next, I will examine special populations and risk modifiers that warrant lower ceilings. After that, I need to check the rationale for more conservative limits in some guidelines. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-focused recommendation and confirm how to calculate total daily intake across all sources, including combination products.

> Let me first confirm the conventional adult maximum. The FDA labeling for acetaminophen injection states a maximum daily dose of 4,000 mg from all routes and all products, which is the canonical ceiling in U.S. practice for adults without special risk factors [^114mx156] [^1159vpjH]. Wait, let me verify whether oral products differ; multiple high-credibility sources align with 4,000 mg/day for adults, including VA/DoD headache guidelines and ADA dental pain guidance, reinforcing that 4,000 mg/day is the standard adult maximum when used short term in otherwise healthy adults [^117VZvpq] [^116XHBkT] [^113K1tY1].

> Hold on, I should verify formulation-specific variations. Some oral products, particularly extended-release or certain OTC brands, specify a lower labeled maximum, such as 3,250–3,900 mg/day, even though the FDA's overall pharmacologic maximum remains 4,000 mg/day; this is a labeling nuance, not a contradiction, and clinicians should still respect the product-specific cap while recognizing that 4,000 mg/day is the regulatory ceiling across sources [^117RaCZ5] [^114F4tFR] [^11537zHd] [^111dZcY4]. I need to ensure I'm not conflating these; yes, the product-specific lower limits are real, but they do not supersede the 4,000 mg/day cross-product maximum when multiple acetaminophen-containing items are used concurrently [^114mx156].

> Next, I should review pediatric dosing. For children, the standard is weight-based at 10–15 mg/kg per dose every 4–6 hours, with a maximum of 75 mg/kg/day, and importantly, not to exceed 4,000 mg/day regardless of weight; this cap applies to all routes and sources, including rectal and IV formulations, and is consistently reflected in pediatric dosing guidance and IV labeling [^11344m4G] [^112DMVSP] [^114mx156] [^1159vpjH]. Wait, I should double-check the IV specifics; yes, IV pediatric maxima of 75 mg/kg/day are specified, with some IV labels noting a 60 mg/kg/day ceiling in certain contexts, underscoring that route-specific labeling should be followed while honoring the 4,000 mg/day absolute cap [^114mx156].

> I will now examine special populations and risk modifiers. In older adults, particularly those aged 80 years or with frailty, many trauma and geriatric sources recommend a lower maximum of about 2,000–3,000 mg/day due to reduced clearance and increased hepatotoxic risk; similarly, patients with chronic liver disease, alcohol use disorder, chronic malnutrition, or severe renal impairment should generally stay below 4,000 mg/day, with many clinicians targeting 2,000–3,000 mg/day or less depending on severity and context [^116Ei6B4] [^111Wzope] [^113bQRHE]. Let me reconsider whether any guideline explicitly caps at 2,000 mg; yes, several high-credibility sources endorse 2,000–3,000 mg/day in these higher-risk groups, and some even advise avoidance when risk is substantial, which is a conservative but reasonable stance given case reports of toxicity at therapeutic doses in susceptible patients [^116Ei6B4] [^111Wzope] [^116LSGy8].

> But wait, what if the patient is using acetaminophen chronically or at the high end of the range? I should confirm the evidence for hepatotoxic risk even within labeled dosing. A randomized, controlled inpatient study showed that 4,000 mg/day for 14 days led to ALT elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal in 31–44% of healthy adults, with values returning toward normal after discontinuation; this supports using the lowest effective dose and reassessing the need for ongoing therapy, especially beyond a few days [^113iQpk4]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; these ALT changes were often asymptomatic and reversible, but they signal subclinical hepatocellular injury and justify caution with prolonged high-dose use or in those with risk factors [^113iQpk4].

> Next, I should review why some guidelines recommend more conservative maxima. Unintentional overdose is common due to multiple acetaminophen sources, and observational data link higher-dose tablet availability to increased poison center calls and supratherapeutic ingestions; this, coupled with modest analgesic benefit in some chronic pain conditions, underpins recommendations to cap routine adult dosing at 3,000–3,250 mg/day in many patients, reserving 4,000 mg/day for short-term use or carefully selected cases with close monitoring [^114mrgrs] [^111pTSfX] [^112vLMK9] [^111urGgB]. I should confirm that these are consensus positions rather than regulatory mandates; yes, they are guideline-level recommendations aimed at mitigating harm while preserving benefit [^112vLMK9] [^111urGgB].

> I need to ensure the practical calculation is explicit. Total daily acetaminophen exposure must include all routes and all products: oral, IV, rectal, prescription combinations, and OTC cold or pain products; exceeding 4,000 mg/day from all sources increases the risk of dose-dependent hepatotoxicity, and many cases of injury occur with cumulative supratherapeutic dosing rather than a single massive ingestion [^113bQRHE] [^114mx156] [^111xu8XH]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to pediatrics too; yes, the same principle holds, with the 75 mg/kg/day cap and the 4,000 mg/day absolute cap applied across all sources and routes [^114mx156] [^11344m4G].

> Let me synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer. For a typical healthy adult using acetaminophen short term, the maximum daily dose is 4,000 mg from all sources and routes, with many clinicians and guidelines preferring 3,000–3,250 mg/day for routine use or when risk factors are present; for children, the maximum is 75 mg/kg/day, never exceeding 4,000 mg/day, with weight-based dosing of 10–15 mg/kg per dose every 4–6 hours; for older adults or those with hepatic disease, alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, or severe renal impairment, a lower maximum of 2,000–3,000 mg/day is prudent, and some patients should avoid acetaminophen altogether depending on severity and alternatives [^114mx156] [^117VZvpq] [^116XHBkT] [^116Ei6B4] [^111Wzope] [^11344m4G] [^112DMVSP]. I should double-check that this aligns with both labeling and guidelines; yes, this synthesis reflects FDA labeling and major society guidance, balancing efficacy and safety with practical caveats for special populations and polypharmacy [^114mx156] [^117VZvpq] [^116XHBkT] [^116Ei6B4].

The maximum daily dose of Tylenol (acetaminophen) is **4,000 mg per day** for healthy adults, from all sources (oral, IV, rectal, and combination products) [^114mx156] [^1159vpjH]. For patients with liver disease, chronic alcohol use, or those at higher risk of hepatotoxicity, **limit total daily intake to 3,000 mg or less** [^111urGgB] [^112vLMK9]. For children, the maximum is **75 mg/kg/day**, not to exceed 4,000 mg/day [^11344m4G] [^112DMVSP]. Never exceed the labeled maximum, and always account for acetaminophen in combination products to avoid overdose [^113bQRHE].

---

## Maximum daily dose for adults

- **Standard maximum dose**: 4,000 mg per day (4 g/day) for healthy adults, from all routes and products [^114mx156] [^1159vpjH].
- **Conservative recommendation**: 3,000 mg/day for patients with liver disease, chronic alcohol use, or other hepatotoxic risk factors [^111urGgB] [^112vLMK9].
- **Single dose**: 650–1,000 mg every 4–6 hours, not exceeding 4,000 mg/day [^114mx156] [^1159vpjH].

---

## Maximum daily dose for children

- **Weight-based dosing**: 10–15 mg/kg per dose every 4–6 hours, not exceeding 75 mg/kg/day [^11344m4G] [^112DMVSP].
- **Absolute maximum**: 4,000 mg/day, regardless of weight [^11344m4G] [^112DMVSP].
- **Infants ≤ 1 year**: maximum 75 mg/kg/day [^114ucx7E] [^117RaCZ5].

---

## Factors influencing maximum dose adjustments

Several factors may necessitate **lower daily limits**:

| **Factor** | **Recommended maximum daily dose** |
|-|-|
| Liver disease (chronic or acute) | ≤ 3,000 mg/day |
| Chronic alcohol use | ≤ 2,000–3,000 mg/day |
| Malnutrition or fasting | ≤ 3,000 mg/day |
| Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) | ≤ 3,000 mg/day |
| Combination products (e.g. opioids, cold medications) | ≤ 3,000 mg/day |

---

## Risks associated with exceeding the maximum dose

Exceeding the maximum daily dose can cause **severe hepatotoxicity**, including acute liver failure, and may necessitate liver transplantation or result in death [^113bQRHE] [^115Y2yEc]. Unintentional overdose is common due to use of multiple acetaminophen-containing products [^1174Ri8s] [^111uj7P6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **VA/DoD guideline**: ≤ 3,000 mg/day for most patients; ≤ 2,000–3,000 mg/day for elderly or those with alcohol use; up to 4,000 mg/day only in select cases with close monitoring [^111urGgB].
- **AASLD**: Acetaminophen is a dose-dependent hepatotoxin; avoid exceeding 4,000 mg/day, especially with risk factors [^115Y2yEc] [^114svRWo].
- **ADA**: 4,000 mg/day maximum for dental pain; emphasize cumulative dose awareness [^116XHBkT] [^113K1tY1].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Acetaminophen is commonly used; follow standard adult dosing and avoid exceeding 4,000 mg/day [^notfound].
- **Chronic pain**: Use the lowest effective dose; consider ≤ 3,000 mg/day for long-term therapy [^111urGgB] [^112vLMK9].
- **Combination products**: Calculate total acetaminophen from all sources to avoid overdose [^113bQRHE] [^114mx156].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Healthy adults**: ≤ 4,000 mg/day.
- **High-risk patients**: ≤ 3,000 mg/day.
- **Children**: ≤ 75 mg/kg/day, not exceeding 4,000 mg/day.
- **Always consider total acetaminophen from all sources** to avoid overdose [^113bQRHE] [^114mx156].

---

The maximum daily dose of Tylenol is **4,000 mg for healthy adults**, with lower limits for children and high-risk patients; never exceed the labeled maximum, and account for all acetaminophen sources to prevent overdose [^114mx156] [^1159vpjH].

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse (see WARNINGS).

Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24–72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets and adjust the dosage accordingly (see WARNINGS).

Initial Dosage

Initiating Treatment with TYLENOL®with Codeine Tablets

Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of pain and response of the patient. However, it should be kept in mind that tolerance to codeine can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related. Adult doses of codeine higher than 60 mg are associated with an increased incidence of adverse reactions and are not associated with greater efficacy.

The usual adult dosage is:

TYLENOL®with Codeine Tablets (codeine 30 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg): Take 1 to 2 tablets every 4 hours as needed for pain.

TYLENOL®with Codeine Tablets (codeine 60 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg): Take one tablet every 4 hours as needed for pain.

The prescriber must determine the number of tablets per dose, and the maximum number of tablets per 24 hours, based upon the above dosage guidance. This information should be conveyed in the prescription.

Conversion from Other Opioids to TYLENOL®with Codeine Tablets

There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose.

Carcinogenesis

Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of the combination of codeine and acetaminophen have not been conducted.

Two-year carcinogenicity studies have been conducted in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in male and female rats, respectively, at dietary doses up to 70 and 80 mg/kg/day of codeine sulfate (approximately 2 times the maximum recommended daily dose of 360 mg/day for adults on a mg/m2basis) for two years. Similarly there was no evidence of carcinogenicity activity in male and female mice at dietary doses up to 400 mg/kg/day of codeine sulfate (approximately 5 times the maximum recommended daily dose of 360 mg/day for adults on a mg/m2basis) for two years.

Long-term studies in mice and rats have been completed by the National Toxicology Program to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of acetaminophen. In 2-year feeding studies, F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were fed a diet containing acetaminophen up to 6000 ppm. Female rats demonstrated equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity based on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia at 0.8 times the maximum human daily dose (MHDD) of 4 grams/day, based on a body surface area comparison. In contrast, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in male rats that received up to 0.7 times or mice at up to 1.2–1.4 times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison.

Mutagenesis

Codeine sulfate was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay or clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosome aberration assay.

In the published literature, acetaminophen has been reported to be clastogenic when administered at 1500 mg/kg/day to the rat model (3.6-times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison). In contrast, no clastogenicity was noted at a dose of 750 mg/kg/day (1.8-times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison), suggesting a threshold effect.

### Emergency department patient knowledge concerning acetaminophen (paracetamol) in over-the-counter and prescription analgesics [^1174Ri8s]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to evaluate patient knowledge of the acetaminophen (paracetamol) content of commonly used pain medications and the maximum daily recommended dose of acetaminophen.

Methods

A prospective, convenience sample of emergency department patients were enrolled. Data were recorded using a standardised questionnaire over 4 months.

Results

1009 patients were enrolled. 492 patients (49%) did not know if Tylenol contained acetaminophen (paracetamol). The majority (66–90%) of patients did not know if Lortab, Vicodin, Percocet, non-aspirin pain reliever, ibuprofen, Motrin, or Advil contained acetaminophen. 568 patients (56%) reported not knowing the maximum daily dose of acetaminophen and only 71 patients (7%) reported the correct daily dose.

Conclusions

Patient knowledge of the acetaminophen content of commonly used analgesic medications and its maximum recommended daily dose is limited. This may contribute to unintentional repeated supratherapeutic ingestion (RSTI) of acetaminophen, or overdose.

Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Individually titrate TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse (see WARNINGS). Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.

If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

Discontinuation of TYLENOL®with Codeine

When a patient who has been taking TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets in a physically-dependent patient (see WARNINGS, DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).

### Developing consumer-centered, nonprescription drug labeling a study in acetaminophen [^111uj7P6]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In the U.S., acetaminophen overdose has surpassed viral hepatitis as the leading cause of acute liver failure, and misuse contributes to more than 30,000 hospitalizations annually. Half to two thirds of acetaminophen overdoses are unintentional, suggesting the root cause is likely poor understanding of medication labeling or failure to recognize the consequences of exceeding the recommended maximum daily dosage.

Purpose

Elicit subject feedback about active ingredient and dosing information on over-the-counter (OTC) acetaminophen and elicit feedback on proposed plain-language text and icons.

Methods

Six focus groups, preceded by individual interviews, were conducted in April 2010 among 45 adults in two cities from two clinics and an adult basic education center. The individual interviews evaluated knowledge of OTC pain relievers, attention to product label information and literacy level while the group discussion elicited preference for label messages and icons. Analyses were conducted from April to June 2010.

Results

Forty-four percent read at or below the 6th-grade level. Individual interviews revealed that < 50% of participants routinely examine product label information. Only 31% know acetaminophen is in Tylenol®. The groups achieved consensus on a preferred icon for acetaminophen, desired explicit statement of potential liver damage in the warning against simultaneous use of acetaminophen products, and indicated preference for an icon and wording for maximum dose.

Conclusions

With the high prevalence of OTC use, a consumer-centered approach to developing icons and messages to promote awareness and safe use of acetaminophen could benefit consumers.

### Are recommended doses of acetaminophen effective for children aged 2 to 3 years? A pharmacokinetic modeling answer [^116S3KrS]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Acetaminophen (APAP) elixir is a widely used pediatric antipyretic medication. It has been shown that up to 30% of febrile children presenting to a large urban pediatric emergency department received inadequate APAP dosages at home with errors primarily due to age-based dosing. Parental education material in the form of weight-based dosing guides has been proposed; however, validation of current recommended APAP dosages using pharmacokinetic models is needed. This study used a mathematical model of APAP absorption to predict plasma concentrations and to compare them with the range required to reach and achieve antipyresis (10–20 μg/mL).

Methods

A common APAP preparation (Children's Tylenol Elixir) was tested (children aged 2–3 years, 10.9–15.9 kg). The manufacturer's suggested dose of 160 mg was compared with the standard 10 to 15 mg/kg dose range.

Results

The model predicts a peak plasma concentration between 6.38 and 8.55 μg/mL for 10 mg/kg dose and 9.57 and 12.8 μg/mL for 15 mg/kg dose. The manufacturer's suggested dose of 160 mg was tested across the limits of the weight range (10.9–15.9 kg). A peak plasma concentration between 9.36 and 12.6 μg/mL was found for the lower weight limit (10.9 kg child) and 6.42 to 8.61 μg/mL for the upper weight limit (15.9 kg child).

Conclusions

With the use of this model, the 10 mg/kg dose does not reach the plasma concentration value for antipyresis (10–20 μg/mL), whereas 15 mg/kg is adequate only if assuming a greater absorption constant. The 160 mg dose is effective only for children weighing 10.9 kg. Individual differences in drug bioavailability, volume of distribution, and absorption/elimination constants undoubtedly exist, and future studies directly measuring plasma APAP concentration and pharmacokinetics are needed. However, these results indicate that dosages for APAP in children should be weight based and manufacturers should review their dosing recommendations.

### Acetaminophen for osteoarthritis [^1176HSdV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. Published guidelines and expert opinion are divided over the relative role of acetaminophen (also called paracetamol or Tylenol) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as first-line pharmacologic therapy. The comparative safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs is also important to consider. This update to the original 2003 review includes nine additional RCTs.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen versus placebo and versus NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac, arthrotec, celecoxib, naproxen, rofecoxib) for treating OA.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE (up to July 2005), EMBASE (2002-July 2005), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ACP Journal Club, DARE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (all from 1994 to July 2005). Reference lists of identified RCTs and pertinent review articles were also hand searched.

Selection Criteria

Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen alone in OA were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pain, physical function and global assessment outcomes were reported. Results for continuous outcome measures were expressed as standardized mean differences (SMD). Dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using relative risk (RR) and the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated.

Main Results

Fifteen RCTs involving 5986 participants were included in this review. Seven RCTs compared acetaminophen to placebo and ten RCTs compared acetaminophen to NSAIDs. In the placebo-controlled RCTs, acetaminophen was superior to placebo in five of the seven RCTs and had a similar safety profile. Compared to placebo, a pooled analysis of five trials of overall pain using multiple methods demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in pain (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.04), which is of questionable clinical significance. The relative percent improvement from baseline was 5% with an absolute change of 4 points on a 0 to 100 scale. The NNT to achieve an improvement in pain ranged from 4 to 16. In the comparator-controlled RCTs, acetaminophen was less effective overall than NSAIDs in terms of pain reduction, global assessments and in terms of improvements in functional status. No significant difference was found overall between the safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs, although patients taking traditional NSAIDS were more likely to experience an adverse GI event (RR 1.47, (95% CI 1.08 to 2.00). 19% of patients in the traditional NSAID group versus 13% in the acetaminophen group experienced an adverse GI event. However, the median trial duration was only 6 weeks and it is difficult to assess adverse outcomes in a relatively short time period.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence to date suggests that NSAIDs are superior to acetaminophen for improving knee and hip pain in people with OA. The size of the treatment effect was modest, and the median trial duration was only six weeks, therefore, additional considerations need to be factored in when making the decision between using acetaminophen or NSAIDs. In OA subjects with moderate-to-severe levels of pain, NSAIDs appear to be more effective than acetaminophen.

### Opioid stewardship after emergency laparoscopic general surgery [^114DUFBy]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Outcomes of interest

The outcomes of interest were quantity and timing of administration of narcotic and non-narcotic analgesia provided postoperatively on the ward, the associated pain scores while in hospital, and the type and dosing of analgesia provided in the discharge prescription. All opioid doses were converted to OME to facilitate comparisons. Patients were categorized into one of four patterns based on their needs while in hospital: (1) opioid and non-opioid analgesia — defined as those who received both opioid and non-opioid analgesia, this included combination opioids, consisting of a single tablet containing both opioid and non-opioid medication, specifically Percocet (acetaminophen 325 mg/oxycodone 5 mg); (2) opioid-only analgesia, defined as those who received only opioids while in hospital; (3) non-opioid analgesia only; (4) no analgesia at all.

In regard to standard practices at the time of study, there was no standardized pain management guideline or pathway in hospital or for discharge prescriptions. Pain management was determined by a physician assistant and surgical residents. They were supervised by 12 faculty attendings. Patients did not routinely receive intraoperative nerve blocks, nor intravenous Toradol or acetaminophen. There are no electronic health order sets or prescription templates for prescribing. Prescribed opioids included hydromorphone, morphine, Percocet, oxycodone, and Tylenol #3.

Patient demographic information (age, gender, diagnosis, history of opioid abuse and comorbidities) was recorded for all eligible patients, as was the postoperative LOS from arrival on the surgical ward to discharge from hospital in hours, the timing of analgesic medication administration, the last documented numerical pain score (scale of 1–10) within 12 hours of discharge, and the discharge prescription. The discharge prescription daily dosing was calculated as the maximum as-needed dosing available as specified in the prescription.

Because the average LOS on the postoperative ward was less than 24 hours, opioid dosing was calculated hourly according to the formula: Hourly dosing = (total dose)/(hours on ward). To facilitate comparisons this value was then extrapolated to the 24 hours' dosing.

### A randomized controlled trial comparing acetaminophen plus ibuprofen versus acetaminophen plus codeine plus caffeine after outpatient general surgery [^111jKXrv]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Narcotics are used extensively in outpatient general surgery but are often poorly tolerated with variable efficacy. Acetaminophen combined with NSAIDs is a possible alternative. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of acetaminophen, codeine, and caffeine (Tylenol No. 3) with acetaminophen and ibuprofen for management of pain after outpatient general surgery procedures.

Study Design

A double-blind randomized controlled trial was performed in patients undergoing outpatient inguinal/umbilical/ventral hernia repair or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients were randomized to receive acetaminophen plus codeine plus caffeine (Tylenol No. 3) or acetaminophen plus ibuprofen (AcIBU) 4 times daily for 7 days or until pain-free. Pain intensity, measured four times daily by visual analogue scale, was the primary outcome. Secondary end points included incidence of side effects, patient satisfaction, number of days until patient was pain-free, and use of alternative analgesia.

Results

One hundred forty-six patients were randomized (74 Tylenol No. 3 and 72 AcIBU), and 139 (95%) patients completed the study. No significant differences in mean or maximum daily visual analogue scale scores were identified between the 2 groups, except on postoperative day 2, when pain was improved in AcIBU patients (p = 0.025). During the entire week, mean visual analogue scale score was modestly lower in AcIBU patients (p = 0.018). More patients in the AcIBU group, compared with Tylenol No. 3, were satisfied with their analgesia (83% versus 64%, respectively; p = 0.02). There were more side effects with Tylenol No. 3 (57% versus 41%, p = 0.045), and the discontinuation rate was also higher in Tylenol No. 3-treated patients (11% versus 3%, p = 0.044).

Conclusions

When compared with Tylenol No. 3, AcIBU was not an inferior analgesic and was associated with fewer side effects and higher patient satisfaction. AcIBU is an effective, low-cost, and safe alternative to codeine-based narcotic analgesia for outpatient general surgery procedures.

### The FDA acetaminophen advisory committee meeting-what is the future of acetaminophen in the United States? The perspective of a committee member [^113kHyvB]. Clinical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Unintentional acetaminophen toxicity is a common problem throughout the world but particularly in the more developed countries. To deal with the problem, several countries have attempted to decrease the risk of acetaminophen overdose by reducing package sizes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) convened a joint meeting recently of three Advisory Committees to consider the issue of unintentional acetaminophen-related toxicity and to explore strategies to address the problem.

Proposals and Recommendations

Three strategies addressed the issue of dose reduction as a way to decrease morbidity and mortality. The FDA proposed a decrease in the maximum daily dose from 4,000 to 3,250 mg, reducing the maximum individual dose from 1,000 to 650 mg and relegating 500 mg tablets to prescription status. The Committees voted in favor of each of those initiatives. Restricting the number of doses that could be purchased by regulating package sizes, as has been done in some European countries, was proposed, but rejected by the Committees. Proposals also addressed the elimination of nonprescription and prescription acetaminophen combination products (e.g., multi-symptom cold relief combinations and acetaminophen/opioid combinations) as a strategy to decrease unintentional poisoning when individuals unknowingly take different products, all of which contain acetaminophen. The Committees rejected the proposal to eliminate the nonprescription combinations but recommended the elimination of prescription combination products. Currently, liquid acetaminophen is available in the United States in three different concentrations. To reduce the confusion associated with the variance in concentrations the Committees voted to have a single concentration for all acetaminophen liquid products. Finally, the Committees voted, almost unanimously, to encourage the FDA to place a boxed warning in the product information to create awareness among prescribers and pharmacists about acetaminophen toxicity and to educate their patients accordingly.

Conclusions

Many of the recommendations were not evidence-based but instead have an anecdotal basis. However, the Committees are advisory to the FDA, their recommendations are not binding and it remains to be seen which of the recommendations will be implemented.

### Clinical practice guideline: opioid prescribing for analgesia after common otolaryngology operations [^111CJ95p]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Table 17 — patient frequently asked questions about opioids provides practical postoperative guidance: pain medication should be taken for severe pain as needed but only if pain is not controlled with nonopioid medication, and if opioids are needed for severe pain, take as prescribed on the medication's bottle. Dose amounts should follow the instructions on the bottle or ones given by your health care provider. For co-medication, probably yes to using Tylenol, aspirin, or Advil instead or with this medication, but check with your health care provider; some prescribed pain medications combine acetaminophen with opioids, and taking additional acetaminophen with the prescribed combination pain medication could be unsafe. Patients do not need to finish the entire bottle; pain medication should be taken when needed and must be stopped when pain is controlled, and if severe pain is under control, there is no need to finish the bottle. Leftover pills should not be left in the home where someone else can access them, and there are facilities that will take these leftover medications. Medications should never be shared with a family member or anyone else, and if pills are left over patients should check with their health care provider or take them to a facility that will dispose of them safely.

### Acute postoperative opioid consumption trajectories and long-term outcomes in pediatric patients after spine surgery [^116XNQ3Y]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Questionnaires

At baseline and at the 6-month follow-up appointment, patients were asked to complete the Scoliosis Research Society-30 (SRS-30) questionnaire. The SRS-30 has been validated for patients with AIS and is one of the most widely used tools in assessing the quality of life and spinal surgery outcomes for individuals with scoliosis. At the same timepoints, patients were also asked to indicate their medication use for pain from the following options: none, non-opioids (eg, Tylenol, ibuprofen) or opioids (eg, Dilaudid).

Perioperative anesthesia care

Perioperative analgesia was standardized including an intraoperative anesthesia institutional standardized protocol specific to the study. All patients received total intravenous anesthesia with propofol, remifentanil/sufentanil/fentanyl, ketamine and dexamethasone. As per our standard of care, after induction, all patients received an intrathecal injection of morphine, with a suggested dose of 5 μg/kg, although at the discretion of the anesthesiologists. After surgery, all patients received IV patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine/ketamine (1:1) 20 μg/kg bolus on demand, 6-min lockout interval, maximum dose per hour 0.1–0.4 mg/kg/hr available upon arrival at the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). The Acute Pain Services (APS) team independently evaluated the patients twice daily and adjusted the dosage based on the patient response and adverse effects. If a patient presented significant postoperative nausea and vomiting on postoperative day 2 or 3, the APS team would change the analgesic solution to hydromorphone/ketamine (bolus 4 μg/kg, lock out 6 mins, maximum dose per hour 0.02–0.08 mg/kg). In addition, all patients received acetaminophen 15 mg/kg Q6 hrs, IV ketorolac 0,5 mg/kg Q6 hrs, and IV ondansetron 4 mg Q6 hrs. The transition to oral medication (normally on POD3 to 4) was decided by the APS team based on the pain intensity, ambulation status, adverse effects, etc. Postoperative medication data were recorded in the patients' electronic medical charts.

### Relation of health literacy to exceeding the labeled maximum daily dose of acetaminophen [^116aq4Hx]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acetaminophen is a commonly used analgesic/antipyretic; overdoses can lead to liver damage. Little is known about the relationship of health literacy to exceeding the recommended maximum daily dose (4 g).

Methods

Subjects were recruited at 23 U.S. malls in 2011. Health literacy was measured by Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), classified as very low (VLL, score < 45); low (LL, 45–60); or adequate (AL, > 60). Participants completed a 7-day acetaminophen use diary by daily telephone interview; an exit interview covered demographics, physical/mental health, medical history, medication label reading, and medication-taking knowledge/attitudes. Acetaminophen products were identified from a comprehensive list; subjects were not required to know their medications contained acetaminophen. Seven hundred fifty-six subjects aged ≥ 18 years had taken acetaminophen in the past 30 days and completed 7 diary days with ≥ 1 day of acetaminophen use, plus the exit survey. Analysis was conducted in 2012–2014.

Results

VLL were more likely than AL individuals to exceed 4 g on ≥ 1 day (OR [95% CI] = 3.8 [1.5, 9.6]; 4.0 [1.3, 12] after controlling for five REALM score-related factors). On usage days, VLL individuals were also more likely to exceed 4 g (3.3 [1.1, 10], by generalized estimating equations; 2.4 [0.9, 6.6], direct effect after accounting for mediation by other deviations from label recommendations).

Conclusions

VLL individuals exceed the recommended maximum acetaminophen dose more often than AL individuals. Other identified characteristics related to health literacy do not explain this, but it is partly mediated by increased frequency of other label deviations.

### An updated review on the metabolite (AM404)-mediated central mechanism of action of paracetamol (acetaminophen): experimental evidence and potential clinical impact [^112AdWeb]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The maximum single dose of paracetamol for pain or fever treatment is 1 g every 4–6 hours as needed, up to a recommended maximum daily dose of 4 g. It is well established that paracetamol is clinically effective under the recommended daily dose and has a well-tolerable safety profile. Paracetamol-related adverse events are rare in healthy adults receiving a daily dose of ≤ 4 g/day. Thus, several guidelines recommend paracetamol as an optimal option for mild-to-moderate pain conditions, such as headache and migraine attacks, postoperative pain and chronic osteoarthritis for limited duration of treatment (however, with some discrepancies here, according to guidelines).

Interestingly, the analgesic effect of paracetamol has a distinct dose-response, according to experimental models and consumers' experience. The French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM) recommended initiating paracetamol with the minimum dose. In a recent focus review, studies comparing the analgesic response to higher (1 g) and lower (500–650 mg) doses of paracetamol were retrieved and summarized. Both direct and indirect comparisons demonstrated analgesic superiority of higher single dose compared to lower single doses, highlighting that a higher single dose of paracetamol for a short duration (4–5 days) poses more benefit than lower single doses. This observation is consistent with the successful experimental demonstration in healthy volunteers of a lack of acetaminophen ceiling effect on R-III nociceptive flexion reflex. In terms of safety, a Cochrane review concluded that the rate of adverse events was similar between the higher and lower single doses of paracetamol. This was in line with another clinical trial showing similar rates of treatment-related adverse events between the higher and lower single doses of paracetamol.

2.1 General Dosing Information

OFIRMEV may be given as a single or repeated dose for the treatment of acute pain or fever. No dose adjustment is required when converting between oral acetaminophen and OFIRMEV dosing in adults and adolescents who weigh 50 kg and above. Calculated maximum daily dose of acetaminophen is based on all routes of administration (i.e., intravenous, oral, and rectal) and all products containing acetaminophen. Exceeding the maximum mg/kg daily dose of acetaminophen as described in Tables 1–3 may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of liver failure and death. To avoid the risk of overdose, ensure that the total amount of acetaminophen from all routes and from all sources does not exceed the maximum recommended dose.

### National poison center calls before vs after availability of high-dose acetaminophen (paracetamol) tablets in Switzerland [^115nQMPQ]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is an antipyretic and analgesic drug with a weak anti-inflammatory action. Since its clinical introduction in 1955, acetaminophen has become the most widely used analgesic-antipyreticand accounts for nearly half of all pain medication prescriptions in Switzerland. Worldwide, acetaminophen is widely available via prescription or over the counter (OTC), with the most common formulations being 500-mg and 1000-mg oral tablets. The therapeutic dose for those aged 12 years and older is 1000 mg every 4 to 6 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 4000 mg. Among children younger than 12 years, weight-based dosing is recommended (ie, 10–15 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours), with a maximum daily dose of 75 mg/kg. When used within this therapeutic dosage, acetaminophen is considered among the safest pain medications available. As such, it is indicated for the management of mild to moderate pain and/or fever. However, daily doses exceeding the therapeutic maximum can cause hepatoxicity, and severe toxic effects can occur with doses exceeding 10 000 mg in adults or 150 to 200 mg/kg in children.

In many Western countries, acetaminophen poisoning is the leading cause of liver failure, and researchers have identified that prolonged exposure to high daily doses can increase the risk of liver failure and death. Thus, in light of the limited evidence of a clinical benefit for musculoskeletal conditions, headache and migraine, or dental pain, concerns regarding the benefit-risk profile of acetaminophen have been raised. In August 2020, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) released draft guidance on chronic pain management, in which acetaminophen (paracetamol) is no longer recommended because of its unfavorable benefit-risk profile.

Access to high doses of acetaminophen may increase the risk of unintentional poisonings owing to a combination of underestimating the risks and lack of clinical effect in pain management, leading to up-dosing. Several studies have linked OTC acetaminophen availability to higher acetaminophen-related inquiries to poison information centers and acetaminophen-related mortality. As a result, many European countries — including the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden — have implemented pack size restrictions for OTC sales. However, changes in legislations for OTC restrictions have so far only identified modest reductions in mortality and poisonings in some regions, and the association with liver transplantation remains limited.

WARNING: Risk of Medication Errors and Hepatotoxicity

Take care when prescribing, preparing, and administering Acetaminophen Injection to avoid dosing errors which could result in accidental overdose and death. In particular, be careful to ensure that:

the dose in milligrams (mg) and milliliters (mL) is not confused;
the dosing is based on weight for patients under 50 kg;
infusion pumps are properly programmed; and
the total daily dose of acetaminophen from all sources does not exceed maximum daily limits.

Acetaminophen Injection contains acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed the maximum daily limits, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^117VZvpq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) for acute migraine — A systematic review (SR) of 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found that paracetamol 1,000 mg versus placebo favored paracetamol for percentage of pain-free response at 2 hours (RR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.24–2.62; p = 0.0022). When taken for moderate to severe pain, paracetamol was superior to placebo with pain freedom at 2 hours (NNT = 12), headache relief at 2 hours (NNT = 5), and headache relief at 1 hour (NNT = 5.2). Paracetamol 1,000 mg alone is statistically superior to placebo, but the NNT of 12 for pain-free response at 2 hours is higher than other commonly used analgesics. For safety, the maximum dose of acetaminophen for acute use is 4,000 mg per day, and this dose should include any other acetaminophen-containing products, such as cold, flu, sinus, or allergy combination products.

### Hepatotoxicity associated with chronic acetaminophen administration in patients without risk factors [^116LSGy8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the literature regarding the potential of acetaminophen to cause toxicity in adult patients without risk factors, when used chronically in daily doses ≤ 4 g.

Data Sources

Key tertiary literature was reviewed, along with searches of MEDLINE (1966-July 2001). International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-May 2001), and PREMEDLINE (July Week 5, 2001). Key search terms included acetaminophen, paracetamol, toxic hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, liver dysfunction, overdose, drug toxicity, and poisoning.

Data Synthesis

Most tertiary references state that the maximum daily dose of acetaminophen is 4 g. Patients taking more than this amount, especially those with certain risk factors, are more likely to develop toxicity. However, a few patients may develop toxicity regardless of risk. An evaluation of the literature regarding the toxic potential of acetaminophen when given at doses ≤ 4 g/d chronically (≥ 4 d) to adult patients without risk factors was conducted.

Conclusions

Acetaminophen should be used cautiously on a chronic basis because several case reports show that it may be hepatotoxic at therapeutic doses.

5.1 Hepatic Injury

Administration of acetaminophen in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of liver failure and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. The maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen includes all routes of acetaminophen administration and all acetaminophen-containing products administered, including combination products.

Use caution when administering acetaminophen in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

5.2 Serious Skin Reactions

Rarely, acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. Patients should be informed about the signs of serious skin reactions, and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.

5.3 Risk of Medication Errors

Take care when prescribing, preparing, and administering Acetaminophen Injection in order to avoid dosing errors which could result in accidental overdose and death. In particular, be careful to ensure that:

the dose in milligrams (mg) and milliliters (mL) is not confused;
the dosing is based on weight for patients under 50 kg;
infusion pumps are properly programmed; and
the total daily dose of acetaminophen from all sources does not exceed maximum daily limits [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.4 Allergy and Hypersensitivity

There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with the use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, and pruritus. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue acetaminophen immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occur. Do not use acetaminophen in patients with acetaminophen allergy.

### Addressing pain in people living with cystic fibrosis: Cystic Fibrosis Foundation evidence-informed guidelines [^115s7iRt]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2025). High credibility.

Table 5 — pharmacologic management of pain (acetaminophen/paracetamol) details first-line use, dosing, and hepatotoxicity cautions: Adults and adolescents oral dosing is 325 to 650 mg every 4 to 6 h as needed or 1000 mg every 6 h as needed; maximum dose 4000 mg/day. Intravenous (IV) dosing for ≥ 50 kg is 650 mg every 4 h or 1000 mg every 6 h; maximum single dose 1000 mg/dose; maximum daily dose 4000 mg/day, and for < 50 kg is 12.5 mg/kg every 4 h or 15 mg/kg every 6 h; maximum single dose 15 mg/kg/dose (≤ 750 mg/dose); maximum daily dose 75 mg/kg/day (≤ 3750 mg/day). Children oral dosing is 10 to 15 mg/kg/dose every 4 to 6 h as needed; do not exceed 5 doses in 24 h; maximum daily dose 75 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 4000 mg/day); IV for < 50 kg follows 12.5 mg/kg every 4 h or 15 mg/kg every 6 h as needed; maximum single dose 15 mg/kg/dose (≤ 750 mg/dose); maximum daily dose 75 mg/kg/day (≤ 3750 mg/day). Infants/children < 2 years old have a maximum daily dose 60 mg/kg/day. The table lists acetaminophen/paracetamol as first-line pharmacologic therapy, included in many over-the-counter combination products, without anti-inflammatory activity, and notes that due to risk for hepatotoxicity some experts recommend a lower maximum dose of 3000 mg/day in adults with normal liver function when used for longer durations (> 3 days), with an even lower total daily dose (e.g., 2000 mg/day) or avoidance preferred for specified risk factors.

### Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate (acetaminophen and codeine) [^1176uEr2]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of pain and response of the patient. The usual adult dosage is:

The usual dose of codeine phosphate in children is 0.5 mg/kg.

Doses may be repeated up to every 4 hours.

The prescriber must determine the number of tablets per dose, and the maximum number of tablets per 24 hours based upon the above dosage guidance. This information should be conveyed in the prescription.

It should be kept in mind, however, that tolerance to codeine can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related. Adult doses of codeine higher than 60 mg fail to give commensurate relief of pain but merely prolong analgesia and are associated with an appreciably increased incidence of undesirable side effects. Equivalently high doses in children would have similar effects.

### National poison center calls before vs after availability of high-dose acetaminophen (paracetamol) tablets in Switzerland [^114mrgrs]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cross-sectional study, the number of acetaminophen-related poisonings increased following the introduction of the 1000-mg oral acetaminophen tablets. This increase was significant for the number of accidental poisonings, suggesting patients unintentionally exceeded the maximum daily dose. Importantly, our analysis revealed that the proportion of potentially severe hepatotoxic doses (ie, ≥ 10 000 mg) was highest among those using the 1000-mg tablets compared with those using the 500-mg tablets, particularly among accidental cases. While the 1000-mg tablets may offer the convenience of fewer tablets in a single ingestion for some patients (eg, nursing homes or high polypharmacy), the question of whether convenience should outweigh the potential for harm at the community level should be re-evaluated. Worldwide, 500-mg oral acetaminophen tablets are available and can be dose adjusted to reach individual administrations of 1000 mg when medically required. Thus, with the accumulating evidence of the potential for harm with high doses of acetaminophen, it is pivotal that public health measures aimed at restricting the availability of 1000-mg acetaminophen tablets be considered.

### Propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen (propoxyphene and acetaminophen) [^1126SFNQ]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen tablets are intended for the management of mild to moderate pain. The dose should be individually adjusted according to severity of pain, patient response and patient size.

Propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen tablets 100 mg/650 mg The usual dosage is one tablet every 4 hours orally as needed for pain. The maximum dose of propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen tablets 100 mg/650 mg is 6 tablets per day. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose.

Propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen tablets 50 mg/325 mg The usual dosage is two tablets every 4 hours orally as needed for pain. The maximum dose of propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen tablets 50 mg/325 mg is 12 tablets per day. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose.

Patients receiving propoxyphene and any CYP3A4 inhibitor should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time and dosage adjustments should be made if warranted.

Consideration should be given to a reduced total daily dosage in elderly patients and in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

Cessation of Therapy

For patients who used propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen on a regular basis for a period of time, when therapy with propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen is no longer needed for the treatment of their pain, it may be useful to gradually discontinue the propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen over time to prevent the development of an opioid abstinence syndrome (narcotic withdrawal). In general, therapy can be decreased by 25% to 50% per day with careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of withdrawal (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE for description of the signs and symptoms of withdrawal). If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, the dose should be raised to the previous level and titrated down more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both.

### Ofirmev (acetaminophen) [^115tukxE]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Hepatic Injury

Administration of acetaminophen in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of liver failure and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. The maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen includes all routes of acetaminophen administration and all acetaminophen-containing products administered, including combination products.

Use caution when administering acetaminophen in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

5.2 Serious Skin Reactions

Rarely, acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. Patients should be informed about the signs of serious skin reactions, and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.

5.3 Risk of Medication Errors

Take care when prescribing, preparing, and administering OFIRMEV (acetaminophen) Injection in order to avoid dosing errors which could result in accidental overdose and death. In particular, be careful to ensure that:

the dose in milligrams (mg) and milliliters (mL) is not confused;

the dosing is based on weight for patients under 50 kg;

infusion pumps are properly programmed; and

the total daily dose of acetaminophen from all sources does not exceed maximum daily limits [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.4 Allergy and Hypersensitivity

There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with the use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, and pruritus. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue OFIRMEV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occur. Do not use OFIRMEV in patients with acetaminophen allergy.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^115bZfD2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Multiple experts from OWG expressed concern that including specific dosage thresholds in a main recommendation statement would emphasize them as authoritative absolutes and would lead to noncollaborative tapers or other potentially harmful consequences. Experts also noted the lack of a single standard formula for calculating MMEs. However, experts agreed there is a need for thresholds as benchmarks and suggested including them in the supporting text after the main recommendation statement. Experts also agreed with separating recommendations on dosage into a recommendation applying to patients starting opioids and patients already receiving opioids.

When opioids are used for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should start opioids at the lowest possible effective dosage. For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed on the basis of the severity of pain and other clinical factors, such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8). The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). For example, a label for hydrocodone bitartrate (5 mg) and acetaminophen (300 mg) states that the usual adult dosage is one or two tablets every 4–6 hours as needed for pain, and the total daily dosage should not exceed eight tablets. Clinicians should use additional caution when initiating opioids for patients aged ≥ 65 years and patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency because of a potentially smaller therapeutic window between safe dosages and dosages associated with respiratory depression and overdose (see Recommendation 8). Formulations with lower opioid doses (e.g. hydrocodone bitartrate 2.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg) are available and can facilitate dosing when additional caution is needed. Product labeling regarding tolerance includes guidance for patients already taking opioids. In addition to opioids, clinicians should consider cumulative dosages of other medications, such as acetaminophen, that are combined with opioids in many formulations and for which decreased clearance of medications might result in accumulation of medications to toxic levels.

### What dose of paracetamol for older people? [^117DdNeF]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Paracetamol, on its own or in combination with other analgesics, is widely used to treat pain associated with acute and chronic conditions. It is considered safe enough to have a general sales licence (GSL) for use by "adults, elderly and children over 16 years" and has few listed cautions or contraindications.1,2 However, recently the effectiveness and safety of paracetamol for some conditions have been challenged, 3,4 and there are published case reports of liver failure associated with therapeutic doses.5–9 Here, we review the use of paracetamol, its pharmacokinetics, the mechanisms by which it can cause liver damage and consider whether frail older people are at greater risk of adverse effects. We also discuss if dose reduction should be considered in some circumstances.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in austere environments: 2024 update [^115FE9uj]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) for pain management — APAP, also known as paracetamol, is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic agent whose analgesic and antipyretic actions appear limited to the central nervous system and, for this reason, APAP is ineffective as an anti-inflammatory; research suggests that APAP may also act as a cannabinoid system modulator. The most commonly reported side effect is GI discomfort, and the most common severe effects are hepatotoxicity from significant overdose with hepatocellular damage and death; toxicity from a single administration < 150 mg/kg for adults or 200 mg/kg for children is rare, and care should be taken in chronic alcoholics and other patients with hepatic dysfunction where the maximum safe daily dose may not be known. APAP has the advantage of being lightweight and low bulk, is available in PO, PR, and IV formulations, and multiple studies comparing IV against PO and PR administrations have found clinical equipoise.

### National poison center calls before vs after availability of high-dose acetaminophen (paracetamol) tablets in Switzerland [^111pTSfX]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Nevertheless, the wide utilization of 1000-mg acetaminophen in Switzerland is concerning considering the ongoing debate regarding the evidence of effectiveness. A 2011 meta-analysisfound that acetaminophen has a marginal benefit compared with placebo in acute pain, and NICE recently released guidance removing acetaminophen from the list of recommended treatments for chronic pain management because of a lack of effectiveness and increased risk of harm. In addition, it has been shown that acetaminophen users were more likely to remedicate early, thereby suggesting a lack of effectiveness and a potential for unintentional poisoning.

The limited effectiveness of acetaminophen for pain, particularly chronic pain, is important to consider in light of the potential for toxic effects with large quantities reaching supratherapeutic dosages greater than the maximum daily dose of 4000 mg. While this maximum daily dose threshold is debated, with some experts recommending it be reduced to 3250 mg, the evidence of the potential for liver damage above 10 000 mg is clear. In our analysis, among calls with acetaminophen monointoxications and information on the ingested dose, we observed that the 1000-mg tablets were overrepresented among those with exposure exceeding 10 000 mg. While we did not observe differences in deaths or severe outcomes, we note that more than 90% of patients with exposure greater than 10 000 mg received the antidote, thereby minimizing the likelihood of severe negative outcomes.

The ITS analysis revealed a significant increase in the reporting of acetaminophen-related calls to the National Poison Centre within 1 year of the 1000-mg tablet being added to the market. While the total number of calls was small in comparison with the total tablets sold, particularly following 2012, these results suggest that adding a more potent formulation of acetaminophen was associated with increased harm. This result is in line with previous studies showing that reducing the available pack sizes of acetaminophen may lead to sustained reductions in the total number of poisonings. However, while Hawton and colleaguesidentified that pack size restriction legislation in the United Kingdom was associated with a decrease in acetaminophen-related deaths, they did not observe a reduction in liver transplantation registration or transplantation. Moreover, while legislation limiting prescription medications has led to changes in utilization patterns, a study by Bateman et alconcluded that legislations limiting OTC drugs were unlikely to be successful. Thus, given that the 1000-mg acetaminophen tablets are currently only available with a medical prescription, we could expect a greater impact of regulations limiting (or withdrawing) the 1000-mg tablet than in studies analyzing the impact of limiting pack sizes of the 500-mg OTC formulations.

### Patient knowledge of the paracetamol content of over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics, cough / cold remedies and prescription medications [^111Cg9bx]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

To test, by completion of a simple questionnaire, patient knowledge of whether 15 commonly used over-the-counter and prescription analgesics and cough/cold remedies contained paracetamol and patient knowledge of the 4&emsp14; g maximum daily dose of paracetamol.

Methods

Patients in the emergency department triage waiting area of a busy London teaching hospital were asked to complete a standardised one-page questionnaire. From a list of 15 commonly used over-the-counter and prescription products, patients were asked which contained paracetamol, responding 'yes', 'no' or 'not sure' for each. They were also asked to state the recommended maximum daily dose of paracetamol.

Results

910 patients were enrolled in the study (mean age 39&emsp14; years, 53% women). The mean ± SD score was 6.5 ± 2.5. The maximum score was 14 (n = 2) and the minimum score was 0 (n = 11). For the recommended maximum daily dose, 93.7% (n = 853) of patients gave an answer. Of these, 53.8% answered correctly, 4.7% quoted a supratherapeutic dose and 41.5% a subtherapeutic dose.

Conclusions

Patient knowledge of paracetamol-containing products and of the maximum daily dose is currently insufficient to ensure safe use of the drug. Interventions are required to address these knowledge gaps to prevent unintentional repeated supratherapeutic ingestion of paracetamol. These interventions could include targeted public education and/or appropriate and effective medication labelling.

### Aminotransferase elevations in healthy adults receiving 4 grams of acetaminophen daily: a randomized controlled trial [^113iQpk4]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

During a clinical trial of a novel hydrocodone/acetaminophen combination, a high incidence of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations was observed.

Objective

To characterize the incidence and magnitude of ALT elevations in healthy participants receiving 4 g of acetaminophen daily, either alone or in combination with selected opioids, as compared with participants treated with placebo.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, 5-treatment, parallel-group, inpatient, diet-controlled (meals provided), longitudinal study of 145 healthy adults in 2 US inpatient clinical pharmacology units.

Intervention

Each participant received either placebo (n = 39), 1 of 3 acetaminophen/opioid combinations (n = 80), or acetaminophen alone (n = 26). Each active treatment included 4 g of acetaminophen daily, the maximum recommended daily dosage. The intended treatment duration was 14 days. Main Outcomes Serum liver chemistries and trough acetaminophen concentrations measured daily through 8 days, and at 1- or 2-day intervals thereafter.

Results

None of the 39 participants assigned to placebo had a maximum ALT of more than 3 times the upper limit of normal. In contrast, the incidence of maximum ALT of more than 3 times the upper limits of normal was 31% to 44% in the 4 treatment groups receiving acetaminophen, including those participants treated with acetaminophen alone. Compared with placebo, treatment with acetaminophen was associated with a markedly higher median maximum ALT (ratio of medians, 2.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.47–4.09; P < .001). Trough acetaminophen concentrations did not exceed therapeutic limits in any participant and, after active treatment was discontinued, often decreased to undetectable levels before ALT elevations resolved.

Conclusions

Initiation of recurrent daily intake of 4 g of acetaminophen in healthy adults is associated with ALT elevations and concomitant treatment with opioids does not seem to increase this effect. History of acetaminophen ingestion should be considered in the differential diagnosis of serum aminotransferase elevations, even in the absence of measurable serum acetaminophen concentrations.

Hand, hip, and knee osteoarthritis — acetaminophen — is conditionally recommended for patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA. Effect sizes in clinical trials are very small and meta-analysis has suggested monotherapy may be ineffective, and longer-term treatment is no better than placebo for most individuals. For those with limited pharmacologic options due to intolerance of or contraindications to NSAIDs, acetaminophen may be appropriate for short-term and episodic use, and regular monitoring for hepatotoxicity is required for patients who receive acetaminophen on a regular basis, particularly at the recommended maximum dosage of 3 g daily in divided doses.

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen (prolate) [^115TAoz3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].

Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets [see WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers].

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing regulations (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see WARNINGS; Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants].

Consider prescribing naloxone when the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.

### What is the most appropriate dose of-acetylcysteine after massive acetaminophen overdose? [^111D2esu]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

While the traditional intravenous N -acetylcysteine (NAC) dosing regimen works well for the vast majority of acetaminophen overdoses, there may be cases of massive overdose where additional NAC may be necessary. Recent evidence suggests that patients with acetaminophen concentrations above the "300-line" develop hepatotoxicity at a higher rate than those below the 300-line, suggesting that an increase of dose may be beneficial at this cut-off. Additional clinical data suggest a further increase in doses at the 450-line and 600-lines. I propose a strategy for step-wise increases in NAC dosing in response to high acetaminophen concentrations at the 300-, 450-, and 600-lines after acute massive acetaminophen overdoses.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in austere environments: 2024 update [^1118ZaTs]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) — dose limits and routes in austere environments — We recommend that APAP, in any formulation or route, should be limited to a maximum daily dose of 60 mg/kg or 4 g in four divided doses. We recommend that in the austere setting, APAP should be administered PO if possible, and if a patient cannot tolerate PO medications, we recommend rectal administration of APAP as second line with suppository (preferred) or PO tablet given rectally (second line). PO administration of APAP is generally the preferred route in most environments if the patient can swallow, and no evidence has suggested teratogenic effects from APAP use in pregnancy.

### Acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity-isn' T it time for APAP to go away? [^116Demib]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) is the most commonly used drug for the treatment of pain and fever around the world. At the same time, APAP can cause dose-related hepatocellular necrosis, responsible for nearly 500 deaths annually in the United States (US) alone, as well as 100,000 calls to US Poison Control Centers, 50,000 emergency room visits and 10,000 hospitalisations per year. As an over-the-counter and prescription product (with opioids), APAP toxicity dwarfs all other prescription drugs as a cause of acute liver failure in the US and Europe, but it is not regulated in any significant way. In this review the ongoing controversy surrounding the proper role for this ubiquitous pain reliever: its history, pathogenesis, clinical challenges in recognition and management, and current regulatory status are highlighted. A new solution to a 50-year-old problem is proposed.

### An integrated safety analysis of combined acetaminophen and ibuprofen (maxigesic / combogesic) in adults [^116DTuCc]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

APAP and IBP are two analgesic compounds with a long history of use, and both are considered safe and well tolerated at maximum recommended OTC daily doses. The major safety risks of APAP (hepatic injury) and IBP (gastric bleeding and thromboembolic) are largely related to dose. Using a combination addresses these risks by providing superior analgesia without transgressing daily OTC dose limits. Combinations containing APAP and IBP are beneficial as there is less opportunity for drug interactions due to their distinct metabolic pathways. Providing an FDC without an opioid also limits the risk of overdosing, as patients attempt to increase their opioid intake due to tolerance and dependence.

Clinical safety data obtained from clinical trials with both the FDC 325/97.5 and the FDC 500/150 demonstrate the safety and tolerability of an FDC of APAP and IBP at or below maximum OTC daily doses of 4,000 mg, and in the case of IBP, well below maximum daily dose of 2,400 mg. This is supported by safety data from a variety of FDC formulations reported previously, including a large meta-analysis of the literature. When taken at full doses, the cumulative daily consumption of APAP and IBP from the FDC 325/97.5 is 97.5% of that from the FDC 500/150. This permitted the pooling of data for the analysis of safety. Among a pooled safety population of 922 patients, 521 AEs were reported. Data from these 922 subjects demonstrated that the superior analgesic efficacy obtained by combining APAP and IBP did not come at the expense of safety or tolerability. During the double-blind period (24–48 hours), treatment with the FDC did not increase the incidence of AEs, discontinuations due to AEs, or the proportion of subjects experiencing at least one AE relative to either monotherapy group or placebo. There was no increase in the percentage of AEs deemed possibly or probably related to the study medication. The FDC did not differ in the percentage of AEs rated as severe. The incidence of common AEs was also unchanged. The FDC did not alter the rates of GI AEs or postoperative bleeding compared with either monotherapy or placebo. There were also no appreciable changes to hemoglobin and liver biochemistry levels compared to the APAP monotherapy during the open-label phase of one study (AFT-MX-6E). The additional analgesia provided by the FDC does not come at the cost of a reduction in tolerability. The FDC provides a well tolerated and effective means of analgesia for mild–moderate pain, which can be used as an alternative or adjunct to opioid use post surgery.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen (Oxycodone and acetaminophen) [^116MMh16]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse (see WARNINGS).

Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets and adjust the dosage accordingly (see WARNINGS).

Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets (see WARNINGS, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression; PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients/Caregivers).

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing regulations (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient (see WARNINGS, Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants).

Consider prescribing naloxone when the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.

Initial Dosage

Initiating Treatment with Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets

The usual adult dosage is one tablet every 6 hours as needed for pain. The total daily dose of acetaminophen should not exceed 4 grams.

Conversion from Oxycodone and Acetaminophen to Extended-Release Oxycodone

The relative bioavailability of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets or oral solution compared to extended-release oxycodone is unknown, so conversion to extended-release oxycodone must be accompanied by close observation for signs of excessive sedation and respiratory depression.

Implementation Considerations

The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making. Risks of opioid use, including risk for overdose and overdose death, increase continuously with dosage, and there is no single dosage threshold below which risks are eliminated. Therefore, the recommendation language emphasizes that clinicians should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients rather than emphasizing a single specific numeric threshold. Further, these recommendations apply specifically to starting opioids or to increasing opioid dosages, and a different set of benefits and risks applies to reducing opioid dosages (see Recommendation 5).
When opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage.
For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed based on the severity of pain and other clinical factors such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8).
The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). TABLE Morphine milligram equivalent doses for commonly prescribed opioids for pain management Sources: Adapted from Von Korff M, Saunders K, Ray GT, et al. Clin J Pain 2008;24:521–7 and Nielsen S, Degenhardt L, Hoban B, Gisev N. Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf 2016;25:733–7. Abbreviations: mcg/hr = microgram per hour; mg = milligram; MME = morphine milligram equivalent. * Multiply the dose for each opioid by the conversion factor to determine the dose in MMEs. For example, tablets containing hydrocodone 5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg taken four times a day would contain a total of 20 mg of hydrocodone daily, equivalent to 20 MME daily; extended-release tablets containing oxycodone 10 mg and taken twice a day would contain a total of 20 mg of oxycodone daily, equivalent to 30 MME daily. The following cautions should be noted: 1) All doses are in mg/day except for fentanyl, which is mcg/hr. 2) Equianalgesic dose conversions are only estimates and cannot account for individual variability in genetics and pharmacokinetics. 3) Do not use the calculated dose in MMEs to determine the doses to use when converting one opioid to another; when converting opioids, the new opioid is typically dosed at a substantially lower dose than the calculated MME dose to avoid overdose because of incomplete cross-tolerance and individual variability in opioid pharmacokinetics. 4) Use particular caution with methadone dose conversions because methadone has a long and variable half-life, and peak respiratory depressant effect occurs later and lasts longer than peak analgesic effect. 5) Use particular caution with transdermal fentanyl because it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/day, and its absorption is affected by heat and other factors. 6) Buprenorphine products approved for the treatment of pain are not included in the table because of their partial µ -receptor agonist activity and resultant ceiling effects compared with full µ -receptor agonists. 7) These conversion factors should not be applied to dosage decisions related to the management of opioid use disorder. † Tapentadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tapentadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists. § Tramadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tramadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists.
If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage and should generally avoid dosage increases when possible.
Many patients do not experience benefit in pain or function from increasing opioid dosages to ≥ 50 MME/day but are exposed to progressive increases in risk as dosage increases. Therefore, before increasing total opioid dosage to ≥ 50 MME/day, clinicians should pause and carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks. If a decision is made to increase dosage, clinicians should use caution and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.
Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients as dosage increases further. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to further increase dosage on the basis of individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^111xu8XH]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity — diagnosis and management for intentional versus unintentional overdose are contrasted by timing, dose patterns, coingestants, laboratory features, and treatments. Time course differs as "Single time point" versus "Several days of repeated use", and dosing descriptions include "Supratherapeutic (typically > 4 g over 24 h)" and "Repeated therapeutic (up to 4 g per day) or supratherapeutic dosing". Intentional cases show "24–72 h: rapid rise in ALT to > 1000 IU/L… total bilirubin is typically < 10 mg/dL" with peaks at "72–96 h", while unintentional cases are often delayed but still have a "rapid rise in ALT to > 1000 IU/L". Risk assessment states to "Use modified Rumack-Matthew nomogram to estimate risk of hepatotoxicity", whereas in repeated-use cases levels are "Often undetectable at initial presentation" and "APAP-protein adducts useful but assay not commercially available". Gastrointestinal decontamination for intentional overdose includes "Activated charcoal (1 g/kg, max dose 50 g) if within 4 h of ingestion", whereas for unintentional overdose it is "Usually not helpful nor recommended". N-acetylcysteine regimens include oral "140 mg/kg load followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 h" and intravenous dosing with "150 mg/kg load over 15–60 min, followed by 50 mg/kg (12.5 mg/kg/h)… then 100 mg/kg (6.25 mg/kg/h) over 16 h (overall total 300 mg/kg over 24 h)", with continuation "at 6.25 mg/kg/h until ALT is decreasing and INR is < 2". For acute liver failure risk, the table advises "Close monitoring in intensive care unit and consider prompt referral to a liver transplant center". Coingestants differ, with "Diphenhydramine and other sedatives" in intentional cases and "Opioids often used in combination" in unintentional cases.
