## Question

Gene associations

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about gene associations, including definitions, study designs, interpretation, causality, clinical translation, and future directions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining gene associations and their clinical relevance. Then, I should review study designs, from candidate gene to GWAS and sequencing-based approaches. Next, I will examine how to interpret association signals, including linkage disequilibrium, fine-mapping, and effect sizes. After that, I need to assess causality using genetic, functional, and informatic evidence. Then, I will consider clinical translation, including polygenic risk scores and Mendelian overlap. Finally, I should synthesize current limitations and future directions, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate citations and self-verification along the way.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition and why gene associations matter clinically. Gene associations refer to statistical relationships between genetic variants and traits or diseases, typically quantified as odds ratios or effect sizes, and they inform our understanding of disease architecture and potential therapeutic targets, though they are not themselves proof of causality [^116cPYMf]. Hold on, I should verify the distinction between association and causation: association is a population-level correlation, whereas causation requires mechanistic evidence and, ideally, perturbational validation, so I need to keep that boundary explicit in subsequent steps [^116cJ8HT].

> Next, I should review study designs, starting with candidate gene studies. Historically, candidate gene studies targeted specific loci based on prior hypotheses but suffered from limited coverage, selection bias, and poor replication, so I need to be cautious about overinterpreting their results despite occasional strong signals when mechanistically grounded and well replicated [^113HWrwJ]. Wait, let me verify the counterexample I recall: the SUR1-TRPM4 channel complex in traumatic brain injury showed consistent associations and functional plausibility, illustrating that well-chosen candidates with biological support can still yield meaningful insights when carefully executed [^113HWrwJ].

> I will now examine genome-wide association studies, which test millions of common variants without pre-specified hypotheses and have revolutionized discovery of loci for complex traits, albeit with modest effect sizes and predominantly non-coding signals that complicate mechanistic inference [^116cPYMf] [^114kPW2b]. Hold on, I should verify the statistical thresholds: genome-wide significance is typically set at p < 5×10−8 to control for the massive multiple testing burden, and adherence to this threshold has improved replication rates across studies [^113icerQ]. But wait, what if the effect is small and clinically subtle? That is common in complex traits, necessitating very large sample sizes to detect additional loci and to improve polygenic resolution [^116cPYMf].

> Let me consider sequencing-based approaches next, because rare and low-frequency variants often have larger effects and can bridge gaps left by common-variant GWAS. Large biobanks such as UK Biobank and FinnGen have enabled exome-wide and genome-wide interrogation of rare coding variation, revealing numerous novel associations and helping connect Mendelian and complex disease architectures [^113o5d87] [^112zCncH]. I should double-check the allele frequency spectrum emphasized here: the 0.1–2% range is particularly informative for identifying coding variants with moderate-to-large effects that GWAS often misses, which can shorten the path from association to mechanism [^112zCncH].

> Now, I need to interpret association signals carefully, starting with linkage disequilibrium and the challenge of identifying causal variants. Most GWAS peaks tag multiple correlated variants, so fine-mapping and functional annotation are required to prioritize credible causal variants within a locus, and even then multiple functional variants in LD can contribute to a single signal, complicating simple "one causal variant" narratives [^11381cyE] [^114PHagr]. Wait, let me verify the implication: this means that both statistical colocalization and experimental perturbation are often needed to distinguish true causal variants from bystanders in LD blocks [^112kByPa].

> I should confirm how we move from locus to gene, because most GWAS variants are non-coding and may regulate distal genes. Integrative methods such as PrediXcan/S-PrediXcan, DEPICT, and eQTL colocalization help link variants to effector genes and tissues by integrating expression and functional annotations, revealing tissue-specific regulatory effects that refine mechanistic hypotheses [^112kByPa] [^114pK2Ve] [^1153KAsZ]. Hold on, I should verify that these approaches still require replication and orthogonal validation to avoid overfitting to a single tissue or dataset, which is why multi-tissue and independent cohort replication are standard practice [^112kByPa].

> Next, I should review effect sizes and clinical significance. Common variant odds ratios are typically modest, often around 1.05–1.20, limiting individual-level predictive utility even when aggregated into polygenic scores, whereas rare coding variants can confer larger effects and occasionally actionable risk, though they remain individually uncommon in the population [^116cPYMf] [^113o5d87]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that larger effects automatically translate to clinical action; I should correct that: clinical utility still depends on penetrance, prevalence, and the availability of effective interventions, so large effects alone are insufficient without supportive clinical evidence [^112JzwqX].

> I will now examine how to assess causality, because association is not enough. Robust gene-level implication requires statistical genetic support first, including replication in independent cohorts and enrichment of damaging variants in cases versus matched controls, followed by ancillary functional and informatic evidence to build a coherent mechanistic case [^116cJ8HT] [^114jLZit]. Let me reconsider the weighting: I initially thought functional data could stand alone, but the field emphasizes that without strong genetic support, functional plausibility risks false positives due to the "narrative potential" of genomes, so integrated evidence is essential [^115xEEgz].

> I need to check the role of rare variants in strengthening causal inference. Rare, protein-altering variants in the same gene and phenotype provide hypothesis-free evidence of causality and can define more tractable targets for functional studies and therapeutic development, which is why exome and genome sequencing are increasingly used to follow up GWAS loci and to discover new disease genes [^112Y3rys] [^113o5d87]. Hold on, I should verify that population structure and case–control matching remain critical even for rare variant studies to avoid spurious enrichment signals, especially in founder or isolated populations [^116oXtRh].

> Next, I should review clinical translation pathways. Polygenic risk scores aggregate thousands of common variants into individual risk estimates, but their clinical utility is context-dependent and must be communicated carefully, particularly when combined with Mendelian variant results, to avoid misinterpretation and inappropriate medical action [^115yNa2G]. I should confirm that current ACMG guidance advises against labeling common risk alleles as pathogenic and recommends reporting them as risk alleles with appropriate caveats, which aligns with the limited predictive value of common variants at the individual level [^1127mWcr] [^115N5S2a].

> Let me consider Mendelian–complex bridges, because this is where clinical impact can be immediate. Variants in Mendelian disease genes can modify risk for related complex traits, and large biobank studies have demonstrated that rare coding variants within GWAS loci often implicate the likely effector gene, shortening the path to mechanism and occasionally to therapeutic targeting [^112zCncH] [^113o5d87]. I should double-check that this supports a continuum model of genetic architecture rather than a strict Mendelian–complex dichotomy, which has implications for gene prioritization and variant interpretation in clinical genomics [^112zCncH].

> I will now examine limitations that constrain current practice. Missing heritability persists because many loci with small effects remain undetected, gene–gene and gene–environment interactions are undercharacterized, and most associated variants reside in non-coding regions with cell-type-specific regulatory effects that are hard to pin down without the right tissue context [^116cPYMf] [^114Ukhm7] [^11381cyE]. Hold on, I should verify that efforts to scale sample sizes, improve phenotype definition, and integrate multi-omics are the main levers to address these gaps, which is consistent with contemporary roadmaps in the field [^116cPYMf].

> Next, I should review future directions. Larger, more diverse cohorts, whole-genome sequencing, and improved imputation will expand discovery across the allele frequency spectrum, while integrative functional genomics, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, and machine learning will sharpen mechanistic inference and effector gene prediction [^113o5d87] [^114JQW7n]. Let me verify that standards for reporting effector gene predictions are being developed, which should improve comparability and clinical interpretability across studies and platforms [^113NhpBP].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical takeaway is balanced. Gene associations are powerful for generating hypotheses, revealing pathways, and, in select cases, guiding diagnostics or therapeutics, but translation requires replication, functional validation, and careful communication of uncertainty, especially when integrating polygenic and Mendelian risk into clinical workflows [^112JzwqX] [^116cJ8HT]. I should double-check that this synthesis aligns with current consensus on cautious, evidence-based implementation, which it does, while acknowledging the accelerating pace of discovery that will likely yield new actionable insights in the near term [^116cPYMf].

Gene associations are statistical links between genetic variants and traits or diseases, most robustly identified by GWAS [^116cPYMf] and replicated in independent cohorts [^1178D7X4]. Most associations involve **common, low-effect variants** [^113o5d87] in non-coding regions [^115N5S2a], so identifying the causal gene and mechanism often requires **fine-mapping** [^114PHagr], **eQTL** [^1153KAsZ], and functional studies [^114JQW7n]. Rare variants with larger effects [^113o5d87] can clarify **causal genes** and mechanisms, but clinical translation remains limited by modest predictive value [^112JzwqX] and the need for larger, diverse cohorts [^114z5hLM] [^112zCncH].

## Methods for identifying gene associations

Several **complementary approaches** are used to discover and validate gene–trait associations:

| **Method** | **Description** | **Strengths** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| GWAS | Genome-wide scanning of common variants (typically MAF > 1%) in large cohorts [^114z5hLM] | - Unbiased <br/> - High power for common variants <br/> - Widely used | - Limited detection of rare variants <br/> - Many associations are non-coding and of small effect [^115N5S2a] |
| Whole-exome/genome sequencing | Sequencing of coding or entire genomes to identify rare, protein-altering variants [^113o5d87] | - Detects rare, large-effect variants <br/> - Enables identification of causal genes | - Requires large samples <br/> - Computational burden <br/> - Variant interpretation challenges [^116cJ8HT] |
| Candidate gene studies | Hypothesis-driven investigation of specific genes | - Focused <br/> - Useful for specific pathways | - Prone to bias <br/> - Poor replication [^113HWrwJ] |
| Gene-based approaches | Aggregate variant effects within genes (e.g. SKAT, MAGMA) [^114BaTLC] | - Increases power for rare variants <br/> - Reduces multiple testing burden | - Dependent on gene annotation quality [^1138Cygb] |

## Challenges in identifying causal genes

Identifying the **causal gene** underlying an association is a major challenge:

- **Linkage disequilibrium (LD)**: Associated SNPs often tag multiple nearby variants, obscuring the true causal variant [^11381cyE].
- **Non-coding variants**: Most GWAS hits are in regulatory regions, requiring eQTL and functional studies to link to target genes [^115d82Xe].
- **Pleiotropy**: A single variant can affect multiple genes or traits, complicating causal inference [^117XsVsf].
- **Tissue specificity**: Regulatory effects are often cell-type specific, requiring context-aware functional data [^112kByPa].

---

## Functional validation of gene associations

Functional studies are essential to establish **causality**:

- **eQTL mapping**: Links variants to gene expression changes in relevant tissues [^1153KAsZ].
- **CRISPR perturbation**: Edits candidate variants/genes to observe phenotypic effects [^notfound].
- **Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)**: Model human disease in relevant cell types [^notfound].
- **Animal models**: Validate gene function and disease mechanisms [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and applications

Gene associations inform **clinical practice** in several ways:

- **Risk prediction**: Polygenic risk scores (PRS) combine many variants to estimate disease risk, though predictive power remains modest [^115N5S2a].
- **Therapeutic targeting**: Associations reveal pathways (e.g. IL-23/IL-17 in autoimmunity) for drug development [^116QpdV1].
- **Diagnostic markers**: Genetic variants aid diagnosis and prognosis (e.g. hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) [^116qzJuq].
- **Personalized medicine**: Tailoring treatment based on genetic risk profiles [^113rXk4j].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current knowledge

Despite progress, **significant limitations remain**:

- **Missing heritability**: Much heritability remains unexplained, likely due to rare variants, gene–gene interactions, and complex architectures [^111suKyS] [^114Ukhm7].
- **Population diversity**: Most studies are in European ancestry, limiting generalizability [^notfound].
- **Variant interpretation**: Many variants have uncertain significance, hindering clinical application [^116q2KDP].
- **Ethical considerations**: Privacy, consent, and equitable access remain critical issues [^notfound].

---

## Future directions and emerging trends

The field is advancing through **larger, more diverse cohorts**, which will improve detection of rare variants and enhance generalizability [^113Jqz2q]. Multi-omics integration — combining genomics with transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics — will clarify mechanisms [^113Jw7b3]. Machine learning will aid variant interpretation and prediction [^116Q4ZWS]. Regulatory efforts will standardize reporting and interpretation of gene associations [^112fD3vc].

---

Gene associations are a cornerstone of modern genetics, linking variants to traits and diseases. While GWAS and sequencing have expanded discovery, **identifying causal genes and mechanisms** requires fine-mapping and functional validation [^116cPYMf]. Clinical translation is growing but remains limited by modest predictive value and the need for larger, diverse cohorts [^112JzwqX].

Gene-level implication

To implicate a variant as pathogenic requires that the DNA sequence affected by that variant has a role in the disease process. For genes not previously reported as causal, investigators must simultaneously demonstrate evidence for a role of a candidate gene and one or more variants disrupting it. Even if the candidate gene has been previously implicated in the same or a similar disease phenotype, the overall support from published sources should be carefully assessed and reported. Multiple classes of evidence may potentially contribute to pathogenic inferences at the level of both gene and variant, and include genetic, informatic and experimental data (Table 1 and Supplementary Information). However, in keeping with the history of the field of human genetics, we emphasize the critical primacy of robust statistical genetic support for the implication of new genes, which may then be supplemented with ancillary experimental or informatic evidence supporting a mechanistic role for the gene in the disease in question.

Historically, gene-level implication in monogenic diseases has relied first on identifying a narrow set of candidate genes through genetic data such as linkage analyses or experimental data on biochemical function, and then identifying rare, probably damaging variants (altering the normal levels or biochemical function of a gene or gene product) in one of the candidate genes in multiple affected patients. The increasing availability of large-scale sequencing data now allows genome-scale approaches to gene discovery, in which the distribution of rare, predicted gene-disrupting variants in patients is systematically compared to population controls or well-validated null models to identify genes with an excess of potentially pathogenic variants for clinical and functional follow-up.

It is worth emphasizing that the whole-genome sequence data sets are in some ways more prone to misinterpretation than earlier analyses because of the sheer wealth of candidate causal mutations in any human genome, many of which may provide a compelling story about how the variant may influence the trait; a problem that has been referred to as the 'narrative potential' of human genomes. To avoid such biases the evidence supporting any candidate gene should be contrasted wherever possible with the evidence observed at other presumably non-disease-related genes (for example, by ranking the gene among all others and reporting the probability of a similar or greater contrast being observed by chance). Formal genome-wide statistical approaches to monogenic-disease gene discovery will require considerable methods development, but general guidelines for establishing the significance of variation can be considered here. As we discuss below, these considerations apply equally to assessing the significance of rare variation in common disease studies.

### Using gene expression to investigate the genetic basis of complex disorders [^115HhYz2]. Human Molecular Genetics (2008). Low credibility.

The identification of complex disease susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has recently become possible and is now a method of choice for investigating the genetic basis of complex traits. The number of results from such studies is constantly increasing but the challenge lying forward is to identify the biological context in which these statistically significant candidate variants act. Regulatory variation plays an important role in shaping phenotypic differences among individuals and thus is very likely to also influence disease susceptibility. As such, integrating gene expression data and other disease relevant intermediate phenotypes with GWAS results could potentially help prioritize fine-mapping efforts and provide a shortcut to disease biology. Combining these different levels of information in a meaningful way is however not trivial. In the present review, we outline the several approaches that have been explored so far in this sense and their achievements. We also discuss the limitations of the methods and how upcoming technological developments could help circumvent these limitations. Overall, such efforts will be very helpful in understanding initially regulatory effects on disease and disease etiology in general.

### Candidate gene association studies and evidence for gene-by-gene interactions [^114WF3qK]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Candidate gene studies in asthma are a powerful and valuable tool in asthma genetics. Although the quality of small-scale, freely associating studies has been questionable, increasingly serious efforts are made to establish, replicate, and verify association results. Association studies may help us to better understand the mechanisms underlying asthma. They may create hypotheses and help to direct functional studies to targets that are likely to give valuable results. However, they should not be over-interpreted; only biologic proof can verify associations between genetic variations and a certain disease outcome. The insight that gene-by-gene and gene-by-environment interactions may be crucial for understanding and pinpoint the complex mechanisms of genetic regulation of multifactorial diseases has gained momentum in the last years when technical improvement allowed for the effective genotyping and analysis of great numbers of polymorphisms in large populations. It can be expected that from this area of research new and exciting results will follow soon.

### Genetic associations of protein-coding variants in human disease [^112zCncH]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Here we have conducted the largest association study of protein-coding genetic variants so far against hundreds of disease endpoints ascertained from two massive population biobanks, UK Biobank and FinnGen. We report novel disease associations, most notably in the rare and low-allelic frequency spectrum, replicate and assign putative causalities to many previously reported GWAS associations, and leverage the insights gained to elucidate disease mechanisms, demonstrating that the step from association to biological insight may be considerably shorter for coding variant association studies than it has traditionally been for GWAS. In addition to a substantial gain in power over previous studies, our analyses benefit from replication between two population cohorts, increasing the robustness of our findings and setting the stage for future similar studies in ethnically more diverse populations.

Notably, our study identifies both pathogenic variants residing in monogenic disease genes to impact the risk for related complex conditions as well as new, probably causal sentinel variants within GWAS loci in genes with known and novel biological roles in the respective GWAS trait. With this, our study is one of the first to help bridge the gap between common and rare disease genetics across a broad range of conditions and provides support for the hypothesis that the genetic architecture of many diseases is continuous. Of the 975 associations identified in our study, 145 are driven by unique variants in the so far little-interrogated rare and low-allelic frequency spectrum between 0.1 and 2% that neither GWAS nor sequencing studies have been able to thoroughly interrogate across a range of diseases and that is hypothesized to contribute to the 'missing heritability' of many human diseases.

### Genome-based prediction of common diseases: advances and prospects [^116wiVUJ]. Human Molecular Genetics (2008). Low credibility.

Common diseases such as type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease result from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Recent developments in genomics research have boosted progress in the discovery of susceptibility genes and fueled expectations about opportunities of genetic profiling for personalizing medicine. Personalized medicine requires a test that fairly accurately predicts disease risk, particularly when interventions are invasive, expensive or have major side effects. Recent studies on the prediction of common diseases based on multiple genetic variants alone or in addition to traditional disease risk factors showed limited predictive value so far, but all have investigated only a limited number of susceptibility variants. New gene discoveries from genome-wide association studies will certainly further improve the prediction of common diseases, but the question is whether this improvement is sufficient to enable personalized medicine. In this paper, we argue that new gene discoveries may not evidently improve the prediction of common diseases to a degree that it will change the management of individuals at increased risk. Substantial improvements may only be expected if we manage to understand the complete causal mechanisms of common diseases to a similar extent as we understand those of monogenic disorders. Genomics research will contribute to this understanding, but it is likely that the complexity of complex diseases may ultimately limit the opportunities for accurate prediction of disease in asymptomatic individuals as unraveling their complete causal pathways may be impossible.

### Properties of human disease genes and the role of genes linked to mendelian disorders in complex disease aetiology [^111j3UvB]. Human Molecular Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

The number and effect size of disease susceptibility alleles vary widely from disorder to disorder. Most rare, monogenic diseases with Mendelian inheritance are well explained by the mutation-selection balance model, under which deleterious variants are continuously introduced by random mutation in the population and subsequently removed by purifying selection. A wide range of human diseases are orders of magnitude more frequent than Mendelian diseases and the precise mechanisms maintaining variation on their susceptibility loci are still poorly understood. However, emerging observations suggest a more elusive boundary between complex and Mendelian human disorders and indicate that they are extremes in a continuum of genetic architectures. An increasing amount of evidence, including the present study, proves a role for genes linked to Mendelian diseases in the aetiology of complex disorders. In a previous work, we demonstrated that genes associated with Mendelian forms of Parkinson's disease are also functionally relevant for the complex form of the disease, suggesting that the two forms are genetically related. Here, after compiling 887 Mendelian genes, we observed that more than 23% of genes linked to a Mendelian disorder are also associated with at least one complex disease (p-value = 2.39×10 − 13 for chi-square test). Furthermore, the intersection between Mendelian and complex disease genes shows specific biological features, indicating a prominent role of CM genes in the aetiology of complex disease. Indeed, CM genes present higher functional importance in the protein network, higher ORs, a tendency towards higher expression levels and are enriched in relevant biological categories when compared to CNM genes.

### Pathway-based approaches for analysis of genomewide association studies [^114NbGja]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2007). Low credibility.

Published genomewide association (GWA) studies typically analyze and report single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their neighboring genes with the strongest evidence of association (the "most-significant SNPs/genes" approach), while paying little attention to the rest. Borrowing ideas from microarray data analysis, we demonstrate that pathway-based approaches, which jointly consider multiple contributing factors in the same pathway, might complement the most-significant SNPs/genes approach and provide additional insights into interpretation of GWA data on complex diseases.

### Benefits and limitations of genome-wide association studies [^116cPYMf]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2019). High credibility.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involve testing genetic variants across the genomes of many individuals to identify genotype-phenotype associations. GWAS have revolutionized the field of complex disease genetics over the past decade, providing numerous compelling associations for human complex traits and diseases. Despite clear successes in identifying novel disease susceptibility genes and biological pathways and in translating these findings into clinical care, GWAS have not been without controversy. Prominent criticisms include concerns that GWAS will eventually implicate the entire genome in disease predisposition and that most association signals reflect variants and genes with no direct biological relevance to disease. In this Review, we comprehensively assess the benefits and limitations of GWAS in human populations and discuss the relevance of performing more GWAS.

### Understanding the genetics of neuropsychiatric disorders: the potential role of genomic regulatory blocks [^112JBptC]. Molecular Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The primary aim of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and other genetic association studies is arguably to serve as the first step in elucidation of the biological mechanisms responsible for the onset of disease, which will eventually lead to their translation into clinical practice. While GWAS and other genetic association studies have made great steps towards understanding many diseases, progress has so far fallen short of initial expectations for most neuropsychiatric disorders. This is primarily due to the difficulty of identifying the biological effect of variants identified as significantly associated with the disorder. More philosophically, it is becoming increasingly recognised that considering interactions across the whole system is required to understand mechanisms in biology, and this may be particularly the case for brain disorders. In the rest of the article we will refer to GWAS because they are the focus of much genetic research in neuropsychiatric disorders at the moment, but the same issues apply to other genetic association studies.

The GWAS approach attempts to identify the statistically significant overrepresentation of specific single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) alleles in a group of affected individuals vs. a healthy control group. This is performed for a panel of hundreds of thousands of SNPs, selected such that they "tag" each linkage disequilibrium (LD) block across the genome at least once. Due to the LD structure of the genome, each identified variant will have hundreds to thousands of other variants in its proximity that are also significantly associated with the trait. The first stumbling block when interpreting GWAS results is thus the identification of the causal variant responsible for the statistical association of the tagged SNP and the trait being studied. The identification of the variant that underlies the biological effect responsible for the statistical association with the disease is known as fine mapping (reviewed in). This procedure is highly dependent on the quality of genotyped data used for the reference (relatively large LD blocks present in the European population were historically especially problematic), the size of the GWAS sample and the concordance of variant quality control across studies used, with notable recent success by Mahajan et al. and others.

### Contemporary insights into the genetics of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: toward a new era in clinical testing? [^116qzJuq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited disease of cardiac muscle characterized by substantial heterogeneity in morphology, clinical manifestation, genetic etiology, and outcome. 1 HCM is diagnosed in the presence of a maximum left‐ventricular wall thickness of at least 15 mm when this is not solely explained by abnormal loading conditions (such as hypertension and aortic stenosis), with other typical features including myocyte disarray and interstitial fibrosis. 2 Although HCM is considered a Mendelian disease with largely autosomal dominant inheritance, incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity are commonly observed in affected families.

As well as being a relatively common (estimated to affect 1 in 500 people) 2, 3, 4 and medically important condition, HCM has been an important model disease for studying issues that are shared among many inherited cardiac diseases. Research into the genetic basis of HCM has been ongoing for almost 30 years and early implementation of clinical genetic testing has yielded extensive data sets for use in research studies. However, several issues have limited the impact of HCM genetic testing in clinical practice:
Over half of patients tested have a negative genetic test result (ie, no definitive or putative pathogenic variant is detected).
The significance of many detected variants has been difficult to ascertain.
The limited correlation between genotype and clinical phenotype has constrained the use of genetic knowledge in directing clinical management.
The ever‐increasing number of genes apparently associated with disease has clouded our understanding of the genetic architecture of HCM.

Despite these open challenges, recent findings have transformed our understanding of the genetic basis of HCM and offered the potential for more accurate, sensitive, and impactful application of genetic testing. These findings have been driven by the development of population genetic databases that have revolutionized our understanding of rare genetic variation in health and disease and by the accumulation of large patient cohorts and disease registries. Collaborative models of data sharing, together with the development of consensus guidelines for variant interpretation and validation of disease‐gene associations, have proven invaluable for improving our knowledge of rare genetic diseases.

Here, we discuss the achievements earned in understanding the genetics of HCM in the past 30 years, the clinical implications of the current reassessment of genetic associations, the need to manage the genotype‐negative HCM patient in a coherent and effective manner, and the challenges that need to be addressed before we can adopt a patient‐specific, individualized approach in HCM. While focusing on HCM, the issues discussed are also broadly relevant to our understanding of other cardiomyopathies and inherited cardiac diseases.

### Association of genes to genetically inherited diseases using data mining [^116p1rWR]. Nature Genetics (2002). Medium credibility.

Although approximately one-quarter of the roughly 4,000 genetically inherited diseases currently recorded in respective databases (LocusLink, OMIM) are already linked to a region of the human genome, about 450 have no known associated gene. Finding disease-related genes requires laborious examination of hundreds of possible candidate genes (sometimes, these are not even annotated; see, for example, refs 3,4). The public availability of the human genome draft sequence has fostered new strategies to map molecular functional features of gene products to complex phenotypic descriptions, such as those of genetically inherited diseases. Owing to recent progress in the systematic annotation of genes using controlled vocabularies, we have developed a scoring system for the possible functional relationships of human genes to 455 genetically inherited diseases that have been mapped to chromosomal regions without assignment of a particular gene. In a benchmark of the system with 100 known disease-associated genes, the disease-associated gene was among the 8 best-scoring genes with a 25% chance, and among the best 30 genes with a 50% chance, showing that there is a relationship between the score of a gene and its likelihood of being associated with a particular disease. The scoring also indicates that for some diseases, the chance of identifying the underlying gene is higher.

### Genome-wide association studies: potential next steps on a genetic journey [^116kSFQ5]. Human Molecular Genetics (2008). Low credibility.

Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified numerous loci at which common variants influence disease risk or quantitative traits. Despite these successes, the variants identified by these studies have generally explained only a small fraction of the heritable component of disease risk, and have not pinpointed with certainty the causal variant(s) at the associated loci. Furthermore, the mechanisms of action by which associated loci influence disease or quantitative phenotypes are often unclear, because we do not know through which gene(s) the associated variants exert their effects or because these gene(s) are of unknown function or have no clear connection to known disease biology. Thus, the initial set of genome-wide association studies serve as a starting point for future genetic and functional studies. We outline possible next steps that may help accelerate progress from genetic studies to the biological knowledge that can guide the development of predictive, preventive, or therapeutic measures.

### Genetics of human gene expression: mapping DNA variants that influence gene expression [^1153KAsZ]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2009). Medium credibility.

There is extensive natural variation in human gene expression. As quantitative phenotypes, expression levels of genes are heritable. Genetic linkage and association mapping have identified cis- and trans-acting DNA variants that influence expression levels of human genes. New insights into human gene regulation are emerging from genetic analyses of gene expression in cells at rest and following exposure to stimuli. The integration of these genetic mapping results with data from co-expression networks is leading to a better understanding of how expression levels of individual genes are regulated and how genes interact with each other. These findings are important for basic understanding of gene regulation and of diseases that result from disruption of normal gene regulation.

### Guidelines for investigating causality of sequence variants in human disease [^116cJ8HT]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

This paper describes the challenges in reliably investigating the role of sequence variants in human disease, and approaches to evaluate the evidence supporting variant causality. It represents the conclusions of a working group of experts in genomic research, analysis and clinical diagnostic sequencing convened by the US National Human Genome Research Institute.

We focus on the application of genome-scale approaches to investigating rare germline variants, defined here as variants with a minor allele frequency of < 1%. Our recommendations are most relevant for variants with relatively large effects on disease risk. Our intended scope encompasses the vast majority of variants implicated in severe monogenic diseases as well as rare, large-effect risk variants in complex disease, but excludes the common, small-effect variants typically identified by genome-wide association studies of complex traits.

Unambiguous assignment of disease causality for sequence variants is often impossible, particularly for the very low-frequency variants underlying many cases of rare, severe diseases. Consequently, we refer in this manuscript to the concept of implicating a gene or sequence variant: that is, the process of integrating and assessing the evidence supporting a role for that gene or variant in pathogenesis. We emphasize the primacy of strong genetic support for causation for any new gene, which may then be supplemented and extended with ancillary support from functional and informatic studies.

Our recommendations centre on five key areas: study design; gene-level implication; variant-level implication; publication and databases; and implications for clinical diagnosis. Core guidelines for researchers are summarized in Box 2. We also provide a list of factors to consider in the analyses of candidate variants in presumed monogenic diseases (Supplementary Information) and a list of resources for assessing pathogenicity (Supplementary Table 1).

### Laboratory perspectives in the development of polygenic risk scores for disease: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^115yNa2G]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ACMG — Testing in the context of Mendelian conditions: If the PRS is being used within a joint prediction model for Mendelian disease risk, there are additional challenges in validating the use of these combined tests. The target populations for testing differ, as Mendelian testing is usually done in high-risk populations with significant family history and challenges exist with testing of healthy populations and should be given careful consideration keeping in mind the potential benefits and risks. The risk information conveyed by each test type differs; Mendelian variant curation frameworks rely on an understanding of disease mechanisms, PRS describes a statistical association, and high-risk does not indicate an underlying disease pathology, and PRS is solely considered screening information. There is no clear guidance on how these different types of risk information can be accurately combined or related to one another. The predicted phenotype of a PRS may not be appropriate for Mendelian diseases. When designing reports including both monogenic high-penetrance variants and PRS in a joint model, the potential effect on medical management must be considered, and many thresholds for prophylactic action or screening recommendations are dependent on lifetime or absolute risk of disease, which are traditionally dependent on well-established risks conferred by Mendelian conditions.

### Gene-or region-based analysis of genome-wide association studies [^114BaTLC]. Genetic Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

With rapid advances in genotyping technologies in recent years and the growing number of available markers, genome-wide association studies are emerging as promising approaches for the study of complex diseases and traits. However, there are several challenges with analysis and interpretation of such data. First, there is a massive multiple testing problem, due to the large number of markers that need to be analyzed, leading to an increased risk of false positives and decreased ability for association studies to detect truly associated markers. In particular, the ability to detect modest genetic effects can be severely compromised. Second, a genetic association of a given single-nucleotide polymorphism as determined by univariate statistical analyses does not typically explain biologically interesting features, and often requires subsequent interpretation using a higher unit, such as a gene or region, for example, as defined by haplotype blocks. Third, missing genotypes in the data set and other data quality issues can pose challenges when comparisons across platforms and replications are planned. Finally, depending on the type of univariate analysis, computational burden can arise as the number of markers continues to grow into the millions. One way to deal with these and related challenges is to consider higher units for the analysis, such as genes or regions. This article summarizes analytical methods and strategies that have been proposed and applied by Group 16 to two genome-wide association data sets made available through the Genetic Analysis Workshop 16.

### Mechanisms of disease: the genetic basis of coronary heart disease [^116zVDKa]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2007). Medium credibility.

Since completion of the human genome sequence, considerable progress has been made in determining the genetic basis of human diseases. Understanding the genetic basis of coronary heart disease (CHD), the leading cause of mortality in developed countries, is a priority. Here we provide an update on the genetic basis of CHD, focusing mainly on the clinical manifestations rather than the risk factors, most of which are heritable and also influenced by genetic factors. The challenges faced when identifying clinically relevant genetic determinants of CHD include phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, and gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. In addition, the etiologic spectrum includes common genetic variants with small effects, as well as rare genetic variants with large effects. Advances such as the cataloging of human genetic variation, new statistical approaches for analyzing massive amounts of genetic data, and the development of high-throughput single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping platforms, will increase the likelihood of success in the search for genetic determinants of CHD. Such knowledge could refine cardiovascular risk stratification and facilitate the development of new therapies.

### Finding a place for candidate gene studies in a genome-wide association study world… [^113HWrwJ]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Evidence of the association of patient genetics with TBI outcomes has been acquired in many ways. Rare but highly penetrant variants in genes, like CACNA1A, can cause life-threatening brain swelling in response to trivial head injury. 2 While such high-impact variants are rare, the last few decades have been witness to multiple candidate gene association studies, 3, 4 which have investigated whether more common variants in a host of different genes might be associated with TBI outcomes. The choice of genetic variants in these studies has been driven by a priori hypotheses regarding TBI pathophysiology. While this approach is rational, candidate gene studies have recognized shortcomings, 5 including low genetic coverage, selection bias, a high false positive rate, publication bias, and poor replication. In contrast, genome-wide association studies examine genetic associations with disease phenotype across the whole genome.

Their increasing use has provided important insights in many diseases, although not in TBI, to our knoweldge. 5 GWAS are unbiased and data-driven, can address millions of common genetic variants, and have well-accepted thresholds for multiple comparison. The study by Jha et al6 provides an example of a candidate gene study with strong supporting evidence. The SUR1-TRPM4 channel complex, which includes the sulphonylurea receptor, has been implicated in the pathophysiological processes of contusion expansion in TBI. Therefore, Jha et al6 sought to determine whether genetic variations in 2 genes, ABCC8 and TRPM4, were associated with progression of intracerebral hemorrhage after severe TBI. Jha et al6 genotyped 40 variants in these genes in 321 patients with severe TBI from a single center.

They found consistent signals that 4 upstream, relatively brain-specific single-nucleotide variations in ABCC8 were associated with increased risk of hemorrhage progression, and 4 SNVs in TRPM4 were associated with decreased hemorrhage progression. Addition of genetic information significantly improved estimation of hemorrhage progression compared with baseline models based on conventional clinical and laboratory covariates. Finally, Jha et al6 demonstrated an association of the candidate SNVs with structure and function of the SUR1-TRPM4 channel.

### Toward robust clinical genome interpretation: developing a consistent terminology to characterize mendelian disease-gene relationships-allelic requirement, inheritance modes, and disease mechanisms [^112fD3vc]. Genetics in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The clinical application of genomic data is reliant upon a robust understanding of the relationships between locus, genotype, mechanism, and disease phenotypes.

Assessment of the evidence that variants in a gene cause a particular monogenic disease is critical for variant classification, particularly for clinical application. – The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG and AMP) have issued standards and guidelines for the clinical interpretation of sequence variants, which have now been widely adopted internationally. These standards and further subsequent guidance make clear that the first step in the classification and interpretation of a variant is the robust assessment of disease-gene validity; without a clear understanding of the gene's role in disease, variant assessment criteria cannot be accurately applied. Using an incorrectly classified variant for family cascade testing and the delivery of screening, treatment, or reproductive choices can have severe adverse consequences.

Historically, disease genes were identified by linkage studies in large families, often using polymorphic markers in close proximity to the gene responsible for the disease. Subsequently, candidate gene studies based on known or hypothesized disease mechanisms became commonplace. Until as recently as 10 years ago, it was not fully appreciated that individually rare genetic variants are collectively extremely common. Exome sequencing typically yields 200 rare (gnomAD allele frequency < 0.1%) and a mean of 27 ± 13 novel (not present in population databases, number varies by ancestry) coding variants. Many studies reported new gene-disease associations without adequately controlling for background genetic variation in the population: inadequately small control cohorts, often just 100 chromosomes, were used for assessment of novel disease genes and variants, and consequently both the literature and disease databases were flooded with assertions of gene-disease relationships and variant pathogenicity that have not proven robust over time. – Recent years have seen concerted efforts to correct this bias, using large, publicly available population databases, such as ExAC and later gnomAD, as control cohorts, and applying standardized approaches to reinterpret evidence for gene-disease relationshipsand variant pathogenicity

### Synthetic associations in the context of genome-wide association scan signals [^116vmAhD]. Human Molecular Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified a large number of genetic variants associated with complex traits, but these only explain a small proportion of the total heritability. It has been recently proposed that rare variants can create 'synthetic association' signals in GWAS, by occurring more often in association with one of the alleles of a common tag single nucleotide polymorphism. While the ultimate evaluation of this hypothesis will require the completion of large-scale sequencing studies, it is informative to place it in the broader context of what is known about the genetic architecture of complex disease. In this review, we draw from empirical and theoretical data to summarize evidence showing that synthetic associations do not underlie many reported GWAS associations.

### Human disease genes [^113vwcvg]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

The complete human genome sequence will facilitate the identification of all genes that contribute to disease. We propose that the functional classification of disease genes and their products will reveal general principles of human disease. We have determined functional categories for nearly 1,000 documented disease genes, and found striking correlations between the function of the gene product and features of disease, such as age of onset and mode of inheritance. As knowledge of disease genes grows, including those contributing to complex traits, more sophisticated analyses will be possible; their results will yield a deeper understanding of disease and an enhanced integration of medicine with biology.

### Unique roles of rare variants in the genetics of complex diseases in humans [^112Y3rys]. Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Genome-wide association studies have identified > 10,000 genetic variants associated with various phenotypes and diseases. Although the majority are common variants, rare variants with > 0.1% of minor allele frequency have been investigated by imputation and using disease-specific custom SNP arrays. Rare variants sequencing analysis mainly revealed have played unique roles in the genetics of complex diseases in humans due to their distinctive features, in contrast to common variants. Unique roles are hypothesis-free evidence for gene causality, a precise target of functional analysis for understanding disease mechanisms, a new favorable target for drug development, and a genetic marker with high disease risk for personalized medicine. As whole-genome sequencing continues to identify more rare variants, the roles associated with rare variants will also increase. However, a better estimation of the functional impact of rare variants across whole genome is needed to enhance their contribution to improvements in human health.

### The IL-23 / IL-17 pathway in human chronic inflammatory diseases-new insight from genetics and targeted therapies [^116QpdV1]. Genes and Immunity (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, spondyloarthritis, and psoriasis cause significant morbidity and are a considerable burden for the patients in terms of pain, impaired function, and diminished quality of life, as well as for society, because of the associated high health-care costs and loss of productivity. Our limited understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in these diseases currently hinders early diagnosis and the development of more specific and effective therapies. The past years have been marked by considerable progress in our insight of the genetic basis of many diseases. In particular, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) performed with thousands of patients have provided detailed information about the genetic variants associated with a large number of chronic inflammatory diseases. These studies have brought to the forefront many genes linked to signaling pathways that were not previously known to be involved in pathogenesis, pointing to new directions in the study of disease mechanisms. GWAS also provided fundamental evidence for a key role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of these diseases, because many of the identified loci map to genes involved in different immune processes. However, the mechanisms by which disease-associated genetic variants act on disease development and the targeted cell populations remain poorly understood. The challenge of the post-GWAS era is to understand how these variants affect pathogenesis, to allow translation of genetic data into better diagnostics and innovative treatment strategies. Here, we review recent results that document the importance of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway for the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory diseases and summarize data that demonstrate how therapeutic targeting of this pathway can benefit affected patients.

### Genetic association studies [^112nnmAQ]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

We review the rationale behind and discuss methods of design and analysis of genetic association studies. There are similarities between genetic association studies and classic epidemiological studies of environmental risk factors but there are also issues that are specific to studies of genetic risk factors such as the use of particular family-based designs, the need to account for different underlying genetic mechanisms, and the effect of population history. Association differs from linkage (covered elsewhere in this series) in that the alleles of interest will be the same across the whole population. As with other types of genetic epidemiological study, issues of design, statistical analysis, and interpretation are very important.

### New models of collaboration in genome-wide association studies: the genetic association information network [^117SYEy3]. Nature Genetics (2007). Medium credibility.

The Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN) is a public-private partnership established to investigate the genetic basis of common diseases through a series of collaborative genome-wide association studies. GAIN has used new approaches for project selection, data deposition and distribution, collaborative analysis, publication and protection from premature intellectual property claims. These demonstrate a new commitment to shared scientific knowledge that should facilitate rapid advances in understanding the genetics of complex diseases.

### Use of functional genomics to identify candidate genes underlying human genetic association studies of vascular diseases [^1113xWmC]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2012). Low credibility.

Recent genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of genetic loci as being associated with vascular diseases or traits and their risk factors. Many of the loci uncovered represent novel discoveries with no obvious candidate genes and molecular mechanisms, testifying to the complexity of vascular diseases. To understand the functional consequences of genetic variations and help pinpoint the underlying genes and mechanisms of common complex diseases, functional genomics that integrate genetic variations and intermediate molecular traits such as gene expression has been extensively studied in the past few years. This review summarizes the key concepts of functional genomics, the current state of the field, and its application in vascular diseases.

### A brief history of human disease genetics [^113rXk4j]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

A primary goal of human genetics is to identify DNA sequence variants that influence biomedical traits, particularly those related to the onset and progression of human disease. Over the past 25 years, progress in realizing this objective has been transformed by advances in technology, foundational genomic resources and analytical tools, and by access to vast amounts of genotype and phenotype data. Genetic discoveries have substantially improved our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for many rare and common diseases and driven development of novel preventative and therapeutic strategies. Medical innovation will increasingly focus on delivering care tailored to individual patterns of genetic predisposition.

### New genetic and genomic approaches after the genome-wide association study era – back to the future [^1139PHxH]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Identification of all human genes and their regulatory regions provides the essential framework for our understanding of the molecular basis of disease. There is a lot of enthusiasm for applying next-generation sequencing methods toward achieving the goals of precision medicine. To do so will require us to go beyond genomics and fundamentally understand how genomics impacts on biology and clinical outcomes through gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions. Clinicians and healthcare systems alike need to embrace the cultural and mindset change needed for the implementation of genomics in the clinic.

### Genome-wide association studies for common diseases and complex traits [^116DkMgX]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2005). Medium credibility.

Genetic factors strongly affect susceptibility to common diseases and also influence disease-related quantitative traits. Identifying the relevant genes has been difficult, in part because each causal gene only makes a small contribution to overall heritability. Genetic association studies offer a potentially powerful approach for mapping causal genes with modest effects, but are limited because only a small number of genes can be studied at a time. Genome-wide association studies will soon become possible, and could open new frontiers in our understanding and treatment of disease. However, the execution and analysis of such studies will require great care.

### Exploring the phenotypic consequences of tissue specific gene expression variation inferred from GWAS summary statistics [^112kByPa]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Scalable, integrative methods to understand mechanisms that link genetic variants with phenotypes are needed. Here we derive a mathematical expression to compute PrediXcan (a gene mapping approach) results using summary data (S-PrediXcan) and show its accuracy and general robustness to misspecified reference sets. We apply this framework to 44 GTEx tissues and 100+ phenotypes from GWAS and meta-analysis studies, creating a growing public catalog of associations that seeks to capture the effects of gene expression variation on human phenotypes. Replication in an independent cohort is shown. Most of the associations are tissue specific, suggesting context specificity of the trait etiology. Colocalized significant associations in unexpected tissues underscore the need for an agnostic scanning of multiple contexts to improve our ability to detect causal regulatory mechanisms. Monogenic disease genes are enriched among significant associations for related traits, suggesting that smaller alterations of these genes may cause a spectrum of milder phenotypes.

### Combining exome / genome sequencing with data repository analysis reveals novel gene-disease associations for a wide range of genetic disorders [^1156JSV3]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

More than half of patients with genetic diseases remain undiagnosed, even after conducting genome-wide diagnostic approaches, such as exome and genome sequencing. Despite recent technological advances, the challenge of variant interpretation remains, in part due to the missing gene–phenotype link.

The methods applied for the identification of causal gene defects for monogenic diseases have changed drastically in the last 10 years. Genome-wide scans using polymorphic microsatellite markers or single-nucleotide variants followed by linkage analysis were the predominant genetic mapping approach used in the past. This changed dramatically after the implementation and routine application of exome/genome sequencing in genetic research. Currently, most family-based approaches for disease gene identification rely on the analysis of exome or genome data. Study designs vary from including single unrelated individuals with a similar phenotype to typical family-based studies with the inclusion of several affected and unaffected relatives to focus on regions of homozygosity or using the de novo approach. Furthermore, phenocentric (focused on specific patients and phenotypes) and genocentric (focused on database analyses and algorithms) approaches have been described. Identification of candidate genes/variants associated with disease is usually followed by replication in other unrelated, similarly affected patients and/or functional studies to validate variants' pathogenicity.

The unambiguous assignment of disease causality is often difficult to achieve, and, in many cases, the initially collected evidence is insufficient to prove causality. The rarity, severity, and clinical heterogeneity of many genetic disorders complicates the process of finding additional patients. Furthermore, the lack of knowledge on the gene/protein function challenges the final assignment of gene causality. Thus, the gene candidacy remains inconclusive and is considered as a research gene.

Within this study, we analyzed exome/genome data together with the respective clinical phenotypes of the patients using Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) to identify novel gene–disease associations and to validate previously reported candidate genes. We present six novel gene–disease associations and the confirmation of 31 additional candidate genes. The outcome has substantial implications for the diagnosis and counseling of the patients and their families.

### Reporting and evaluating genetic association studies [^115hJBfj]. Respiratory Research (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This commentary discusses many of the issues that must be addressed in performing and reporting genetic association studies, including SNP discovery, genotyping and haplotype analysis; population size, matching of cases and controls, and population stratification; phenotype definition and the issue of multiple related phenotypes; multiple testing; replication; and the special issues of genomewide association studies and functional studies. All of these issues must be addressed to ensure high quality genetic association studies. The extent, to which authors can address these issues, plus the novelty and importance of their observations, will play a major role in determining the suitability of the manuscript for publication.

### Opportunities and challenges associated with clinical diagnostic genome sequencing: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^116q2KDP]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2012). Medium credibility.

Clinical utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) is characterized by broad application potential, decision impact, and evaluation challenges: Aided by the rapidly decreasing cost of data generation, large-scale personal genome sequencing will be applied to diverse settings, and with proper interpretation NGS will permit a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms, allowing for more evidence-based medical interventions, influencing medical decisions including personalized treatment, monitoring of disease progression, and assessments of disease risk, prognosis, and reproductive matters. Some genome testing will inevitably be offered directly to consumers; in such a setting, consumers will decide independently whether they want to learn about topics ranging from ancestry to disease risks. Clinical utility is described as a measure of the net health benefits, reflected by the balance of benefit versus harm, and accurate evaluation considers factors such as test rationale, patient population, and clinical scenarios, following an individualized evidence-based approach for each patient to separate information with demonstrated medical utility from information with less clear or missing utility evidence. Given NGS data density, variants of unknown significance are encountered many times and our understanding of the biological, pathophysiological, and functional impact of certain genome regions and sequence changes remains limited; thus, the development of evidence-based, validated scientific standards to evaluate clinical utility with accurate genotype-based risk estimation is a considerable challenge, and there is a possibility of potential overinterpretation of results that could lead to unnecessary medical action.

### How to interpret a genome-wide association study [^114kPW2b]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Genome-wide association (GWA) studies use high-throughput genotyping technologies to assay hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and relate them to clinical conditions and measurable traits. Since 2005, nearly 100 loci for as many as 40 common diseases and traits have been identified and replicated in GWA studies, many in genes not previously suspected of having a role in the disease under study, and some in genomic regions containing no known genes. GWA studies are an important advance in discovering genetic variants influencing disease but also have important limitations, including their potential for false-positive and false-negative results and for biases related to selection of study participants and genotyping errors. Although these studies are clearly many steps removed from actual clinical use, and specific applications of GWA findings in prevention and treatment are actively being pursued, at present these studies mainly represent a valuable discovery tool for examining genomic function and clarifying pathophysiologic mechanisms. This article describes the design, interpretation, application, and limitations of GWA studies for clinicians and scientists for whom this evolving science may have great relevance.

### Whole-genome sequencing to understand the genetic architecture of common gene expression and biomarker phenotypes [^114jXX7U]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Initial results from sequencing studies suggest that there are relatively few low-frequency (minor allele frequency < 5%) variants associated with large effects on common human phenotypes. However, few of these sequencing experiments have used sample sizes similar to those required to identify most common variant–phenotype associations. Still fewer sequencing studies have examined the whole genome, instead most have focused on exomes or targeted sets of genes or have focused on population genetics rather than phenotype associations. Given that the proportion of phenotype variance explained is a function of allele frequency and effect size [approximated as β 2 × (2 pq)], limitations in sample size mean that many current sequencing studies are powered to detect only those single low-frequency variants that explain substantially more phenotypic variance than single common SNPs. In this study, we define 'low frequency–large effect' as a variant that has a minor allele frequency < 5% but that has a sufficiently large per-allele effect on a phenotype that it explains a similar proportion of phenotypic variance as common variants detectable in the same sample size.

Current whole-genome and exome sequencing-based studies are aiming to answer several questions of relevance to common disease and quantitative phenotypes. First, how many low frequency and rare variant associations can we reasonably expect to identify and in what sample sizes? Second, are common variant–common phenotype associations driven by low frequency associations? Third, could we do just as well by imputing genotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project and other reference panels? These questions are important for a number of reasons. First, it is known that most human genetic variation is low frequency and rare but there is considerable debate as to how best to identify which of these variants are associated with common phenotypes. Studies include whole-exome and gene-targeted approaches low-pass sequencing in unrelated individuals and high-pass sequencing in families. Second, if low frequency and rare variants are responsible for many common variant–common phenotype associations it will likely implicate a different set of causal genes and regulatory elements for follow up. Finally, few studies have tested the power of imputation from reference panels to identify low-frequency association signals and this approach could be the most efficient way of studying lower frequency effects in large sample sizes, as recently shown by a deCODE study.

### Biological interpretation of genome-wide association studies using predicted gene functions [^114pK2Ve]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The main challenge for gaining biological insights from genetic associations is identifying which genes and pathways explain the associations. Here we present DEPICT, an integrative tool that employs predicted gene functions to systematically prioritize the most likely causal genes at associated loci, highlight enriched pathways and identify tissues/cell types where genes from associated loci are highly expressed. DEPICT is not limited to genes with established functions and prioritizes relevant gene sets for many phenotypes.

### Unique roles of rare variants in the genetics of complex diseases in humans [^113joWJs]. Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Rare variants play unique roles in the genetics of complex diseases in humans, including as hypothesis-free evidence of gene causality, a precise target of functional analysis for understanding disease mechanisms, a new target for drug development, and a genetic marker with high disease risk for personalized medicine (Fig. 1). Advances in WGS will continue to allow for the identification of rare variants, where a better estimation of the functional impact of each rare variant across the whole genome will provide paramount benefits to human health.

### Genome-wide association studies of cancer [^113VBfwF]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Knowledge of the inherited risk for cancer is an important component of preventive oncology. In addition to well-established syndromes of cancer predisposition, much remains to be discovered about the genetic variation underlying susceptibility to common malignancies. Increased knowledge about the human genome and advances in genotyping technology have made possible genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of human diseases. These studies have identified many important regions of genetic variation associated with an increased risk for human traits and diseases including cancer. Understanding the principles, major findings, and limitations of GWAS is becoming increasingly important for oncologists as dissemination of genomic risk tests directly to consumers is already occurring through commercial companies. GWAS have contributed to our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer and will shed light on biologic pathways and possible new strategies for targeted prevention. To date, however, the clinical utility of GWAS-derived risk markers remains limited.

### 15 years of genome-wide association studies and no signs of slowing down [^115VSqL1]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

When the Human Genome Project (HGP) was launched in 1993, the expectation was that genomics would transform clinical care, providing the insights needed to develop better diagnostic, prognostic, preventive, and therapeutic strategies for rare and common diseases. Upon completion of the HGP in 2003, the genome-wide association approach was hailed as the key gene discovery paradigm to translate these expectations into practice. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) screen the genome for associations between millions of genetic variants and a disease or trait without any a priori hypothesis. As such, GWASs may reveal new genes and pathways not previously implicated in the disease pathology.

While the very first GWAS was published in 2005, it was the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) that in 2007 set the stage for many more GWASs to come. With their pivotal paper, the WTCCC demonstrated that combining forces (large sample sizes), a rigorous study design (discovery and replication stages), and stringent criteria (multiple testing corrected significance level) were needed for reproducible discoveries. By the time Nature Communications was launched in April 2010, GWASs had already accelerated the rate of gene discovery to an unprecedented scale, identifying more than 3000 unique loci for over 250 disease/trait outcomes. These numbers increased exponentially over the subsequent 10 years, and to date, more than 4300 papers have reported on 4500 GWASs and over 55,000 unique loci for nearly 5000 diseases and traits. Summary statistics for most GWASs have been made publicly available, and a number of user-friendly data portals allow scientists to query GWAS data freely (Box 1).

### Properties of human disease genes and the role of genes linked to mendelian disorders in complex disease aetiology [^115yqViS]. Human Molecular Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Improving our understanding of genetic mutations and potential genetic risk factors directly causing, or contributing to, human diseases is at the core of modern medical genetics. In that context, evolutionary theory can be used to characterize the selective forces that have acted on the causal and susceptibility alleles underlying human genetic disorders. Complex disorders are common in the general population and result from the interaction of several susceptibility loci and environmental factors. In contrast, Mendelian disorders are typically rare and have predictable inheritance patterns as they usually result from a single causative mutation in a gene. However, heterogeneity and incomplete penetrance suggest that the classical distinction between Mendelian and complex diseases is not always absolute and that a continuum exists between the purely Mendelian and the most complex diseases. Although several unclear situations are found, since many genes harbour mutations that are unequivocally linked to particular Mendelian diseases, one can still define a set of genes linked to Mendelian diseases. Recent advances in medical research have resulted in large catalogues of mutations causing Mendelian hereditary disorders and of susceptibility loci contributing to complex diseases, such as those of the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database and the Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) Catalogue. This biomedical information, when coupled with the increasing public availability of whole genome sequences, can be used to elucidate the genetic architecture and natural history of human genetic diseases.

### Guidelines for investigating causality of sequence variants in human disease [^114jLZit]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

Such methods may not yet be applicable to every rare disease scenario, and will require work to extend to more exotic inheritance modes such as parental imprinting or obligate compound heterozygosity. Although formal methods are established to perform these tests rigorously, researchers should at the very least evaluate and report the level of background variation in an implicated gene in population cohorts, taking advantage of public resources such as the Exome Variant Server when implicating a new gene in pathogenesis. Furthermore, the analysis of at least some number of controls, sequenced and analysed in a manner identical to cases, can be critical for avoiding the systematic false positives that remain commonplace in exome and genome sequencing.

Just as for genome-wide association studies of common variants, replication of newly-implicated disease genes in independent families or population cohorts is critical supporting evidence, and in most cases essential for a novel gene to be regarded as convincingly implicated in disease. For the rarest disorders additional cases for independent replication may be unavailable and it may be impossible to make a compelling statistical case for implication from human genetic data alone. In these cases, gene implication must be based on an integrated analysis of genetic, informatic and experimental evidence.

### Genome-wide association studies overview-NCI… [^114CGVb5]. dceg.cancer.gov (2016). Low credibility.

A genome-wide association study is an approach to compare the genomes from many different people to find genetic markers associated with a particular phenotype or risk of disease. The goal is to understand how genes contribute to the disease and to use that understanding to help develop better prevention and treatment strategies. The Division maintains a robust research program including GWAS for a number of cancers, and more recently, exposures and survival. Researchers apply fine-mapping and deep sequencing techniques to regions or loci identified by these scans to pinpoint the specific functional variants responsible for disease risk and the biologic mechanisms involved. Large-scale consortial arrangements make it possible to combine study resources in a coordinated intramural/extramural approach that enables rapid replication of positive findings using independent data sets.

When reproducible findings emerge, the pooling of data sets provides the statistical power to quantify the risks associated with specific gene variants and exposures, and enables subset analyses that can uncover gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. This collaborative infrastructure presents the cancer research community with an extraordinary opportunity to advance research while taking advantage of economies of scale. It also provides an opportunity for NCI to partner with other NIH institutes to investigate a series of complex diseases and traits including diabetes, cardiovascular, neurological disorders, obesity, and smoking behaviors. By making the data available through rapid posting, NIH can leverage its resources to ensure that the dramatic advances in genomics are incorporated into rigorous population-based studies. Ultimately, findings from these studies may yield new preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions for cancer. Nat Comms.

### The role of phenotype in gene discovery in the whole genome sequencing era [^113Jw7b3]. Human Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

As whole genome sequence becomes a routine component of gene discovery studies in humans, we will have an exhaustive catalog of genetic variation and the challenge becomes understanding the phenotypic consequences of these variants. Statistical genetic methods and analytical approaches that are concerned with optimizing phenotypes for gene discovery for complex traits offer two general categories of advantages. They may increase power to localize genes of interest and also aid in interpreting associations between genetic variants and disease outcomes by suggesting potential mechanisms and pathways through which genes may affect outcomes. Such phenotype optimization approaches include use of allied phenotypes such as symptoms or ages of onset to reduce genetic heterogeneity within a set of cases, study of quantitative risk factors or endophenotypes, joint analyses of related phenotypes, and derivation of new phenotypes designed to extract independent measures underlying the correlations among a set of related phenotypes through approaches such as principal components. New opportunities are also presented by technological advances that permit efficient collection of hundreds or thousands of phenotypes on an individual, including phenotypes more proximal to the level of gene action such as levels of gene expression, microRNAs, or metabolic and proteomic profiles.

### Strategies for fine-mapping complex traits [^114PHagr]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of robust and replicable genetic associations for complex disease. However, the identification of the causal variants that underlie these associations has been more difficult. This problem of fine-mapping association signals predates GWAS, but the last few years have seen a surge of studies aimed at pinpointing causal variants using both statistical evidence from large association data sets and functional annotations of genetic variants. Combining these two approaches can often determine not only the causal variant but also the target gene. Recent contributions include analyses of custom genotyping arrays, such as the Immunochip, statistical methods to identify credible sets of causal variants and the addition of functional genomic annotations for coding and non-coding variation to help prioritize variants and discern functional consequence and hence the biological basis of disease risk.

### Standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants: a joint consensus recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology [^1127mWcr]. Genetics in Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Complex trait risk alleles — reporting guidance and scope: In common diseases, risk alleles can explain only up to 10% of population variance, and this recommendation does not address the interpretation and reporting of complex trait alleles; when such alleles are encountered during sequencing of Mendelian genes, the terms "pathogenic" and "likely pathogenic" are not appropriate, and an interim solution is to report these variants as "risk alleles" or in an "other reportable" category, with evidence descriptors such as "established risk allele", "likely risk allele", or "uncertain risk allele".

### Epistasis and its implications for personal genetics [^1179L7Kh]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

The widespread availability of high-throughput genotyping technology has opened the door to the era of personal genetics, which brings to consumers the promise of using genetic variations to predict individual susceptibility to common diseases. Despite easy access to commercial personal genetics services, our knowledge of the genetic architecture of common diseases is still very limited and has not yet fulfilled the promise of accurately predicting most people at risk. This is partly because of the complexity of the mapping relationship between genotype and phenotype that is a consequence of epistasis (gene-gene interaction) and other phenomena such as gene-environment interaction and locus heterogeneity. Unfortunately, these aspects of genetic architecture have not been addressed in most of the genetic association studies that provide the knowledge base for interpreting large-scale genetic association results. We provide here an introductory review of how epistasis can affect human health and disease and how it can be detected in population-based studies. We provide some thoughts on the implications of epistasis for personal genetics and some recommendations for improving personal genetics in light of this complexity.

### Realizing the promise of genome-wide association studies for effector gene prediction [^113NhpBP]. Nature Genetics (2025). High credibility.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify regions of the genome in which genetic variation is associated with the risk of complex diseases, such as diabetes, or the magnitude of traits, such as blood pressure. Determining which 'effector genes' mediate the effects of GWAS associations is essential to using GWAS to understand disease mechanisms and develop new therapies. In recent years, GWAS authors have increasingly included effector gene predictions as part of their study results. However, the research community has not yet converged on standards for generating or reporting these predictions. In this Perspective, we illustrate the diversity of the evidence types used to support effector gene predictions and argue for future initiatives to increase their accessibility and usefulness.

### Genome-wide association studies: a powerful tool for neurogenomics [^115eMVdP]. Neurosurgical Focus (2010). Low credibility.

As their power and utility increase, genome-wide association (GWA) studies are poised to become an important element of the neurosurgeon's toolkit for diagnosing and treating disease. In this paper, the authors review recent findings and discuss issues associated with gathering and analyzing GWA data for the study of neurological diseases and disorders, including those of neurosurgical importance. Their goal is to provide neurosurgeons and other clinicians with a better understanding of the practical and theoretical issues associated with this line of research. A modern GWA study involves testing hundreds of thousands of genetic markers across an entire genome, often in thousands of individuals, for any significant association with a particular disease. The number of markers assayed in a study presents several practical and theoretical issues that must be considered when planning the study. Genome-wide association studies show great promise in our understanding of the genes underlying common neurological diseases and disorders, as well as in leading to a new generation of genetic tests for clinicians.

### Dissecting the genetics of complex traits using summary association statistics [^117Vrvtc]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2017). Medium credibility.

During the past decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to successfully identify tens of thousands of genetic variants associated with complex traits and diseases. These studies have produced extensive repositories of genetic variation and trait measurements across large numbers of individuals, providing tremendous opportunities for further analyses. However, privacy concerns and other logistical considerations often limit access to individual-level genetic data, motivating the development of methods that analyse summary association statistics. Here, we review recent progress on statistical methods that leverage summary association data to gain insights into the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases.

### Beyond GWASs: illuminating the dark road from association to function [^115d82Xe]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have enabled the discovery of common genetic variation contributing to normal and pathological traits and clinical drug responses, but recognizing the precise targets of these associations is now the major challenge. Here, we review recent approaches to the functional follow-up of GWAS loci, including fine mapping of GWAS signal(s), prioritization of putative functional SNPs by the integration of genetic epidemiological and bioinformatic methods, and in vitro and in vivo experimental verification of predicted molecular mechanisms for identifying the targeted genes. The majority of GWAS-identified variants fall in noncoding regions of the genome. Therefore, this review focuses on strategies for assessing likely mechanisms affected by noncoding variants; such mechanisms include transcriptional regulation, noncoding RNA function, and epigenetic regulation. These approaches have already accelerated progress from genetic studies to biological knowledge and might ultimately guide the development of prognostic, preventive, and therapeutic measures.

### A gene-centric approach to genome-wide association studies [^1124aNhG]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2006). Medium credibility.

Genic variants are more likely to alter gene function and affect disease risk than those that occur outside genes. Variants in genes, however, might not be sufficiently covered by the existing approaches to genome-wide association studies. Our analysis of the HapMap ENCODE data indicates that this concern is valid, and that an alternative approach that focuses on genic variants provides a more complete coverage of functionally important regions and a greater genotyping efficiency. We therefore argue that resources should be developed to make gene-centric genome-wide association studies feasible.

### Understanding the contribution of synonymous mutations to human disease [^115B4B8f]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2011). Medium credibility.

Synonymous mutations - sometimes called 'silent' mutations - are now widely acknowledged to be able to cause changes in protein expression, conformation and function. The recent increase in knowledge about the association of genetic variants with disease, particularly through genome-wide association studies, has revealed a substantial contribution of synonymous SNPs to human disease risk and other complex traits. Here we review current understanding of the extent to which synonymous mutations influence disease, the various molecular mechanisms that underlie these effects and the implications for future research and biomedical applications.

### Multiple sclerosis genetics: results from meta-analyses of candidate-gene association studies [^112KKTvC]. Cytokine (2018). Low credibility.

As a complex disease, multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility implicates many genetic and environmental factors. Usually, individual genetic association studies have several limitations, and results are specific to the population of study. The Meta-analysis approach has been proposed to resolve these limitations and to increase the power of statistical analyses. In this review, we summarize results from meta-analyses of candidate genes of MS. Using the keywords: multiple sclerosis, genetic polymorphism and meta-analysis, we searched electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Web of Sciences) for published meta-analyses until May 2017. Meta-analyses confirmed the association of polymorphisms in fifteen candidate genes with MS disease. However, polymorphisms in fourteen genes showed none significant association. Results outlined the importance of confirmed genes to understand signaling pathways in MS disease and shed light on their utility to develop new drugs targets.

### Estimation of the multiple testing burden for genomewide association studies of nearly all common variants [^115CNvWD]. Genetic Epidemiology (2008). Low credibility.

Genomewide association studies are an exciting strategy in genetics, recently becoming feasible and harvesting many novel genes linked to multiple phenotypes. Determining the significance of results in the face of testing a genomewide set of multiple hypotheses, most of which are producing noisy, null-distributed association signals, presents a challenge to the wide community of association researchers. Rather than each study engaging in independent evaluation of significance standards, we have undertaken the task of developing such standards for genomewide significance, based on data collected by the International Haplotype Map Consortium. We report an estimated testing burden of a million independent tests genomewide in Europeans, and twice that number in Africans. We further identify the sensitivity of the testing burden to the required significance level, with implications to staged design of association studies.

### Genetic associations of protein-coding variants in human disease [^113o5d87]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Main

Inherited variations in protein-coding and non-coding DNA have a role in the risk, onset and progression of human disease. Traditionally, geneticists have dichotomized diseases as either caused by coding mutations in single genes that tend to be rare, highly penetrant and frequently compromise survival and reproduction (often termed 'Mendelian' diseases), or as common diseases that show a complex pattern of inheritance influenced by the joint contributions of hundreds of low-impact, typically non-coding genetic variants (often termed 'complex' diseases). For both rare and common conditions, large human cohorts systematically characterized for a respective trait of interest have enabled the identification of thousands of disease-relevant variants through either sequencing-based approaches or GWAS. Nevertheless, the exact causal alleles and mechanisms that underlie associations of genetic variants to disease have so far remained largely elusive.

In recent years, population biobanks have been added to the toolkit for disease gene discovery. Biobanks provide the opportunity to simultaneously investigate multiple traits and diseases at once and uncover relationships between previously unconnected phenotypes. For instance, the UK Biobank (UKB) is a resource that captures detailed phenotype information matched to genetic data for more than 500,000 individuals and, since its inception, has facilitated biomedical discoveries at an unprecedented scale. We and others have recently reported on the ongoing efforts to sequence the exomes of all UKB participants and link genetic findings to a broad range of phenotypes –. We also established FinnGen (FG), an academic–industry collaboration to identify genotype–phenotype correlations in the Finnish founder population with the aim of better understanding how the genome affects health. Finland is a well-established genetic isolate and a unique gene pool distinguishes Finns from other Europeans. The distinct Finnish haplotype structure is characterized by large blocks of co-inherited DNA in linkage disequilibrium and an enrichment for alleles that are rare in other populations, but can still be confidently imputed from genotyping data even in the rare and ultra-rare allele frequency spectrum –. Through combining imputed genotypes with detailed phenotypes ascertained through national registries, FG holds the promise to provide particular insights into the so far little examined allele frequency spectrum between 0.1 and 2%, where both sequencing studies and GWAS have so far remained largely underpowered in relation to identifying associations with disease. This spectrum includes many coding variants with moderate to large effect sizes that can help identify causal genes in GWAS loci, provide mechanistic insights into disease pathologies, and potentially bridge rare and common diseases.

### The statistical properties of gene-set analysis [^113ANrQX]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2016). Medium credibility.

The rapid increase in loci discovered in genome-wide association studies has created a need to understand the biological implications of these results. Gene-set analysis provides a means of gaining such understanding, but the statistical properties of gene-set analysis are not well understood, which compromises our ability to interpret its results. In this Analysis article, we provide an extensive statistical evaluation of the core structure that is inherent to all gene- set analyses and we examine current implementations in available tools. We show which factors affect valid and successful detection of gene sets and which provide a solid foundation for performing and interpreting gene-set analysis.

### Estimating genome-wide significance for whole-genome sequencing studies [^113icerQ]. Genetic Epidemiology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Complex-trait genetic association studies aim to identify robust associations between genotype and phenotype in order to enhance our understanding of the underlying biological processes contributing to the trait of interest. The field of complex-trait genetics has thus far focused on the study of common (minor allele frequency [MAF] ≥ 0.05) variants through candidate gene studies and, in recent years, through genome-wide association scans (GWAS). The candidate gene study era was unsuccessful in identifying many reproducible associations, partly due to the liberal thresholds used to declare statistical significance, and the issue of multiple testing became even more pronounced with the advent of GWAS. To guard against lenient significance thresholds, a genome-wide significance level was estimated, based on a Bonferroni correction for the number of independent (i.e. uncorrelated) common variants across the genome: 5×10 −8 [Dudbridge and Gusnanto; Gao et al; Pe'er et al.]. Adherence to this threshold has served the field well, with a very high proportion of genome-wide significant signals withstanding replication.

### Functional genomics and its implications for molecular medicine [^115n5vBk]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Technological development in genetics and genomics provides unprecedented possibilities to identify the underlying molecular basic of many common diseases. With the availability of the human genome sequence and growing information on the most frequent DNA variations combined with the molecular analysis on the RNA expression and protein level, diseases might be characterized in the future at the molecular level. Describing gene function anf the specific role of DNA, RNA, and proteins in the disease process provides novel diagnosis tools and treatment. Ultimately how the unique genetic signature of an individual influences the risk and prognosis of disease will be the basis for individualized medicine in the years to come.

### Personalized medicine: new genomics, old lessons [^115LjRoo]. Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical translation of genetic markers can take place even in the absence of a complete understanding of their functional biologic significance

The use of linkage or "reverse genetics" led to discoveries of the basis of single gene disorders, such as hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, and breast cancer (reviewed in Botstein and Risch). In the case of BRCA1, over 15 years after its discovery, its myriad cellular roles continue to be defined (Boulton), complicating prediction of the functional (hence clinical) significance of missense variants routinely detected (Spearman et al.). The same limitation applies for the estimated 50,000–200,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which may contribute to disease (Orr and Chanock). Non-synonymous SNPs in exons are the most amenable to estimation of their functional significance, however, even synonymous SNPs can effect mRNA stability and alter splicing signals, and have been linked to diseases such as androgen-insensitivity syndrome and thrombasthenia (Chamary et al.). SNPs in introns and regulatory regions, and SNPs in "gene deserts" may affect gene regulation, as in the case of prothrombin disorders, schizophrenia, or colon cancer (Poort et al; Law et al; Pomerantz et al.). Recognizing that most SNPs are merely "markers" of a genetic lesion, and that frequencies of disease-associated SNPs may be obscured or falsely elevated as a result of population heterogeneity, the lack of a precise biological understanding of genetic or genomic associations limits but does not preclude their clinical application. In the mid 1990s, we and others counseled families regarding prophylactic mastectomies based only on markers linked to the BRCA1 locus. Today, we and others will soon offer testing for risk modifying variants affecting BRCA2 penetrance and expressivity (Gaudet et al; Antoniou et al.), even in the absence of knowledge of their function. The proof of clinical utility of genetic or genomic predictive markers does not depend on a complete biological functional understanding of the genetic variant in question, although such an understanding remains critical for pharmacologic targeting.

### Gearing up for genome-wide gene-association studies [^111ttY9p]. Human Molecular Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

One of the grand challenges of human genetics to systematically map by gene-association susceptibility genes for complex diseases is underway. High-throughput genotyping platforms have been developed; a comprehensive map of human genetic variation (HapMap) to guide efficient marker selection is imminent and many researchers have assembled suitable cohorts of patients. Expectations are understandably high and it is timely to review the promise and pitfalls of this strategy.

### Genome interpretation using in silico predictors of variant impact [^116Q4ZWS]. Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Estimating the effects of variants found in disease driver genes opens the door to personalized therapeutic opportunities. Clinical associations and laboratory experiments can only characterize a tiny fraction of all the available variants, leaving the majority as variants of unknown significance (VUS). In silico methods bridge this gap by providing instant estimates on a large scale, most often based on the numerous genetic differences between species. Despite concerns that these methods may lack reliability in individual subjects, their numerous practical applications over cohorts suggest they are already helpful and have a role to play in genome interpretation when used at the proper scale and context. In this review, we aim to gain insights into the training and validation of these variant effect predicting methods and illustrate representative types of experimental and clinical applications. Objective performance assessments using various datasets that are not yet published indicate the strengths and limitations of each method. These show that cautious use of in silico variant impact predictors is essential for addressing genome interpretation challenges.

### Properties of human disease genes and the role of genes linked to mendelian disorders in complex disease aetiology [^112abqnj]. Human Molecular Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Annotation datasets and gene groups considered

All protein-coding human genes from Ensembl were categorized in different non-overlapping groups according to the information of previously described public datasets to perform two levels of analyses. Initially, genes were categorized as Mendelian according to the information in the hOMIM database (a hand-curated version of the OMIM database that contains all genes that contribute to diseases with a simple genetic basis), or as associated with complex diseases if they were described in the GWAS catalogue, which contains only variants showing a significance level ≤ 9×10 − 6. We excluded infectious diseases and considered only association studies performed in populations of European ancestry, and binary disease traits, independently of the heritability levels of the complex diseases and the explained variance of the GWAS hits. For each trait, we analysed only the genes reported by the authors of each single association study in the GWAS catalog, but if a reported gene was not available, all the genes mapped by the database curators through an automated pipeline were gathered from the corresponding entry. Genes annotated with any of the 46 prenatal, perinatal or postnatal lethal phenotypes detected by knock-out experiments in mice were considered as mouse essential genes. Those human genes that were orthologues of mouse essential genes were then annotated as putative essentials in humans.

### Resolving the variable genome and epigenome in human disease [^112KZtaC]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The individual human genome and epigenome are being defined at unprecedented resolution by current advances in sequencing technologies with important implications for human disease. This review uses examples relevant to clinical practice to illustrate the functional consequences of genetic and epigenetic variation. The insights gained from genome-wide association studies are described together with current efforts to understand the role of rare variants in common disease, set in the context of recent successes in Mendelian traits through the application of whole exome sequencing. The application of functional genomics to interrogate the genome and epigenome, build up an integrated picture of the regulatory genomic landscape and inform disease association studies is discussed, together with the role of expression quantitative trait mapping and analysis of allele-specific gene expression.

### Genetic architecture: the shape of the genetic contribution to human traits and disease [^115wHwo9]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2018). Medium credibility.

Genetic architecture describes the characteristics of genetic variation that are responsible for heritable phenotypic variability. It depends on the number of genetic variants affecting a trait, their frequencies in the population, the magnitude of their effects and their interactions with each other and the environment. Defining the genetic architecture of a complex trait or disease is central to the scientific and clinical goals of human genetics, which are to understand disease aetiology and aid in disease screening, diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. Recent technological advances have enabled genome-wide association studies and emerging next-generation sequencing studies to begin to decipher the nature of the heritable contribution to traits and disease. Here, we describe the types of genetic architecture that have been observed, how architecture can be measured and why an improved understanding of genetic architecture is central to future advances in the field.

### Opportunities and challenges associated with clinical diagnostic genome sequencing: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^115Y5p3W]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2012). Medium credibility.

Common complex diseases — genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) catalogs highlight scale and limits: 11 million SNPs and three million indels have been characterized, dense SNP chips have facilitated GWAS with many cases and controls (> 1000 per group), and genome.gov catalogues > 1200 polymorphisms that confer disease risk in > 165 common human diseases and traits, yet multiple risk alleles only explain approximately 5% of the variance in the population. At the individual level, the uncovering of three million SNPs within a genome requires interpretive knowledge, and the full potential can only be realized when the genome sequences of thousands of individuals are available and linked to corresponding phenotypes; data mining initiatives such as the U.K. 10,000 Genomes Project may refine disease pathways and clarify how specific alleles present as protective or deleterious.

### The IL-23 / IL-17 pathway in human chronic inflammatory diseases-new insight from genetics and targeted therapies [^112BWxbP]. Microbes and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, spondyloarthritis and psoriasis cause significant morbidity and are a considerable burden for the patients in terms of pain, impaired function and diminished quality of life, as well as for society, because of the associated high health-care costs, and loss of productivity. Our limited understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in these diseases currently hinders early diagnosis and the development of more specific and effective therapies. The past years have been marked by considerable progress in our insight of the genetic basis of many diseases. In particular, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) performed with thousands of patients have provided detailed information about the genetic variants associated with a large number of chronic inflammatory diseases. These studies have brought to the forefront many genes linked to signaling pathways that were not previously known to be involved in pathogenesis, pointing to new directions in the study of disease mechanisms. GWAS also provided fundamental evidence for a key role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of these diseases, because many of the identified loci map to genes involved in different immune processes. However, the mechanisms by which disease-associated genetic variants act on disease development and the targeted cell populations remain poorly understood. The challenge of the post-GWAS era is to understand how these variants affect pathogenesis, to allow translation of genetic data into better diagnostics and innovative treatment strategies. Here, we review recent results that document the importance of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway for the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory diseases and summarize data that demonstrate how therapeutic targeting of this pathway can benefit affected patients.

### Genome-wide association studies: theoretical and practical concerns [^115ZkBF9]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2005). Medium credibility.

To fully understand the allelic variation that underlies common diseases, complete genome sequencing for many individuals with and without disease is required. This is still not technically feasible. However, recently it has become possible to carry out partial surveys of the genome by genotyping large numbers of common SNPs in genome-wide association studies. Here, we outline the main factors - including models of the allelic architecture of common diseases, sample size, map density and sample-collection biases - that need to be taken into account in order to optimize the cost efficiency of identifying genuine disease-susceptibility loci.

### A perspective on interaction effects in genetic association studies [^1138ZrWj]. Genetic Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

ABSTRACT

The identification of gene–gene and gene–environment interaction in human traits and diseases is an active area of research that generates high expectation, and most often lead to high disappointment. This is partly explained by a misunderstanding of the inherent characteristics of standard regression‐based interaction analyses. Here, I revisit and untangle major theoretical aspects of interaction tests in the special case of linear regression; in particular, I discuss variables coding scheme, interpretation of effect estimate, statistical power, and estimation of variance explained in regard of various hypothetical interaction patterns. Linking this components it appears first that the simplest biological interaction models — in which the magnitude of a genetic effect depends on a common exposure — are among the most difficult to identify. Second, I highlight the demerit of the current strategy to evaluate the contribution of interaction effects to the variance of quantitative outcomes and argue for the use of new approaches to overcome this issue. Finally, I explore the advantages and limitations of multivariate interaction models, when testing for interaction between multiple SNPs and/or multiple exposures, over univariate approaches. Together, these new insights can be leveraged for future method development and to improve our understanding of the genetic architecture of multifactorial traits.

### Genetic association studies in cardiovascular diseases: Do we have enough power? [^1146DaLc]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Genetic association studies have a long history of delivering insightful results for cardiovascular disease (CVD) research. Beginning with early candidate gene studies, to genome-wide association studies, and now on to newer whole-genome sequencing studies, research in human genetics has enriched our understanding of the pathobiology of CVD. As these studies continue to expand, the issue of statistical power plays an important role in study design as well as the interpretation of results. We provide an overview of the component parts that determine statistical power and preview the future of CVD genetic association studies through this lens.

### Replication validity of genetic association studies [^112gvq8k]. Nature Genetics (2001). Medium credibility.

The rapid growth of human genetics creates countless opportunities for studies of disease association. Given the number of potentially identifiable genetic markers and the multitude of clinical outcomes to which these may be linked, the testing and validation of statistical hypotheses in genetic epidemiology is a task of unprecedented scale. Meta-analysis provides a quantitative approach for combining the results of various studies on the same topic, and for estimating and explaining their diversity. Here, we have evaluated by meta-analysis 370 studies addressing 36 genetic associations for various outcomes of disease. We show that significant between-study heterogeneity (diversity) is frequent, and that the results of the first study correlate only modestly with subsequent research on the same association. The first study often suggests a stronger genetic effect than is found by subsequent studies. Both bias and genuine population diversity might explain why early association studies tend to overestimate the disease protection or predisposition conferred by a genetic polymorphism. We conclude that a systematic meta-analytic approach may assist in estimating population-wide effects of genetic risk factors in human disease.

### Hints of hidden heritability in GWAS [^111suKyS]. Nature Genetics (2010). Medium credibility.

Although susceptibility loci identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) typically explain only a small proportion of the heritability, a classical quantitative genetic analysis now argues that considering together all common SNPs can explain a large proportion of the heritability of these complex traits. A related study provides recommendations for the sample sizes needed in future GWAS to identify additional susceptibility loci.

### Bringing genome-wide association findings into clinical use [^112JzwqX]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2013). Medium credibility.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been heralded as a major advance in biomedical discovery, having identified ~2,000 robust associations with complex diseases since 2005. Despite this success, they have met considerable scepticism regarding their clinical applicability; this scepticism arises from such aspects as the modest effect sizes of associated variants and their unclear functional consequences. There are, however, promising examples of GWAS findings that will or that may soon be translated into clinical care. These examples include variants identified through GWASs that provide strongly predictive or prognostic information or that have important pharmacological implications; these examples may illustrate promising approaches to wider clinical application.

### The post-GWAS era: from association to function [^1169jkYP]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

During the past 12 years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have uncovered thousands of genetic variants that influence risk for complex human traits and diseases. Yet functional studies aimed at delineating the causal genetic variants and biological mechanisms underlying the observed statistical associations with disease risk have lagged. In this review, we highlight key advances in the field of functional genomics that may facilitate the derivation of biological meaning post-GWAS. We highlight the evidence suggesting that causal variants underlying disease risk often function through regulatory effects on the expression of target genes and that these expression effects might be modest and cell-type specific. We moreover discuss specific studies as proof-of-principle examples for current statistical, bioinformatic, and empirical bench-based approaches to downstream elucidation of GWAS-identified disease risk loci.

### Association studies for finding cancer-susceptibility genetic variants [^111PERfS]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2004). Medium credibility.

Cancer is the result of complex interactions between inherited and environmental factors. Known genes account for a small proportion of the heritability of cancer, and it is likely that many genes with modest effects are yet to be found. Genetic-association studies have been widely used in the search for such genes, but success has been limited so far. Increased knowledge of the function of genes and the architecture of human genetic variation combined with new genotyping technologies herald a new era of gene mapping by association.

### Recent genetic findings in schizophrenia and their therapeutic relevance [^113P5xGb]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

Table 3.
Questions affecting the therapeutic targeting of a schizophrenia risk gene.

As might be expected, genetically driven therapeutic progress in medicine to date has been greatest in situations where a single gene is the sole or primary cause of the disease (e.g. for certain cancers and Mendelian disorders;). Yet even in these domains, advances have been few. Within psychiatry, we still await mature therapeutic fruits of research into the neurodegenerative (e.g. Huntington's disease; familial Alzheimer's disease) and neurodevelopmental (e.g. Rett syndrome) disorders for which the causal genes and the mutations within them have been known for well over a decade, and despite considerable advances in understanding their molecular pathogenesis. On the other hand, these cautionary notes in no way detract from the significance of the genetic discoveries for schizophrenia therapeutics. It is from genetics that the core biochemical and molecular basis of the disorder will finally be elucidated, and it is from the latter understanding that rationally designed and effective treatments will be developed. This is a prize well worth striving for. Notably, a recent study showed how the genetics of rheumatoid arthritis is informing target validation and drug discovery.report that the targets of existing rheumatoid arthritis drugs significantly overlap with the disease-associated genes (3.7-fold enrichment, p < 10–5); they also provide genetic data which suggest that certain drugs currently being used in cancer are worth trialling in rheumatoid arthritis. These findings are encouraging, since the genetic architecture of rheumatoid arthritis shows many similarities with schizophrenia (e.g. both currently have ~100 genome-wide significant loci, most with odds ratios < 1.2, and without the causal variant at each locus having been identified).

### An evolving understanding of multiple causal variants underlying genetic association signals [^11381cyE]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Understanding how genetic variation contributes to phenotypic variation is a fundamental question in genetics. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have discovered numerous genetic associations with various human phenotypes, most of which contain co-inherited variants in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with indistinguishable statistical significance. The experimental and analytical difficulty in identifying the "causal variant" among the co-inherited variants has traditionally led mechanistic studies to focus on relatively simple loci, where a single functional variant is presumed to explain most of the association signal and affect a target gene. The notion that a single causal variant is responsible for an association signal, while other variants in LD are merely correlated, has often been assumed in functional studies. However, emerging evidence powered by high-throughput experimental tools and context-specific functional databases argues that even a single independent signal may involve multiple functional variants in strong LD, each contributing to the observed genetic association. In this perspective, we articulate this evolving understanding of causal variants through examples from both traditional locus-by-locus approaches and more recent high-throughput functional studies. We then discuss the implications and prospects of this notion in understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits and interpreting the variant-level causality in GWAS follow-up studies.

### Insights and implications of genome-wide association studies of height [^1138bCoz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

GWAS-associated variants mostly reside in noncoding regions of the genome. Therefore, most of these variants do not directly affect the protein structure or function but instead likely modulate the expression of a nearby gene. Because GWAS-associated variants don't lie directly in a gene and gene regulation can occur at distances of hundreds of thousands or even sometimes millions of bases, identifying the target gene for a GWAS-associated variant can be very challenging. Furthermore, most common variants are correlated ("in linkage disequilibrium") with many other nearby common variants, which makes the identification of the relevant variant difficult and further complicates the identification of the relevant biological mechanisms that account for associations seen in GWASs.

The small effect sizes of the GWAS variants necessitate very large sample sizes to detect statistically significant signals. Thus, most successful GWASs have many thousands and often hundreds of thousands of study individuals. Typically, with increasing sample sizes, more and more association signals will be able to be detected because of greater statistical power. One advantage of having more signals is that computational methods can identify commonalities across associated loci to help illuminate the underlying biology. For example, if many associated variants (more than expected by chance) are located near genes in the same biological pathway or genes expressed in the same cell type, then the GWAS results collectively implicate that biological pathway or cell type. We will revisit this concept later in the Review.

### Discovering genetic interactions bridging pathways in genome-wide association studies [^115SQx9L]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Genetic interactions have been reported to underlie phenotypes in a variety of systems, but the extent to which they contribute to complex disease in humans remains unclear. In principle, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a platform for detecting genetic interactions, but existing methods for identifying them from GWAS data tend to focus on testing individual locus pairs, which undermines statistical power. Importantly, a global genetic network mapped for a model eukaryotic organism revealed that genetic interactions often connect genes between compensatory functional modules in a highly coherent manner. Taking advantage of this expected structure, we developed a computational approach called BridGE that identifies pathways connected by genetic interactions from GWAS data. Applying BridGE broadly, we discover significant interactions in Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, hypertension, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and type 2 diabetes. Our novel approach provides a general framework for mapping complex genetic networks underlying human disease from genome-wide genotype data.

After more than a decade of hope and hype, researchers are finally making inroads into understanding the genetic basis of many common human diseases. The use of genome-wide association studies has broken the logjam, enabling genetic variants at specific loci to be associated with particular diseases. Genetic association data are now providing new routes to understanding the aetiology of disease, as well as new footholds on the long and difficult path to better treatment and disease prevention.

### Clarifying the causes of consistent and inconsistent findings in genetics [^114YJB13]. Genetic Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

As research in genetics has advanced, some findings have been unexpected or shown to be inconsistent between studies or datasets. The reasons these inconsistencies arise are complex. Results from genetic studies can be affected by various factors including statistical power, linkage disequilibrium, quality control, confounding and selection bias, as well as real differences from interactions and effect modifiers, which may be informative about the mechanisms of traits and disease. Statistical artefacts can manifest as differences between results but they can also conceal underlying differences, which implies that their critical examination is important for understanding the underpinnings of traits. In this review, we examine these factors and outline how they can be identified and conceptualised with structural causal models. We explain the consequences they have on genetic estimates, such as genetic associations, polygenic scores, family‐ and genome‐wide heritability, and describe methods to address them to aid in the estimation of true effects of genetic variation. Clarifying these factors can help researchers anticipate when results are likely to diverge and aid researchers' understanding of causal relationships between genes and complex traits.

### A systematic review of cancer GWAS and candidate gene meta-analyses reveals limited overlap but similar effect sizes [^115pQHDN]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) represent two complementary approaches to uncovering genetic contributions to common diseases. We systematically reviewed the contributions of these approaches to our knowledge of genetic associations with cancer risk by analyzing the data in the Cancer Genome-wide Association and Meta Analyses database (Cancer GAMAdb). The database catalogs studies published since January 1, 2000, by study and cancer type. In all, we found that meta-analyses and pooled analyses of candidate genes reported 349 statistically significant associations and GWAS reported 269, for a total of 577 unique associations. Only 41 (7.1%) associations were reported in both candidate gene meta-analyses and GWAS, usually with similar effect sizes. When considering only noteworthy associations (defined as those with false-positive report probabilities ≤ 0.2) and accounting for indirect overlap, we found 202 associations, with 27 of those appearing in both meta-analyses and GWAS. Our findings suggest that meta-analyses of well-conducted candidate gene studies may continue to add to our understanding of the genetic associations in the post-GWAS era.

### Prioritizing GWAS results: a review of statistical methods and recommendations for their application [^114Wtdqn]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have rapidly become a standard method for disease gene discovery. A substantial number of recent GWAS indicate that for most disorders, only a few common variants are implicated and the associated SNPs explain only a small fraction of the genetic risk. This review is written from the viewpoint that findings from the GWAS provide preliminary genetic information that is available for additional analysis by statistical procedures that accumulate evidence, and that these secondary analyses are very likely to provide valuable information that will help prioritize the strongest constellations of results. We review and discuss three analytic methods to combine preliminary GWAS statistics to identify genes, alleles, and pathways for deeper investigations. Meta-analysis seeks to pool information from multiple GWAS to increase the chances of finding true positives among the false positives and provides a way to combine associations across GWAS, even when the original data are unavailable. Testing for epistasis within a single GWAS study can identify the stronger results that are revealed when genes interact. Pathway analysis of GWAS results is used to prioritize genes and pathways within a biological context. Following a GWAS, association results can be assigned to pathways and tested in aggregate with computational tools and pathway databases. Reviews of published methods with recommendations for their application are provided within the framework for each approach.

Common complex disorders risk alleles — Unlike Mendelian diseases, the identification of common, complex disease genes has largely relied on population-based approaches such as genome-wide association studies. Currently, numerous genome-wide association study reports have resulted in the cataloguing of over 1,200 risk alleles for common, complex diseases and traits, and most of these variants are in noncoding regions. Common, complex risk alleles typically confer low relative risk and are meager in their predictive power, and to date the utility of common, complex risk allele testing for patient care has been unclear, with models to combine multiple markers into a cumulative risk score often flawed and usually no better than traditional risk factors such as family.

### Do we need more genome wide association studies? [^114z5hLM]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Much of the individual biological traits we have, of what we look like, of our physical and mental abilities, of our risk to suffer from the noncommunicable diseases that will ultimately end our lives, is encoded in the genetic 'background', consisting of millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and other common sequence variants that each have minute functional effects on regulatory sequences within our genome.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are the tool of choice to make the connection between commonvariant genotype data, collected either through genome sequencing or with genotyping arrays ('chips'), and human phenotype. In its simplest form, GWAS compare the frequency for each of of thousands or millions of common genetic variants between groups of patients and controls, thus identifying genetic risk factors for the diseases studied this way.

There are limits to what the traditional GWAS approach can achieve. Suffocating type-I error rates arising from the analysis of millions of genetic variants make it necessary to assemble very large groups of patients and controls, but even then, only the strongest genetic risk factors can be identified with meaningful certainty. Even so, finding this initial set of genetic factors has significantly enhanced our understanding of pathways leading to common disease or shaping healthrelevant physiological traits. With the majority of disease risk factors still hidden, however, it is presently impossible to assemble enough genetic information to make clinically relevant predictions for any given person. The gambit for detecting additional disease-relevant genetic factors has been to the assemble ever larger subject cohorts, reaching hundreds of thousands of participants for some conditions. Still the majority of the disease-relevant genetic background remains untouchable, with thousands of weak-effect alleles still hidden, trapped in what is termed the 'missing heritability'. General frustration with the GWAS approach is prevalent among researchers.

Over the past 15 years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have generated a wealth of new information.

### Discovering genetic interactions bridging pathways in genome-wide association studies [^114Ukhm7]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been increasingly successful at identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with statistically significant association to a variety of diseases, and gene sets significantly enriched for SNPs with moderate association. However, for most diseases, there remains a substantial disparity between the disease risk explained by the discovered loci and the estimated total heritable disease risk based on familial aggregation. While there are a number of possible explanations for this "missing heritability", including many loci with small effects or rare variants, genetic interactions between loci are one potential culprit. Genetic interactions generally refer to a combination of two or more genes whose contribution to a phenotype cannot be completely explained by their independent effects. One example of an extreme genetic interaction is synthetic lethality where two mutations, neither of which is lethal on its own, combine to generate a lethal double mutant phenotype. Thus, genetic interactions may explain how relatively benign variation can combine to generate more extreme phenotypes, including complex human diseases. Several studies have reported genetic interactions between specific variants in various disease contexts, and scalable computational tools have been developed for searching for interactions amongst SNPs. However, systematic discovery of statistically significant genetic interactions on a genome-scale remains a major challenge. For example, a theoretical analysis estimated that ~500,000 subjects would be needed to detect significant genetic interactions under reasonable assumptions, which remains beyond the cohort sizes available for a typical GWAS study or even the large majority of meta-GWAS studies.

### The future of association studies: gene-based analysis and replication [^111LXQkj]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2004). Low credibility.

Historically, association tests were limited to single variants, so that the allele was considered the basic unit for association testing. As marker density increases and indirect approaches are used to assess association through linkage disequilibrium, association is now frequently considered at the haplotypic level. We suggest that there are difficulties in replicating association findings at the single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) or the haplotype level, and we propose a shift toward a gene-based approach in which all common variation within a candidate gene is considered jointly. Inconsistencies arising from population differences are more readily resolved by use of a gene-based approach rather than either a SNP-based or a haplotype-based approach. A gene-based approach captures all of the potential risk-conferring variations; thus, negative findings are subject only to the issue of power. In addition, chance findings due to multiple testing can be readily accounted for by use of a genewide-significance level. Meta-analysis procedures can be formalized for gene-based methods through the combination of P values. It is only a matter of time before all variation within genes is mapped, at which point the gene-based approach will become the natural end point for association analysis and will inform our search for functional variants relevant to disease etiology.

### Functional studies of GWAS variants are gaining momentum [^114JQW7n]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In the past 15 years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been established as a default tool for mapping the genetic variation underlying complex traits. These studies have associated thousands of variants with hundreds of phenotypes, furthering our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex diseases. Deciphering how associated variants modulate disease risk and severity, and how they impact cellular phenotypes informs mechanistic therapeutic hypotheses resulting in more effective drug discovery. As the available genomic tools become more sophisticated and the cellular disease models more relevant, the next decade will deliver significant advancement in biological, clinical and therapeutic insights from GWAS variants. Accelerating these efforts will be achieved through close collaborative efforts and the blending of broad-scope systematic approaches with deep dives that rely on tailored assays in the context of specific biological processes. Here, we focus on some of the experimental approaches that will propel the translational impact of GWAS signals towards deeper pathomechanistic insights and improved therapies (Fig. 1).

### Gene set analysis for interpreting genetic studies [^1138Cygb]. Human Molecular Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Interpretation of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results is lacking behind the discovery of new genetic associations. Consequently, there is an urgent need for data-driven methods for interpreting genetic association studies. Gene set analysis (GSA) can identify aetiologic pathways and functional annotations and may hence point towards novel biological insights. However, despite the growing availability of GSA tools, the sizeable amount of variants identified for a vast number of complex traits, and many irrefutably trait-associated gene sets, the gap between discovery and interpretation remains. More efficient interpretation requires more complete and consistent gene set representations of biological pathways, phenotypes and functional annotations. In this review, I examine different types of gene sets, discuss how inconsistencies in gene set definitions impact GSA, describe how GSA has helped to elucidate biology and outline potential future directions.

### Reporting, appraising, and integrating data on genotype… [^1128HymP]. archive.cdc.gov (2022). Medium credibility.

Reporting, Appraising, and Integrating Data On Genotype Prevalence and Gene-Disease Associations by Julian Little. Abbreviations: GSTT1, glutathione S-transferase T1 gene; HLA-DQ, human leukocyte-DQ antigen locus; NAT2, N-acetlytransferase 2 gene; PCR polymerase chain reaction; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism. The process of identifying DNA variation that may be associated with disease is now underway through the cataloguing and mapping of single nucleotide polymorphisms throughout the genome. The analysis of genotype data on SNPs may aid in the identification of DNA alterations that result in or contribute to disease states. While the spectrum of the relationship between genes and disease is very broad, ranging from single gene disorders to multifactorial conditions, many common methodological issues apply throughout this spectrum.

These issues relate to the planning and analysis of original studies, the critical appraisal of individual studies and to the integration of evidence from diverse studies. It has been suggested that it would be useful to type several polymorphisms throughout a candidate gene and then construct haplotypes, which could then be tested for association with the phenotype of interest. The increasing availability of mapped SNP markers offers the opportunity for such an approach. Methodological issues relating to this approach are still under development. Genotyping on the basis of phenotype In some studies, genotype has been inferred on the basis of a phenotypic test. A potential advantage of this approach is that the phenotypic assay reflects enzyme activity level, and therefore may provide a direct measure of the functional significance of the underlying genetic polymorphism. The genotype is one determinant of long-term enzyme activity level.

Concern about the possible effects of population stratification has stimulated development of family-based case-control designs, which essentially eliminate potential confounding from this source. The most commonly used examples of such designs involve the use of siblings or parents as controls. Sibling controls are derived from the same gene pool as cases. The third is the transmission disequilibrium test, in which the unit of analysis is the heterozygous parent. A standard binomial test is carried out, based on comparing the number of heterozygous parents who transmitted the given allele to the affected offspring with the number of heterozygous parents who did not.

### What makes a good genetic association study? [^1178D7X4]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Genetic association studies are central to efforts to identify and characterise genomic variants underlying susceptibility to multifactorial disease. However, obtaining robust replication of initial association findings has proved difficult. Much of this inconsistency can be attributed to inadequacies in study design, implementation, and interpretation — inadequately powered sample groups are a major concern. Several additional factors affect the quality of any given association study, with appropriate sample-recruitment strategy, logical variant selection, minimum genotyping error, relevant data analysis, and valid interpretation all essential to generation of robust findings. Replication has a vital role in showing that associations that are identified reflect interesting biological processes rather than methodological quirks. For an unbiased view of the evidence for and against any particular association, study quality, rather than significance value, needs to play the dominant part.

### Standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants: a joint consensus recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology [^11648Pdk]. Genetics in Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Gene of uncertain significance (GUS) — classification and reporting when a gene lacks validated association: When the laboratory finds a variant in a gene without a validated association to the patient's phenotype, it is a GUS, and utilizing variant classification rules developed for recognized genotype–phenotype associations is not appropriate. For exome or genome analyses, a de novo observation is no longer strong evidence for pathogenicity given that all individuals are expected to have approximately one de novo variant in their exome or 100 in their genome, and many deleterious variants that are clearly disruptive to a gene or its resultant protein (nonsense, frameshift, canonical ± 1,2 splice site, exon-level deletion) may be detected with insufficient evidence for a causative role. Variants found in a GUS may be considered as candidates and reported as "variants in a gene of uncertain significance", and these variants, if reported, should always be classified as uncertain significance; additional evidence would be required to support the gene's association to disease before any variant in the gene itself can be considered pathogenic for the disease.

Introduction

Gene regulation is an essential component of cellular function, and its dysregulation often leads to disease. The genetic makeup intrinsic to each person shapes their disease susceptibilities and response to treatment, making understanding the functional impact of genetic mutations one of the most pursued challenges in genetics research. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have associated tens of thousands of genetic variants with complex traits, but the functional link between them is unknown. In this context, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses, which rely on studying the transcriptomic profiles of many individuals to reveal variants that modulate gene expression, are pivotal in bridging the functional gap between genotypes and organismal phenotypes –. Indeed, in combination with GWAS, eQTL studies have been crucial in identifying causal genes and tissues associated with complex traits and disease. Yet, understanding a variant's molecular link to complex traits and disease is still a major challenge, given that most are found in the genome's non-coding regions, act only in specific tissues and may affect several genes.

A pertinent clue in the linking genome to phenome is the correlation of activity among regulatory elements and genes, which is key in understanding the shared genetic architecture between multiple complex traits and diseases as well as between all associated genes. In this respect, previous studies have found that gene order in eukaryotes is not random, and genes with similar expression profiles tend to be genomically linked. Indeed, genes located near to each other (e.g. < 1 Mb) often display concerted co-expression –. Local gene co-expression is more pronounced in the immediate vicinity of a gene (e.g. < 100 kb) but it has also been shown that it extends further and occurs regardless of the strand, transcription orientation, shared functionality or tandem duplications. The existence of structural and regulatory domains orchestrating the organised expression of nearby genes and mediating the genetic effects of regulatory variants on genes has been demonstrated, thus suggesting that regulatory element sharing and regulatory variant sharing may be key in controlling the co-expression of nearby genes. However, the molecular mechanisms, genetic control and tissue specificity of local gene co-expression are far from being fully understood. For instance, while genetic variants controlling expression have been found for almost all genes, the extent to which several genes may be controlled by the same genetic variants is yet unknown. Moreover, the full extent of local gene co-expression remains to be deeply assessed, particularly across tissues.

### 10 years of GWAS discovery: biology, function, and translation [^111coyMi]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Application of the experimental design of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is now 10 years old (young), and here we review the remarkable range of discoveries it has facilitated in population and complex-trait genetics, the biology of diseases, and translation toward new therapeutics. We predict the likely discoveries in the next 10 years, when GWASs will be based on millions of samples with array data imputed to a large fully sequenced reference panel and on hundreds of thousands of samples with whole-genome sequencing data.
