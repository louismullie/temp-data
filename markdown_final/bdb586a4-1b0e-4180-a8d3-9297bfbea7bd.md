## Question

What is the appropriate workup for a newborn with a short femur?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the appropriate workup for a newborn with a short femur. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and whether the femoral shortening is unilateral or bilateral. Then, I should verify the prenatal history and any prior imaging. Next, I will perform a focused neonatal examination to assess proportion, symmetry, and associated anomalies. After that, I need to obtain a standardized skeletal survey and interpret radiographic patterns. Then, I should consider targeted genetic testing based on phenotype. Finally, I will outline subspecialty referrals, counseling, and follow-up, while double-checking pitfalls like DDH screening and osteopenia of prematurity that can confound the picture [^115u5k3p] [^1149GdRt].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and urgency. I need to check whether the short femur is unilateral or bilateral, symmetric or asymmetric, and whether there are respiratory or airway concerns suggesting a lethal thoracic dysplasia, because that will drive the immediacy of neonatal intensive care and subspecialty involvement [^116DzxFn]. Hold on, I should verify that prenatal records and maternal-fetal medicine notes are obtained promptly, including any ultrasound measurements of femur length, chest size, and amniotic fluid, since these inform lethality risk and the differential diagnosis [^116w8jBH].

> Next, I should review the prenatal history carefully. Wait, let me verify the timing of femur shortening on prenatal ultrasound, because achondroplasia typically shows progressive femur shortening after about 24 weeks, whereas thanatophoric dysplasia often shows severe shortening much earlier and may have a FL/AC ratio less than 0.16, which is a strong predictor of lethality [^117TZJUU] [^116w8jBH]. I need to check whether there were polyhydramnios, macrocephaly, frontal bossing, a bell-shaped thorax, or fractures, and whether any prenatal genetic testing was performed, as these findings narrow the differential and guide postnatal testing [^116w8jBH] [^113P3LpU].

> I will now examine the newborn systematically. Let me consider body proportions first, because rhizomelic shortening with macrocephaly and frontal bossing points toward achondroplasia, while mesomelic or micromelic patterns suggest other dysplasias, and a narrow thorax with short ribs raises concern for lethal skeletal dysplasias such as thanatophoric dysplasia or short-rib thoracic dysplasia [^113FUCBK] [^116DzxFn]. I should confirm symmetry of limb shortening, inspect the hands for trident configuration, assess the chest for bell shape or respiratory effort, and palpate the clavicles and skull for mineralization defects, while also checking for fractures or joint laxity that might indicate osteogenesis imperfecta or hypophosphatasia [^112JL9M8] [^117QgBDm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before imaging. I need to ensure a standardized skeletal survey is obtained as soon as the infant is stable, because a babygram or full skeletal survey is the cornerstone for differentiating skeletal dysplasias and documenting the pattern of abnormalities [^1129RZ5Y]. Let me verify the views include AP and lateral skull, AP chest with thoracic spine, lateral thoracolumbar spine, AP pelvis with lumbar spine, AP views of one upper and one lower limb, and dorsopalmar hands, as this set captures the features needed for nosology-based diagnosis and genetic counseling [^1129RZ5Y].

> Now, I will interpret the radiographs with a pattern-based approach. I should double-check for achondroplasia features such as decreased interpedicular distance from upper to lower lumbar spine, flat rounded iliac bones with narrow sacrosciatic notches, and radiolucent proximal femurs, which are highly suggestive and often sufficient for clinical diagnosis when combined with phenotype [^113FUCBK]. But wait, what if there are multiple rib fractures, severe osteopenia, or wormian bones? That would steer me toward osteogenesis imperfecta, whereas absent or severely hypomineralized bones, especially the skull vault, would raise concern for lethal hypophosphatasia, and a cloverleaf skull with telephone receiver femurs would support thanatophoric dysplasia [^112JL9M8] [^117QgBDm] [^117TZJUU]. I need to ensure I document metaphyseal changes, epiphyseal stippling, and any vertebral anomalies, as these details refine the differential and guide molecular testing [^1128Qgmc] [^116opHiv].

> Next, I should review genetic testing strategy. Let me first confirm that targeted testing is prioritized by phenotype, because this increases yield and accelerates diagnosis. If achondroplasia is suspected, I should test FGFR3 for the common c.1138G > A or c.1138G > C variants, recognizing that prenatal ultrasound alone has only moderate diagnostic accuracy and that postnatal genetic confirmation is recommended when not established prenatally [^116FZK5t] [^116w8jBH] [^114edVRd]. If the phenotype suggests osteogenesis imperfecta, I should consider COL1A1/COL1A2 sequencing, and if hypophosphatasia is suspected, I should check ALPL and serum alkaline phosphatase, since biochemical testing complements imaging in perinatal HPP [^117TJtYg]. If the phenotype is nonspecific or multiple anomalies are present, I should broaden to a skeletal dysplasia panel or exome sequencing, given the substantial incremental diagnostic yield of prenatal or postnatal exome in short long bones, especially when additional skeletal anomalies are present [^116sFUJu].

> I need to ensure appropriate subspecialty referrals are made early. Let me verify that pediatric genetics is involved for diagnosis, counseling on inheritance, and recurrence risk, and that pediatric orthopedics evaluates limb alignment, limb-length discrepancy, and spine, while neonatology addresses respiratory support if a restrictive thoracic dysplasia is suspected [^114m8YJt]. Hold on, I should also consider pediatric endocrinology for growth surveillance, pulmonology for restrictive lung disease, and neurology for any signs of cord compression or developmental concerns, as multidisciplinary care improves outcomes and anticipates complications [^114m8YJt].

> I should confirm that counseling is comprehensive and timely. Let me think about explaining the diagnosis, natural history, prognosis, and recurrence risks, and I should double-check that families understand the implications for future pregnancies, including the option of preimplantation genetic testing or early prenatal diagnosis when a molecular diagnosis is established [^114m8YJt] [^114Gn3Sf]. If a lethal diagnosis such as thanatophoric dysplasia is suspected or confirmed, I need to discuss palliative care options and perinatal planning with sensitivity and clarity, using objective sonographic predictors of lethality to guide discussions [^116w8jBH] [^116DzxFn].

> Next, I should review follow-up and surveillance. I need to ensure growth is monitored with condition-specific growth charts when available, and I should verify that infants with achondroplasia undergo sleep apnea screening, cervical spine MRI when indicated, and car seat testing given the risk of apnea and head control issues [^113FUCBK]. Wait, let me verify bone health considerations too, because preterm infants with skeletal dysplasia may have compounded osteopenia risk and require careful mineral and vitamin D management to prevent fractures and rickets [^1149GdRt].

> But wait, what if the short femur is unilateral and focal rather than part of a generalized dysplasia? I should double-check for proximal focal femoral deficiency or other limb reduction defects, because unilateral shortening warrants pediatric orthopedic evaluation for limb-length discrepancy and prosthetic planning, and prenatal detection rates for such focal deficiencies are variable, so postnatal imaging and clinical correlation are essential [^116CHyPw] [^112e7t8G]. Hold on, I should verify that the contralateral limb and pelvis are imaged adequately to exclude associated hip dysplasia or acetabular dysplasia that would alter management [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I do not conflate skeletal dysplasia workup with developmental dysplasia of the hip screening. Let me reconsider the timing of hip ultrasound, because universal newborn hip ultrasound is not recommended, and selective ultrasound is reserved for infants with risk factors or abnormal clinical examination, typically between 2 and 6 weeks of age, with AP pelvis radiographs considered after 4 to 6 months if instability persists or diagnosis remains uncertain [^115u5k3p] [^115Z9BwM] [^115wCQRN]. I should confirm that any hip concerns on exam are addressed per guidelines, but I must avoid anchoring on DDH when the primary issue is femoral shortening from a dysplasia [^115u5k3p].

> Finally, I should double-check that the diagnostic pathway remains iterative. If initial targeted genetic testing is negative but the phenotype is compelling, I should escalate to panel or exome sequencing, and if new clinical features emerge over time, I should repeat imaging and expand the differential accordingly, because phenotype-genotype correlations evolve and reanalysis can yield diagnoses missed initially [^114m8YJt] [^116sFUJu]. Let me verify that families are updated regularly as results return and that all findings are communicated clearly to the multidisciplinary team to coordinate care and anticipate complications proactively [^114m8YJt].

The workup for a newborn with a short femur should be **stepwise and multidisciplinary**, starting with a **focused clinical exam** to assess proportion, symmetry, and associated anomalies, followed by a **standard skeletal survey** (babygram) to characterize the skeletal pattern [^1129RZ5Y]. If a skeletal dysplasia is suspected, obtain **targeted genetic testing** (e.g. FGFR3, COL1A1/COL1A2, ALPL) and consider a skeletal dysplasia panel or exome sequencing if the phenotype is nonspecific [^116sFUJu]. Evaluate for **associated complications** — such as respiratory compromise, neurologic issues, and feeding difficulties — and refer early to pediatric genetics, orthopedics, and pulmonology for counseling and management planning [^114m8YJt] [^114Gn3Sf].

---

## Clinical evaluation

### History

- **Prenatal history**: Review prenatal ultrasounds for femur length, growth trajectory, and associated anomalies (e.g. thoracic hypoplasia, macrocephaly, polyhydramnios) [^116w8jBH].
- **Family history**: Document parental stature, consanguinity, and any history of skeletal disorders or neonatal deaths [^notfound].
- **Perinatal history**: Note gestational age, birth weight, length, head circumference, and delivery complications [^114V3Luz].

---

### Physical examination

- **General assessment**: Measure length, weight, head circumference, and assess body proportions (limb-to-trunk ratio, upper-to-lower segment ratio) [^114V3Luz].
- **Limbs**: Evaluate for rhizomelia, mesomelia, or micromelia; limb symmetry; joint mobility; and presence of bowing or fractures [^114Wo6kd].
- **Skull and face**: Look for macrocephaly, frontal bossing, midface hypoplasia, and craniosynostosis [^114Wo6kd].
- **Thorax**: Assess chest shape and size, respiratory effort, and presence of rib fractures [^115jn6PJ].
- **Spine**: Check for scoliosis, kyphosis, or vertebral anomalies [^116opHiv].
- **Hands and feet**: Examine for polydactyly, syndactyly, brachydactyly, and trident hand configuration [^114Wo6kd].

---

## Imaging studies

### Skeletal survey (babygram)

A skeletal survey (babygram) is essential and should include **AP and lateral views of the entire skeleton**, encompassing the skull, spine, chest, pelvis, and all limbs [^1129RZ5Y]. Key radiographic features to assess include:

- **Long bones**: Shortening, bowing, fractures, metaphyseal abnormalities, and osteopenia [^116JLb7w].
- **Skull**: Large calvarium, decreased ossification, and craniosynostosis [^112JL9M8].
- **Spine**: Vertebral anomalies, platyspondyly, and interpedicular narrowing [^115jn6PJ].
- **Thorax**: Small bell-shaped thorax, short ribs, and rib fractures [^116JLb7w].
- **Pelvis**: Small iliac bones, narrow sacrosciatic notches, and acetabular dysplasia [^113FUCBK].

---

### Advanced imaging (if indicated)

Use **fetal CT** selectively when prenatal ultrasound is inconclusive and when low-dose protocols are available, balancing diagnostic yield against radiation risk [^1144EcJf]. Fetal MRI is useful for assessing brain, spine, and soft tissues when ultrasound is limited or additional detail is needed [^113W6Cwg].

---

## Genetic testing

- **Targeted gene testing**: Based on clinical and radiographic findings (e.g. FGFR3 for achondroplasia/hypochondroplasia, COL1A1/COL1A2 for osteogenesis imperfecta, ALPL for hypophosphatasia) [^116FZK5t] [^116JLb7w] [^117TJtYg].
- **Skeletal dysplasia panel**: Use a multigene panel or exome sequencing if the phenotype is nonspecific or targeted tests are negative [^116sFUJu].
- **Parental testing**: Consider parental genetic testing to determine inheritance pattern and recurrence risk [^notfound].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

Laboratory evaluation should include a **complete blood count** to assess for anemia or infection, and serum calcium, phosphate, and alkaline phosphatase to evaluate bone metabolism and screen for metabolic bone disease [^1149GdRt]. Consider **thyroid function tests** if hypothyroidism is suspected.

---

## Multidisciplinary care and follow-up

- **Genetics**: Counseling on diagnosis, prognosis, inheritance, and recurrence risk [^114Gn3Sf].
- **Orthopedics**: Management of limb deformities, limb-length discrepancy, and spine anomalies [^116CHyPw].
- **Pulmonology**: Assessment and management of respiratory complications (e.g. thoracic insufficiency, sleep apnea) [^113FUCBK].
- **Neurology**: Evaluation for neurologic complications (e.g. hydrocephalus, spinal stenosis) [^113FUCBK].
- **Endocrinology**: Growth monitoring and hormone therapy if indicated [^114SjyMc].
- **Nutrition**: Dietary counseling and supplementation as needed [^114kMTcQ].

## Diagnostic approach

| **Step** | **Evaluation** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Clinical history and examination | Identify clinical features, family history, and associated anomalies |
| 2 | Skeletal survey (babygram) | Characterize skeletal abnormalities and pattern recognition |
| 3 | Genetic testing | Confirm diagnosis and determine inheritance |

1 Introduction

Skeletal dysplasias are a group of disorders affecting the development of bone and cartilage. Over 770 different disorders have been recognized to date with a total birth incidence of 1/5000. The genetic spectrum of skeletal dysplasias can differ significantly between populations. The most severe forms are associated with significant perinatal morbidity and mortality.

The primary diagnostic tool to identify fetal skeletal disease is prenatal ultrasound (US). Usually the first abnormal finding observed with US is shortening of the long bones. Other signs indicating skeletal disorder are bowing, poor mineralization, or fractures of the bones along with abnormalities in flat bones, vertebrae, and thorax. Nuchal translucency (NT) or fetal hydrops can also be associated with skeletal dysplasia.

Assessing the degree of severity of potential fetal skeletal dysplasia during pregnancy is often challenging due to the large number of possible diagnoses with variable and overlapping phenotypes. In the absence of an exact genetic diagnosis, the decision‐making relies on clinical assessment with US. Prenatal US has only 40%–68% diagnostic accuracy in detecting skeletal dysplasia and poor visibility due to for example maternal obesity can complicate the process. With appropriate criteria, US is quite accurate in distinguishing between lethal and non‐lethal types of the disease. The most accurate predictors of lethal skeletal dysplasia are 3D fetal lung volumes (< 5th percentile for gestational age), ratios of femur length to abdominal circumference (FL/AC < 0.16) and chest circumference to abdominal circumference (TC/AC < 0.6). Other features potentially indicating lethal disease include a bell‐shaped thorax, short ribs, severe femoral shortening, polyhydramnion and multiple fractures or underossification of the spine.

### Evaluating skeletal dysplasias on prenatal ultrasound: an emphasis on predicting lethality [^116DzxFn]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Lethal skeletal dysplasias can be diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound (US) using several sonographic parameters. Degree of femoral shortening, lung volumes, femur length to abdominal circumference ratio, and chest circumference to abdominal circumference ratio are the most sensitive and specific predictors. Although there are more than 450 different skeletal dysplasias, only a few are lethal in the perinatal period. We review current fetal US literature and present an updated algorithmic approach to first establish lethality and, second, evaluate for hallmark sonographic features to help determine a specific diagnosis.

### Revisiting skeletal dysplasias in the newborn [^114m8YJt]. NeoReviews (2021). Medium credibility.

With over 400 reported disorders, the skeletal dysplasias represent a myriad of molecularly-based skeletal abnormalities. Arising from errors in skeletal development, the clinical spectrum of disease evolves through an affected individual's life. The naming and grouping of these disorders are ever-changing, but the fundamentals of diagnosis remain the same and are accomplished through a combination of prenatal ultrasonography and postnatal physical examination, radiography, and genetic analysis. Although some disorders are lethal in the perinatal and neonatal periods, other disorders allow survival into infancy, childhood, and even adulthood with relatively normal lives. The foundation of management for an affected individual is multidisciplinary care. Medical advances have offered new insights into reducing common morbidities through pharmacologic means. This review summarizes the normal skeletal development and discusses the 3 most common skeletal dysplasias that can affect the newborn.

### Early prenatal diagnosis of skeletal anomalies [^116cSY9j]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review experience of early prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias, and to explore diagnostic accuracy and improve management.

Methods

A retrospective review of fetal medicine unit (FMU) records was performed to identify cases where a skeletal dysplasia was suspected by 14 weeks' gestation. A literature review was undertaken to ascertain cases with a diagnosis of a skeletal dysplasia in the late first or early second trimester.

Results

Fifteen cases were identified from review of FMU records, including ten different dysplasias with a variety of inheritance patterns. Accurate prenatal diagnosis was made only in cases with a positive family history, and in one case each of thanatophoric dysplasia and Roberts syndrome. Review of the literature identified further cases. Increased nuchal translucency was reported in other cases subsequently diagnosed as having a skeletal dysplasia. In early pregnancy, common presenting features included short femora, abnormal skull shape and mineralisation, profile or chest.

Conclusion

Increasing use of first-trimester combined screening for Down's syndrome, with or without detailed anomaly scanning, will result in early detection of more skeletal dysplasias. Parents must be made aware that detailed postnatal pathological and radiological examination is usually required for accurate diagnosis and prediction of recurrence risks.

Perinatal period

During delivery, there is a need for neonatologist because some babies display respiratory compromise in the immediate newborn period.
Diagnosis should be confirmed by both clinical and radiologic evaluation after delivery. Proximal shortening of limbs in at least the arms, large head, narrow chest and short fingers with "trident" shape are signals that should confirm the prenatal suspicion. According to Spranger et al. radiographic features are: large calvarium, decrease in the interpedicular distance from upper to lower lumbar spine, short pedicles in the lateral view of spine. In infancy (aged 0 to 5 years), square or oval radiolucent areas in proximal femur are also observed.

5 Conclusion

Fetal radiographic imaging, especially CT, is an important method for investigating terminated or stillborn fetuses with suspected skeletal disease. As ultrasound is not able to detect all abnormalities, post‐mortem X‐ray/CT offers additional information supporting the diagnostic process. Detailed phenotypic data are important for the interpretation of the results of molecular genetic testing, especially in cases with novel or rare variants. This information is valuable in the assessment of recurrence risk in future pregnancies.

Ultrasound performs well in detecting skeletal dysplasias and severe forms of the disease. It is also an important tool in visualizing other anomalies, fetal hydrops, contractures, and lack of fetal movements, which are important in differential diagnostics as there are other diseases affecting fetal growth and mimicking skeletal disease. Despite improved imaging methods, actual skeletal dysplasias are still detected rather late, usually in second trimester of pregnancy; therefore, additional approaches and diagnostic methods are needed.

### Neonatal skeletal dysplasias [^1128Qgmc]. Pediatric Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Skeletal dysplasias are a large diverse group of disorders characterized by abnormal bone and cartilage growth. Approximately one-quarter of them are considered lethal in the perinatal period. This paper will review the components of the skeletal survey, the primary imaging tool for diagnosing dysplasias postnatally, emphasizing the use of an organized approach and appropriate descriptive terminology. Several illustrative cases of lethal and nonlethal dysplasias will be shown, with additional discussion of commonly associated genetic mutations and classification systems.

### Safe, accurate, prenatal diagnosis of thanatophoric dysplasia using ultrasound and free fetal DNA [^115nVXaF]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2013). Low credibility.

Earlier series report that around 40% of osteochondrodysplasias are correctly diagnosed by ultrasound in the prenatal period. By using ultrasound scan alone, the diagnosis of TD was suspected in 86% of the cases in our cohort. This is consistent with other studies that investigated the accuracy of prenatal diagnosis of TD using ultrasound (88% in Schramm et al.70% in Sharony et al.50% in Tretter et al.40% in Gaffney et al.75% in Doray et al.and approximately 50% in Krakow et al.).

Published reports suggest that it is possible to accurately predict that cases presenting with sonographic evidence of a skeletal dysplasia are likely to be lethal by evaluation of chest size and configuration. Others have used a femur length/AC ratio < 0.16 as a sensitive threshold for predicting lethal skeletal dysplasia. In our series, we were able to evaluate this ratio in 35 cases – these and all TD cases reported in the literature that included the femur length/AC ratio had a FL/AC ratio of < 0.16. Predicting lethality may be possible and reliable, but definitive confirmation of the underlying pathology is critical for accurate parental counselling with regard to recurrence risks as well as the management of future pregnancies. Traditionally, this can be carried out using molecular analysis of chorionic villi or amniocytes following invasive testing, or by postnatal radiology. The differential diagnosis for TD is broad and will vary with gestation (Table 4). In early pregnancy, the main differentials will include other dominantly inherited conditions such as spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia congenitabut will also include conditions such as the short-ribbed polydactyly syndromes that are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. With the increasing use of early ultrasound, detection of features suspicious of TD at a time when a surgical termination of pregnancy is an option will increase. This management pathway precludes the use of postnatal radiology for confirmation of diagnosis and restricts options to molecular analysis following invasive prenatal testing or analysis of fetal products after termination.

3.3 Radiographic Imaging Ex Utero

Additional radiographic imaging (X‐ray and CT) was performed postmortem in 16 of the 27 terminated pregnancies, seven of which were first‐trimester terminations. In addition, the results of imaging studies were available from five liveborn children. Radiographic imaging was not performed during the perinatal period for children with mild phenotypes since it was unnecessary to expose them to radiation. When genetic diagnosis was confirmed and pregnancy was terminated, radiographic imaging was not routinely performed (Figure 3).

FIGURE 3
Radiographic imaging after termination of pregnancy (TOP) or after birth (during neonatal period/during first year of life).

X‐ray and especially 3D‐CT appeared to be superior to US in identifying spinal and thoracic anomalies in both the first and second trimesters of pregnancy (Table 1a and 1b). Especially, deformities, fractures and shortening of ribs were often missed with US. In nine cases, these changes had not been detected at all with US. Additionally, abnormalities and fractures of vertebrae and scapular, clavicular and acromial defects were poorly detected, and in some cases, even long bone fractures and deformities were missed with US. Occasionally bowing of long bones seen with US later appeared as fractures in radiographs, which also showed more detailed abnormalities such as widening of metaphyses and diaphyses. For instance, in one case with COL1A2 ‐related severe perinatal form of Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) (Sillence type 2), US showed shortening and bowing of the long bones indicating skeletal dysplasia, but femoral fractures and multiple rib fractures diagnostic to severe OI were only detected with X‐ray/CT (Figure 4). In other OI cases, some fractures and for example poor ossification of the skull were visible with US, but phenotypic data provided by X‐ray/CT was much more detailed.

### Differential diagnosis of perinatal hypophosphatasia: radiologic perspectives [^113W6Cwg]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Prenatal imaging

Prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia relies on cross-sectional imaging modalities (US, CT and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), whereas postnatal diagnosis relies more heavily on radiography. The International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology and the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend that all pregnant women undergo US scanning at 10 to 14 weeks to establish gestational age and at 18 to 22 weeks to screen for structural anomalies. Thereafter, the frequency of fetal monitoring depends on the severity of findings, the mother's health and the family's wishes. High-resolution US is required to clearly identify the skeletal abnormalities of HPP. Two- or three-dimensional (2-D or 3-D) US may be used to visualize the skeleton by gestational week 12. Although radiologists are usually trained with 2-D images and generally prefer 2-D to 3-D US when reviewing image slices, 3-D US may allow the radiologist to more clearly visualize characteristic dysmorphic findings of the face, hands, feet, vertebrae, ribs and skull sutures in skeletal dysplasias.

Prenatal CT is a useful modality when skeletal dysplasia is suspected after sonographic examination and is best performed from 30 weeks' gestation; image quality is poor at earlier gestational ages because of relatively poor skeletal mineralization and artefacts caused by fetal movement. Although the added diagnostic value of CT over US has not been formally assessed in a large study, CT allows detailed visualization of the fetal skeleton and is less dependent on amniotic fluid volume and fetal position than US. The risk associated with fetal radiation is a common concern with prenatal CT; however, the risk to benefit ratio can be relatively low if the radiation dose is kept to a minimum by selecting appropriate technical parameters. A recommended threshold of radiation that would have negligible risk to the fetus is 50 milligray. Advances in model-based iterative reconstruction methods for ultra-low-dose fetal CT yield fetal radiation exposures as low as 0.5 milligray while maintaining excellent image quality for the diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias.

MRI has shown only limited utility in prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias and is not routinely used in HPP diagnosis; however, fetal MRI can provide valuable details when targeted US is unable to clarify the diagnosis. Fetal "black bone" MRI, compared with standard MRI sequences, may improve visualization of the mineralized skeleton.

### Differential diagnosis of perinatal hypophosphatasia: radiologic perspectives [^1129RZ5Y]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Postnatal imaging

A whole-body radiograph of an infant (i.e. babygram) is required for any live-born infant, preterm fetus or stillborn with a suspected constitutional disorder of bone. The babygram includes anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs of the full body length. Figures 1, 2 and 3 show postmortem whole-body radiographs of fetuses with normal skeletons at 11, 14 and 15 weeks' gestation. In cases of stillbirths, babygrams may be performed using cabinet X-ray machines that visualize all bones of the skeleton on a single projection. For live-born, larger infants, a standard skeletal survey may be required to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The series of radiographs obtained for a standard skeletal survey may vary among institutions but should include the following views: AP and lateral skull, AP chest (including AP thoracic spine), lateral thoracolumbar spine, AP pelvis (including AP lumbar spine), AP one upper limb, AP one lower limb and dorsipalmar left hand. A review of family members' previous radiographs, if available, may help if any first-degree relatives are suspected of being affected.

Fig. 1
Normal ossification of the fetal skeleton of a male fetus at 11 weeks' gestation. a, b Radiographs in lateral (a) and anteroposterior (b) projections show absent ossification of skull vault, cervical, thoracic and sacral vertebral bodies, and ischia and pubic bones. This is normal for the gestational age (the pelvic calcification [arrows] is probably within the bowel)

Fig. 2
Normal ossification of the fetal skeleton of a male fetus at 14 weeks' gestation. a, b Radiographs in lateral (a) and anteroposterior (b) projections show ossification of all vertebral bodies, which is in contrast with characteristics shown in the 11-week fetus in Fig. 1; however, there remains absent ossification of the skull vault, much of the skull base, and the ischia and pubic bones

Fig. 3
Normal ossification of the fetal skeleton of a male fetus at 15 weeks' gestation. a, b Radiographs in lateral (a) and anteroposterior (b) projections show early ossification of the ischia at 15 weeks (arrows)

Cross-sectional imaging modalities (e.g. US, CT, MRI) are generally reserved for specific skeletal and systemic abnormalities. Whole-body MRI findings associated with HPP have been described in children but may be less useful/practical in a perinatal setting.

### A genetic approach to the diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia [^1113FhSQ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2002). Low credibility.

The skeletal dysplasias are a large and heterogeneous group of disorders. Currently, there are more than 100 recognized forms of skeletal dysplasia, which makes arriving at a specific diagnosis difficult. This process is additionally complicated by the rarity of the individual conditions. The establishment of a precise diagnosis is important for numerous reasons, including prediction of adult height, accurate recurrence risk, prenatal diagnosis in future pregnancies, and most importantly, for proper clinical treatment. When a child is referred for genetic evaluation of suspected skeletal dysplasia, clinical and radiographic indicators, and more specific biochemical and molecular tests, are used to try to arrive at the underlying diagnosis. Preferably, the clinical features and pattern of radiographic abnormalities are used to generate a differential diagnosis so that the appropriate confirmatory tests can be done. The current author will review this sequence of diagnostic steps. For geneticists, this process starts with history gathering including the prenatal and family history. This is followed by clinical examination with measurements and radiographs. Only once a limited differential diagnosis has been established, should molecular investigations be considered.

### Guidelines for the prenatal diagnosis of fetal skeletal dysplasias [^114kfq2S]. Genetics in Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The osteochondrodysplasias, or skeletal dysplasias are a genetically heterogeneous group of over 350 distinct disorders, and many of them can present in the prenatal period as demonstrated by ultrasound. Differentiating these disorders in the prenatal period can be challenging because they are rare and many of the ultrasound findings are not necessarily pathognomic for a specific disorder. However, differentiating known lethal disorders from nonlethal disorders, providing differential diagnoses before delivery, determining postdelivery management plans and ultimately determining accurate recurrences risks to the at-risk couples improves patient care. These guidelines provide an approach to a fetus suspected of manifesting a skeletal dysplasia.

Femoral length — femoral length is not used for assessing gestational age due to variability in the measurement; however, it may be useful in evaluating a fetus with a suspected skeletal dysplasia; measurement technique requires magnifying the femoral diaphysis to fill most of the image space, keeping the ultrasound beam perpendicular to the long axis, placing calipers at the proximal and distal ends of the ossified diaphysis while excluding spur artifacts, and measuring the longest visible diaphysis.

Discussion with Newborn Nursery

Because third-trimester ultrasounds are not routinely obtained in pregnancy, it is not uncommon for the first signs of achondroplasia to be recognized after delivery, in the newborn nursery, or at a first well-child visit. A pediatrician may notice during a newborn examination the presence of macrocephaly, disproportionate short limbs, rhizomelia, deviation between the third and fourth digits (so-called "trident hands"), and/or midface hypoplasia. In this case, x-rays of the spine and lower extremities and/or genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, it is imperative that the patient be referred to a skeletal dysplasia team or a physician who can lead and coordinate skeletal dysplasia care for the infant. This care will entail screening and monitoring for the most common potential complications associated with achondroplasia in infancy, including the following:

Regarding diagnostic investigations for prenatal screening for chromosomal abnormalities, more specifically with respect to further evaluation, ACOG/SMFM 2020 guidelines recommend to counsel patients regarding the risk of aneuploidy associated with isolated soft ultrasonographic markers (such as echogenic cardiac focus, choroid plexus cyst, pyelectasis, short humerus or femur length) where aneuploidy screening has not been performed, and offer cell-free DNA, quad screen testing, or amniocentesis. Do not obtain further risk assessment if aneuploidy testing is obtained and is low-risk. Provide genetic counseling, maternal-fetal medicine consultation, or both, if > 1 marker is identified.

### Phenotypic heterogeneity in-related short-rib thoracic dysplasia: antenatal indicators and postnatal outcomes [^113FxqZS]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

DYNC2H1 -related short-rib thoracic dysplasia with/without polydactyly (SRTD), formerly asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy-Jeune syndrome, is a rare genetic skeletal disorder characterised by a narrow thorax, short ribs, shortened long bones and brachydactyly/polydactyly. DYNC2H1 -related SRTD shows significant phenotypic variability. There is limited information regarding correlations between genotypes, antenatal ultrasound findings and clinical phenotypes and severity.

Methods

A retrospective study of confirmed DYNC2H1 -related SRTD cases was conducted through paper and digital medical records. Data collected included patient demographics, initial presentation, postnatal progression, childhood follow-up, antenatal ultrasound imaging, postnatal skeletal surveys and genetic variant analysis.

Results

Nine individuals from eight families across three tertiary genetic centres in England were included in the study. Eight presented in the antenatal period (gestation 14–36 weeks) and one in the postnatal period at 6weeks. All nine displayed a narrow thorax and eight displayed shortened long bones (humerus and/or femur). Polydactyly was less common and seen in only four individuals. Phenotypic severity was variable, including mild (n = 4), moderate requiring respiratory support (n = 2) and severe/lethal (n = 3) cases. Earlier antenatal presentation and more significant femur shortening and bowing were predictive of poor postnatal prognosis, and there were no clear genotype-phenotype correlations. We also report seven novel DYNC2H1 variants, not previously reported.

Conclusion

DYNC2H1 -related SRTD exhibits significant phenotypic variability which cannot be reliably predicted by genotype but has some correlation with time of gestational presentation.

### A guide to the recognition of skeletal disorders in the fetus [^114qtLtL]. Pediatric Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The discovery of fetal skeletal abnormality on prenatal US mandates an extended study of the fetus. This extended examination includes specific views and measurements of the fetal skeleton. Lethality can be predicted if severe pulmonary hypoplasia is present. Specific diagnosis of a fetal osteochondrodysplasia is difficult; a collaborative approach among obstetric, neonatal and genetic services is necessary to provide the parents with all available information regarding the pregnancy. Pediatric radiologists who have experience in radiologic assessment of osteochondrodystrophies of infants and children can provide expertise in this area.

### Suspected fetal skeletal malformations or bone diseases: how to explore [^112bte12]. Pediatric Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Skeletal dysplasias are a heterogeneous and complex group of conditions that affect bone growth and development and result in various anomalies in shape and size of the skeleton. Although US has proved reliable for the prenatal detection of skeletal abnormalities, the precise diagnosis of a dysplasia is often difficult to make before birth (especially in the absence of a familial history) due to their various phenotypic presentations, the variability in the time at which they manifest and often, the lack of precise molecular diagnosis. In addition to the accuracy of the antenatal diagnosis, it is very important to establish a prognosis. This is a clinically relevant issue as skeletal dysplasias may be associated with severe disability and may even be lethal. We will therefore describe the respective role of two-dimensional (2-D) US, three-dimensional (3-D) US and CT in the antenatal assessment of skeletal malformations.

### Prenatal diagnosis of congenital femoral deficiency and fibular hemimelia [^116CHyPw]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Routine ultrasonography can detect congenital femoral deficiency (CFD) and fibular hemimelia (FH), but prenatal detection rate and its relation to deformity severity have never been reported. Whether mothers prefer prenatal diagnosis is also unknown. We aimed to determine whether mothers prefer prenatal diagnosis, to report detection rates for CFD and/or FH, and to correlate detection rates to severity of limb shortening.

Methods

Surveys were mailed to 171 mothers who gave birth to children with CFD/FH between 2000 and 2008. Bilateral femoral and tibial lengths were measured on postnatal radiographs. We calculated corresponding femoral/tibial lengths at gestational weeks 20 and 30.

Results

Sixty-five surveys were returned, and 56 radiographs were reviewed. Most mothers (63%) preferred prenatal diagnosis as it enables prenatal counseling. Congenital limb shortening was detected in 24 cases (37%) and was not detected in 41 cases (63%). Detection rate was 52% (12 of 23) in CFD cases, 23% (three of 13) in FH cases, and 30% (six of 20) in combined cases. CFD cases with severe shortening had a higher detection rate.

Conclusions

Ultrasonographers should measure both femoral and tibial lengths. Unilateral shortening should result in pediatric orthopedic consultation to estimate limb-length discrepancy at maturity and discuss treatment.

### Special considerations for international weight standards for cleft surgery: presurgical optimisation in a patient with femoral-facial syndrome [^114kMTcQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

The majority of publications describing FFS involve antenatal diagnosis by means of maternal ultrasound scans. This case remained undetected until delivery due to a lack of maternal prenatal care, resulting in a delayed final diagnosis in toddlerhood based on clinical and radiographic findings. Though anomalies in the genitourinary tract, such as renal hypoplasia or agenesis, have been described with FFS, to our knowledge, this is the first report of an anteriorly placed ectopic right kidney.

For the patient with multiple congenital anomalies, it is appropriate to plan a stepwise approach to address surgically correctable conditions, particularly those that impact survival and future development. Early involvement of multidisciplinary teams is essential to identify the appropriate sequence of interventions and, where possible, coordinate multiple procedures under a single anaesthesia event to minimise overall risk and reduce financial burden. Typically, patients who present with micrognathia in the neonatal period require early surgical evaluation to determine the need for tongue–lip adhesion or mandibular distraction to ensure airway patency. In this patient who initially presented in late infancy, sufficient mandibular growth had occurred such that there were no airway complications. Therefore, the immediate surgical priority was cleft palate repair, which is typically performed before 18 months of age to minimise the risk of poor speech outcomes and the development of velopharyngeal insufficiency.

Nutrition status is an essential component of the presurgical screening process, as malnutrition is associated with increased wound healing complications, infection, fistula formation and altered anaesthetic response. Operation Smile's medical global standards require that patients with severe malnutrition, defined as a weight to length/height ratio below −2 SD according to the WHO or national anthropometric growth charts, undergo nutritional optimisation prior to surgical scheduling.

Nutritional rehabilitation of any cleft condition is difficult, but this case was especially challenging due to several patient and facility-specific factors. Despite adequate nutritional rehabilitation, the patient could not achieve age-appropriate weight because of the absence of typical lower limb development. Facility-specific protocols required us to follow global weight standards prior to scheduling cleft surgery, which rely on weight-to-length ratios that are significantly skewed in patients with disorders of skeletal development. Specific growth charts exist for a few syndromes such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome and Noonan syndrome. While there have been attempts to prepare growth charts for cleft conditions due to unique feeding challenges and metabolic demands in this patient population, syndromic cases have routinely been excluded. This omission is particularly noteworthy as approximately 30% of cleft palates are associated with a genetic syndrome.

### Genome sequencing in a cohort of 32 fetuses with genetic skeletal disorders [^116mnNbF]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Genetic skeletal disorders are a large group of rare conditions that affect the development and growth of the skeleton. With 771 identified clinical entities, each disorder possesses unique characteristics, inheritance patterns, and prognosis. Among these, approximately 200 disorders are identifiable prenatally, presenting challenges for early detection and management. These disorders vary widely in their phenotypic presentation, ranging from mild anomalies often recognized in the third trimester, to severe, life-limiting malformations that are diagnosed already in the first or second trimester. Traditional prenatal screening methods, such as ultrasound scans, are crucial for the initial detection of skeletal abnormalities. However, the information obtained from fetal ultrasound often does not provide enough detail and there is a large overlap in the clinical findings between different conditions. Although fetal CT offers more detailed imaging and has been effectively utilized as an additional method in some countries, its implementation in Sweden remains limited due to concerns regarding radiation exposure. The widespread availability of massive parallel sequencing, including its compatibility with low-input sequencing technologies, has made prenatal genetic testing on DNA from amniotic fluid or chorionic villus samples a valuable diagnostic complement. By examining 32 fetuses with prenatally detected skeletal abnormalities confirmed by postnatal radiographs, we aimed to determine the diagnostic yield and identify previously unreported genetic variants contributing to these disorders, to improve prenatal diagnostic accuracy and enhance genetic counseling.

### Prenatal diagnosis of genetic aberrations in fetuses with short femur detected by ultrasound: a prospective cohort study [^112ptGFm]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the genetic aberrations in fetuses with short femur and explore the relationships with respect to degree of femoral shortening and the initial diagnostic gestational age GA.

Methods

Singleton pregnancies with fetal short femur who consented to amniocentesis and to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and Sanger sequencing for G380R mutations in FGFR3 gene were enrolled in this 5-year period prospective study. Clinical follow-up assessments were performed after birth.

Results

Of a total of 161 fetuses, the prevalence of genetic aberrations was 16.2% (26/161), comprised of 65.4% (17/26) with chromosomal abnormalities and 34.6% (9/26) with G380R mutations. All fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities had FL 2–4SDs below GA. Fewer chromosomal abnormalities were detected in fetuses with short femurs presenting in the third trimester. Significantly more FGFR3 mutations were detected in fetuses with FL below -4SDs. All fetuses with FL 2–4SDs below GA diagnosed as achondroplasia were between 22 and 24 gestational weeks, and all of those diagnosed in third trimester had FL below -4SDs.

Conclusion

In this small cohort study, we demonstrated that different degrees of femur shortness may be attributed to different genetic aberrations. SNP array should be regarded as the first-tier test for fetuses with FL 2–4SDs below GA. The prognoses for fetuses with FL 2–4SDs below GA was significantly better than those with FL below 4SDs.

### The utility of ultrasound for the detection of fetal limb abnormalities – a 20-year single-center experience [^111pwkah]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Congenital limb abnormalities have a live birth (LB) prevalence of approximately 1 in 1600. The prenatal detection of such malformations is important for parental education, counseling, initiating appropriate planning for postnatal evaluation and treatment and ruling out associated malformations, which may alter the management of the pregnancy. The recent Executive Summary of a Joint Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American College of Radiology, Society for Pediatric Radiology, and Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound Fetal Imaging Workshop recommends documentation of the arms and legs as a component of the standard fetal examination at 18 to 20 weeks of gestation. However, the utility of visualizing these structures in excluding anomalies of the extremities is variable. The purpose of this study was to review the diagnostic accuracy of obstetric ultrasound at a tertiary referral center in the United States for the detection of fetal limb abnormalities, associated malformations and outcomes.

### Radiographic features of osteogenesis imperfecta [^112JL9M8]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Antenatal diagnosis of OI

Severe forms of OI (mainly type II) can be diagnosed by ultrasound during the second trimester of pregnancy. Nonspecific signs such as intra-uterine growth retardation or hydramnios may be seen. Otherwise, examination may show abnormalities of the skull, the rib cage, the spine or the limbs, such as decreased echogenicity due to insufficient mineralisation, deformities related to fractures, callus formation and increased bone plasticity, and micromelia, especially of the femur (Fig. 1). In case of doubt and when a termination of pregnancy is being considered, low-dose computed tomography (CT) with three-dimensional reconstructions of the whole foetal skeleton can be performed, after 26 weeks of gestation, to yield a correct diagnosis. The role of MRI is limited, except when visualisation of the foetal brain or visceral organs is required to look for associated abnormalities or to assess foetal lung volume. When termination of pregnancy is performed based on the discovery of ultrasound and CT abnormalities, postmortem radiographs are a very useful adjunct to diagnosis, in confirming and specifying foetal bone abnormalities (Fig. 2).

### International consensus statement on the diagnosis, multidisciplinary management and lifelong care of individuals with achondroplasia [^116FZK5t]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Achondroplasia — diagnostics, genetics and molecular testing recommends that prenatal genetic testing is possible by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis for the FGFR3 pathogenic variant for any pregnancy in which the fetus might have achondroplasia; non-invasive prenatal screening using fetal cell-free DNA extracted from maternal blood is available in many but not all locations and such non-invasive screening might be used if only the father has achondroplasia or if either member of a couple with average stature already had a child with achondroplasia; in infants and young children with suspected achondroplasia, a full skeletal survey is not routinely indicated; genetic analysis of the FGFR3 gene can be considered for individuals with clinical and/or radiographic suspicion; and ultrasound findings of achondroplasia are generally not apparent until 24 weeks of gestation, with genetic testing performed due to anomalies suggestive of achondroplasia before 24 weeks of gestation requiring consideration and testing for other skeletal dysplasias unless a parent or sibling has achondroplasia.

### Indications, advantages and limitations of perinatal postmortem imaging in clinical practice [^116eNtnr]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Skeletal abnormalities or dysplasias are extremely rare in infants who do not have external stigmata. This has been shown by studies in the 1970s and 1980s in which routine postmortem radiography was diagnostic in about 15% and of no value in > 50%. A more recent study suggested that postmortem radiography was not useful in the absence of an antenatal sonographic abnormality, abnormal clinical examination or abnormal chromosomal abnormality, although the authors did not address the utility of bone biometry for foetal growth assessment.

It is often difficult to extract from published data the objective additional value of postmortem radiography over an autopsy, or vice versa, because in all cases both investigations (autopsy and postmortem radiography) were performed and a composite final report issued. In studies where the autopsy rate was high, the additional yield of routine radiographs is likely to be minimal, with the main exception being specific clinical settings identified prior to autopsy, such as suspected skeletal dysplasias or complex genetic syndromes, in which postmortem radiography often provides a specific diagnosis. Two more recent studies of the objective usefulness of postmortem radiography have concluded that it is useful in only a minority of cases. The most recent study in a single specialist centre reported an overall abnormality rate of foetal postmortem radiography of about 10%, but almost all cases in this study had clear indications on antenatal history or external examination; only 0.3% of cases were predicted to be missed if a policy of highly selected, rather than routine, foetal postmortem radiography was employed.

Initial cost estimates suggest that a directed approach could also represent a cost saving: while postmortem radiography is fairly cheap as a diagnostic tool, the workload volume in routine imaging may not justify its overall service cost. An evidence-based selective postmortem radiography imaging protocol could yield significant cost savings, without a reduction in diagnostic yield. We conclude that routine postmortem radiography in all cases has a low diagnostic yield in clinical practice and is therefore neither diagnostically useful nor cost-effective, and therefore we suggest that postmortem radiography remain indicated for specific cases in which an appropriate abnormality is suspected from the antenatal findings, or in cases in which a specialist paediatric pathologist determines that there is a clinical indication to exclude or include specific features from the clinical history or initial external examination. Limiting skeletal radiography to selected cases would significantly reduce the radiology case workload. This would support the use of additional cross-sectional examinations such as postmortem CT in selected cases, yet still represent an overall cost-saving.

Evaluation of infants with risk factors for DDH — timing and modality for selective imaging: If the risk factors of family and/or breech presentation are present, there is moderate evidence to support selective ultrasound screening between 2–6 weeks of age for infants who otherwise have a normal clinical hip examination or an AP radiograph at 4 months of age. There were two studies of moderate strength that confirm significance for selective prospective screening by ultrasound in infants with history of possible clinical instability and/or risk factors: breech and family history to prevent late dislocations and need for surgery. The literature terminology on breech is: breech at birth, breech delivery, and breech position at the third trimester; there is no literature to substantiate a particular duration of breech positioning as a risk factor.

### The value of enhancing sonographic phenotyping to improve the diagnostic yield of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) for achondroplasia [^1154WEtr]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

Conversely, the diagnostic rate dropped to 8.9% when isolated short long bones — below the third centile — or an isolated curved femur were the only sonographic signs motivating FGFR3 NIPD. This result suggests that short long bones, when considered as an isolated sonographic feature, may not be an appropriate indication for NIPD targeting of FGFR3 variants. Also, a significant proportion of foetuses were classified as having 'short femurs' in the third trimester when older growth curves were used; therefore, the adoption of the newer charts (Intergrowth or WHO charts — according to the standard practice of the reference centre) is recommended. Given the targeted nature of NIPD for achondroplasia, a negative result does not inherently rule out other foetal anomalies (in the FGFR3 gene or elsewhere). Therefore, in cases where the combination of three highly specific sonographic features is absent, or when ultrasound reveals isolated non‐specific findings, we recommend prioritizing comprehensive genetic testing via amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. As highlighted by Mone et al. prenatal exome sequencing has a significant diagnostic yield, particularly for cases with isolated short long bones (48%) and short long bones with additional skeletal anomalies (68%). This approach ensures a wider diagnostic net, avoiding the potential for a targeted NIPD result to inadvertently delay a definitive diagnosis of an alternative underlying condition.

This study aims to contribute to the existing knowledge base and collaboratively support clinicians in optimising NIPD ordering practices as part of a whole to a global effort to improve ordering practices. By identifying key sonographic features associated with achondroplasia, we aim to enable clinicians to make more personalised and efficient diagnostic decisions.

Emerging treatments for achondroplasia have changed the natural growth history of this condition and may transform the practices of FGFR3 prenatal diagnosis. NIPD provides a safe and effective tool, offering couples new alternatives for their future child, together with respect for individual choice, autonomy, advocacy and political support for concerned individuals. Recently, the first European consensus for management of achondroplasia provided guidelines for optimal care of people with achondroplasia, which can be used in conjunction with more specific recommendations provided at regional, national, or institutional levels.

### Differential diagnosis of perinatal hypophosphatasia: radiologic perspectives [^113nBm49]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The gestational age at which skeletal abnormalities are apparent in perinatal HPP varies widely, with some cases detected on prenatal US as early as 13 weeks' gestation. However, HPP diagnosis based on US findings cannot be definitive until halfway through the second trimester, when characteristics of in utero HPP become more evident. In the second trimester, all bony features become more apparent as the fetus grows and increase in visibility as ossification progresses. If the diaphysis of a tubular bone is not ossified in the second trimester, it is likely abnormal rather than physiologically related to gestational age.

Prenatal US findings may help predict lethality of a skeletal dysplasia. The three most accurate predictors of fatality when evaluated in conjunction with fetal amniotic fluid volume are 3-D fetal lung volume, the ratio of femur length to abdominal circumference and the ratio of chest circumference to abdominal circumference. In general, the risk of fatality is greater if chest size is small and/or multiple rib fractures are present because this will lead to breathing difficulties ex utero. Lethal perinatal HPP is characterized by diffuse hypomineralization of the fetal skeleton with the absence of many bones and a lack of posterior acoustic shadowing from bones that are sonographically visible. In particular, the neural arches and the thoracic spine may be poorly ossified or absent. In general, lethal perinatal HPP is clearly more severe than other forms of HPP at first detection, with a lack of improvement in skeletal signs with increasing gestational age. The severity of hypomineralization may also predict fatality. A diagnosis of lethal HPP can usually be made by the late second or early third trimester. Lack of mineralization of bones in the hands is considered an important feature. However, no correlation is apparent between the gestational age when skeletal disease is first observed and the severity of HPP after birth.

### Prenatal diagnosis of achondroplasia: new specific signs [^114KhPi1]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Achondroplasia is one of the most common forms of short limb dwarfism. It is usually suspected on third trimester routine ultrasound because of very shortened long bones. We have described two new prenatal sonographic signs of achondroplasia visible at the proximal femoral metaphysis.

Methods

Over 5 years, five fetuses were diagnosed with achondroplasia at the Grenoble Prenatal Diagnosis Centre. Ultrasound and tomographic examinations were performed by specialists. To study the proximal metaphysis, the ultrasound transducer was positioned at a 45 degree angle to the diaphyseal axis. Postnatal diagnosis was confirmed.

Results

On computed tomography and postnatal X-ray, proximal femoral metaphysis appeared rounded, with poor, uneven ossification. Connexion to diaphysis was abnormal, with relative overgrowth of the periosteum, creating a new diagnostic sign that we called the 'collar hoop' sign. On ultrasound, all fetuses had a very rounded metaphyseal-epiphyseal interface, with an angle connexion to diaphysis wider than expected. The 'collar hoop' sign was obvious on four of the fetuses. During the same period, proximal femoral metaphyses appeared normal in 653 healthy fetuses, suggesting high specificity of those two new signs.

Conclusion

Metaphysis examination is recommended if fetal femur length measures below the fifth percentile, as normal aspect may rule out achondroplasia.

### Low-dose fetal CT in the prenatal evaluation of skeletal dysplasias and other severe skeletal abnormalities [^1144EcJf]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia is often difficult and based on findings with ultrasound, a technique with 40–60% sensitivity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a preliminary experience in assessing severe prenatal osseous abnormalities with low-dose fetal CT. The hypothesis was that use of CT may improve the prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia beyond the available capabilities of ultrasound.

Materials and Methods

Retrospective search of a radiology database (July 2008-February 2011) yielded the records of unenhanced CT examinations of patients referred because of abnormal fetal bones. The original ultrasound and CT reports as interpreted at image acquisition were independently analyzed by two radiologists blinded to the final diagnosis and to the findings of the opposing imaging modality. Blinded review of the images was also performed. Correlation was made with the postmortem and postnatal findings.

Results

According to the reports of the studies, 5 of 21 cases were interpreted correctly with CT and incorrectly with ultrasound. In 17 cases, CT revealed additional osseous findings not in the ultrasound report. There were no cases in which ultrasound findings were correct and CT findings were incorrect. Blinded review of the images revealed that CT outperformed ultrasound (p < 0.001). There were a total of four CT errors among 218 total measures recorded and a total of 19 ultrasound errors among 218 total measures.

Conclusion

Although low-dose fetal CT should never be used as the initial diagnostic modality in cases of suspected skeletal dysplasia, it is a powerful imaging adjunct that depicts the fetal bones in exquisite detail. Use of CT of fetuses at risk of skeletal dysplasia may provide clinicians with more accurate information for counseling of families regarding neonatal morbidity and mortality.

### The role of prenatal ultrasound and added value of post-mortem radiographic imaging with X-ray and CT in suspected fetal skeletal dysplasia [^116EXP8W]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

Based on US findings, the fetal condition was classified as lethal or severely life‐limiting in 18/36 (50%) cases. However, the methods of describing and reporting the findings tended to be variable. In five of these 18 cases, FL/AC < 0.16 was mentioned as one indicator of lethal disease. Chest circumference was not measured often; instead, chest was described to be small or bell‐shaped. In one case of Thanatophoric dysplasia, TC/AC was measured to be normal (> 0.6) but other features and FL/AC indicated lethal disease. Nine cases were described to have severe skeletal abnormalities such as very short and bowed long bones or poorly mineralized skull. The remaining cases had mainly non‐skeletal findings indicating severe disease such as fetal hydrops or lack of fetal movements. In two cases, the assessment of lethality was based solely on the molecular genetic analysis; both fetuses were diagnosed with GRACILE. All 18 cases with severe disease were discovered before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Of these 18 pregnancies, 16 were terminated. In the remaining two cases, the child was born alive but died within days after birth.

In our cohort, both lethal and non‐lethal skeletal dysplasias had normal amounts of amniotic fluid in the second trimester US and polyhydramnion was only observed in one case of non‐lethal spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia at 31 + 5 pregnancy weeks.

### The value of enhancing sonographic phenotyping to improve the diagnostic yield of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) for achondroplasia [^114MEgQB]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Ultrasound Examination

Referral diagnostic ultrasound examinations were performed at 33 foetal medicine units in France, in accordance with the 2016 and 2023 national guidelines of the Collège Français d'Echographie Foetale. Conception dates used to calculate gestational age were determined based on first‐trimester crown–rump length measurements, using either Robinson or Intergrowth‐21th curves, according to the centre's practice.

Databases from each foetal medicine unit that requested our laboratory to provide NIPD based on sonographic findings suggestive of achondroplasia from 2017 to 2023 were reviewed. Prenatal records were examined to determine the following foetal measurements: biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length, humerus length, and the length of the radius, ulna, tibia and fibula. We also evaluated the presence in available sonographic reports of the 17 following specific sonographic features: short femurs, short long bones, bowed femurs, abnormal proximal end of the femur, spur sign, short humeri, macrocrania above the 95 th centile, an abnormal profile with a prominent forehead, brachycephaly, midfacial hypoplasia, a marked nasal saddle, trident hands, spinal anomalies, platyspondyly, narrow chest, excess amniotic fluid or polydramnios. The 'collar hoop' sign refers to a small bony excrescence that protrudes outward all around the femoral shaft, at the interface between metaphysis and diaphysis, and at the interface between the metaphysis and diaphysis, as defined by Boulet and colleagues.

A total of 65 sonographic records from 18 to 22 weeks of gestation (WG) were examined, along with 99 records from 22 to 28 WG, 123 records after 28 WG, and 44 prenatal CT scans. Finally, pregnancy outcomes were retrieved from the referring centres, when available. Pregnancy outcomes classified healthy live births as either normal or with persistently short long bones postnatally, based on growth charts and clinical examination.

### Differential diagnosis of perinatal hypophosphatasia: radiologic perspectives [^117QgBDm]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Perinatal hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare, potentially life-threatening, inherited, systemic metabolic bone disease that can be difficult to recognize in utero and postnatally. Diagnosis is challenging because of the large number of skeletal dysplasias with overlapping clinical features. This review focuses on the role of fetal and neonatal imaging modalities in the differential diagnosis of perinatal HPP from other skeletal dysplasias (e.g., osteogenesis imperfecta, campomelic dysplasia, achondrogenesis subtypes, hypochondrogenesis, cleidocranial dysplasia). Perinatal HPP is associated with a broad spectrum of imaging findings that are characteristic of but do not occur in all cases of HPP and are not unique to HPP, such as shortening, bowing and angulation of the long bones, and slender, poorly ossified ribs and metaphyseal lucencies. Conversely, absent ossification of whole bones is characteristic of severe lethal HPP and is associated with very few other conditions. Certain features may help distinguish HPP from other skeletal dysplasias, such as sites of angulation of long bones, patterns of hypomineralization, and metaphyseal characteristics. In utero recognition of HPP allows for the assembly and preparation of a multidisciplinary care team before delivery and provides additional time to devise treatment strategies.

### Radiographic and genetic diagnosis of sporadic hypochondroplasia early in the neonatal period [^1157QyPf]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2004). Low credibility.

Hypochondroplasia is an autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia expressing postnatal onset of short stature with mild rhizomelic shortening of the limbs. This manifestation leads to restricted prenatal diagnosis of the disorder. We report here on a sporadic case of a hypochondroplastic baby, whose prenatal sonographic measurements were serially recorded from 19 weeks of gestation. Mild shortening of the limbs became manifest after 26 weeks of gestation. Biparietal diameter was within the normal range throughout gestation. Both parents were of average stature. A tentative diagnosis of a nonlethal short-limb skeletal dysplasia was made. At birth, the clinical manifestations of the neonate were not characteristic, but the radiographic features raised the possibility of hypochondroplasia. Molecular analyses revealed a C to G mutation at nucleotide 1659 of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, a common mutation in hypochondroplasia.

### Approach to the patient with achondroplasia-new considerations for diagnosis, management, and treatment [^113FUCBK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Case 2: Newborn Nursery

A 1-day-old infant was evaluated in the newborn nursery. He was born at 39 weeks' gestation to a 32-year-old healthy woman. The pregnancy was uncomplicated and the prenatal ultrasound at 20 weeks' gestation was unremarkable. The infant was born via spontaneous vaginal delivery, and there were no clinical concerns following delivery. On examination, the infant was well-appearing, macrocephalic with frontal bossing, and had disproportionately short limbs as compared to the trunk with rhizomelia of the upper and lower extremities. The anterior fontanelle was soft, flat, and large at 5 cm by 4 cm. He had symmetric movement of all extremities, axial hypotonia, and normal appendicular tone with good strength and strong suck and grasp. The pediatrician suspected a skeletal dysplasia. A single radiograph including the infant's chest, abdomen, and extremities (eg, babygram) showed decreased interpedicular distance from upper to lower lumbar spine, flat rounded iliac bones with narrow sacrosciatic notches, and radiolucency of the proximal femurs, confirming the clinical diagnosis of achondroplasia (Fig. 2). Using achondroplasia male growth grids, length was 50%, weight was 50%, and head circumference was 25%. The newborn underwent a car seat test to screen for episodes of apnea and, given his achondroplasia diagnosis, particular attention to his lack of head control was noted. His pediatrician was made aware of the diagnosis and the family was scheduled for a visit with a local geneticist with a same-day baseline fast-spin magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine and a coordinated overnight polysomnogram. The infant was discharged to home with his parents on day of life 2 in a car bed.

### The role of prenatal ultrasound and added value of post-mortem radiographic imaging with X-ray and CT in suspected fetal skeletal dysplasia [^11426XKN]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Material and Methods

This study was based on a retrospectively collected cohort, involving pregnancies with prenatally suspected or diagnosed fetal skeletal dysplasias between January 2013 and March 2020 at the Fetomaternal Medical Center (FMC) at Helsinki University Hospital. FMC is a tertiary institution for fetal medicine and its catchment area covers almost one third of the Finnish population. Clinical details about pregnancies, including US and genetic findings, have been presented in our previous publication. In the present study, we carried out a more extensive evaluation of the US findings and their association with radiographic imaging findings in this same cohort. This research was approved by Helsinki University Central Hospital (no. 4199, November 4, 2020). As this was a retrospective study utilizing hospital register data, informed consent or separate ethical approval was not required.

In Finland, all pregnant women are offered prenatal ultrasound screening free of charge. First trimester screening is offered between 10 + 1 and 13 + 6 gestational weeks and second trimester morphology screening between 18 + 0 and 21 + 6 weeks. If fetal abnormality is suspected, families are referred to a fetal diagnostic unit for further evaluation and counseling. Invasive diagnostic testing (either chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis) is offered if genetic etiology is suspected. According to the Finnish law, termination of pregnancy (TOP) is allowed before 24 weeks of pregnancy if a severe fetal abnormality (structural anomaly, genetic abnormality or other severe fetal disease) is diagnosed with a reliable method.

Ultrasound in our cohort was performed by an experienced perinatologist at the fetal diagnostic unit and both two‐dimensional (2D) and three‐dimensional (3D) imaging were used. Fetal MRI was available but it has not been routinely used in cases with suspected skeletal dysplasia and was not applied in this cohort.

After termination of pregnancy or after fetal demise, radiographic imaging using ionizing radiation (X‐ray and/or CT with 3D reformats) was performed. In cases where the diagnosis had not been genetically confirmed during the pregnancy, fetal autopsy was performed and DNA samples were obtained for genetic analyses. Liveborn children were evaluated by a pediatrician and skeletal findings were evaluated by X‐ray. All imaging was performed in normal clinical settings. X‐ray and CT were reviewed concurrently, and the findings were not separated in the report.

We classified the diagnoses as skeletal dysplasias if they were included in the recent version of Nosology (2023;), while diagnoses resembling skeletal disease but absent from the Nosology were considered as a separate group that should be considered in differential diagnostics.

### Antenatal detection of skeletal dysplasias [^1144cZtM]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the accuracy of the prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias.

Methods

All antenatally detected anomalies are coded in our ultrasound database, which is linked with a genetics database that includes outcomes. A final diagnosis is sought on the basis of radiographic studies, molecular testing, or both. Our ultrasound and genetics databases were queried for "skeletal dysplasias". All cases were reviewed specifically for the degree of bone shortening and other distinguishing characteristics on antenatal sonography.

Results

Thirty-seven cases of skeletal dysplasia were antenatally diagnosed over an 8-year period. Complete follow-up was available in 31 cases. The mean gestational age at diagnosis was 22.7 weeks (range, 14–32.3 weeks). Twenty-one cases were diagnosed before 24 weeks. A final diagnosis was obtained in 80% of cases. The antenatal diagnosis was correct in 20 (65%) of 31 cases. There were 2 false-positive diagnoses. Specific final diagnoses included thanatophoric dysplasia (8), osteogenesis imperfecta (6), Roberts syndrome (2), achondroplasia (3), Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (1), metaphyseal dysplasia (1), spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (1), distal arthrogryposis (1), caudal regression (1), and glycogen storage disorder (1). The condition was correctly thought to be lethal in 16 of the fetuses on the basis of early severe long bone shortening (13), femur length-abdominal circumference ratio of less than 0.16 (12), hypoplastic thorax (10), marked bowing or fractures (4), short ribs (4), caudal regression (1), and cloverleaf skull (1). The ability to predict lethality was 100%. There were no false-positive findings with respect to lethality.

Conclusions

Accurate antenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias is problematic; in this series, only 20 of 31 cases were correctly diagnosed. However, the antenatal prediction of lethality was highly accurate. The most common predictors of lethal skeletal dysplasias included early and severe shortening of the long bones, femur length-abdominal circumference ratio of less than 0.16, hypoplastic thorax, and certain distinguishing characteristics.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of limited obstetric ultrasound examinations by advanced clinical providers [^114LtV7i]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Gestational age assessment emphasizes that first-trimester crown-rump measurement is the most accurate means for ultrasound dating of pregnancy; beyond this period, biparietal diameter (BPD), abdominal circumference (AC), and femoral diaphysis length (FL) can be used to estimate gestational age, though variability increases with advancing pregnancy. Significant discrepancies between gestational age and fetal measurements may suggest the possibility of a fetal growth abnormality, intrauterine growth restriction, or macrosomia, and the pregnancy should not be redated after an accurate earlier scan has been performed and is available for comparison.

### Approach to the patient with achondroplasia-new considerations for diagnosis, management, and treatment [^111oUytH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion of Prenatal Diagnosis

Since achondroplasia is caused by a de novo FGFR3 variant in 80% of cases and the clinical features may be subtle, the diagnosis will likely not be suspected in average-height biological parent pregnancy. Achondroplasia is not evident in the 18- to 20-week anatomy scan. By the third trimester, a fetus with achondroplasia may have decreased femur length, macrocephaly with frontal bossing, depressed nasal bridge, brachydactyly with trident hand, and a collar hoop sign (ie, abnormal connection to diaphysis with relative overgrowth of the periosteum), but there is often no indication to perform this late imaging and therefore the differences are not seen. Even after birth, achondroplasia may not be obvious since midface hypoplasia may be mild and newborn length is within normal range of average stature infants.

Due to the later onset of features, chorionic villus sampling at or before 12 weeks' gestation and amniocentesis from 16 weeks onward is not routinely performed for the indication of suspected achondroplasia. However, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology now recommends NIPT that can be performed as early as 9 to 10 weeks' gestation for all pregnancies to assess for aneuploidies because the risk of detecting one of these is greater than the risk of miscarriage in the pregnancy via invasive prenatal testing methods. In some prenatal settings, a limited single-gene or panel for copy number variants and/or single genes is offered by NIPT. As of late 2024, this prenatal panel of single genes includes the achondroplasia-specific FGFR3 pathogenic variant c.1138G > A or c.1138G > C (p. Gly380Arg). Testing for FGFR3 condition can only be conducted by NIPT if the pregnant parent does not have the same condition, since the test will not distinguish between maternal and fetal FGFR3 variant. This is the case presented earlier, which is leading to earlier diagnosis and the presentation of expecting mothers and support partners to skeletal dysplasia centers and experts.

### Detection and nonoperative management of pediatric developmental dysplasia of the hip in infants up to six months of age [^117B4zEt]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) — definitions, natural history, and evaluation highlights that terminology and criteria are inconsistent, early detection must consider physiologic hip development, and current practice standards call for evaluation of all newborns using clinical and imaging resources. There is inconsistent terminology with no clear or widely accepted clinical definitions and imaging criteria are similarly vague; early detection and early management must take into account the early natural history of physiologic hip development, and current and evolving practice standards call for a musculoskeletal evaluation of all newborn children with methods that may involve both clinical and imaging resources. The true prevalence of adult hip pathology attributable to DDH is unknown.

### Approach to the patient with short stature: genetic testing [^114tmUrg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

The first step in the evaluation of the short child is to decide whether growth parameters in the context of the history are abnormal or a variant of normal. If growth is considered abnormal, system and hormonal tests are likely to be required, followed by more directed testing, such as skeletal survey and/or genetic screening with karyotype or microarray. In a small percentage of short children in whom a diagnosis has not been reached, this will need to be followed by detailed genetic analysis; currently, exome sequencing using targeted panels relevant to the phenotype is the commonly used test. Clinical scenarios are presented that illustrate how such genetic testing can be used to establish a molecular diagnosis, and how that diagnosis contributes to the management of the short child. New genetic causes for short stature are being recognized on a frequent basis, while the clinical spectrum for known genes is being extended. We recommend that an international repository for short stature conditions is established for new findings to aid dissemination of knowledge, but also to help in the definition of the clinical spectrum both for new and established conditions.

### The value of enhancing sonographic phenotyping to improve the diagnostic yield of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) for achondroplasia [^114edVRd]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

Several other conditions have been associated with pathogenic variants in the FGFR3 gene, including hypochondroplasia (MIM # 146000), severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans (SADDAN) (MIM # 616482), thanatophoric dysplasia (types I and II) (MIM # 187600 and 187,601), and FGFR‐related craniosynostosis, including Muenke syndrome (MIM # 602849) and Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans (MIM # 612247).

While a clinical and radiological diagnosis of achondroplasia can often be made with certainty at birth, the European Achondroplasia Forum recommends postnatal genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis, particularly when it has not been established prenatally. During the prenatal period, molecular studies are also of particular interest in case of foetal growth retardation detected during regular prenatal ultrasound screening. Achondroplasia is suspected on routine ultrasound scans when long bones are found to be below the third percentile for gestational age. Femur length progressively falls away from the centiles after 24 weeks, while head circumference and abdominal circumference remain within or above the normal range. The proximal end of the femur is also abnormal. The femora may appear bowed, and the proximal femoral metaphysis often presents as a rounded interface due to deficient ossification. A small bony excrescence, a few millimetres in size, appears to protrude circumferentially around the femoral shaft at the interface between the metaphysis and diaphysis. This feature has been referred to as the 'collar hoop' sign by Boulet et al. Additionally, the abnormal metaphysis slopes downward and connects to the diaphysis at a widened angle than typically expected. In cases of achondroplasia, slowing of growth of the femurs and humerus is the most evident. It typically becomes evident after 24 weeks of gestation and is frequently associated with an amount of amniotic fluid above the expected range. While femur length is commonly assessed using growth charts and centiles, its reliability can be further enhanced by adopting the newer charts (Intergrowth or WHO). Increased head circumference, or macrocrania, is a recognised and frequently assumed sonographic feature of achondroplasia. Three‐dimensional ultrasound imaging improves the assessment of facial dysmorphia.

### The utility of ultrasound for the detection of fetal limb abnormalities – a 20-year single-center experience [^115KfmJJ]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Kevern and colleagues reviewed two study populations to examine the accuracy of prenatal sonographic identification of fetal limb abnormalities. In a retrospective review of 60 infants referred for genetic counseling, for the birth of a child with a limb abnormality, 15 were detected prenatally for a sensitivity of 25%. Using the Wessex Antenatally Detected Anomalies Register, 67 cases of limb anomaly were diagnosed prenatally, 56 of which were confirmed postnatally (PPV 84%). Correctly diagnosed abnormalities included micromelia, rhizomelia, absent bone, shortened bone and POD. Only 3/56 had associated malformations (5.4%).

A retrospective review of 64 fetuses with a short, absent or abnormal radius and/or ulna revealed 15% were ISO, 70% were correctly diagnosed prenatally and 84% were confirmed postnatally. Chromosomal anomalies and genetic syndromes occurred in 29.7% and were more likely if the abnormalities were bilateral.

The Northern Congenital Abnormalities Survey collects data on all major congenital abnormalities in the northern region of England. During the period 2000 to 2005, there were 18 cases of radial ray defects. Eleven (61%) were diagnosed prenatally. TOP was elected in 12 cases, which included four fetuses with T18 and three others with a non-chromosomal syndrome. Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound was used in 8/18 cases and either confirmed the ultrasound findings or allowed the diagnosis of additional anomalies. It was felt to be especially useful in illustrating the relationships of the fetal forearm and hand and for examination of the facial anatomy.

A prior study from this institution included 100 cases of upper extremity anomalies evaluated in the congenital hand surgery clinic. These children were not necessarily a part of the database for the current study and most had been imaged prenatally at other sites. Thirty-one of these cases had an upper extremity abnormality identified on prenatal ultrasound. In 18/31 (58%), the prenatal diagnosis was confirmed postnatally.

### Should we offer prenatal exome sequencing for intrauterine growth restriction or short long bones? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116sFUJu]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to determine the incremental yield of prenatal exome sequencing over chromosomal microarray or G-banding karyotype in fetuses with: (1) intrauterine growth restriction related to placental insufficiency or (2) short long bones, in isolated and nonisolated instances for both scenarios.

Data Sources

Data were collected via electronic searches for relevant citations from January 2010 to April 10, 2022 in MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane, and using relevant bibliographies and data generated in-house.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Included were prospective or retrospective cohort studies and/or case series with: (1) n > 5 cases of short long bones and/or intrauterine growth restriction undergoing prenatal sequencing with a clearly defined phenotype including assessment of placental function; (2) testing based on prenatal phenotype only; (3) a nondiagnostic chromosomal microarray/karyotype; and (4) known results of genetic testing.

Methods

Incremental yield was calculated for each study and as a pooled value for the aforementioned groups using a random-effects model. Results were displayed in forest plots with 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was assessed statistically using Higgins' I 2. Publication bias was assessed graphically using funnel plots. Quality assessment was performed using modified Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy criteria (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews registration number CRD42022324680).

Results

Nineteen studies were included (n = 452 cases). The apparent incremental yields with prenatal sequencing were: (1) 4% (95% confidence interval, -5.0 to 12; I² = 0%) in isolated intrauterine growth restriction with evidence of placental insufficiency, (2) 30% (95% confidence interval, 13–47; I² = 1%) in intrauterine growth restriction with additional structural anomalies, (3) 48% (95% confidence interval, 26–70; I² = 73%) in isolated short long bones, and (4) 68% (95% confidence interval, 58–77; I² = 51%) in short long bones with additional skeletal anomalies. Of the 37 short long bone cases with a diagnosis, 32 had a skeletal dysplasia, with thanatophoric dysplasia and osteogenesis imperfecta being the most common (both 21.6% [n = 8/37]). In fetuses with short long bones and additional skeletal features, osteogenesis imperfecta was the most common diagnosis (28% [n = 57/204]). Where documented, the inheritance patterns were de novo in 75.4% (n = 150) of cases.

Conclusion

Prenatal sequencing adds substantially to incremental yield over chromosomal microarray in fetuses with short long bones or multisystem intrauterine growth restriction. Robust studies are required to assess the utility of fetal sequencing in isolated intrauterine growth restriction with evidence of placental insufficiency, which cannot be recommended on the basis of current evidence.

### Indications, advantages and limitations of perinatal postmortem imaging in clinical practice [^114b6HHA]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Foetal postmortem radiography

Skeletal radiography provides an overview of bone structure and development, and bone biometry, and it allows identification of focal or generalised bone abnormalities; a specific diagnostic approach to the postmortem radiography is provided elsewhere in this mini-symposium. Routine postmortem radiographs are suggested in national autopsy guidelines and are considered mandatory in certain cases such as suspected skeletal dysplasia.

Before the widespread introduction of routine antenatal sonography, foetal gestational age estimation and accurate skeletal imaging was difficult. Postmortem radiography therefore developed as a standard tool for these indices from assessments of ossification centres and long-bone length measurements. Postmortem radiography also allows rarer foetal disorders such as skeletal dysplasias to be detected and better characterised. However, postmortem radiographs can be technically difficult to perform because of the positional changes of rigor mortis (in infants and older children) and other artefactual issues, and unlike in live skeletal surveys, there is no standardised protocol or guidance as to when a babygram or skeletal survey should be used.

Modern antenatal sonography now provides highly accurate determination of gestational age and reliable detection of a wide variety of foetal abnormalities, including skeletal dysplasias. As antenatal diagnostic sonography continues to improve, combined with a low incidence and prevalence of skeletal dysplasias and other foetal bony abnormalities (the most significant of which are identified antenatally and are typically an indication for termination of pregnancy), the yield of routine postmortem radiographic examinations is low with regard to providing significant additional information in apparently anatomically normal foetuses and stillbirths. A particular challenge for radiologists in this setting is differentiating skeletal dysplasias from normal skeletal development at increasingly early gestation (less than 20 weeks), where knowledge of normal foetal appearances is crucial. Other imaging modalities such as micro-CT and high-resolution postmortem MRI may become useful in these settings.

### The role of prenatal ultrasound and added value of post-mortem radiographic imaging with X-ray and CT in suspected fetal skeletal dysplasia [^114pK6qM]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

4.5 Prenatal CT

Many studies have shown the benefits of prenatal low‐dose or ultra‐low‐dose CT in identifying skeletal abnormalities. In prenatal settings with lower dose of radiation, CT performed better than US in evaluating skeletal abnormalities with a reduction in radiation exposure. However, visualization of fetal hands and feet was poor with the low dose, especially in second trimester. This is not the problem with post‐mortem CT when sufficient radiation dose is applicable.

Because of the fetal radiation exposure, prenatally used CT is not currently widely used nor is it used in Finland yet for this indication. With improved techniques in‐utero radiation exposure is likely to be quite small. Therefore, it has been suggested that prenatally used fetal CT should be considered when there is suspicion of severe skeletal dysplasia and diagnosis is unclear after detailed US or if molecular genetic testing is unavailable. Recent guidelines suggest the use of CT after 26 weeks of pregnancy, meaning that it is not helpful for families considering termination since the imaging is only performed after the pregnancy has already progressed past the legal time limit for termination.

4.6 Strengths and Limitations

Our patient cohort is very representative of the Finnish population as the study was carried out in a large tertiary hospital and all pregnant women in Finland are offered prenatal screening and possible additional testing (including genetic analyses) free of charge, resulting in high uptake of these tests. However, it has to be noted that there is considerable population‐specific variation in the genetic spectrum of fetal skeletal disease. Indeed, in this Finnish patient cohort, the diagnoses belonging to the Finnish disease heritage group covered about half of all cases with genetically confirmed diagnosis. In other populations, the percentage of diseases visible with US early in pregnancy might vary and the local protocols concerning the termination of pregnancy might also significantly affect the diagnostic process. Due to the long study period, the methods of reporting the ultrasound findings also varied, making it challenging to interpret the data.

Imaging with X‐ray and CT were performed in clinical settings over the study years without a systematic approach. Findings were reviewed concurrently, and the results were combined in the final report. Therefore, we cannot determine which proportion of the findings would have only been seen with CT. Hence, further research in this field would be beneficial.

### Achondroplasia in latin America: practical recommendations for the multidisciplinary care of pediatric patients [^115HABfW]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Role of gynecologists and obstetricians in prenatal diagnosis and planning of delivery

Achondroplasia is generally suspected around 24–25 weeks of gestation using routine ultrasound although prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias may be challenging due to phenotypic variability; indeed, the accuracy of prenatal ultrasound in detecting a specific skeletal dysplasia has been reported as 40 to 60%. Ceroni and colleagues reported the natural history of 39 patients with achondroplasia followed in a reference center in Brazil. These authors showed that 67% of patients were diagnosed prenatally or at birth, while 33% received diagnosis within the first year of life. These data pointed out the importance of disease awareness by gynecologist, obstetrician and pediatricians. Below are some characteristics and recommendations to facilitate diagnosis:
Fetuses with achondroplasia display shortening of the long bones (femora or humeri length measurements less than 5th centile or -2 standard deviation (SD) from the mean in the second trimester). Macrocephaly, frontal bossing and widened femoral diaphyseal-metaphyseal angle may also be visualized during ultrasound evaluation.
Achondroplasia should be suspected when shortened long bones are noted on the third trimester ultrasonography.
Complementary evaluations such as fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) may constitute an interesting complementary tool, assisting in the evaluation of the central nervous system, spine and pulmonary volume. In addition, MRI may also assist in decision making for amniocentesis, choice of genetic testing and delivery planning.
Any signs that could contribute to the detection of lethality should be evaluated, such as thoracic cage versus abdominal circumferences ratios in the prediction of pulmonary hypoplasia, visceral abnormalities, polyhydramnios and hydrops fetalis.
The anesthesia procedure and the delivery are critical to ensure safety to both mother and her baby. For non-achondroplasia pregnant women, psychological follow-up and genetic counselling are critical as well as the evaluation of the fetus regarding macrocephaly, hampering the vaginal delivery. Regardless of the offspring being affected or not, pregnant women with achondroplasia should deliver by cesarean section because of a small pelvis-to-head size ratio in the fetus, Fig. 3 -A. However, based on clinical circumstances, the international consensus has recently proposed that vaginal delivery may be suitable when under the care of an experienced obstetrician.

### Syndromes with focal femoral deficiency: strengths and weaknesses of prenatal sonography [^112e7t8G]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To further characterize the prenatal diagnosis of proximal focal femoral deficiency and to contrast this entity with a variety of other "syndromes" in which the femur may be deficient.

Methods

We report 2 cases of proximal focal femoral deficiency and a case of femoral-facial syndrome.

Results

A series of 3 women whose fetuses had deficiency of 1 or both femurs were carefully analyzed for severity and for similarities and differences with other syndromes in which the femur may be deficient, as well as syndromes showing global skeletal abnormalities.

Conclusions

Prenatal sonography is a valuable tool both for detecting cases of proximal focal femoral deficiency, separating them from syndromes showing global skeletal abnormalities, and for stratifying them according to severity.

### Optimal timing of initial postnatal ultrasonography in newborns with prenatal hydronephrosis [^116Vzq3k]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Conflicting data exist concerning optimal timing for initial postnatal ultrasound in newborns with prenatal hydronephrosis. To determine whether timing significantly affects the accuracy of postnatal ultrasound, we conducted a prospective study comparing ultrasound within 48 hours of birth and at 7 to 10 days of life.

Materials and Methods

A total of 21 consecutive newborns with prenatal hydronephrosis were enrolled in 14 months. Prenatal hydronephrosis was defined as a pelvic diameter 4 mm. or greater before 33 weeks and 8 mm. or greater beginning at 33 weeks of gestation. Postnatal hydronephrosis was assessed using the Society for Fetal Urology grading system. Patients were subsequently followed with serial ultrasound and adjunctive imaging studies.

Results

Of the 32 evaluable renal units a majority had a change in the degree of hydronephrosis between the first and second ultrasound. An increase in hydronephrosis was found in 14 (44%) renal units with an increase of 2 or greater grades in 8 (25%). At a median followup of 15 months only 3 renal units had a persistent increase in hydronephrosis. None had greater than grade 2 hydronephrosis or required therapeutic intervention. A decrease in hydronephrosis between the first and second ultrasound was noted in 8 (25%) renal units. Seven renal units were excluded from analysis due to unequivocal obstruction, and none of these demonstrated a change between the 2 sonograms.

Conclusions

The degree of hydronephrosis varied between scans performed in the first 48 hours and 7 to 10 days of life in most newborns. The initial ultrasound more commonly underestimated the degree of hydronephrosis but this difference was not clinically significant at further followup. We recommend initial postnatal sonogram at 7 to 10 days of life for routine prenatal hydronephrosis but earlier scans may be appropriate in select cases.

### Fetal skeletal dysplasia: an approach to diagnosis with illustrative cases [^116eocmk]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

Skeletal dysplasias are a heterogeneous group of conditions associated with various abnormalities of the skeleton. These conditions are caused by widespread disturbance of bone growth, beginning during the early stages of fetal development and evolving throughout life. Despite recent advances in imaging, fetal skeletal dysplasias are difficult to diagnose in utero due to a number of factors, including the large number of skeletal dysplasias and their phenotypic variability with overlapping features, lack of precise molecular diagnosis for many disorders, lack of a systematic approach, the inability of ultrasonography (US) to provide an integrated view, and variability in the time at which findings manifest in some skeletal dysplasias. US of suspected skeletal dysplasia involves systematic imaging of the long bones, thorax, hands and feet, skull, spine, and pelvis. Assessment of the fetus with three-dimensional US has been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy, since additional phenotypic features not detectable at two-dimensional US may be identified. The radiologist plays a major role in making an accurate diagnosis; however, representatives of other disciplines, including clinicians, molecular biologists, and pathologists, can also provide important diagnostic information.

### Prenatal diagnosis of a novel pathogenic variation in the ACAN gene presenting with isolated shortening of fetal long bones in the second trimester of gestation: a case report [^117QYndK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Since ACAN gene mutations are among the main causes of genetic short stature in the pediatric population, based on our findings, we believe that these should be considered also in the prenatal differential diagnosis of fetal growth's delay in a fetus with short limbs. The presence of short limbs, even if not all below the pathological value of the 3rd centile, should suggest the possibility of an underlying genetic condition. In case of suspicion of skeletal dysplasia, the ACAN gene should be considered. An early diagnosis is particularly important in cases in which, after birth, it is possible to practice without delay a therapy that can positively influence the clinical picture and, ultimately, the quality of life of the patient.

### The utility of ultrasound for the detection of fetal limb abnormalities – a 20-year single-center experience [^114C9dSf]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of all patients who underwent obstetric ultrasound examination in the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology at Washington University School of Medicine between January 1990 and January 2010. Our Unit is a tertiary referral center for standard as well as specialized ultrasound examinations. All prenatal and postnatal ultrasound and pregnancy outcome data are stored in a computerized database, and a dedicated nurse coordinator attempts to obtain neonatal follow-up on all patients having prenatal ultrasound. This allows confirmation of prenatal ultrasound findings as well as postnatal determination of conditions not detected prenatally and pregnancy outcomes. All examinations were performed by registered diagnostic medical sonographers with certification in obstetrics and gynecology. All examinations were interpreted by maternal–fetal medicine sub-specialists or board certified obstetrician-gynecologists with extensive experience in fetal imaging.

In this investigation, women whose fetuses were identified as having polydactyly (POD), arthrogryposis (ART), limb reduction defects (LRD) or abnormal hand positioning (AHP) prenatally and/or postnatally were identified in the computerized data base. ART was defined as fetal joint contractures and rigidity. AHP was defined as clenched hands or overlapping digits. For each condition, the indication for the initial ultrasound, the accuracy of prenatal diagnosis, the pregnancy outcome and associated malformations were reviewed. The indication for examination was classified as either evaluation of a known or suspected malformation at the time of diagnosis or 'Other'. Cases with a known or suspected malformation were often referred for suspicion of a major malformation, which was non-skeletal. However, the fact that these fetuses were scanned in follow-up to an abnormal screening examination may have contributed to the diagnosis of our conditions as ancillary findings. Cases in the 'Other' category were typically referred for gestational age assignment, standard anatomic survey, fetal growth or maternal medical or obstetric conditions.

### Child with suspected short stature [^1164WAx6]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis of short stature — common causes and idiopathic short stature criteria are specified as follows: Common causes include familial or intrinsic short stature, constitutional delay of growth and puberty, idiopathic short stature, and small for gestational age without catch up growth by 2 years. In constitutional delay, children typically cross percentiles downwards in the first 3 years and then grow at a normal growth velocity on the lower percentiles or just below the 3rd percentile, and bone age is delayed. Idiopathic short stature is defined as height < 2.25 SD below the mean for age and sex (shortest 1.2% of children) – FDA definition, with notes that patients are unlikely to attain adult height in the normal range (less than 63 inches for boys and 59 inches for girls) and that diagnostic evaluation excludes other causes of short stature.

Fetal spine and extremities — detailed first-trimester assessment: The fetal extremities are easily visible between 12 weeks 0 days and 13 weeks 6 days, and major limb reduction anomalies can be detected at this gestational age. Three long bones should be subjectively identified in each extremity and described if abnormal in appearance, the presence of feet and hands should be documented, and a more detailed assessment of the fingers or toes is recommended in the setting of a suspected abnormality or clinical history concerning for a musculoskeletal disorder. The fetal spine should be imaged in the longitudinal and axial planes, evaluated for irregularity, scoliosis, or interruption, and the skin over the spine should be demonstrated; an abnormal appearance of the posterior fossa, posterior displacement of the aqueduct of Sylvius, and a smaller-than-expected BPD may be markers of open spina bifida. If skeletal dysplasia is suspected, assessment of calvarial shape, thorax and rib appearance, scapulas, and ossification of the long bones and spine plus biometry of the long bones in comparison to other structures may be useful for suspected skeletal dysplasias.

1 Introduction

Individuals with achondroplasia (MIM # 100800), the most common form of skeletal dysplasia, have a disproportionately short stature. The condition occurs in 1:26,000 to 1:28,000 live births. Clinically, achondroplasia is characterised by pronounced rhizomelic dwarfism, which predominantly affects the proximal long bones (femur and humerus), and is associated with moderate yet characteristic skeletal deformities, such as hyperlordosis, genu varum and the occasional narrowing of the spinal canal, which is responsible for neurological complications. Facial deformities are characterised by frontal bossing and midface hypoplasia or even retrusion of the midface. Intellectual development is normal. There is also a possible association with trident‐shaped hands, mild polyhydramnios, occasional small chest, mild femoral bowing and a widened femoral angle, which may be observed during prenatal ultrasound screening.

This condition is caused by a pathogenic variant in the FGFR3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3) gene (MIM # 134934), which encodes a transmembrane receptor for the fibroblast growth factor. During normal development, FGFR3 has a negative regulatory effect on bone growth. In achondroplasia, the abnormal form of the receptor is constitutively active, resulting in significant shortening of the long bones.

Achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant disorder with full penetrance. In 80% of cases, the variant is de novo and the affected child is born to unaffected parents. In the remaining 20% of cases, the child with achondroplasia is born to a couple where one parent is also affected. Furthermore, when the condition is related to pathogenic variants present on both parental alleles, the outcome is similar to thanatophoric dysplasia and is lethal in the perinatal period. Approximately 98% of patients with achondroplasia carry a missense variant in the FGFR3 gene involving a guanine‐to‐adenine transition at nucleotide 1138. This results in a glycine‐to‐arginine substitution at amino acid position 380, known as variant NM_000142.5 (FGFR3):c.1138G > A, p.(Gly380Arg). Around 1% of patients have a guanine to cytosine transversion at the same position, resulting in the variant NM_000142.5 (FGFR3):c.1138G > C, p.(Gly380Arg).

### Severe nasomaxillary hypoplasia (binder phenotype) on prenatal US / MRI: an important marker for the prenatal diagnosis of chondrodysplasia punctata [^116opHiv]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chondrodysplasia punctata is a skeletal dysplasia caused by a diverse spectrum of etiologies, with outcomes ranging from antenatal demise to a normal life span. Prenatal detection can be challenging.

Objective

To review a series of cases of chondrodysplasia punctata associated with nasomaxillary hypoplasia, known as the Binder phenotype, and to highlight prenatal ultrasound and MRI findings, as well as postnatal MRI and radiographic findings.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed ultrasound, MRI and radiographic imaging findings in postnatally confirmed cases of chondrodysplasia punctata from 2001 to 2017. We analyzed prenatal findings and correlated them with maternal history, postnatal imaging, phenotype, genetics and outcome.

Results

We identified eight cases, all with prenatal US and six of eight with prenatal MRI between 18 weeks and 32 weeks of gestational age. Reasons for referral included midface hypoplasia in four cases; family history in one case; intrauterine growth restriction in one case; short long-bones, intrauterine growth restriction and multicystic kidney in one case; and multiple anomalies in one case. In six cases, postnatal radiographs were performed. In four cases, postnatal spine MRI imaging was performed. The diagnosis of chondrodysplasia punctata was suggested in prenatal reports in six of eight fetuses. Seven of eight fetuses had Binder phenotype with severe nasomaxillary hypoplasia. Limb length was mildly symmetrically short in four of eight cases and normal in four of eight fetuses. Two of eight fetuses had epiphyseal stippling identified prenatally by US; this was present postnatally in six neonates on radiographs. Hand and foot abnormalities of brachytelephalangy were not detected on the prenatal US or MRI but were present in six of eigth fetuses on postnatal radiographs or physical exam. Four of eight fetuses had prenatal spine irregularity on US from subtle stippling. Six of eight had spine stippling on postnatal radiographs. One fetus had cervicothoracic kyphosis on prenatal US and MRI, and this was postnatally present in one additional neonate. One case had prenatally suspected C1 spinal stenosis with possible cord compression, and this was confirmed postnatally by MRI. There was a maternal history of systemic lupus erythematosus in two and hyperemesis gravidarum in one. Outcomes included one termination and seven survivors.

Conclusion

Chondrodysplasia punctata can be identified prenatally but findings are often subtle. The diagnosis should be considered when a fetus presents with a hypoplastic midface known as the Binder phenotype. Maternal history of lupus, or other autoimmune diseases or hyperemesis gravidarum can help support the diagnosis.

### Safe, accurate, prenatal diagnosis of thanatophoric dysplasia using ultrasound and free fetal DNA [^117TZJUU]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2013). Low credibility.

Figure 3
Comparison of femur length in fetuses with thanatophoric dysplasia (closed circle) or achondroplasia (open circle) with normal fetuses (derived from Chitty et al.) showing the distinctive pattern for TD, with little increase in size from the mid second trimester and achondroplasia, which follows the normal femoral centiles until around 25 weeks' gestation when it then falls away from the normal centiles

The reports describing additional ultrasound findings were available for all 42 of our cases (Table 2). A diagnosis of TD was suspected in 36 cases based on the sonographic features (Figure 1). In the other six cases, a diagnosis of a serious skeletal dysplasia was made, but no diagnosis was specified. In 13, the diagnosis was confirmed following invasive testing and molecular analysis that showed a mutation in the FGFR3 gene and in a further three analysis of cffDNA extracted from maternal blood that confirmed the presence of the mutation. The diagnosis was confirmed in the remaining 26 cases by postnatal radiology or, in four of these, by molecular analysis that demonstrated the c.742C > T mutation in three cases and the c.1948A > G mutation in the fourth. Short limbs occurred in all cases with bowing of the femora, also a commonly reported feature, seen in 67% (28/42) of the cases. Frontal bossing was observed in 80% (24/30 cases where profile was visualised), cloverleaf skull in 31% (13/42), short fingers in 52% (16/31 where fingers were examined) and polyhydramnios in 31% (11/35 cases where amniotic fluid volume was recorded). Both small narrow chest and short ribs were described in 95% (35/37) of cases. These findings are compatible with descriptions available in the literature (Table 2), where short, bowed limbs in association with a small chest and relative macrocephaly are the most frequently reported findings. As with our series, there are also occasional reports of brain anomalies, including ventriculomegaly.

### Safe, accurate, prenatal diagnosis of thanatophoric dysplasia using ultrasound and free fetal DNA [^114ameDY]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2013). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Thanatophoric dysplasia (TD) is the most common lethal dominant skeletal dysplasia with an incidence of 2–3 per 100 000 births. It results from a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene located on 4p16.3. There are several mutations known to cause TD, the most common being Arg248Cys, Tyr373Cys and Lys650Glu.TD may be divided into subtypes I and II, based both on molecular diagnosis and on clinical features, but there is considerable overlap between the two groups. Cases with a Lys650Glu mutation have predominantly milder radiological and histological features with straight femora and craniosynostosis and have been classified as Type II. In Type I, femora tend to be curved and craniosynostosis infrequent, resulting most commonly from the Arg248Cys or Tyr373Cys substitutions. Prenatal sonographic detection occurs traditionally in the second trimester, at the time of the routine anomaly scan when the fetus is found to have short long bones, a small chest, macrocephaly, frontal bossing, short fingers, cloverleaf skull or telephone receiver-shaped femora (Figure 1), but with increasing use of first trimester ultrasound, these features are increasingly detected earlier in pregnancy. The accuracy of prenatal diagnosis of TD based on ultrasound findings has been reported to vary from 40% to 88%.–

Figure 1
Sonographic features of thanatophoric dysplasia (TD) with a view of the thorax demonstrating short ribs (A), a view of the head in a fetus with TD II and a cloverleaf skull (B), a longitudinal view of the thorax and abdomen demonstrating the 'champagne cork' appearance due to the very small chest (C), a 3-D image of the femur demonstrating slight bowing (D), a 3-D view of the face (E), a sagittal view showing the frontal bossing (F) also demonstrating a very small chest and a view of a hand illustrating the short fingers (G)

Accurate sonographic diagnosis allows for targeted molecular testing that, until recently, required analysis of fetal cells obtained following an invasive diagnostic test such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Identification of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) circulating in maternal plasmahas allowed for the development of safer, non-invasive genetic prenatal diagnosis that relies on a maternal blood sample.

### Differential diagnosis of perinatal hypophosphatasia: radiologic perspectives [^117TJtYg]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Perinatal HPP is associated with a broad spectrum of imaging findings that overlap with other perinatal skeletal dysplasias. Certain features (e.g. sites of angulation and hypomineralization, spurs, metaphyseal characteristics) may help distinguish HPP from other skeletal dysplasias. ALPL gene mutation testing during pregnancy can confirm the diagnosis before delivery. Alkaline phosphatase results are essential for confirming a suspected diagnosis of perinatal HPP. Early recognition of the disease provides more opportunity for education and counseling to prepare the parents, allows for the assembly and preparedness of a multidisciplinary care team upon delivery, and provides additional time to consider and discuss treatment options, with the goal of improving duration and quality of life or minimizing unnecessary suffering for the affected child and the family.

### The value of enhancing sonographic phenotyping to improve the diagnostic yield of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) for achondroplasia [^117QhTHa]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Achondroplasia is the most common form of skeletal dysplasia and is usually suspected in the third trimester of pregnancy based on abnormal sonographic findings. Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD), based on the detection of pathogenic FGFR3 variants in maternal plasma, provides an accurate genetic confirmation. The aim of this study was to identify the sonographic markers most strongly associated with achondroplasia, with the intention of enhancing the specificity of NIPD referrals and improving diagnostic efficiency, thereby supporting clinicians in their diagnostic approach.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 275 NIPD tests performed in the laboratory between 2017 and 2023. Of these, 176 were requested due to sonographic abnormalities suggestive of achondroplasia. Sonographic reports were systematically reviewed to identify key ultrasound features correlated with a positive NIPD result.

Results

Among the NIPD tests ordered due to sonographic anomalies, 34.1% were confirmed positive for achondroplasia. Abnormal proximal end of the femur, frontal bossing, and a pronounced nasal saddle were the most specific markers, achieving a diagnostic yield of 87.5% when all three features were present. In contrast, short femur length alone had a poor diagnostic yield (8.9%).

Conclusion

Targeted sonographic phenotyping significantly improves the diagnostic yield of NIPD for achondroplasia. These findings support the need for more refined prenatal screening guidelines to enhance test specificity and optimise patient care as new achondroplasia treatments emerge.

Examination of the stillborn fetus — procedures and options: The general examination of the stillborn fetus should be done promptly, noting any dysmorphic features and obtaining measurements of weight, length, and head circumference, and foot length may be especially useful before 23 weeks of gestation to ascertain gestational age. Photographs of the whole body and close-up views are vital for subsequent review, and whole-body X-ray with anterior–posterior and lateral views may reveal an unrecognized skeletal abnormality or further define a grossly apparent deformity. Fetal autopsy should be offered because it is one of the most useful diagnostic tests in determining the cause of death, and if families are uncomfortable with a complete autopsy, other options such as partial autopsy, gross examination by a trained pathologist, ultrasonography, and especially magnetic resonance imaging are particularly useful. When a full autopsy is performed, it should follow published guidelines and protocols for perinatal autopsy; recommendations include measurements to establish gestational age (such as foot length and body weight), estimation of the interval between death and delivery, identification of intrinsic abnormalities and developmental disorders, and investigation for evidence of infection, and it is preferable to use a pathologist experienced in perinatal autopsy with examination by a physician experienced in genetics and dysmorphology.

### Association of isolated short fetal femur with intrauterine growth restriction [^111ehDez]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To analyze the outcomes of fetuses referred because of short femur length.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of all singleton pregnancies referred to a tertiary care referral hospital with a femur length below the 5(th) percentile. All ultrasound scan reports, including Doppler, fetal karyotyping, pregnancy outcome and neonatal data were analyzed.

Results

In 112 patients, 87 (78%) had an isolated short femur and 25 (22%) had a non-isolated short femur. The non-isolated cases consisted of chromosomal disorders (n = 6), skeletal abnormalities (n = 6), multiple abnormalities (n = 12) and 1 genetic disorder. In the isolated group 37 cases (43%) were intrauterine growth restricted (positive likelihood ratio 1.20, negative likelihood ratio 0.45). In 33 cases the short femur was unexplained and 17 referrals were considered false-positive. The growth restricted group had significant more abnormal Doppler measurements (p = 0.01), caesarean deliveries (p = 0.043) and admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit (p = 0.001).

Conclusion

An isolated short femur is associated with intrauterine growth restriction and adverse pregnancy outcome.

Noonan syndrome may also be the cause of short stature after being born SGA. Activation of the RAS/Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway results in a number of overlapping syndromes, the so-called "RASopathies", including Noonan (OMIM 163950), Leopard (OMIM 151100), Costello (OMIM 218040), cardio-facio-cutaneous (OMIM 115150), and neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndromes (OMIM 601321). All have a varying degree of postnatal growth failure and, sometimes, there are no obvious clinical features.

Monogenic disorders with normal head circumference and disproportionate short stature (Table 1)

In most genetic disorders associated with disproportionate short stature, the genes are already abnormally expressed during fetal life, which often results in a lower birth length SDS than birth weight SDS. The more severe forms of skeletal dysplasia can be easily diagnosed in young children, but clinical features can be so mild that many children are initially labeled as short SGA of unknown origin. Body disproportion and skeletal abnormalities can become more abnormal when the child becomes older. When an SGA child has disproportionate short stature (sitting height/height ratio > 2 SDS and/or arm-span width > height), skeletal survey analysis and/or genetic testing can be an efficient diagnostic approach. A description of all skeletal dysplasias and their underlying genetic aberrations is beyond the scope of this guideline, but the most frequent ones in relation to SGA and short stature are presented in Table 1.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaGrowth disturbances-risk of fetal growth restriction [^116kzQyS]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fetal growth restriction, or an estimated fetal weight of less than the 10th percentile, is associated with adverse perinatal outcome. Optimizing management for obtaining the most favorable outcome for mother and fetus is largely based on detailed ultrasound findings. Identifying and performing those ultrasound procedures that are most associated with adverse outcome is necessary for proper patient management. Transabdominal ultrasound is the mainstay of initial management and assessment of fetal growth. For those fetuses that are identified as small for gestational age, assessment of fetal well-being with biophysical profile and Doppler velocimetry provide vital information for differentiating those fetuses that may be compromised and may require delivery and those that are well compensated. Delivery of the pregnancy is primarily based upon the gestational age of the pregnancy and the ultrasound findings. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^113xK6i2]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Heterozygous mutations of the Indian hedgehog gene (IHH) are associated with brachydactyly type A1 (OMIM 1112500) but may also cause short stature classified as ISS or SGA with mild disproportion. Most children are born SGA for length, and 50% have shortening of the middle phalanx of the second and fifth fingers with cone-shaped epiphyses.

A heterozygous mutation of ACAN (encoding aggrecan) leads to abnormal cartilage matrix formation, with mild skeletal dysplasia, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (OMIM 608361), or short stature without radiographic skeletal dysplasia (OMIM 165800). Approximately 30% to 40% of children are born SGA and 14% of short SGA children with a bone age advancement of 6 or more months had a heterozygous ACAN mutation. However, bone age can be normal. Birth length SDS is always lower than birth weight SDS, and patients often have early-onset osteoarthritis and/or osteochondritis dissecans.

Monogenic disorders with microcephaly and short stature (Table 2)

Children with biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) IGF1 mutations (OMIM-608747) are born with a very low birth weight and length and microcephaly, although patients homozygous for less disruptive IGF1 mutations or harboring heterozygous IGF1 mutations have a milder phenotype. Recombinant IGF-I treatment is moderately effective. Children with complete loss-of-function mutations also have sensorineural deafness (OMIM-608747).

Children with a heterozygous IGF1R mutation (MIM 270450) have a wide range of birth weight (−3.5 to −1.5 SDS), birth length (−5.0 to 0.3 SDS) and head circumference (−3.0 to 0 SDS) (142,143). The prevalence of heterozygous IGF1R mutations or deletions is estimated at 1% to 2% in short SGA children. Homozygous mutations are extremely rare and possibly not compatible with life, although one case was reported with severe pre- and postnatal growth failure (< −4.5 SDS) and congenital malformation). The response to recombinant GH treatment is usually moderate and associated with high IGF-I concentrations.

### Osteopenia in newborns and infants… [^1149GdRt]. AAP (2022). Medium credibility.

The third trimester of pregnancy is a time of rapid transfer of calcium and phosphorus to the fetus.
- Fetal movement in the third trimester may stimulate bone development; most preterm infants have limited physical activity.
- Premature infants excrete more phosphorus than term newborns
- Diuretics or steroids, often given to premature infants, cause low calcium levels Osteopenia of prematurity often has no symptoms.
- When severe, bones are weak and brittle, and unknown fractures may be accompanied by swelling or decreased movement.
- An increased risk for fracture often persists through the first year of life for very premature infants. Treatment of Osteopenia of Prematurity Osteopenia in premature infants requires monitoring and testing:

- Blood levels of calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase
- Ultrasound
- Radiography Although minerals are well absorbed from human milk, the net retention of calcium and phosphorus are far below the rates in utero, therefore:

- Supplementary calcium and phosphorus are needed to sustain optimal calcium balance in preterm infants.
- Human milk fortifiers and special formulas with added minerals are available in the United States and many other countries for feeding preterm infants.
- Use of these products has led to net calcium retention comparable to that achieved in utero. AAP Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D of Enterally-Fed Preterm Infants
- Preterm infants, especially those born at < 27 weeks' gestation or with birth weight < 1000 g with a history of multiple medical problems, are at high-risk of rickets.
- Routine evaluation of bone mineral status by using biochemical testing indicted for infants with birth weight < 1500 g but not those with birth weight > 1500 g. Biochemical testing should usually be started 4 to 5 weeks after birth.
- Routine management of preterm infants, especially those with birth weight < 1800 to 2000 g, should include human milk fortified with minerals or formulas designed for preterm infants
- At the time of discharge from the hospital, VLBW infants will usually be provided higher intakes of minerals than are provided by human milk or formulas intended for term infants with the use of transitional formulas. If exclusively breastfed, a follow-up serum alkaline phosphatase activity at 2 to 4 weeks after discharge from the hospital may be considered.

### Screening by physical… [^112RcN5g]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

10 However, even with excellent screening and treatment programs, a small number of children appear to have a poor outcome and require surgical correction of the abnormality.
10. ORTOLANI AND BARLOW MANEUVERS The Ortolani and Barlow maneuvers have been the standard techniques for detecting hip instability in newborns
9. These maneuvers cannot be performed in a fussy, crying infant whose muscle activity may inhibit the movement of an unstable hip. For the examinations, the infant's hips are flexed to 90 degrees; the thumbs of the examiner are placed on the medial proximal thigh, and the long fingers are placed over the greater trochanter. The more poorly developed the acetabulum, the less pronounced the "clunk. " Consequently, the Ortolani maneuver must be performed very gently to avoid obscuring the sound of the femoral head passing over a poorly developed posterior acetabulum.

Audible high-pitched "clicks" without a sensation of instability have no pathologic significance. 4 Limitation of hip abduction is the best indicator of dislocation in the older infant. 31 Other signs, such as an apparent shortening of the femur, asymmetric skin folds and telescoping of the affected hip, are also clues to dislocation. 31, 32. The neonate who has a dislocated hip at birth should be referred to a pediatric orthopedist immediately for treatment. However, when a newborn has a dislocatable hip, referral can be safely deferred for two weeks. It is highly possible that the hip will stabilize during that interval. With a dislocatable hip, use of an abduction pillow for the first two to four weeks of life is an appropriate option to referral at two weeks. The infant should then be reevaluated by physical examination with or without ultrasound assessment.

Treatment or further surveillance may be initiated if the presence of an abnormality is confirmed. Treatment of Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip In the United States, developmental dysplasia of the hip in a newborn is generally treated by splinting with the Pavlik harness, a brace that places the hips in flexion and abduction. In Europe, excellent results have been reported for the use of abduction pillows as the initial mode of treatment.

### Screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip… [^113Go2uo]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Study A. L. is a 4, 100-g, one-day-old boy born at 39 weeks' gestation by cesarean section because of breech presentation following an uncomplicated pregnancy. One- and five-minute Apgar scores were 8 and 9, respectively. He has normal vital signs and activity and no gross deformities on his general assessment. As part of your examination, you perform the Ortolani and Barlow maneuvers and detect a hip dislocation on the Barlow test. Case Study Questions 1. Based on information from the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force, which one of the following statements about developmental dysplasia of the hip is correct. A. Limited hip abduction to identify DDH is most accurate in infants younger than three months. B. Strong evidence supports the effectiveness of surgical and nonsurgical early interventions for DDH. C. Most abnormal hips identified by newborn physical examination resolve spontaneously, requiring no intervention. D.

Harms from treatment of DDH are mild and rare. E. Long-term complications of untreated DDH include avascular necrosis of the hip. Answers 1. The correct answer is C. There is evidence that screening for DDH leads to earlier identification. However, 60 to 80 percent of the hips of newborns identified as abnormal or suspicious for DDH by physical examination and more than 90 percent of those identified by ultrasonography resolve spontaneously, requiring no intervention. Limited hip abduction is a relatively insensitive and nonspecific marker of DDH in early infancy but becomes more accurate after three to six months of age and with more severely affected hips.
2. The correct answer is B. A. L. is at increased risk because of his breech position at birth. Other risk factors for DDH include female sex, family history of DDH, and in utero postural deformities. However, most infants with DDH have no identifiable risk factors.

Above-average birth weight is not a known risk factor, and cesarean section is not known to be protective.
