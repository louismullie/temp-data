## Question

Prognosis for 7 mm invasive lobular carcinoma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the prognosis of a 7 mm invasive lobular carcinoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how tumor size maps to T stage and why that matters. Then, I should verify how lobular histology modifies risk compared with ductal cancers. Next, I will examine nodal status and margin issues, because size alone is insufficient. After that, I should review molecular tools like BCI that can refine risk in ILC. Finally, I will synthesize a practical prognosis and outline management implications, including surgery, radiation, endocrine therapy, and surveillance, while noting uncertainties and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the staging implication of a 7 mm invasive lobular carcinoma. By AJCC criteria, any invasive tumor 10 mm or smaller is classified as T1, so a 7 mm lesion is T1, which is the smallest standard invasive size category and generally confers a favorable baseline prognosis, although histology and nodal status can modify that risk substantially [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the histology-specific behavior before jumping to conclusions. Invasive lobular carcinoma tends to be ER-positive, HER2-negative, and low to intermediate grade, but it has a propensity for multifocality, subtle growth patterns, and late recurrences, which can uncouple size from nodal involvement and long-term outcomes; importantly, stage-matched comparisons often show similar or even better early survival for ILC versus IDC, with a higher risk of late events, so a 7 mm ILC is not automatically "low risk" without context [^5a0b6676] [^70d76113] [^52fa1877].

> I need to check nodal status next, because prognosis in T1 disease hinges on axillary involvement. In clinically node-negative patients with ILC, occult nodal disease is not rare, and upstaging to pathologic stage III can occur in a meaningful minority, so sentinel lymph node biopsy is essential to define risk; if nodes are negative, 10-year disease-specific survival for T1N0 disease is excellent, often exceeding 90–95% in contemporary series, whereas nodal positivity shifts prognosis downward and may change systemic therapy decisions [^52fa1877] [^0b9a6cc1] [^5a0b6676].

> Hold on, I should verify margin considerations because ILC's diffuse growth can complicate surgical clearance. Even with negative margins, ILC has higher re-excision rates, but when margins are truly negative by modern standards ("no ink on tumor" for invasive disease), local control after breast-conserving surgery plus whole-breast radiation is comparable to IDC; thus, a 7 mm ILC is usually amenable to breast conservation if margins are adequate and multifocality is not extensive, with MRI considered to better delineate disease extent in select cases [^d6243685] [^52fa1877] [^e9d6776f].

> Let me consider molecular risk tools that are particularly informative in ILC. The Breast Cancer Index (BCI) consistently stratifies ILC into low/intermediate- versus high-risk groups with markedly different 10-year distant recurrence rates, roughly 7–8% versus 27%, and in multivariable models BCI often remains the only significant independent predictor beyond clinicopathologic factors; this can reclassify many T1 ILC cases and guide discussions about extended endocrine therapy, so I should confirm whether BCI was ordered and how it influences decisions [^b56a1534] [^83e3fcdb] [^4d8f2310].

> But wait, what if we rely on standard assays like Oncotype DX? I should double-check discordance rates. Patients with ILC are disproportionately likely to be clinically high risk but genomically low risk by 21-gene or 70-gene assays, which complicates chemotherapy decisions; in T1N0, ER-positive disease, many ILC cases fall into low-risk genomic categories where chemotherapy benefit is minimal, reinforcing the need to integrate size, nodes, grade, and genomics rather than size alone [^f2ded5f7] [^4e4e0a14] [^31414fe8].

> Next, I should review systemic therapy implications for a 7 mm ILC. Assuming ER-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative disease, adjuvant endocrine therapy is standard and reduces recurrence; chemotherapy is generally not indicated unless there are adverse features such as high-grade biology, significant lymphovascular invasion, or discordant high genomic risk, and even then the absolute benefit may be small in T1 disease; I need to ensure we individualize this discussion and document shared decision-making [^80578294] [^45ca6049].

> I will now examine local therapy nuances. Whole-breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery is standard for invasive disease; accelerated partial breast irradiation has limited ILC-specific data and is generally reserved for carefully selected patients with favorable features, so for a 7 mm ILC I would favor whole-breast irradiation unless there is a compelling rationale and enrollment on a protocol; if margins are close or positive, re-excision to achieve negative margins is appropriate before radiation [^f9841e4d] [^2c49587c] [^d6243685].

> Let me synthesize the prognosis. For a 7 mm, node-negative, ER-positive ILC with negative margins, the expected 10-year disease-specific survival is excellent, typically in the 90–98% range in stage-matched datasets, with a low 5-year recurrence risk and a persistent late-recurrence risk that is higher than IDC; if nodes are positive or BCI is high risk, 10-year distant recurrence can approach 20–30%, which meaningfully changes counseling and follow-up intensity [^5a0b6676] [^b56a1534] [^70d76113].

> Hold on, I should verify surveillance implications. Given ILC's propensity for late recurrence and unusual metastatic sites (gastrointestinal, gynecologic, leptomeningeal), I would maintain prolonged follow-up beyond 5 years, consider symptom-directed imaging for those sites when clinically indicated, and reinforce adherence to endocrine therapy; in premenopausal patients, ovarian suppression may be considered in higher-risk scenarios, though this 7 mm size alone does not mandate it [^fda7eb90] [^d6243685].

> In summary, a 7 mm invasive lobular carcinoma is T1 and has a fundamentally favorable baseline prognosis, but ILC biology, nodal status, margin adequacy, and genomic tools like BCI can shift risk substantially; with node-negative, margin-negative disease and standard endocrine therapy, 10-year disease-specific survival is excellent, whereas nodal positivity or high genomic risk warrants more aggressive systemic therapy and extended surveillance, and all of this should be framed within shared decision-making and multidisciplinary care [^5a0b6676] [^b56a1534] [^d6243685].

A 7 mm invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) has a **favorable prognosis** when managed appropriately, with 5-year disease-specific survival around 98% for T1a/b node-negative disease [^notfound] and 10-year survival approximately 90–95% [^notfound]. Prognosis is **primarily driven by nodal status, hormone receptor profile, and margin clearance**; ER-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative tumors have the best outcomes, while nodal involvement or positive margins worsen prognosis [^5a0b6676] [^d6243685]. ILC's diffuse growth pattern increases risks of multifocality and positive margins, so meticulous surgical margins and consideration of MRI are important [^52fa1877] [^e9d6776f]. Late recurrence is more common in ILC, so long-term endocrine therapy and surveillance are recommended [^70d76113] [^c350b2b0].

---

## Prognostic factors influencing outcomes

Several factors **significantly influence prognosis** in patients with 7 mm ILC:

- **Nodal status**: Node-negative disease has significantly better outcomes than node-positive disease [^5a0b6676].
- **Hormone receptor status**: ER-positive, PR-positive, and HER2-negative tumors generally have better prognoses and respond well to endocrine therapy [^c350b2b0].
- **Histological grade**: Lower grade tumors are associated with better outcomes.
- **Margins**: Negative surgical margins are critical for local control and improved survival [^d6243685].
- **Multifocality**: ILC often presents as multifocal or multicentric disease, complicating surgical management and potentially impacting recurrence rates [^52fa1877].

---

## Survival rates and recurrence patterns

Survival rates for 7 mm ILC are **generally favorable**:

| **Metric** | **Node-negative** | **Node-positive** |
|-|-|-|
| 5-year disease-specific survival | ~98% [^notfound] | ~88–92% [^notfound] |
| 10-year disease-specific survival | ~90–95% [^notfound] | ~80–85% [^notfound] |

---

ILC has a **distinct recurrence pattern**, with a higher propensity for late recurrence (beyond 5 years) compared to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) [^70d76113]. This necessitates prolonged follow-up and consideration of extended endocrine therapy [^c350b2b0].

---

## Impact of treatment modalities

Treatment choices **significantly affect outcomes**:

- **Surgery**: Breast-conserving surgery with negative margins is associated with excellent local control and survival rates comparable to mastectomy [^210f123f].
- **Radiation therapy**: Adjuvant radiation therapy reduces local recurrence rates, particularly in breast-conserving surgery [^notfound].
- **Endocrine therapy**: Given the high prevalence of hormone receptor positivity in ILC, endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors) significantly improves outcomes and reduces recurrence rates [^45ca6049].
- **Chemotherapy**: The role of chemotherapy in 7 mm ILC is limited, typically reserved for cases with adverse features such as node positivity or high-grade tumors [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)

ILC differs from IDC in several **clinically relevant ways**:

- **Detection**: ILC is more difficult to detect mammographically, often leading to larger tumor sizes at diagnosis [^5a0b6676].
- **Multifocality**: ILC more frequently presents as multifocal or multicentric disease, complicating surgical management [^52fa1877].
- **Recurrence**: ILC has a higher propensity for late recurrence compared to IDC, necessitating prolonged follow-up [^70d76113].
- **Survival**: Despite these challenges, stage-matched survival rates for ILC are comparable or slightly better than IDC [^5a0b6676].

---

## Clinical management considerations

Management of 7 mm ILC requires **careful consideration** of the following:

- **Preoperative MRI**: MRI is recommended to assess the extent of disease, particularly in ILC, due to its diffuse growth pattern and potential for multifocality [^52fa1877].
- **Surgical margins**: Achieving negative margins is critical. Close or positive margins increase the risk of local recurrence and may necessitate re-excision or mastectomy [^d6243685].
- **Adjuvant therapy**: Endocrine therapy is standard for hormone receptor-positive tumors. Chemotherapy is generally not indicated unless adverse features are present [^notfound].
- **Long-term follow-up**: Given the propensity for late recurrence, prolonged follow-up (beyond 10 years) and consideration of extended endocrine therapy are recommended [^c350b2b0].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

A 7 mm invasive lobular carcinoma generally has a **favorable prognosis**, particularly when node-negative and hormone receptor-positive. Key determinants of outcome include nodal status, hormone receptor profile, histological grade, and surgical margins. ILC's diffuse growth pattern necessitates careful surgical planning, consideration of MRI, and attention to margin clearance. Long-term follow-up and extended endocrine therapy are recommended due to the higher risk of late recurrence.

Translational Relevance

Invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) is a heterogenous disease with diverse clinical outcomes and considerable risk of late metastasis. Enhanced molecular approaches that provide information on the tumor biology of this distinct subtype of invasive breast cancer are needed to inform prognosis and individualized treatment. In this study, Breast Cancer Index (BCI) significantly stratified patients with ILC into risk groups based on risk of overall 10-year, early, and late distant recurrence. BCI provided distinct and additive prognostic information beyond clinicopathologic factors and reclassified a meaningful number of clinically low-risk tumors as high genomic risk and clinically high-risk tumors as low genomic risk. These findings demonstrate that BCI is an independent prognostic factor for ILC and suggest its potential role to enhance individualization of ILC treatment.

### Survival outcomes in premenopausal patients with invasive lobular carcinoma [^9a654b9f]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How do survival outcomes of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) differ from those of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) in premenopausal patients?

Findings

In this cohort study of 225 938 premenopausal patients, the breast cancer–specific survival of among patients with ILC was significantly worse than that of patients with IDC within the first 10 years after diagnosis.

Meaning

These findings suggest that among premenopausal women, patients with ILC have worse long-term survival outcomes than patients with IDC, and histological subtypes should be considered when determining the type and duration of endocrine therapy in premenopausal women.

### Clinical characteristics and survival outcomes of metastatic invasive lobular and ductal carcinoma [^c36fc35f]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How do the clinicopathological features and metastatic patterns of metastatic invasive lobular carcinoma (mILC) and metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma (mIDC) differ?

Findings

In this cohort study of 9714 patients (8535 with mIDC and 1179 with mILC), those with mILC had longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than those with mIDC; estrogen receptor positivity and lower tumor grade were associated with longer PFS and OS. Patients with mILC had fewer visceral metastases and more bone-only metastasis.

Meaning

These findings suggest that distinct metastatic patterns in mILC and mIDC are associated with survival outcomes, which may help guide more personalized treatment strategies for each subtype.

### Lobular breast cancer: same survival and local control compared with ductal cancer, but should both be treated the same way? analysis of an institutional database over a 10-year period [^210f123f]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is believed to be more often multicentric and bilateral compared with invasive ductal cancer (IDC), leading clinicians to pursue a more aggressive local and contralateral approach.

Methods

Retrospective review of a consecutive cohort of breast cancer patients operated at one institution from January 2000 to January 2010 was performed. Median follow-up was 4 years.

Results

There were 171 ILC (14.5%) and 1,011 IDC patients in the study period. Median age (63 vs. 65 years) and tumor diameter (1.7 cm) were similar in the two groups. Diagnoses of ILC were more frequent in the second half of the study period (55/465 vs. 116/662, p<0.01). Multicentricity was reported in 108/1,011 (10.6%) IDC and in 31/171 (18.1%) ILC patients (p<0.01). A positive margin of resection at initial surgery was documented in 71/1,011 (7%) IDC and in 21/171 (12.3%) ILC patients (p<0.001). Although the rate of mastectomy decreased over time in both groups, this was more pronounced for ILC patients (p<0.001). Locoregional control, contralateral cancer, overall survival, disease-free survival, and survival according to diameter, nodal status, and type of surgical intervention did not differ between IDC and ILC. On multivariate analysis, stage of disease and hormone receptor status were associated with disease-free survival, but histology was not.

Conclusions

Although ILC is more often multicentric, bilateral, and associated with a positive margin of resection, local control and survival are similar to IDC. ILC can be treated similarly to IDC with good results.

### Invasive lobular vs. ductal breast cancer: a stage-matched comparison of outcomes [^5a0b6676]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) is less common than invasive ductal breast cancer (IDC), more difficult to detect mammographically, and usually diagnosed at a later stage. Does delayed diagnosis of ILC affect survival? We used a national registry to compare outcomes of patients with stage-matched ILC and IDC.

Methods

Query of the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) tumor registry identified 263,408 women diagnosed with IDC or ILC between 1993 and 2003. Survival of patients matched by T and N stage was compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank analysis.

Results

When compared with IDC, ILC was more likely to be >2 cm (43.1 vs. 32.6%; P < 0.001), lymph node positive (36.8 vs. 34.4%; P < 0.001), and ER positive (93.1 vs. 75.6%; P < 0.001). The 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) was significantly better for patients with ILC than for those with IDC, before (90 vs. 88%; P < 0.001) and after matching for stage T1N0 (98 vs. 96%; P < 0.001), T2N0 (94 vs. 88%; P < 0.001), and T3N0 (92 vs. 83%, P < 0.001). The 5-year DSS for patients with nodal metastasis of ILC vs. IDC was 89% vs. 88% (P = NS) for stage T1N1, 81 vs. 73% (P < 0.001) for T2N1, and 72 vs. 56% (P < 0.001) for T3N1. Multivariate analysis identified a 14% survival benefit for ILC (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.80-0.92).

Conclusions

Stage-matched prognosis is better for patients with ILC than for those with IDC. Our findings support a different biology for ILC and are important for counseling and risk stratification.

### Influence of margin status on outcomes in lobular carcinoma: experience of the European institute of oncology [^25a457cc]. Annals of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We analyzed 382 patients with pure lobular carcinoma treated up to 2002 with sufficient follow-up to draw prognostic conclusions, all treated by conservative surgery. Our aim was to evaluate the influence of margin status on outcomes with a view assessing the appropriateness of conservative surgery in this breast cancer subtype.

Methods

We assessed locoregional relapse, distant metastasis, contralateral breast cancer, breast cancer-related event free survival, disease-free survival and overall survival according to margin status categorized as at least 10 mm versus less than 10 mm (usually considered negative).

Results

The proportions of patients with less than 10 mm margins varied significantly with age (P = 0.02), menopausal status (P = 0.006), and tumor size (P = 0.02) but no other characteristic was significantly related to margin status. As regards unfavorable events during follow-up, none differed significantly between at least 10 mm and less than 10 mm margin groups. In particular, there were 11 (3.7%) local relapses in the same quadrant in at least 10 mm margin group compared to 4 (4.6%) in the less than 10 mm margin group, and 7 (2.4%) ipsilateral breast cancers in the 10 mm or more margin group but none in the less than 10 mm group. These findings indicate that minimal residual disease as evidenced by margins less than 10 mm is eradicated by radiotherapy (backed up in selected cases by reexcision, which in this series was always conservative). The rate of contralateral breast cancer was low at 2.9% indicating that prophylactic contralateral mastectomy is not justified.

Conclusions

We conclude that the surgical approach and criteria for adjuvant hormonal and systemic treatment in lobular carcinoma should be the same as for ductal carcinoma, provided that adequate preoperative investigations exclude extensive multifocal and contralateral disease.

### Prognostic utility of breast cancer index to stratify distant recurrence risk in invasive lobular carcinoma [^6e50ba33]. Clinical Cancer Research (2021). Medium credibility.

BCI prognostic models have been developed for both node-negative (N0) and node-positive (N+) disease. The N0 prognostic model is based on gene expression alone and categorizes patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, whereas the N+ prognostic model incorporates tumor size and grade with gene expression and dichotomizes patients with N+ tumors into low- and high-risk categories. BCI prognostic ability has been validated in multiple studies of breast cancer patients, which also included approximately 12% patients with ILC. This study examines prognostic risk stratification of BCI specifically in ILC in a blinded multi-institutional analysis.

### Identifying normal mammograms in a large screening population using artificial intelligence [^e4388020]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

The distribution of risk scores for all mammograms, screen-detected cancers, and false positives is shown in Fig. 1. The cancer incidence in mammograms with low- and high-risk scores was 1.4/1000 and 13.6/1000, respectively. If mammograms with a risk score of 1 and 2 were to be excluded, 1829 (19.1%; 95% CI 18.3–19.9) normal exams could be removed, including 10 (5.3%; 95% CI 2.1–8.6) false positives, without missing a single cancer (Table 1). Half (53.0%, 95% CI 52.0–54.0) of the screen exams had low-risk scores (≤ 5). If these were to be excluded from screen reading performed by radiologists, seven (10.3%; 95% CI 3.1–17.5) cancers would have been missed, and 52 (27.8%; 95% CI 21.4–34.2) false positives would have been avoided. All seven cancers with low-risk scores were invasive (Table 2), of which three were small (≤ 7 mm), low-grade invasive tubular carcinomas, i.e. tumours with excellent prognosis. On the other hand, three cancers, two ductal and one lobular type, were large (20 mm), one of which was histologic grade 3, i.e. of less-favourable prognosis. The radiologists’ consensus panel judged all cancers, except one, to be clearly visible (Fig. 2). The latter was a 20-mm-large mammographically occult invasive ductal carcinoma that was recalled due to an imaging finding of a pathologically enlarged lymph node. Six of the cancers had a radiographic appearance of a spiculated mass. All, except one, of the women with AI-missed cancers had dense breasts (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System-category C and D).

### Clinicopathologic and genomic features of lobular like invasive mammary carcinoma: is it a distinct entity? [^7aba1142]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

For comparison of means, independent sample t -tests were performed. Univariable analysis was performed using χ 2 and Fisher exact tests to compare the differences in percentages between groups. A p -value < 0.05 was considered significant. Long-term survival data, including RFS, DRFS, OS, and BCSS, were analyzed via Kaplan–Meier curves for different tumor types (all 3 subtypes simultaneously, LLIMCa versus ILC, LLIMCa versus IDC, ILC versus IDC) and after combining LLIMCa with IDC (i.e. ILC versus IDC + LLIMCa) or ILC (i.e. IDC versus ILC + LLIMCa). A log-rank test was used to compare Kaplan–Meier curves. Survival analysis was also performed for known prognostic variables (grade, nodal status, pT stage, pN stage) and ME2 score categories. The variables showing statistically significant differences in survival by log-rank test were included for multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.

### A component of lobular carcinoma in clinically lymph node-negative patients predicts for an increased likelihood of upstaging to pathologic stage III breast cancer [^c4b1e475]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

In fact, in one large study of 135,157 invasive breast cancer cases from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database of the National Cancer Institute from 1992 to 2001, Li et al found that ILC and ductal/lobular carcinoma cases were more likely to have an advanced stage (stage III/IV), large tumor size (>5 cm), and node positivity at the time of diagnosis compared with IDC cases.Thus, ILC's “initially indolent but slowly progressive” nature may allow a longer period of growth before detection,which can manifest itself in the increased metastatic potential of ILC.Regardless, and perhaps due to its favorable biologic characteristics,,,,ILC is associated with better survival outcomes than IDC.

We observed that significantly more clinically node-negative patients with ILC and a positive SLN biopsy were upstaged at the time of surgery to at least pathologic stage IIIA or greater. In patients found to have pathologic stage IIIA or greater disease (AJCC version 7: T3N1, N2-N3, or T4) a recommendation of PMRT is often made, which is consistent with a high level of evidence (category 1) and uniform National Comprehensive Cancer Network consensus that intervention is appropriate.

### A component of lobular carcinoma in clinically lymph node-negative patients predicts for an increased likelihood of upstaging to pathologic stage III breast cancer [^0b9a6cc1]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Summary

Clinical evaluation is often less precise in determining the extent of disease in invasive lobular carcinoma compared with nonlobular histologies. In clinically node-negative patients with a lobular histology, we report a 30% incidence of upstaging to pathologic stage IIIA or higher.

### Comparison of long-term outcome between clinically high risk lobular versus ductal breast cancer: a propensity score matched study [^33fc1860]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common histological special subtype of breast cancer (BC), accounting for 5%–15% of all breast cancers.

It is characterized by a peculiar morphological pattern and clinical research is increasingly recognizing that it has distinct clinical, pathologic, molecular, and biological characteristics compared with invasive ductal cancer (IDC).,,,,

The association with its encoding gene CDH1 inactivation, translating in the lack of intercellular adhesion tumor and in a cancer morphology in which cells invade tissues in a chain-like single-file manner, due to the loss of E-cadherin expression, is distinctive of ILC. This unique growth pattern is therefore characterized by greater difficulties in imaging detection, determining a higher stage of disease at diagnosis, which are correlated with more frequent multifocality, and consequent superior rates of mastectomies.ILC is also predominantly hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) negative, presenting low grade and proliferative index.

Although these tumor characteristics are generally associated with a favorable prognosis, ILC has a higher risk of late distant recurrence and may exhibit aggressive metastatic behavior associated with worse long-term outcomes than IDC at the same stage,,,,,(Supplementary Table S1).

Indeed, ILC represents a clinical challenge compared to IDC, and research is dedicating its efforts to study the biological heterogeneity of the ILC in order to identify personalized paradigms of long-term treatment and management of the disease.,,

Current clinical practice guidelines anyway recommend similar treatment approaches for both histological subtypes.

A current and lively research area is investigating the management of patients affected by hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) negative BC generally treated with endocrine therapy yet presenting a likelihood of recurrence due to peculiar clinical and pathological features. Several recent clinical trials were designed to treat patients at high risk of recurrence, studying the combination of new adjuvant treatments to current standard-of-care adjuvant endocrine for patients with HR positive, HER2 negative BC.,,,,

### Prospective matched-pair comparison of outcome after treatment for lobular and ductal breast carcinoma [^94767199]. The British Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Whether the prognosis of invasive lobular carcinoma is different from that of other invasive breast cancers is controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome in age- and stage-matched patients with lobular carcinoma and those with invasive breast cancer, and in particular to compare predictors of outcome.

Methods

Data were obtained from a prospectively maintained database that included patients who had breast surgery for invasive cancer. Patients were matched for International Union Against Cancer stage and age at diagnosis within 5 years. Two patients with invasive ductal carcinoma were matched to each patient with invasive lobular carcinoma.

Results

There was no significant difference between invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas in terms of overall survival. Oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive invasive ductal carcinoma had a better prognosis than ER-positive invasive lobular carcinoma (P = 0.011). Similarly, ER-negative invasive ductal carcinoma was associated with worse survival than ER-negative invasive lobular carcinoma (P = 0.054).

Conclusion

These results suggested that the differences in outcome between invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas may be determined by ER status.

### Clinical characteristics and survival outcomes of metastatic invasive lobular and ductal carcinoma [^2d393995]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study of patients with mIDC and mILC, metastasis onset, ER positivity, and tumor grade were associated with survival outcomes and the metastasis patterns of mIDC and mILC. The findings of the present study highlight the importance of recognizing the distinct prognostic factors of mIDC and mILC, which can improve our understanding of the association with disease progression, recurrence patterns, and survival outcomes, ultimately guiding more personalized treatment strategies for each subtype.

### Invasive lobular breast cancer: data to support surgical decision Making [^52fa1877]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is thought be a unique entity with higher rates of multifocal/multicentric and bilateral disease. This study aimed to evaluate the true extent of the disease, risk of bilaterality, lymph node involvement, and impact of preoperative imaging to help guide surgical decision making.

Methods

A retrospective analysis identified patients treated for ILC between 2004 and 2017. Clinical staging and pathologic results were compared. Follow-up details including local recurrence, contralateral breast cancer (CBC), and survival outcomes were evaluated.

Results

The study identified 692 patients with ILC, including 43 patients (6%) with a diagnosis of CBC and 232 patients (33%) with a diagnosis of multifocal/multicentric disease at presentation. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) led to an identification of additional disease in 20% of the patients. Preoperative MRI resulted in a more accurate prediction of tumor size staging but did not improve the discordance between clinical and pathologic nodal staging. Overall, the rate of imaging occult lymph node disease was 24%. At the 6-year follow-up evaluation, a local recurrence had developed in 2.3%, a CBC in 2.3, and a distant metastasis in 9.4% of the patients. The overall survival rate was 96% at 3 years and 91% at 5 years.

Conclusions

Invasive lobular carcinoma is a distinct subset of cancer that poses a diagnostic staging challenge. The results of this study favor MRI for accurate tumor staging and for improving detection of multicentricity and bilaterality. However, clinicians should be aware of the higher likelihood of occult lymph node involvement with ILC and subsequent early metastasis.

Introduction

Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common histologic subtype of invasive breast cancer and accounts for approximately 10% to 15% of all breast cancers. ILC displays distinct pathologic, molecular, and clinical characteristics compared with those of the more commonly diagnosed invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC; refs.). Loss of E-cadherin expression is a defining characteristic of ILC and results in reduced cell–cell adhesion and tumor morphology in which cells invade tissues in a chain-like single-file manner. ILC tumors are predominantly estrogen receptor positive (ER+), HER2 negative (HER2−), and of low grade and low proliferative index. Although these tumor characteristics are generally associated with favorable prognoses, ILC tumors have an increased risk of late distant recurrence (DR) and can display aggressive metastatic behavior associated with poorer long-term outcomes when compared with stage-matched IDC. Despite the unique clinical challenges of ILC versus IDC, current clinical practice guidelines recommend similar treatment paradigms for both histologic subtypes. Thus, there is an unmet medical need for enhanced approaches that interrogate underlying ILC tumor biology to better individualize treatment and long-term disease management.

The Breast Cancer Index (BCI) is a gene expression–based signature that incorporates two functional biomarker panels: (i) the 2-gene ratio, HOXB13/IL17BR (H/I), and (ii) the 5-gene Molecular Grade Index (MGI). The BCI test is indicated for patients with early-stage, hormone receptor–positive (HR+) breast cancer and reports both a predictive and a prognostic result. The predictive component, BCI (H/I), reports a categoric prediction of high versus low likelihood of benefit from extended endocrine therapy, whereas the prognostic component, the BCI score, is based on the algorithmic combination of H/I and MGI and stratifies risk for overall (0–10 years) and late (5–10 years post-diagnosis) DR.

### Distinct clinical and prognostic features of infiltrating lobular carcinoma of the breast: combined results of 15 international breast cancer study group clinical trials [^70d76113]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine how patients with infiltrating lobular carcinoma (ILC) differ from patients with the more common infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) with regard to patient and tumor factors, local treatment, and patterns of recurrence.

Patients and Methods

Twelve thousand two hundred six breast cancer patients entered onto 15 International Breast Cancer Study Group trials between 1978 and 2002 were categorized as having ILC, IDC, or other/mixed types.

Results

Seven hundred sixty-seven tumors (6.2%) were classified as ILC, 8,607 (70.5%) were classified as IDC, and 2,832 (23.2%) were classified as other. The analysis is limited to the 9,374 patients categorized as either pure IDC or ILC. The median follow-up time was 13 years. Compared with IDC, ILC was associated with older age; larger, better differentiated, and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors; and less vessel invasion. Mastectomy was used more frequently for ILC (P < .01). There was a significant (P < .01) early advantage in disease-free survival and overall survival for the ILC cohort followed by a significant (P < .01) late advantage for the IDC cohort after 6 and 10 years, respectively. Similar patterns were observed in cohorts defined by ER status. ILC was associated with an increased incidence of bone events but a decrease in regional and lung events (all P < .01).

Conclusion

ILC is more than a histologic variant of breast cancer. The diagnosis of ILC carries distinct prognostic and biologic implications.

BCI is a significant prognostic factor in ILC

Significant differences in outcome based on BCI risk stratification were observed. In the overall cohort (N = 307), BCI classified 40% of patients (N = 123) as low-risk with a 10-year DR rate of 7.6% (95% CI, 2.0%–12.9%), 14% of patients (N = 44) as intermediate-risk with a 10-year DR rate of 8.0% (95% CI, 0.0%–16.4%), and 46% of patients (N = 140) as high-risk with a 10-year DR rate of 27.0% (95% CI, 18.3%–34.9%; Fig. 1A). The low- and intermediate-risk patients displayed similar rates of DR, and therefore were combined into a single low/intermediate-risk group with a 10-year DR rate of 7.8% (95% CI, 3.0%–12.4%; Fig. 1B). BCI significantly stratified patients with ILC into high- and low/intermediate-risk groups based on overall 10-year (HR = 4.09; 95% CI, 2.00–8.34; P = 0.0001), early (0–5 years) (HR = 8.19; 95% CI, 1.85–36.30; P = 0.0042), and late (5–10 years) DR (HR = 3.04; 95% CI, 1.32–7.00; P = 0.0224; Fig. 1B–D). Of the 248 patients that remained free of DR for at least 5 years, 57% were classified as low/intermediate-risk with a late DR rate of 6.5% (95% CI, 2.0%–10.9%) compared with a DR rate of 18.7% (95% CI, 10.4%–26.3%) in the high-risk group (Fig. 1D). Overall, the low/intermediate-risk group had a favorable prognosis with DRs predominantly occurring late (post-5 years; 6.5%; 95% CI, 1.3%–7.0%) rather than early (1.4%; 95% CI, 0.0%–3.2%). In contrast, the high-risk group demonstrated a persistent and increasing risk of DR over the entire 10-year period (Fig. 1B–D). Results in patients that received adjuvant endocrine therapy (N = 263) were similar to the overall cohort (Supplementary Fig. S4). The overall cohort was then stratified by BCI (H/I) to evaluate the likelihood of benefit from extended endocrine therapy. Of the BCI low/intermediate-risk patients, 34% were classified as BCI (H/I)-high and predicted to benefit from extended endocrine therapy (Supplementary Fig. S5). In addition, 49% of the BCI high-risk patients were classified as BCI (H/I)-low and not predicted to benefit from extended endocrine therapy (Supplementary Fig. S5).

In this study, we aimed to validate the RCB method for predicting event free survival (EFS) in patients with ILC who received NAC. We utilized an international, multicenter, pooled cohort in which we previously reported associations between RCB and EFS by tumor receptor subtype across all histologic subtypes, and now evaluate ILC cases specifically compared to non-ILC cases. Our primary study question was whether or not RCB index and class are associated with EFS in patients with ILC. Additionally, we explored which of the individual components of RCB was most predictive of outcomes in those with ILC.

In the 65% of patients with stage II and III breast cancer (36% N0, 64% N+), the overall 10-year DR rate was 29.5% (95% CI, 19.7%–38.1%) for the high-risk group and 10.5% (95% CI, 1.9%–18.3%) for the low/intermediate-risk group (HR = 3.37; 95% CI, 1.40–8.12; P = 0.0158). These patients with stage II and III disease could also be further stratified for both early (HR = 4.09; 95% CI, 0.91–18.27; P = 0.1352) and late (HR = 3.01; 95% CI, 1.01–8.95; P = 0.1139) DR (Fig. 2B) with 39% classified as low/intermediate-risk. Patients treated with chemotherapy were similarly stratified for overall 10-year (HR = 4.62; 95% CI, 1.60–13.36; P = 0.0081), early (P = 0.0246), and late (HR = 2.73; 95% CI, 0.89–8.38; P = 0.1876) DR risk (Fig. 2C).

### The impact of lobular carcinoma in situ in association with invasive breast cancer on the rate of local recurrence in patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy [^401a0a3a]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

The significance of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) associated with invasive breast cancer in patients undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT) remains controversial. We examined the impact of the presence and extent of LCIS associated with invasive breast cancer on clinical outcome in BCT patients.

Methods and Materials

From 1980 to 1996, 607 cases of invasive breast cancer were treated with BCT. All slides were reviewed by a single pathologist. Positive margin was defined as presence of invasive carcinoma/ductal carcinoma in situ at the inked margin. Multiple clinical, pathologic, and treatment-related variables were analyzed for their association with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and true recurrence/marginal miss (TR/MM). Median follow-up was 8.7 years.

Results

Fifty-six patients (9%) had LCIS in association with invasive cancer. On univariate analysis, positive final margin, positive/no reexcision, smaller maximum specimen dimension, and the presence of LCIS predicted for IBTR. The 10-year IBTR rate was 14% for cases with LCIS vs. 7% without LCIS (p=0.04). On multivariate analysis, positive margin (p<0.01), positive/no reexcision (p=0.04), and presence of LCIS (p=0.02) remained independently associated with IBTR; positive margin (p<0.01) and LCIS (p=0.04) were also associated with TR/MM failure. When examining only cases with negative final margins, the presence of LCIS remained associated with higher IBTR and TR/MM rates (p<0.01).

Conclusion

The presence of LCIS was independently associated with higher rate of IBTR and TR/MM after BCT for invasive breast cancer. LCIS may have significant premalignant potential and progress to an invasive IBTR at the site of index lesion. The adequacy of excision of LCIS associated with invasive carcinoma should be considered in patients undergoing BCT.

Long-term survival analysis

For all three groups of patients, the median follow-up time for survival analysis was 10 years or longer (LLIMCa: 130 months, range 12.3–186.6 months; ILC: 128.7 months, range 28.8–185.1 months; IDC: 119.2, range 7.3–168.1 months). In the Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, although LLIMCas appeared to harbor an intermediate survival between IDCs and ILCs, statistical significance was not reached (Fig. 3) in either separate or combined sets of comparisons (Supplementary D ata sets). Lower tumor grade (grade I), lower pT stage (pT1), lower pN stage (pN0 + pN1), and lower ME2 score (<18) were associated with significantly improved recurrence-free survival (RFS), distant RFS (DRFS), and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) (Table 5, Fig. 4 for BCSS, and Supplementary Data sets). Lower pT stage (pT1), lower pN stage (pN0 + pN1), and lower ME2 score (<18) were associated with significantly improved overall survival (OS) (Table 5 and Supplementary Data sets). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed statistically significant improved RFS, DRFS, OS, and BCSS associated with lower pT stage (pT1) and lower ME2 score (<18) (Supplementary Data sets).

### Immunological subtypes in breast cancer are prognostic for invasive ductal but not for invasive lobular breast carcinoma [^d695ec88]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Currently, breast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer type and the leading cause of cancer-related death in the female population in the West. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is by far the most common type of BC. The second largest group comprises invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), and reports indicate that 10–15% of breast tumours are ILC. Investigations into the differences between IDC and ILC have consistently shown that lobular carcinomas have a particular single-file growth pattern, tend to be larger, more often ER- and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive, and less aggressive than their ductal counterparts (;). Nevertheless, these two types of BC are treated similarly with regard to systemic adjuvant therapy, which is based on tumour size, histological grade, hormone receptor status and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status.

Gene expression studies have identified several distinct BC subtypes with marked differences in patient prognosis (;,). This molecular classification proposed four different classes of breast tumours: Luminal A and B, basal-like and tumours overexpressing HER2. Luminal B tumours differ from Luminal A by a lower quantative content of hormone receptors. Basal-like tumours are triple-negative tumours and HER2-overexpressing tumours cluster near these basal-like tumours (;,). Studies have shown that basal-like and HER2-overexpressing tumours have a more aggressive character, resulting in an unfavourable patient outcome compared to the Luminal tumour types.

With respect to over- and undertreatment, no optimal risk stratification exists for the allocation of the (individual) BC patient to the most appropriate therapeutic regimen. It is likely that the different gene expression profiles explain the observed survival differences seen in the BC population, even after controlling for tumour stage. However, there is also strong evidence that the BC host's adaptive immune system plays a crucial role in the control of tumour growth and progression. On the other hand, breast tumour cells are able to adapt in order to escape the immune system and thus acquire characteristics to evade immunological recognition. Several studies have attempted to elucidate this highly immunogenic disease by pointing out the great variety of immune reactions found in BC.

### High rates of breast conservation for large ductal and lobular invasive carcinomas combining multimodality strategies [^6e23d0e3]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

The standard treatment of operable breast adenocarcinomas too large to be amenable to breast-conserving surgery is mastectomy with axillary lymph node clearance. Several randomised studies have compared neoadjuvant with adjuvant chemotherapy. In these studies, the locoregional treatment could be either surgery or radiotherapy or a combination of both. There was no significant difference in terms of locoregional control and overall (OS) or disease-free survivals. The principal clinical benefit of a neoadjuvant medical treatment was, in the case of good clinical response, avoiding mastectomy. However, data regarding the specific behaviour of invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC), a histological subtype of breast cancers representing 5–15% of all breast cancer cases, are still scarce in this therapeutic setting. Lobular carcinomas are characterised by a specific morphology with discohesive small cells usually associated with estradiol receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) positivity and with a low proliferation rate. These factors are now well-established predictive markers of poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We, and others, have previously shown that ILC are often diagnosed as larger tumours than invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC), and for which a neoadjuvant treatment could be chosen to increase the rate of conservative surgery. This study aims to compare the outcome of lobular vs ductal carcinomas under neoadjuvant chemotherapy and to report their locoregional control.

### A component of lobular carcinoma in clinically lymph node-negative patients predicts for an increased likelihood of upstaging to pathologic stage III breast cancer [^08d46bfc]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Except for cancers of the skin, breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among U.S. women and accounts for 29% of all new cancer cases and 14% of all cancer-related deaths. In 2017 alone, more than 250,000 newly diagnosed cases of invasive breast cancer and 40,000 deaths were expected.Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) comprise the majority of invasive breast cancer subtypes, with IDC being by far the most common.However, ILC is often described as the most common special breast cancer subtype because these cancers demonstrate distinct histopathologic features and clinical behavior that distinguish them from other special types and no special type (ductal) carcinomas.

ILC is often associated with several good prognostic factors, including low histologic grade, low proliferative activity, positive expression for hormone receptors, and lack of biomarkers of poor prognosis, such as HER2.,Despite these lower risk features, the low density of tumor cells in the tissue and absence of a substantial desmoplastic stromal reaction make detection of ILC on physical examination, imaging, and even gross pathologic evaluation more difficult than detection of other histologies.

The same biologic characteristics that lead to later detection of ILC can make it harder for the clinician to find evidence of axillary lymph node (LN) metastases on imaging and physical examination. Nodes may remain nonpalpable, even in extensive metastatic disease. Although several factors aid to predict the presence of LN metastases, including palpable tumor, T-stage, mean tumor size, and angiolymphatic invasion, they are not conclusive.Only surgical pathology can definitively determine the extent of disease in patients with ILC, and the discovery of LN metastases in a patient originally deemed clinically node-negative can upstage the cancer and significantly alter the treatment plan.

### Prognostic utility of breast cancer index to stratify distant recurrence risk in invasive lobular carcinoma [^b56a1534]. Clinical Cancer Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Purpose:

The prognostic utility of Breast Cancer Index (BCI) for risk assessment of overall (0–10 years), early (0–5 years), and late (5–10 years) distant recurrence (DR) in hormone receptor–positive (HR+) invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) was evaluated.

Experimental Design:

BCI gene expression analysis was performed blinded to clinical outcome utilizing tumor specimens from patients with HR+ ILC from a multi-institutional cohort. The primary endpoint was time to DR. Kaplan–Meier analyses of overall, early, and late DR risk were performed, and statistical significance was evaluated by log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression. The prognostic contribution of BCI in addition to clinicopathologic factors was evaluated by likelihood ratio analysis.

Results:

Analysis of 307 patients (99% ER+, 53% T1, 42% N+, 70% grade II) showed significant differences in DR over 10 years based on BCI risk categories. BCI low- and intermediate-risk patients demonstrated similar DR rates of 7.6% and 8.0%, respectively, compared with 27.0% for BCI high-risk patients. BCI was a significant independent prognostic factor for overall 10-year DR [HR = 4.09; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.00–8.34; P = 0.0001] as well as for both early (HR = 8.19; 95% CI, 1.85–36.30; P = 0.0042) and late (HR = 3.04; 95% CI, 1.32–7.00; P = 0.0224) DR. In multivariate analysis, BCI remained the only statistically significant prognostic factor for DR (HR = 3.49; 95% CI, 1.28–9.54; P = 0.0150).

Conclusions:

BCI is an independent prognostic factor for ILC and significantly stratified patients for cumulative risk of 10-year, early, and late DR. BCI added prognostic value beyond clinicopathologic characteristics in this distinct subtype of breast cancer.

### High rates of breast conservation for large ductal and lobular invasive carcinomas combining multimodality strategies [^e9aed7c6]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Despite being associated with large tumour size and less clinical response to primary chemotherapy, lobular subtype was not found associated with either worse locoregional control, even in the subgroup of only patients who had been treated with breast conservation, or worse overall survival. It should, however, be noted that in this series, patients treated with exclusive or preoperative radiotherapy fared worse in terms of locoregional control than others, perhaps also because of a selection of patients with poor prognosis. This opens the debate as to whether radiotherapy could not play a role in increasing the rate of breast-conserving treatments for some invasive carcinomas, as it is an important part of the treatment of large breast cancers (;) and has been shown to achieve complete clinical response (6–41%) with doses compatible with planned secondary surgeries (;;;). At the Institut Curie, the S6 trial randomised premenopausal women between chemotherapy and radiotherapy as an initial treatment for large breast cancers. There was no difference in the 10-year OS. Out of 69 tumours still palpable after four cycles of FAC (5-fluorouracil, adriamycine and cyclophosphamide), 42 (61%) achieved complete clinical response after 54 Gy. In contrast with chemotherapy (;), which is more effective in proliferative tumours, the effect of radiotherapy does not seem to depend on the degree of proliferation (or on the histological grade) (;;). Radiotherapy could thus theoretically play a role in increasing the rate of breast conservation for tumours that fail to sufficiently shrink with primary chemotherapy because of low proliferation, as in the case of lobular carcinomas. Another study performed at the Institut Curie showed a similar rate of pathological complete response with preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy for lobular and for ductal invasive carcinomas (31 vs 22%; P =0.5;).found, in a retrospective study comparing surgery (either breast-conserving or mastectomy) and exclusive radiotherapy for women who achieved clinical complete responses after primary chemotherapy, a nonsignificant trend toward increased locoregional-only recurrence for the no surgery group. However, they also found that patients achieving both clinical and ultrasound complete responses, and not undergoing surgery, had a low (8%) rate of locoregional recurrence at 5 years. Additionally, MRI has also proven to be useful in the assessment of the tumour response to chemotherapy (;;;). This good value of MRI in the evaluation of tumour response should also apply to ILC as, even though ILC is still a challenge for MRI, the addition of MRI to mammography still increases the sensitivity in the detection of ILC (;) and, most importantly in the case of the response evaluation, the volumetric assessment is improved (;;;). This raises the question of whether patients who achieve complete clinical and imaging response could in some cases entirely avoid surgery. This issue, needless to say, would need to be properly assessed in a prospective randomised trial. Additionally, to really benefit from higher rates of breast conservation, one needs to closely evaluate the cosmetic effects of this therapeutic approach but which could not be assessed in our study. One particular concern is indeed that it is associated with worse cosmetic results, because they deteriorate with the radiotherapy total dose (whole breast+boost;), with chemotherapy, and when radiotherapy is given pre- rather than post-operatively, both in the case of standard or oncoplastic surgeries.

### Prognostic utility of breast cancer index to stratify distant recurrence risk in invasive lobular carcinoma [^4d8f2310]. Clinical Cancer Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Findings from this study, which investigated the prognostic ability of BCI in a multi-institutional cohort of patients with ILC treated with endocrine or chemo-endocrine therapy, demonstrate that BCI is a significant and independent prognostic factor in ILC and provides risk stratification for cumulative 10-year DR, as well as both early (0–5 years) and late (5–10 years) DR. Patients with ILC were stratified into a low/intermediate-risk group comprising 54% of the patients, with a DR rate of approximately 7.8%, and a high-risk group including 46% of patients with a DR rate of approximately 27.0%. Importantly, BCI also significantly stratified patients with ILC for late DR, with prognostic performance consistent across all clinical subsets examined. It has been previously reported that lymph node status, tumor size, age, S-phase, PR status, and ER status are significant clinical factors independently associated with recurrence and survival. In addition, increased tumor size and nodal status have been shown to be associated with risk of late DR. However, results from the current study underscore the utility of genomic risk assessment in ILC, as BCI classified 19% of patients with N0 tumors and 45% of patients with well/moderately-differentiated tumors as high-risk. Conversely, 17% of patients with N+ tumors and 39% of patients with stage II/III tumors were classified as low/intermediate-risk by BCI, indicating these patients have a favorable long-term prognosis despite their high-risk clinicopathologic features.

As ILC has a propensity for late DR, an apparent feature of BCI prognostic stratification is that DRs in low/intermediate-risk patients occurred almost entirely in the late follow-up period (post-5 years from diagnosis), whereas recurrences in high-risk patients showed a steady increase in cumulative risk over 10 years (Fig. 1). Similar recurrence patterns to those of the overall cohort were also observed in high- and low/intermediate-risk patients with well- and moderately-differentiated tumors (Fig. 2A), stage II/III tumors (Fig. 2B), and N+ tumors (Supplementary Fig. S6B). In addition, patients with ILC did not demonstrate any reduction in risk or shift in prognostic profile with chemotherapy treatment, although this should be interpreted with caution given the retrospective nature of this study (Fig. 2C).

### Evolving concepts in breast lobular neoplasia and invasive lobular carcinoma, and their impact on imaging methods [^e9d6776f]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

A more precise determination of the burden of lesions allows for better surgical planning (mastectomy versus conservative techniques) and is fundamental for the indication and planning of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Despite the evidence of the high sensitivity of MRI for the detection of ILC, its role in preoperative staging is still controversial. In fact, no study has confirmed an improvement in overall survival. A possible explanation for this result is that MRI shows small synchronous lesions that would be effectively treated by adjuvant therapies (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy) without the need for additional surgical procedures. However, most of the synchronous lesions diagnosed by MRI share histological characteristics related to aggressiveness and a prognosis similar to that of the index lesions. Furthermore, the impact of a lesion’s overestimation by MRI when deciding and planning the surgical approach is questionable, as this could arguably lead to overtreatment.

Current evidence has shown changes in the clinical management of patients who had a preoperative breast MRI and the clear benefit of a minor rate of surgical re-assessment in patients who underwent conservative surgeries. Mann et al. retrospectively evaluated the role of preoperative MRI in the treatment of ILC and concluded that MRIs significantly reduced the rate of re-assessment in breast conservation surgeries, without increasing the number of mastectomies.

Prognostic factors and clinical management

Although ILC has some good prognostic factors, such as lower grades, lower mitotic indexes, positive hormonal receptors and a lack of HER2 overexpression, there is no difference in the survival rates of patients with these two histological types, which may be justified by the fact that, usually, ILC is diagnosed in more advanced staging than IDC.

It is well known that when conservative procedures are chosen, free surgical margins are less common for ILC than for IDC; thus, the rate of re-excision is significantly higher for ILC treated with conservative surgeries. Mastectomy as an option for re-assessment is used in 16–48 % of patients. However, when surgical margins are free in conservative surgeries, there is no difference in local recurrence, disease-free survival or overall survival compared with IDC. Accordingly, the indications for surgical treatment, radiotherapy and chemotherapy do not differ between ILC and IDC. Endocrine therapy is often used in women with ILC, given their high proportion of hormonal receptor expression.

### Survival outcomes in premenopausal patients with invasive lobular carcinoma [^fda7eb90]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common histological subtype, accounting for 5% to 10% of invasive breast cancer. In population-based series, when combined hormonal replacement therapy was widely used, the incidence of ILC was significantly higher than that of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC).Invasive lobular carcinoma tends to be clinically bilateral, multifocal, or multicentric; pathologically, it tends to be estrogen receptor (ER) positive and/or progesterone receptor (PR) positive and ERBB2 (previously HER2/neu) negative, accompanied by the presence of E-cadherin.,, Unlike IDC, the metastasis of ILC can be found at specific sites, including the gastrointestinal tract, cerebrospinal fluid, peritoneal sites, pelvic organs, and leptomeninges.

Several previous studies have compared the prognosis of ILC with that of IDC. The clinical outcomes of ILC were found to be diverse and better,, not different, or worsethan those of IDC. Considering the long-term outcome, ILC has been suggested to have a poorer prognosis than IDC. These discrepancies regarding prognosis could be attributed to the different observation periods, particularly considering long-term follow-up and late recurrence.

### A pooled analysis evaluating prognostic significance of residual cancer burden in invasive lobular breast cancer [^3c746e3f]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Alternatively, the morphological differences in the growth pattern of ILC compared to IDC may indeed result in differential patterns of response to therapy. A concentric decrease in tumor size after NAC is less common in patients with HR+HER2- disease, and patients with ILC may be even more likely to have a scattered residual pattern of disease due to its diffuse growth pattern. Investigators have recently shown that the histologic pattern of response is associated with outcomes, such that the presence of scattered residual disease portends increased risk of recurrence relative to tumors with concentric shrinkage. However, this finding was strongest in triple-negative breast cancers, which are rare in ILC. As such, significant chemotherapy response in ILC may be best reflected by reduction in tumor cellularity as opposed to reductions in tumor bed diameter or even nodal positivity. Indeed, our recursive partitioning tree identified tumor cellularity as the most predictive component of RCB for the ILC cases. In this model, we found that among those cases with relatively lower tumor cellularity, the combination of fewer residual positive nodes along with larger tumor size was paradoxically associated with the most favorable prognosis. While this finding could be an anomaly due to small sample size or occasional inaccurate RCB assessment, it is also possible that the combination of a larger tumor without extensive nodal involvement indicates the underlying biology of the tumor, with perhaps a lower potential for metastatic spread despite larger size. While larger tumor size in breast cancer is associated with increased likelihood of nodal involvement, this correlation is weaker at the extremes of tumor size and is impacted by tumor biology, suggesting that larger size alone may not reflect a tumor’s propensity for distant dissemination,. Prior work shows a relationship between tumor cellularity and pathologic tumor size after NAC, with smaller residual tumors having a larger decrease in cellularity. Whether this association between reduction in cellularity and reduction in tumor size holds true for lobular tumors specifically is unknown, but our findings suggest that lack of reduction in tumor size after NAC may not always be a negative prognostic indicator for those with ILC.

### A prognostic index for operable, node-negative breast cancer [^d218c7f7]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

The ‘good outcome’ group were younger (mean age 53.0 years, 95% CI 50.01–55.99 vs mean age 57.7 years, 95% CI 54.24–61.25. P =0.044). The requirement for 10 years survival, in order to be included in the ‘good’ prognosis category, probably contributed to this effect.

Of the 83 tumours in the initial set, 13 were of ‘special’ pathological types (tubular or lobular) and there was no difference in their distribution among subgroups. The presence of ductal (or, in one instance, lobular) carcinoma in situ was correlated weakly with good outcome (P =0.03) and, while this association failed to reach statistical significance for either arm of the trial, on its own, it was stronger for the subgroup which had not received adjuvant tamoxifen. As anticipated, ‘good’ and ‘poor’ outcome cases differed on overall pathological grade, with 30% of the former, but 54% of the latter, being grade 3 (P =0.025). Unexpectedly, this difference was accounted for entirely by cases from the adjuvant tamoxifen arm of the trial, where the proportions of grade 3 tumours in the good and poor outcome group were 26 and 71%, respectively (P =0.003). No significant differences were found in extent of vascular invasion, nor of tumour necrosis. Lymphocytic infiltration was sparse or absent in the majority of cases. It was substantial in only four tumours, all of which belonged to the ‘good outcome, no adjuvant tamoxifen’ category. However, numbers were too small to justify incorporating this criterion into a general prognostic index.

### A pooled analysis evaluating prognostic significance of residual cancer burden in invasive lobular breast cancer [^1f40d36a]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study of 216 ILC and 4890 non-ILC cases who received NAC across 12 different institutions, we showed that RCB index and class have significant prognostic capability regardless of histologic subtype of breast cancer. For HR+HER2- cases, the relationship between RCB and EFS was non-linear, which was more pronounced in the ILC cohort. In prior analyses of this dataset, RCB was shown to be prognostic across receptor subtypes, with RCB 0 and RCB I classes having similar prognosis among HR+HER2- cases. In those cases, the log relative HR for RCB was similar up to an RCB index of 1.5. In the current analysis, we found similar results for the ILC cohort, with the exception of finding similar prognosis for ILC cases with RCB index up to 1.9. This is consistent with RCB 0, I, and II classes having comparable EFS outcomes in the ILC cohort. For HR+HER2- ILC cases specifically, which represent the vast majority of ILC tumors seen in clinical practice, estimated cumulative EFS at 5 years was high for those with either RCB 0/I or RCB II disease (87.3% and 90.7% respectively), with a lower 5-year EFS observed in those with RCB III disease (64.6%). These findings suggest that clinical trials utilizing RCB as an endpoint should consider even RCB II status as a good prognostic indicator in patients with HR+HER2- ILC, with the caveat that longer term follow up is needed to exclude an impact on late recurrence.

### Invasive lobular breast cancer: the prognostic impact of histopathological grade, E-cadherin and molecular subtypes [^cc824181]. Histopathology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is defined as an invasive carcinoma comprising non-cohesive cells dispersed individually in a single-file linear pattern in a fibrous stroma and accounts for 5–15% of breast cancers.–A number of variants of ILC do not show the classical morphological pattern, but loss of cell-to-cell cohesion is a common feature.

Histopathological grade is an important prognostic tool.–The Nottingham grading system classifies patients into groups with different prognoses.However, in ILC the suitability of grading is uncertain.Glandular structures are absent, mitoses are infrequent and the nuclei uniform. Thus, most ILCs are grade 2 and the prognostic value of grading is unclear.

Breast cancer treatment guidelines are based on hormone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and proliferation (Ki67) status, in addition to histopathological grade, tumour size and lymph node status.Histopathological type is not always included as a parameter in treatment guidelines, although favourable types may influence the choice of treatment.

E-cadherin (E-cad) is a transmembrane protein involved in cell-to-cell adhesion, and its loss promotes invasion and metastasis.Loss of E-cad is common in ILC,,and supports the diagnosis of ILC.Although it has been suggested that low levels of E-cad are associated with poorer prognosis,–its potential as a prognostic marker in ILC has not been clarified.

The aims of this study were to compare breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) in ILC with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) in a cohort of breast cancer patients with a long follow-up, to assess the prognostic value of histopathological grading of ILC and to examine the potential of E-cad as a prognostic marker in ILC.

### Mixed invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma of the breast: prognosis and the importance of histologic grade [^930beb1e]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of mixed invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma (IDC-L) in clinical practice is often associated with uncertainty related to its prognosis and response to systemic therapies. With the increasing recognition of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) as a distinct disease subtype, questions surrounding IDC-L become even more relevant. In this study, we took advantage of a detailed clinical database to compare IDC-L and ILC regarding clinicopathologic and treatment characteristics, prognostic power of histologic grade, and survival outcomes.

Materials and Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, we identified 811 patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer with IDC-L or ILC. Descriptive statistics were performed to compare baseline clinicopathologic characteristics and treatments. Survival rates were subsequently analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

Patients with ILC had more commonly multifocal disease, low to intermediate histologic grade, and HER2-negative disease. Histologic grade was prognostic for patients with IDC-L but had no significant discriminatory power in patients with ILC. Among postmenopausal women, those with IDC-L had significantly better outcomes when compared with those with ILC: disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31-0.95). Finally, postmenopausal women treated with an aromatase inhibitor had more favorable DFS and OS than those treated with tamoxifen only (OS adjusted HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.29-0.87), which was similar for both histologic types ( p = .212).

Conclusion

IDC-L tumors have a better prognosis than ILC tumors, particularly among postmenopausal women. Histologic grade is an important prognostic factor in IDC-L but not in ILC.

Implications For Practice

This study compared mixed invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma (IDC-L) with invasive lobular carcinomas (ILCs) to assess the overall prognosis, the prognostic role of histologic grade, and response to systemic therapy. It was found that patients with IDC-L tumors have a better prognosis than ILC, particularly among postmenopausal women, which may impact follow-up strategies. Moreover, although histologic grade failed to stratify the risk of ILC, it showed an important prognostic power in IDC-L, thus highlighting its clinical utility to guide treatment decisions of IDC-L. Finally, the disease-free survival advantage of adjuvant aromatase inhibitors over tamoxifen in ILC was consistent in IDC-L.

### Prognostic utility of breast cancer index to stratify distant recurrence risk in invasive lobular carcinoma [^26b9b1fe]. Clinical Cancer Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with well- and moderately-differentiated tumors accounted for 90% of the overall cohort, and within this group 53% were N0 and 47% were N+. Among these patients with well- and moderately-differentiated tumors, the 10-year rate of DR was 16.3% (95% CI, 11.0%–21.2%), and BCI stratified 45% of patients into a high-risk group with a 10-year rate of DR of 26.0% (95% CI, 16.6%–34.4%), and stratified 55% of patients into a low/intermediate-risk group with a 10-year rate of DR of 8.2% (95% CI, 2.8%–13.4%; HR = 3.78; 95% CI, 1.76–8.09; P = 0.0012). In addition, BCI significantly stratified patients for both early (HR = 11.64; 95% CI, 1.47–91.90; P = 0.0126) and late (HR = 2.78; 95% CI, 1.19–6.49; P = 0.0484) DR (Fig. 2A).

RESULTS

Patients' and tumours' characteristics according to the histological type of invasive carcinoma

The comparison of the 78 patients with lobular invasive carcinoma with the 672 with ductal invasive carcinomas is summarised in Table 1.

Patients diagnosed with lobular invasive carcinomas were significantly older than patients with ductal carcinomas. Lobular cancers were significantly larger (median size of 50 vs 40 mm; P <10 −3) with more HRs positive (HR+; 87 vs 73%; P =0.02) and lower histological grades than ductal carcinomas (grade 1; 41 vs 12%; P <10 −3).

Response to primary chemotherapy and local treatment according to histological type

Clinical response to primary chemotherapy was significantly better for ductal invasive carcinomas than for lobular (⩾50% of clinical response in 60% for ductal vs 47% for lobular; P =0.04; Table 2). The rates of breast-conserving treatments for lobular carcinomas was lower than that for ductal carcinomas, but the difference was not statistically significant (54% (42 out of 78) vs 65% (434 out of 672); P =0.07) and more patients with lobular carcinomas received local treatment with either exclusive radiotherapy or preoperative radiotherapy compared with ductal carcinomas (40 (31 out of 78) vs 26% (178 out of 672); P =0.02). If we look at patients who had surgery, excluding patients with radiotherapy alone as local treatment, there were significantly fewer breast conservations for lobular than for ductal invasive carcinomas: 24 out of 78 (31%) vs 333 out of 672 (50%), P =0.001. Rates of pathological complete response (for all patients who had undergone surgery) were respectively 9% (40 out of 457, 118 unknown) for ductal and 8% (4 out of 50, 10 unknown) for lobular (P =0.94).

Other factors of good clinical response found in univariate analysis (Table 3) were clinical T2 vs T3, HR+ vs HR− and high histological grade vs low and intermediate. In multivariate analysis, only high grade was significantly associated with a higher rate of clinical response.

### A pooled analysis evaluating prognostic significance of residual cancer burden in invasive lobular breast cancer [^67022464]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is validated to predict event-free survival (EFS) in breast cancer but has not been studied for invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). We studied patient-level data from a pooled cohort across 12 institutions. Associations between RCB index, class, and EFS were assessed in ILC and non-ILC with mixed effect Cox models and multivariable analyses. Recursive partitioning was used in an exploratory model to stratify prognosis by RCB components. Of 5106 patients, the diagnosis was ILC in 216 and non-ILC in 4890. Increased RCB index was associated with worse EFS in both ILC and non-ILC (p=0.002 and p<0.001, respectively) and remained prognostic when stratified by receptor subtype and adjusted for age, grade, T category, and nodal status. Recursive partitioning demonstrated residual invasive cancer cellularity as most prognostic in ILC. These results underscore the utility of RCB for evaluating NAC response in those with ILC.

### Clinical outcomes using accelerated partial breast irradiation in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma [^6bb8f7d6]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

We compared clinical outcomes of women diagnosed with either invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) or invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI).

Methods and Materials

A total of 16 patients with ILC received APBI as part of their breast-conservation therapy (BCT) and were compared with 410 patients with IDC that received APBI as part of their BCT. Clinical, pathologic, and treatment related variables were analyzed including age, tumor size, hormone receptor status, surgical margins, lymph node status, adjuvant hormonal therapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, and APBI modality. Clinical outcomes including local recurrence (LR), regional recurrence (RR), disease-free survival (DFS), cause-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.

Results

Median follow-up was 3.8 years for the ILC patients and 6.0 years for the IDC patients. ILC patients were more likely to have positive margins (20.0% vs. 3.9%, p = 0.006), larger tumors (14.1 mm vs. 10.9 mm, p = 0.03) and less likely to be node positive (0% vs. 9.5%, p < 0.001) when compared with patients diagnosed with IDC. The 5-year rate of LR was 0% for the ILC cohort and 2.5% for the IDC cohort (p = 0.59). No differences were seen in the rates of RR (0% vs. 0.7%, p = 0.80), distant metastases (0% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.54), DFS (100% vs. 94%, p = 0.43), CSS (100% vs. 97%, p = 0.59), or OS (92% vs. 89%, p = 0.88) between the ILC and IDC patients, respectively. Additionally, when node-positive patients were excluded from the IDC cohort, no differences in the rates of LR (0% vs. 2.2%, p = 0.62), RR (0% vs. 0%), DFS (100% vs. 95%, p = 0.46), CSS (100% vs. 98%, p = 0.63), or OS (92% vs. 89%, p = 0.91) were noted between the ILC and IDC patients.

Conclusion

Women with ILC had excellent clinical outcomes after APBI. No difference in local control was seen between patients with invasive lobular versus invasive ductal histology.

### Histologic grading of invasive lobular carcinoma: does use of a 2-tiered nuclear grading system improve interobserver variability? [^c12af941]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

The Nottingham histologic grade (NHG) is a prognostic marker for infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Its usefulness for invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) has been less clear, given that 2 of the 3 parameters, tubule formation and mitotic activity, show little variation in ILC, placing much of the emphasis on nuclear grade. We have previously reported a trend for improved overall and relapse-free survival in patients with ILC of low nuclear grade, as classified by a 2-tiered nuclear grading system. Given the inherent potential for interobserver variability with any grading system, the goal of this study is to compare interobserver variability in the grading of ILC using a 2-tiered nuclear grade vs the NHG. Thirty-eight cases of ILC were graded independently by 5 pathologists using NHG criteria. Tumors were also categorized by a nuclear grading system as low grade (grade 1 nuclei) or high grade (grades 2-3 nuclei). Pairwise kappa values and interobserver agreement rates were calculated for both NHG and nuclear grade. Results were compared using the paired t test. Mean interobserver agreement rates and kappa values improved with use of the nuclear grading system as compared to NHG (83% vs 70%, 0.4738 vs 0.3228, respectively). The differences between the 2 were statistically significant. Because histologic grade has significant prognostic implications for patients with breast cancer, accurate reporting is paramount. For ILC, where use of the NHG places substantial weight on nuclear pleomorphism, a 2-tiered nuclear grading system may reduce interobserver variability yet still provide useful prognostic information.

Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS)—nature and cancer risk are summarized as follows: LCIS is a histologic finding that usually does not present as a mass or with specific imaging abnormalities and is typically diagnosed incidentally at biopsy for another lesion. It is not considered a precursor lesion but a risk marker, and women with LCIS have a substantially increased risk of subsequent invasive cancer in the affected and contralateral breast. LCIS is often multifocal and involves the contralateral breast in 30% of cases; women with LCIS have an estimated 10–20% risk of developing invasive cancer in the following 15 years, and when invasive cancer occurs with LCIS it is contralateral in 29–75% of cases.

### Partial breast irradiation for patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ: an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^f9841e4d]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASTRO partial breast irradiation (PBI) guideline—KQ1 indications frames the applicable population, evidence base, and clinical stance when considering PBI as an alternative to whole breast irradiation (WBI). The AHRQ inclusion criteria required adult women (age ≥18 years) with early-stage invasive breast cancer or DCIS defined as a small lesion ≤3 cm with minimal (up to 3 positive) or no lymph node involvement, treated with upfront breast conserving surgery, and the search did not include patients of male sex. Multiple RCTs evaluating the efficacy of PBI alone compared with WBI have demonstrated comparable IBR and long-term overall survival. There is broad consensus that PBI is an acceptable treatment option for patients with favorable clinical features and tumor characteristics (postmenopausal age range, estrogen receptor [ER]-positive status, grade 1 to 2, small tumor size, and no lymph node involvement), while uncertainty remains regarding features perceived as less favorable that represented a minority in RCTs (age <50 years, DCIS, invasive lobular carcinoma, larger tumor size, grade 3, ER-negative status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-positive status, positive for lymphovascular invasion [LVI], and positive lymph nodes). Evaluation of these subgroups was restricted to the patients enrolled in the RCTs using PBI techniques that are recommended in KQ2, and the key question asks: In adult patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer or DCIS, what are the appropriate indications for PBI as an alternative to WBI?

### Comparison of long-term outcome between clinically high risk lobular versus ductal breast cancer: a propensity score matched study [^1d895b4d]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Novel treatment strategies included CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors,a mainstay of treatment for HR positive HER-2 negative, node-positive early high-risk BC. High risk was defined “by a compilation of clinical and pathologic factors including nodal status, tumor size, grade, and a marker of cellular proliferation (Ki-67)”.Indeed, findings of the monarchE trialhave recently provided systemic therapy recommendations for such BC patients. Recent published long-term monarchE trial data has globally confirmed the advantage of adjuvant abemaciclib added to endocrine therapy in HR positive HER2 negative high-risk BC patients, represented by the increase in absolute invasive disease-free survival and distant relapse-free survival benefit at 4 years.

To date, the frequency of patients with BC potentially eligible for abemaciclib treatment is not clear, as well as the data on the prognosis of ILCs compared to IDCs are conflicting (Supplementary Table S1): hence, the main purpose of this study is to quantify the characteristics and long-term outcomes of a real-world high-risk population according to monarchE trial criteria, comparing ILC to IDC cohorts.

### Society of Surgical Oncology-American Society for Radiation Oncology-American Society of Clinical Oncology consensus guideline on margins for breast-conserving surgery with whole-breast irradiation in ductal carcinoma in situ [^c4faaebf]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Treatment with excision alone in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is associated with substantially higher ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) than excision plus whole-breast radiotherapy (WBRT), and the optimal margin width for excision alone “should be at least 2 mm,” with some evidence of lower IBTR at widths wider than 2 mm. Meta-analysis showed 10-year IBTR with excision alone versus excision and WBRT of 26.0% v 12.0% for negative margins and 48.3% v 24.2% for positive margins. In a randomized trial of small, mammographically detected low-to-intermediate grade DCIS with margins ≥ 3 mm, 7-year IBTR rates were 6.7% and 0.9% (P = .003), respectively. In a prospective cohort treated with excision alone (negative margin width ≥ 3 mm), 12-year IBTR was 14.4% for non–high grade DCIS ≤ 2.5 cm and 24.6% for high-grade DCIS ≤ 1 cm; a single-arm series requiring margins ≥ 1 cm reported a 10-year IBTR rate of 15.6%. In contrast, an excision-alone series found 10-year IBTR rates of 16% for margins > 10 mm, 23% for 2.1 to 10 mm, 27% for 0 to 2 mm, and 41% for positive margins, and after adjustment margin width was a more highly significant predictor (P < .0001). The MP felt that heterogeneity “did not allow for a definitive recommendation for margin widths greater than 2 mm in patients foregoing RT.”

### Prognostic utility of breast cancer index to stratify distant recurrence risk in invasive lobular carcinoma [^74b9c11b]. Clinical Cancer Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The prognostic utility of Breast Cancer Index (BCI) for risk assessment of overall (0-10 years), early (0-5 years), and late (5-10 years) distant recurrence (DR) in hormone receptor-positive (HR+) invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) was evaluated.

Experimental Design

BCI gene expression analysis was performed blinded to clinical outcome utilizing tumor specimens from patients with HR+ ILC from a multi-institutional cohort. The primary endpoint was time to DR. Kaplan-Meier analyses of overall, early, and late DR risk were performed, and statistical significance was evaluated by log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression. The prognostic contribution of BCI in addition to clinicopathologic factors was evaluated by likelihood ratio analysis.

Results

Analysis of 307 patients (99% ER+, 53% T1, 42% N+, 70% grade II) showed significant differences in DR over 10 years based on BCI risk categories. BCI low- and intermediate-risk patients demonstrated similar DR rates of 7.6% and 8.0%, respectively, compared with 27.0% for BCI high-risk patients. BCI was a significant independent prognostic factor for overall 10-year DR [HR = 4.09; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.00-8.34; P = 0.0001] as well as for both early (HR = 8.19; 95% CI, 1.85-36.30; P = 0.0042) and late (HR = 3.04; 95% CI, 1.32-7.00; P = 0.0224) DR. In multivariate analysis, BCI remained the only statistically significant prognostic factor for DR (HR = 3.49; 95% CI, 1.28-9.54; P = 0.0150).

Conclusions

BCI is an independent prognostic factor for ILC and significantly stratified patients for cumulative risk of 10-year, early, and late DR. BCI added prognostic value beyond clinicopathologic characteristics in this distinct subtype of breast cancer.

Lung adenocarcinoma invasion-size classification and prognosis—Size of the central invasive component defines categories and prognosis: tumors with a small central invasive scar (≤ 5 mm) are termed MIA, and central fibrosis with invasion of < 5 mm showed no lymph node metastases and is predictive of nearly 100% survival; MIA with ≤ 5 mm of central invasive carcinoma has excellent overall survival relative to tumors whose invasive component exceeds 1 or 2 cm. AIS or MIA cannot be reliably diagnosed from a needle biopsy specimen alone, and histologic separation of AIS, MIA, and invasive adenocarcinoma can only be performed when the entire tumor has been excised and examined pathologically. For individuals with glandular producing tumors, distinguishing AIS and MIAs from invasive adenocarcinomas is recommended (Grade 1C).

### Mixed ductal-lobular carcinomas: evidence for progression from ductal to lobular morphology [^b8355bbd]. The Journal of Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The full extent of breast cancer heterogeneity is being recognized through genomic analysis, although its visible manifestations have been essential to the histopathological classification for many decades. Breast tumours are broadly categorized into two morphological groups: tumours showing specialized growth patterns, and those with no distinguishing features [invasive carcinoma of no special type (IC‐NST), or invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), which we will use for simplification of expression]. Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the most common special type (∼15%), and is defined by discohesive cells individually dispersed or arranged in single file, linearly in the fibrous stroma 1. Three to five per cent of tumours show both ductal and lobular morphology 1, and are classified as mixed ductal–lobular carcinoma (MDL) if the ductal component constitutes at least 10% of the tumour and the lobular component constitutes ≥50% 1, 2, 3. However, this definition is interpreted variably, as it does not account for tumours showing small foci of lobular differentiation. Some therefore report MDL as IDC with lobular features or simply as ‘ductal or lobular carcinoma’, whereas others also include those tumours with predominantly ductal features 3.

Several studies have investigated the clinical significance of MDLs, and have shown that they are associated with a better prognosis than IDC, but a poorer prognosis than ILC 3, 4, although the distinction was mostly lost after adjustment for grade 3, and that the prognosis for MDLs was poorer after stratification for oestrogen receptor (ER) positivity 5. Whereas a number of studies have shown that preinvasive lesions confined to the duct [lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)] and their associated invasive carcinomas are clonally related 6, 7, 8, there are insufficient studies to support this idea in MDLs. Limited evidence suggests that lesions with mixed morphology are clonally related and arise from a common ancestor 9 ; however, this study used low‐resolution technologies on relatively small cohorts. MDLs represent a unique model for interrogating intratumoural heterogeneity, clonal evolution, and the mechanisms driving acquisition of infiltrative growth patterns. In contrast to ILC and IDC, there are limited data on the underlying pathobiology of MDLs 2, 3.

### Does non-classic lobular carcinoma in situ at the lumpectomy margin increase local recurrence? [^3e570c28]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical significance of nonclassic, lobular carcinoma in situ (NC-LCIS) at the surgical margin of excisions for invasive cancer is unknown. We sought to determine whether NC-LCIS at or near the margin in the setting of a concurrent invasive carcinoma is associated with risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and locoregional recurrence (LRR).

Methods

Patients with stage 0-III breast cancer and NC-LCIS who underwent lumpectomy between January 2010 and January 2022 at a single institution were retrospectively identified. NC-LCIS margins were stratified as <2 mm, ≥2 mm, or within shave margin. Rates of IBTR and LRR were examined.

Results

A total of 511 female patients (median age 60 years [interquartile range (IQR) 52-69]) with NC-LCIS and an associated ipsilateral breast cancer with a median follow-up of 3.4 years (IQR 2.0-5.9) were identified. Final margins for NC-LCIS were ≥2 mm in 348 patients (68%), <2 mm in 37 (7.2%), and within shave margin in 126 (24.6%). Crude incidence of IBTR was 3.3% (n = 17) and that of LRR was 4.9% (n = 25). There was no difference in the crude rate of IBTR by NC-LCIS margin status (IBTR rate: 3.7% ≥2 mm, 0% <2 mm, 3.2% within shave margin, p = 0.8) nor in LRR (LRR rate: 4.9% ≥2 mm, 2.7% <2 mm, 5.6% within shave margin, p = 0.9).

Conclusions

For completely excised invasive breast cancers associated with NC-LCIS, extent of margin width for NC-LCIS was not associated with a difference in IBTR or LRR. These data suggest that the decision to perform reexcision of margin after lumpectomy should be driven by the invasive cancer, rather than the NC-LCIS margin.

### Comparison of long-term outcome between clinically high risk lobular versus ductal breast cancer: a propensity score matched study [^9cf6e9e8]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Abemaciclib is currently approved for the adjuvant treatment of high-risk, lymph node (LN)-positive, hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer (BC). In a real-world setting the clinicopathologic features of patients potentially eligible for adjuvant abemaciclib remain to be defined. There are conflicting data regarding the biological behavior and long-term outcomes across invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). In our study we retrospectively assessed the real-world data and long-term outcome of selected high-risk features ILC compared to IDC, according to the MonarchE trial inclusion criteria.

Methods

We identified 15,071 patients who got surgery at the European Institute of Oncology for a first primary, non-metastatic, HR-positive, HER2-negative BC from 2000 to 2008. 11,981 (79.5%) patients had an IDC and 1524 (10.1%) an ILC. The remaining 1566 patients (10.4%) had either combined ductal and lobular breast cancer or another histological breast cancer subtype. According to the eligibility criteria of the MonarchE study, we identified two high-risk groups, based on high number of positive lymph nodes, large tumor size, or a high cellular proliferation as measured by tumor grade or biomarkers. Patients were matched by propensity score.

Findings

A total of 2872 (21.3%) patients were selected as clinically high-risk, including 361/1524 ILC (23.7%) and 2511/11,981 IDC (21%). 322 high-risk ILC were matched with similar high-risk IDC. The median follow-up was 13.2 years for survival. In the matched set, invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) (log-rank P = 0.09) and overall survival (OS) (log-rank P = 0.48) were not statistically significantly different between the two histological groups. For IDC patients, the 5-year and 10-year IDFS rates (95% CI) were 77.7% (72.9–82.2) and 57.3% (51.7–63.1) respectively, compared to the 5-year and 10-year IDFS rates of ILC patients that were 75.5% (70.6–80.2) and 50.7% (45.0–56.6). The 5-year and 10-year distant relapse free survival (DRFS) rates were 80% (75.3–84.2) and 65.3% (59.8–70.7) in IDC cohort, compared to the 5-year and the 10-year DRFS rates of 78.7% (74.0–83.1) and 61.5% (55.9–67.1) in the ILC cohort. Such data match the recent outcomes efficacy results of the MonarchE control arm. More patients in the ILC (n = 17) than in the IDC group (n = 10) developed axillary recurrence. At multivariable analysis, stratified for specific clinical features, age <35 years, pT2-3, axillary involvement with more than 10 positive axillary nodes were found to be predictors of unfavorable IDFS and OS in the overall matched high-risk population.

Interpretation

Findings from this matched cohort study reported similar IDFS and DRFS rates for high risk HR positive early BC when compared to the control arm overall IDFS and DRFS rates reported from the MonarchE trial. Our study demonstrated rates of concordant long-term outcome status beyond histologic subtype. These data support an escalation strategy for these two different histological entities when diagnosed with high-risk features. In our dataset approximately 21% rate of high-risk HR positive early BC patients are potentially eligible for adjuvant abemaciclib treatment.

### A pooled analysis evaluating prognostic significance of residual cancer burden in invasive lobular breast cancer [^cf776db9]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

In these adjusted analyses, RCB index is significantly associated with EFS for ILC and non-ILC cases overall. When stratified by receptor subtype, higher RCB index remains significantly associated with EFS in non-ILC cases, and trends towards shorter EFS in ILC subsets but has wide confidence intervals in these smaller groups. For models including RCB class, RCB 0 and RCB I cases were combined as a single reference group (RCB 0/I) for HR+HER2- cases due to only 4 ILC patients having RCB 0 disease.

Bold indicates statistical significance (p < 0.05).

### High rates of breast conservation for large ductal and lobular invasive carcinomas combining multimodality strategies [^c1385b0f]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This retrospective study spans a period of 10 years with patients treated between 1989 and 1999. The follow-up is long with a median at 10 years and makes the study of locoregional survival relevant. The tumour characteristics of lobular carcinomas were those already found by Sastre and co-workers and others (;). Patients diagnosed with lobular invasive carcinomas were significantly older than patients with ductal tumours. Lobular cancers were significantly larger (;;) with more HRs (;;;) and lower histological (;) or nuclear (;) grade than ductal carcinomas.

Because of the frequent use of either exclusive or preoperative radiotherapy, the study of pathological response in our series was not relevant. Bearing in mind the mandatory caution in interpreting clinical response, we found that the response to primary chemotherapy was significantly better for ductal invasive carcinomas than for lobular (⩾50% of clinical response in 60% for ductal vs 47% for lobular; P =0.04), confirming the notion developed by others that lobular carcinomas responded less than ductal carcinomas to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (;;;;). However, in the present study, in multivariate analysis, only high grade was significantly associated with a higher rate of clinical response. This result is therefore in agreement with the Nomograms's design proposed online, which does not take into account the histological type of the tumour when deciding on the therapeutic option. There is room to better define biological predictive factors of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy to screen patients who would benefit most from this therapeutic option (;;;;). Lobular carcinomas had reduced clinical responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, while responses to breast-conserving treatments were fewer, although not significantly (54% (42 out of 78) vs 65% (434 out of 672); P =0.07). The lower rate of breast conservation in lobular vs ductal invasive carcinoma could also be due to the larger size of ILC. The most striking data are the high rate of breast conservation for both ductal and even more so for lobular carcinomas when compared to the rates in the literature that range, respectively, between 30–48 and 16–31% (;;). This is explained in our series by the use of either exclusive or preoperative radiotherapy, particularly for large tumours with a poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and, therefore, more frequently for lobular (40%) than for ductal (26%) carcinomas. Because of the retrospective nature of this study, we could not report the reason for the choice of performing preoperative or exclusive radiotherapy. However, as one can see from Table 2, the proportion of patients who received radiotherapy immediately after primary chemotherapy and who actually went on to have successful breast-conserving treatments was 80 and 84%, respectively, for IDC and ILC.

### Distinct clinical and prognostic features of infiltrating lobular carcinoma of the breast: combined results of 15 international breast cancer study group clinical trials (...) [^039411b5]. ASCO (2008). Low credibility.

Abstract Purpose To determine how patients with infiltrating lobular carcinoma differ from patients with the more common infiltrating ductal carcinoma with regard to patient and tumor factors, local treatment, and patterns of recurrence. Patients and Methods Twelve thousand two hundred six breast cancer patients entered onto 15 International Breast Cancer Study Group trials between 1978 and 2002 were categorized as having ILC, IDC, or other/mixed types. Results Seven hundred sixty-seven tumors were classified as ILC, 8, 607 were classified as IDC, and 2, 832 were classified as other. The analysis is limited to the 9, 374 patients categorized as either pure IDC or ILC. The median follow-up time was 13 years. Compared with IDC, ILC was associated with older age; larger, better differentiated, and estrogen receptor –positive tumors; and less vessel invasion. Mastectomy was used more frequently for ILC.

There was a significant early advantage in disease-free survival and overall survival for the ILC cohort followed by a significant late advantage for the IDC cohort after 6 and 10 years, respectively. Similar patterns were observed in cohorts defined by ER status. ILC was associated with an increased incidence of bone events but a decrease in regional and lung events. Conclusion ILC is more than a histologic variant of breast cancer. The diagnosis of ILC carries distinct prognostic and biologic implications.

Definitions of a negative margin varied across RCTs—no tumor on ink, 2 mm microscopic margins, 5 mm microscopic margins, and 1 cm macroscopic margins—with one trial requiring 2 mm for invasive non-lobular and 5 mm for DCIS or invasive lobular histology. PBI is not recommended for patients with positive surgical margins defined as tumor on ink, for whom re-excision is advised in the setting of WBI.

### Invasive lobular carcinoma classic type: response to primary chemotherapy and survival outcomes [^e9f75ee4]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the impact of histologic type invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) versus invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) on response to primary chemotherapy (PC) and long-term outcome.

Patients and Methods

The study included 1,034 patients with stage II and III breast cancer who participated in six clinical trials of PC at our institution between 1985 and 2002. One hundred twenty-two patients (12%) had ILC and 912 (88%) had IDC. All patients received anthracycline-based PC, and 346 patients (33.5%) also received a taxane as part of PC. Pathologic complete response (pCR) was defined as no evidence of invasive disease in the breast and axillary lymph nodes.

Results

The median patient age was 48 years (range, 18 to 79 years). Patients with ILC tended to be older (median age, 53 years v 47 years for patients with IDC) and have more hormone-receptor-positive tumors (92% v 62%; P < .001), lower nuclear grade (nuclear grade 3, 16% v 56%; P < .001), and higher stage at diagnosis (10% v 0% with stage IIIB or IIIC disease; P < .001). Patients with ILC were less likely to have a pCR (3% v 15%; P < .001) and had a larger number of involved axillary lymph nodes (41% v 26% had > 3 involved nodes; P = .001). At a median follow-up time of 70 months, ILC patients tended to have longer recurrence-free survival (P = .004) and overall survival (P = .001).

Conclusion

ILC is characterized by lower rates of pathologic response to PC but better long-term outcomes compared to IDC. pCR might not be a prognostic indicator for this group of patients.

### Immunological subtypes in breast cancer are prognostic for invasive ductal but not for invasive lobular breast carcinoma [^f2f23671]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Patient and tumour characteristics

Tumour material was available for 87% (704/822) of the patients. Median follow-up was 10 years (range 0.02–22 years), and median age in this cohort was 58 years (range 23–96 years). Clinicopathological and treatment characteristics for the original and imputated cohorts are shown in Table 1.

IDC and ILC: differences in associations with clinicopathological parameters

No statistically significant difference was seen between IDC and ILC with regard to the association with tumour immune subtypes (P =0.4) and molecular subtypes (P =0.4). For the classical prognostic variables tumour grade (P <0.001) and pathological tumour stage (P =0.0002), a significant difference was seen between lobular and ductal breast tumour histology. ILC had significantly more grade II tumours and a higher pathological tumour stage. Both remained independent prognostic factors in the multivariate correction (grade: P <0.001, hazard ratio (HR): 12.6, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.5–44.8); pathological tumour stage: P <0.0001 (HR pT2: 2.3 (95% CI: 1.1–4.8), HR pT3: 9.1 (95% CI: 3.1–26.4), HR pT4: 10.3 (95% CI: 3.0–35.5)). Also, compared to IDC, ILC showed a significantly lower expression pattern for both cleaved caspase-3 (P =0.0004, HR low: 0.2 (95% CI: 0.1–0.6), HR intermediate: 0.4 (95% CI: 0.1–0.9), HR high: 0.1 (95% CI: 0.01–0.4)) and Ki67 (P =0.03, HR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2–0.9) following multivariable analyses.

### ASO author reflections: discordant clinical and molecular risk in invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast: the 21-gene recurrence score in the national cancer database by histologic subtype [^4e4e0a14]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Past

The availability of molecular assays to predict the benefit of chemotherapy has allowed more tailored care for patients with breast cancer. Those with genomically low-risk tumors can be spared the potential harms of chemotherapy, whereas those with genomically high-risk tumors can be identified and receive effective treatment. However, for the subset of patients with a diagnosis of larger tumors and more nodal involvement, the clinical risk of recurrence may conflict with the predicted genomic risk of recurrence, resulting in treatment dilemmas. The authors previously showed that when the 70-gene signature is used, patients with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) are significantly more likely to fall into this discordant risk category than those with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC).Indeed, 35.6% of ILC cases were found to be clinically high risk but genomically low risk compared with 19.2% of IDC cases. A high proportion of discordance means that personalizing treatment is more challenging. Recent trials have addressed this issue, with the RxPONDER trial randomizing clinically high-risk patients (those with 1–3 positive nodes) with low-risk molecular assays (21-gene recurrence score ≤ 25) to chemotherapy or no chemotherapy.Although no difference in disease-free survival was seen in the overall study population, chemotherapy was associated with improved outcomes in the pre-menopausal subset.

### Clinicopathologic and genomic features of lobular like invasive mammary carcinoma: is it a distinct entity? [^3459d4c7]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Second, LLIMCas often harbor significantly larger pathologic tumor size than the size estimated on imaging and frequently positive or close margins at the first surgical procedure. This appears to be associated with lobular-like tumor morphology despite the preservation of the E-cadherin/catenin complex. In the past decade, multiple studies and consensus guidelines have recommended preoperative MRI for optimal management of patients with ILC, given its high sensitivity and better accuracy of measuring tumor size and multifocal disease –. Similar findings have been reported in “IDC with lobular features” on core biopsy. Moreover, the percentage of aberrant E-cadherin and p120 expression was found to be irrelevant to additional diseases detected on MRI in such patients. Given the findings in our study, we contend that distinguishing LLIMCas from the usual type IDCs in the biopsy report may be required and that preoperative MRI should be considered to guide surgical management for this type of invasive breast carcinoma.

### High-risk lesions of the breast: concurrent diagnostic tools and management recommendations [^538807b3]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Prognosis

Molecular analysis has demonstrated that LN is a clonal neoplastic proliferation and a precursor to invasive cancer. The relative risk of developing breast cancer is 4–12 times higher for women diagnosed with LCIS compared with women without LN, and 4 to 5 times higher for women with ALH compared with women without LN. The upgrade rate after surgical excision ranges widely from 0 to 40% in the literature, which may be due to differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria used in different studies (Table 2). One main inclusion criterion should be pathologic–radiologic agreement, especially considering that research studies carried out over the last decade have demonstrated that poor agreement between pathologic and imaging findings are associated with higher upgrade rates. For example, Murray et al. demonstrated in 85 cases of classic LN that there was a significant difference in the upgrade rate among cases with and without radiologic–pathologic discrepancy (38% and 3%, respectively).

A study by Genco et al. which evaluated the upgrade rate after surgical removal of classic LN showed that the upgrade rate was significantly higher for cases with previous or current breast cancer, radiologic asymmetry, and architectural distortion.

After the diagnosis of LN, the relative risk of developing cancer is 1–2% after one year, 15–17% after 15 years, and 35% after 35 years, with relatively equal rates of ipsi- and contralateral breast cancer (8.7 and 6.7%, respectively). The risk further doubles when the presence of proliferating high-risk lesions is accompanied by family history of breast cancer. Although all types of invasive carcinoma have been observed after a diagnosis of LN, invasive lobular carcinoma or special-type carcinomas are seen with higher frequency than in the general breast cancer population.

### LobSig is a multigene predictor of outcome in invasive lobular carcinoma [^28b99934]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the most common special type of breast cancer, and is characterized by functional loss of E-cadherin, resulting in cellular adhesion defects. ILC typically present as estrogen receptor positive, grade 2 breast cancers, with a good short-term prognosis. Several large-scale molecular profiling studies have now dissected the unique genomics of ILC. We have undertaken an integrative analysis of gene expression and DNA copy number to identify novel drivers and prognostic biomarkers, using in-house (n = 25), METABRIC (n = 125) and TCGA (n = 146) samples. Using in silico integrative analyses, a 194-gene set was derived that is highly prognostic in ILC (P = 1.20 × 10 −5)—we named this metagene ‘LobSig’. Assessing a 10-year follow-up period, LobSig outperformed the Nottingham Prognostic Index, PAM50 risk-of-recurrence (Prosigna), OncotypeDx, and Genomic Grade Index (MapQuantDx) in a stepwise, multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, particularly in grade 2 ILC cases (χ 2, P = 9.0 × 10 −6), which are difficult to prognosticate clinically. Importantly, LobSig status predicted outcome with 94.6% accuracy amongst cases classified as ‘moderate-risk’ according to Nottingham Prognostic Index in the METABRIC cohort. Network analysis identified few candidate pathways, though genesets related to proliferation were identified, and a LobSig-high phenotype was associated with the TCGA proliferative subtype (χ 2, P < 8.86 × 10 −4). ILC with a poor outcome as predicted by LobSig were enriched with mutations in ERBB2, ERBB3, TP53, AKT1 and ROS1. LobSig has the potential to be a clinically relevant prognostic signature and warrants further development.

### Clinical features and prognoses of patients with breast cancer who underwent surgery (...) [^399d68e7]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Multivariate analysis found that for patients with IDC, age, BCS, invasive tumor size, tumor grade, lymphovascular invasion, the number of lymph node metastases, distant metastasis, Ki67, and HR status were associated with OS, whereas invasive tumor size, tumor grade, LVI, the number of LNMs, HR status, and ERBB2 status were associated with DFS. After propensity score matching, BCS was equivalent to mastectomy with respect to survival in patients with IDC. The 5-year and 10-year OS rates were 92. 9% and
87. 4%, and the 5-year and 10-year DFS rates were 89. 0% and
82. 9%, respectively. For patients with stage III disease, the 5-year and 10-year OS rates were 82. 2% and
72. 8%, respectively, while the 5-year and 10-year DFS rates were 73. 4% and
64. 2%. For patients with stage IV disease, the 5-year and 10-year OS rates were 59.

6% and
41. 2%, respectively. Using the Cox regression model for multivariate survival analysis, age at diagnosis, invasive tumor size, grade 2/3 tumors, LVI, the number of LNMs, DM, and Ki67 were associated with worse OS. Conversely, BCS and HR-positive status were associated with better OS. Our study revealed that patients with DCIS, MIBC, MucC, ILC, and MedC had lower percentages of LVI, while patients with IMPC had higher percentages. Meanwhile, we also found that patients with DCIS, MIBC, and MucC had lower percentages of NI, while patients with ILC had higher percentages. Interestingly, a few patients with DCIS were found to have NI or DM, which is similar to previous studies. 28, 29.

### Clinicopathologic and genomic features of lobular like invasive mammary carcinoma: is it a distinct entity? [^76b669fb]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Pathological characteristics

A comparison of the pathologic features of LLIMCa, ILC, and IDC (Table 2) demonstrated that the mean tumor size of LLIMCas (1.9 cm) was intermediate between IDCs (1.55 cm, p < 0.012) and ILCs (2.7 cm, p < 0.0001). As a result, LLIMCas presented at a higher pT stage than IDCs but a lower pT stage than ILCs.

Table 2 
Comparison of pathological characteristics.

LLIMCa lobular-like invasive mammary carcinoma, ILC invasive lobular carcinoma, IDC invasive ductal carcinoma, LVSI lympho-vascular space invasion, LN lymph node, pT pathologic tumor stage, pN pathologic nodal stage. *Statistically significant, two-sided t -test is used to compare the tumor foci number and tumor size, and Chi-square and Fisher exact tests are used to compare the other pathological variables.

LLIMCas was more likely to have positive or close margins (37%) in the first surgical procedure compared to IDCs (19%, p = 0.003) but was similar to ILCs (35%, p = 0.261). LLIMCas were found to have a significantly higher rate of lymphovascular space invasion (27%) than ILCs (11%, p = 0.002) but were similar to IDCs (22%, p = 0.465). No differences in multifocality, number of tumor foci, tumor-associated calcifications, lymph node status, or pN stage were observed between any of the tumor types.

Within the group of nuclear grade 1 and 2 tumors, as designed in the current study, LLIMCas exhibited a higher Nottingham grade and score than IDCs and ILCs. A substantial number of IDC were Nottingham grade I (grade I: 46%, grade II: 54%) due to the presence of tubule formation, whereas LLIMCas (grade I: 7%, grade II: 93%, p < 0.0001) and ILCs (grade I: 18%, grade II: 82%, p < 0.0001) were more likely to be grade II due to the lack of tubules. Additionally, LLIMCas frequently had higher Nottingham grades and scores compared to ILCs (p = 0.005), owing to the larger nuclei and more frequent mitoses.

BCI is an independent prognostic factor beyond clinicopathologic parameters

Univariate analysis in the overall cohort showed that adjuvant chemotherapy, tumor size, tumor grade, nodal status, and BCI each provided significant prognostic information for overall 10-year DR rate, whereas age and adjuvant endocrine therapy did not. However, in the multivariate analysis, after adjusting for other significant prognostic factors identified in the univariate analysis, BCI remained the only significant and independent prognostic factor for overall 10-year DR rate (HR = 3.49; 95% CI, 1.28–9.54; P = 0.015; Table 2).

Table 2. 
Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis of prognostic performance of BCI for overall 10-year DR rate in the ILC cohort.

To further examine the additive prognostic value of BCI gene expression versus tumor size and grade, likelihood ratio statistics (ΔLR-χ 2) were calculated for the N0 and N+ subsets. As shown in Fig. 4, BCI gene expression was highly prognostic in both N0 (ΔLR-χ 2 = 6.28) and N+ (ΔLR-χ 2 = 6.82) patients. In the N0 subset, BCI was more prognostic than tumor size (ΔLR-χ 2 = 2.52), but not more than tumor grade (ΔLR-χ 2 = 7.74) or tumor size plus grade (ΔLR-χ 2 = 10.05). BCI added independent prognostic information to tumor grade, tumor size, and tumor size plus grade, and conversely, tumor grade and tumor size plus grade added independent prognostic information to BCI gene expression. In the N+ subset, BCI provided greater prognostic information versus tumor size (ΔLR-χ 2 = 0.02), grade (ΔLR-χ 2 = 2.10), or tumor size plus grade (ΔLR-χ 2 = 2.14), and added more prognostic information to tumor size and grade (ΔLR-χ 2 = 5.35) than these variables added to BCI (ΔLR-χ 2 = 0.67).

### Invasive lobular breast cancer: the prognostic impact of histopathological grade, E-cadherin and molecular subtypes [^fe48aa7c]. Histopathology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main finding in this study of a cohort of breast cancer patients with long-term follow-up was a significantly poorer prognosis for grade 2 ILC compared to grade 2 IDC. The prognosis for grade 2 ILC was comparable to that of grade 3 IDC. A similar pattern was observed when the analyses were restricted to tumours with positive prognostic marker profiles (ER +, HER2 − and Ki67 low). Furthermore, E-cad expression appeared to be a favourable prognostic marker in ILC.

In the Nottingham grading system gland formation, nuclear atypia/pleomorphism and mitosis counts are considered.However, because the morphological features of ILC differ from IDC, grade may have a different prognostic significance.This is an important discussion, because histopathological grade is one of several factors determining adjuvant therapy, whereas type is disregarded.

In agreement with others,,,there were few ILCs of grade 1 (7.8%) and grade 3 (6.9%) in this study, and the low numbers preclude survival analyses. Histopathological grading has been shown to be of independent prognostic value in ILC.However, the implications of grading in ILC may differ from IDC and its value as a prognostic tool must be considered in this light, particularly when determining treatment strategies.

ER, HER2 and Ki67 are important prognostic and/or predictive markers. In this study, the proportion of ILCs with a favourable marker profile was higher compared to IDC, implying a better prognosis for ILC. However, even when restricting analyses to cases with favourable marker profiles, a significantly poorer prognosis was found in ILC compared to IDC. HER2 + cases in ILC were few (Table 2), thus limiting its utility as a prognostic marker in ILC. Better prognostic markers for ILC are required.

Then, in an attempt to identify factors which may predict changes in the HER2 status between primary and recurrent tumours, we analysed clinical, pathological and immunohistochemical characteristics for patients with HER2-negative primary tumours who developed local recurrences compared to those with distant metastases. We found that basic pathological and immunohistochemical characteristics of primary tumours which gave rise to recurrences with a changed HER2 status were different between these two groups. Indeed, for patients who presented with distant metastases, HER2-negative tumours which relapsed as HER2-low more frequently expressed ER (94.8% versus 73.0% among tumours which relapsed without a change in the HER2 status; P = 0.001), had significantly lower proliferation indexes (3.1 ± 3.6/mm 2 versus 7.3 ± 9.6; P = 0.008) with lower mitosis scores (56.1% versus 35.6% with mitosis score I; P = 0.020) and lower Ki67 expression (28.7 ± 19.6% versus 32.8 ± 22.9%; P = 0.047). They also seemed to metastasise later (time to recurrence of 84.2 ± 49.8 versus 68.7 ± 51.1 months), but the trend was not statistically significant (P = 0.051). For HER2-low tumours which gave rise to HER2-negative recurrences, only one parameter was found to be different compared to tumours with a stable HER2 status (negative in the primary and in the recurrent tumour): a significantly higher Ki67 expression in the first tumour category (39.8 ± 20.2% versus 28.5 ± 17.1% for stable HER2-negative tumours; P = 0.037). Concerning local recurrences, HER2-negative tumours which gave rise to HER2-low recurrences relapsed significantly later than tumours with stable HER2 expression (101.3 ± 61.4 versus 66.9 ± 54.8 months; P = 0.013) and tended to appear in younger patients (52.4 ± 11.8 versus 60.8 ± 17.1 years), even though these differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.057). No significant differences were found between HER2-low tumours which relapsed as HER2-negative tumours and those which gave rise to recurrences with the same HER2 status (HER2-low). All these data are summarised in Table 4.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^80578294]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Adjuvant therapy for tumors of favorable histologies: The guidelines provide systemic treatment recommendations for favorable histology invasive breast cancers based on ER/PR status, tumor size, and ALN status, and if used the options for endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and sequencing with other modalities are similar to those for usual histology cancers. Rare subtypes of metaplastic carcinoma such as low-grade adenosquamous and low-grade fibromatosis-like carcinoma may have a favorable prognosis even without adjuvant systemic therapies. The vast majority of pure tubular, pure mucinous, and pure cribriform breast cancers are ER-positive and HER2-negative, and to be associated with favorable prognosis the histologic type should not be high grade, should be pure (>90% on surgical excision, not core biopsy alone), and should be HER-2 negative; if atypical pathologic or clinical features are present, consider treating as ductal/NST. The pathology evaluation and accuracy of ER and/or HER2 should be reviewed if results are ER-negative and/or HER2-positive, or if a tumor with ER- and PR-negative status is grade 1, and if a pure tubular or mucinous cancer is confirmed ER-negative it should be treated according to the usual histology, ER-negative guideline.

### The incidence of discordant clinical and genomic risk in patients with invasive lobular or ductal carcinoma of the breast: a national cancer database study [^f2ded5f7]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Given the propensity for ILC to present at later stages and have molecular low risk by standard assays, we hypothesized that patients with ILC are more likely to fall into the discordant risk category of “clinical high/genomic low” compared to patients with hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor-2 receptor (HER2) negative IDC. Therefore, we had three objectives in this study: (1) to establish whether patients with ILC are more likely to have discordant clinical and genomic risk compared to patients with IDC, (2) to determine whether rates of chemotherapy use differ by histologic status among those with discordant risk, and (3) to evaluate potential differences in overall survival (OS) by histology and treatment type in those with discordant risk.

### Presence of lobular carcinoma in situ does not increase local recurrence in patients treated with breast-conserving therapy [^01e66602]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is known to be a risk factor for the development of invasive breast cancer. Debate continues as to whether LCIS is also a precursor lesion. We hypothesized that, if LCIS were a precursor, its presence in the lumpectomy specimen, particularly at the margin, could increase local recurrence (LR) after breast-conserving therapy (BCT).

Methods

2894 patients treated with BCT for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), stage I or II breast cancer between 1/80 and 5/07 were identified. Patients with DCIS or invasive cancer at the margins or those receiving neoadjuvant therapy were excluded. Group A had 290 patients with LCIS in the lumpectomy; 84 had LCIS at the final margin. Group B included 2604 patients with no evidence of LCIS.

Results

Median patient age in group A and B was 57 and 58 years, respectively (P = 0.05); 12% and 13%, respectively, of patients in group A and B had margins <2 mm (P = NS). The histologic distribution of tumor types in group A was lobular in 47.2%, ductal in 34.5%, DCIS in 11.4%, and other invasive histologies in 6.9%, compared with 4.1%, 76.3%,13.6%, and 6.0% for group B, respectively (P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between the groups in tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. The crude rate of LR was 4.5% in group A and 3.8% in group B (P = NS). Five- and 10-year actuarial LR rates for LCIS at the margin were 6% and 6%, 1% and 15% for LCIS present but not at the margin, and 2% and 6% for no LCIS (P = NS), for group A and B, respectively. In multivariate analysis, menopausal status and adjuvant therapy use were significant predictors of LR. LCIS, either in the specimen or at the margin, was not significantly associated with LR.

Conclusion

Presence of LCIS, even at the margin, in BCT specimens does not have an impact on LR. Re-excision is not indicated if LCIS is present or close to margin surfaces. These findings do not support consideration of LCIS as a precursor to the development of invasive lesions.

### Clinical characteristics and survival outcomes of metastatic invasive lobular and ductal carcinoma [^fe35596a]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Comparing the clinical and molecular features of metastatic invasive lobular carcinoma (mILC) and metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma (mIDC) is essential to enhance understanding of breast cancer biology and improve personalized treatment approaches.

Objective

To compare mILC and mIDC in terms of survival outcomes and to investigate the association of clinicopathologic characteristics with those outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included adult patients at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center with their first metastatic diagnosis occurring between January 1997 and December 2020. Patient records were obtained from an institutional database. The study follow-up concluded in July 2023, and data were analyzed from July to December 2024.

Exposure

Diagnosis of mIDC and mILC.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and disease-free interval (DFI) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Survival distributions were compared using the log-rank test. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association of metastasis onset, estrogen receptor (ER) expression level, and tumor grade with OS and PFS.

Results

The analysis included a total of 9714 patients (9628 women [99%]), 8535 with mIDC and 1179 with mILC. The median age at metastasis was 53.3 years (range, 17.6-62.0 years). Generally, patients with mILC were older and had lower nuclear grade tumors and fewer metastasis sites than patients with mIDC. Patients with mILC had longer PFS (median, 0.65 years; 95% CI, 0.58-0.74) than patients with mIDC (median, 0.46 years; 95% CI, 0.45-0.48) (hazard ratio [HR],0.78; 95% CI, 0.73-0.84; P<.001). For OS, patients with mILC had longer OS (median, 3.06 years; 95% CI, 2.87-3.29) than patients with mIDC (median, 2.60 years; 95% CI, 2.52-2.67 years) (HR,0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.98; P=.01). Overall, patients with mILC had longer DFI than patients with mIDC (HR,0.69; 95% CI, 0.64-0.75; P<.001). At initial diagnosis, patients with mILC were less likely to present with visceral metastasis (522 patients [44.3%]) than patients with mIDC (4909 patients [57.5%]). A higher proportion of patients with mILC (931 patients [79.0%]) than patients with mIDC (5431 patients [63.6%]) had bone-only metastasis.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, patients with mILC had longer OS and PFS than those with mIDC. Metastasis onset, ER positivity, and tumor grade were associated with survival outcomes, and distinct metastatic patterns of mIDC and mILC were also associated with survival for mIDC and mILC, which may help guide more personalized treatment strategies for each subtype.

### Invasive lobular breast cancer: the prognostic impact of histopathological grade, E-cadherin and molecular subtypes [^e19546fc]. Histopathology (2015). Low credibility.

Prognostic value of E-cadherin

Table 3 shows that 23.3% of ILC were E-cad +. Figure 4 shows BCSS for grade 2 E-cad + and E-cad − ILC and IDC. E-cad − ILC had poorer prognosis than E-cad + ILC (P =0.005, log-rank test). Figure 5 shows examples of E-cad IHC staining. Table 7 shows that risk of death from breast cancer for ILC E-cad − was nearly twofold (HR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.32–2.89) compared to IDC E-cad +. There was no clear difference in prognosis between IDC E-cad +, IDC E-cad − and ILC E-cad +. Adjustment for age, stage and time-period did not influence the results.

### Clinical outcome in pleomorphic lobular carcinoma: a case-control study with comparison to classic invasive lobular carcinoma [^36248e07]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Pleomorphic lobular carcinoma (PLC), a variant of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is described as an aggressive tumor with poor prognosis. Multiple studies show lower overall survival for patients with PLC than for patients with classic ILC (cILC). We compared the clinicopathologic characteristics of PLC with those of cILC. All cases with a diagnosis of ILC, Nottingham grades 2 or 3 that were diagnosed between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2010, were retrieved from pathology files in the institutional anatomic pathology database. The cases (N = 52) were reviewed to identify those meeting the criteria for PLC. An E-cadherin immunostain was used to confirm the lobular immunophenotype. Clinicopathologic data were assessed and analyzed. A control group (N = 103) of cILC, Nottingham grade 1, was selected, with 2 controls for each case, matched by age and year of diagnosis. PLC was associated more closely with in situ carcinoma (P = .03), and had lower progesterone receptor expression (P = .03) than cILC. Both disease-free survival and overall survival were similar between patients with PLC and matched cILC controls, and both depended on disease stage, tumor size, and lymph node status. PLC is similar to cILC in terms of patient survival and outcomes.

### High rates of breast conservation for large ductal and lobular invasive carcinomas combining multimodality strategies [^68c53681]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

The literature reports low rates of breast conservation after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable breast cancers not amenable to initial breast-conserving surgery. This study aims to compare the outcome of lobular vs ductal carcinomas after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Between 1989 and 1999, 750 patients with clinical stage II/IIIA ductal (672) or lobular (78) invasive breast carcinomas were treated at the Institut Curie with primary anthracycline-based polychemotherapy followed by either breast conservation (surgery and/or radiotherapy) or mastectomy. Median follow-up was 10 years. Clinical response to primary chemotherapy was significantly worse for lobular than for ductal carcinomas (47 vs 60%; P=0.04), but only histological grade remained predictive in multivariate analysis. Breast conservation was high for both ductal and lobular carcinomas (65 and 54%; P=0.07), due, in part, to the use of radiotherapy, either exclusive or preoperative, for respectively 26 and 40% of patients. The lobular type had no adverse effect, neither on locoregional control nor on overall survival, even in the group of patients treated with breast conservation.

### Survival outcomes in premenopausal patients with invasive lobular carcinoma [^bffbc242]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The disparate prognostic implications between invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) have been demonstrated. However, information on premenopausal patients remains insufficient.

Objective

To examine long-term survival outcomes of ILC and IDC in premenopausal patients using national databases.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), Korean Breast Cancer Registry (KBCR), and Asan Medical Center Research (AMCR) databases to identify premenopausal patients with stage I to III ILC or IDC between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2015. The median follow-up time was 90 (IQR, 40-151) months in the SEER database, 94 (IQR, 65-131) months in the KBCR database, and 120 (IQR, 86-164) months in the AMCR database. Data were analyzed from January 1 to May 31, 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), which was analyzed according to histological type, and the annual hazard rate was evaluated. Survival rates were analyzed using a log-rank test and a Cox proportional hazards regression model with time-varying coefficients. Multivariable analysis was performed by adjusting for tumor characteristics and treatment factors.

Results

A total of 225 938 women diagnosed with IDC or ILC and younger than 50 years were identified. Mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 42.7(5.3) years in the SEER database, 41.8(5.5) years in the KBCR database, and 41.8(5.5) years in the AMCR database. In terms of race (available for the SEER database only), 12.4% of patients were Black, 76.1% were White, 11.0% were of other race (including American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander), and 0.5% were of unknown race). Patients with ILC had better BCSS in the first 10 years after diagnosis than those with IDC (hazard ratios [HRs], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.68-0.78] in the SEER database, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.91-1.58] in the KBCR database, and 0.50 [95% CI, 0.29-0.86] in the AMCR database), although BCSS was worse after year 10 (HRs, 1.80 [95% CI, 1.59-2.02] in the SEER database, 2.79 [95% CI, 1.32-5.88] in the KBCR database, and 2.23 [95% CI, 1.04-4.79] in the AMCR database). Similar trends were observed for hormone receptor-positive tumors (HRs, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.37-1.75] in the SEER database, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.01-5.10] in the KBCR database, and 2.12 [95% CI, 0.98-4.60] in the AMCR database). Considering the annual hazard model of BCSS, IDC events tended to decline steadily after peaking 5 years before diagnosis. However, the annual peak event of BCSS was observed 5 years after diagnosis for ILC, which subsequently remained constant.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that premenopausal women with ILC have worse BCSS estimates than those with IDC, which can be attributed to a higher late recurrence rate of ILC than that of IDC. Histological subtypes should be considered when determining the type and duration of endocrine therapy in premenopausal women.

### Prognostic utility of breast cancer index to stratify distant recurrence risk in invasive lobular carcinoma [^ec8aa35a]. Clinical Cancer Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Consistent with the distinct biological characteristics of ILC, there are notable differences between BCI risk stratification of patients with ILC versus IDC. Previous studies have shown that BCI stratified N0 IDC tumors into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups comprising approximately 55–60%, 25–30%, and 15–20% of patients, respectively. For patients with N+ IDC, BCI stratified ∼20% as low-risk and ∼80% as high-risk. In contrast, only two risk groups were classified by BCI in ILC in patients with both N0 and N+ tumors. Thus, BCI identifies two clinical entities in ILC: a low/intermediate-risk category consisting of 54% of patients and a high-risk category comprising 46% of patients. Importantly, findings from this study indicate that tumor biology and genomic classification provide increased resolution to prognostication of ILC, which is highly heterogenous and therefore likely requires individualized assessment of gene expression to accurately assess DR risk. Although nodal status showed correlation with BCI risk groups, in multivariate analysis, BCI remained the only significant independent prognostic factor for risk of DR.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) excision-alone considerations note that for patients treated with excision alone (no WBRT), regardless of margin width, there is a substantially higher rate of IBTR than with excision plus WBRT, even in predefined low-risk patients; although the optimal margin width for excision alone is unknown, it should be at least 2 mm, with some evidence suggesting improved IBTR with margin widths wider than 2 mm. For DCIS with microinvasion (DCIS-M), it is defined as an invasive focus 1 mm or smaller in size.

Classic lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) at lumpectomy margins—although there are no meta-analyses, multiple retrospective, single institution studies with follow-up of at least 5 years have shown that a positive or close margin with classic LCIS does not increase local recurrence risk, and based on these data, the decision to re-excise should be based on the margin status of the invasive cancer or DCIS and not the presence of classic LCIS at or close to a margin.

### LobSig is a multigene predictor of outcome in invasive lobular carcinoma [^7b38cb4c]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite clear biological and clinical differences, treatment of IC-NST and ILC remains the same. Prognostication is routinely performed using clinico-pathologic information; namely the Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI),which comprises tumor size, grade and lymph node status, and an IHC panel to evaluate ER, PR and HER2 (with or without Ki67, a marker of proliferation).Ostensibly, the molecular signature market for breast cancer is a busy space (reviewed in ref.), however the utility in ILC of some of the existing commercial tests remains to be seen, and uptake is by no means global. While most focus on ER+ tumors, notably, none of these signatures account for tumor morphology in their algorithms. The Genomic Grade Index (GGI/MapQuantDx™) panel has been shown to be more powerful than grade alone in the ILC population,while MammaPrint® has validated value only in node negative ILC patients.The clinical utility in ILC of the 21-gene signature, OncotypeDx®, remains unclear with two studies showing classification of 42%and 35.5%of patients as being as of intermediate risk (IR; managing the IR designated patient is clinically challenging) and further studies indicate limited additional value over histology.Prosigna® is the commercial diagnostic test based on the PAM50 ‘intrinsic’ subtyping. It generates a Risk of Recurrence score (ROR) and has a better prognostic value than that of the OncotypeDx test, in ER+ node negative patients.Again, the utility of Prosigna® in ILC specifically is unknown, and a recent study on its utility in breast histological special types excluded ILC.A recently reported five-transcript metagene, EarlyR, has shown prognostic power for recurrence-free survival over 8 years in ER+ tumors, however there is no discussion of histology.

Here, we present an integration of gene expression and copy number data to identify genes influencing ILC behavior and prognosis. Through this combination of approaches we have developed a 194 metagene signature, which we have termed LobSig, that could add significant prognostic power to the standard clinical information for patients with ILC.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated by BCS and whole breast radiation therapy (RT)—margin width and ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) risk indicate that a margin resection width of at least 2 mm is associated with reduced IBTR relative to narrower negative margins, while routine practice of obtaining margins >2 mm to further improve outcomes is not supported; when there is only minimal or focal DCIS near the margin, clinical judgment should be utilized to weigh risks of re-excision versus recurrence for the individual patient.

### Clinical benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy in oestrogen receptor-positive invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas [^6490e8f3]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

An important clinical benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy is clinical tumour response that leads to downstaging and smaller surgical resection volume (;). Tumour resection margins were more commonly positive or close (⩽2 mm) in ILC (19 vs 11%) and the rate of breast-conserving surgery was also lower (19 vs 34%). These differences in clinical benefit remained significant after adjusting for other clinical variables, including grade and tumour size. These observations are consistent with the majority of the literature that reports low rates of breast conservation therapy for patients with ILC following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (;). These results collectively indicate that clinical benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy in operable ER-positive ILC is less compared with ER-positive IDCs due to the inherently lower chemotherapy sensitivity of these cancers and their unique anatomical features, which make determination of cancer margins more difficult intraoperatively.

Our study is the largest report of outcomes of ILC subtype after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but there were some limitations. As a retrospective survey there was heterogeneity in our population, especially regarding chemotherapy regimens. Moreover, important variables, such as proliferation (i.e. Ki-67 staining), were not available. However, nuclear grade may be considered as a crude surrogate for proliferation activity.

However, a simple conclusion that ILC does not respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy would represent an oversimplification. Forty-one per cent of ILCs had lower tumour T stage compared with baseline after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. What further complicates clinical decision-making for patients with ILC is that clinical response rates over 50% have also been reported with the use of 3–6 months of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy alone (;;;;;). In addition, the majority of patients with ILC have a low or intermediate recurrence score (Oncotype DX, Redwood, CA, USA), which is associated with no or very modest benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in terms of improved survival (;;). Taking all this information together, it is reasonable to conclude that most patients with ILC are unlikely to derive substantial short-term clinical benefit (substantial tumour reduction with clear margins or pathological CR) from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, ILC may derive similar long-term survival benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy as ER-positive IDCs, but this benefit is likely to be modest.

### The incidence of discordant clinical and genomic risk in patients with invasive lobular or ductal carcinoma of the breast: a national cancer database study [^31414fe8]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

An important consideration in the interpretation of our findings is the use of OS as opposed to disease-free survival as the primary endpoint, as it is the only outcome available from the NCDB Participant User Files. Additionally, ILC and many HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors tend to recur beyond the first five years; as such, longer follow-up of these patients may yield different results with regards to the impact of chemotherapy on survival. It is possible that certain patients had differential access to molecular testing, leading to selection bias. For example, availability of molecular testing may have been limited in lower-resourced settings. We were lacking information regarding the type of chemotherapy or endocrine therapy administered, as well as duration of therapy. Finally, despite attempts to correct for the possibility of treatment selection bias, the retrospective nature of the NCDB limits the conclusions of these analyses. However, despite these limitations, our findings clearly show that patients with ILC are indeed significantly more likely to have discordant clinical and genomic risk. While the 70-gene signature has been shown to be independently prognostic in those with node-negative ILC, its predictive ability and the role of other prognosticators in node-positive ILC patients is unknown. The recent identification of several ILC gene classifiers suggest the possibility that a prognostic or predictive tool specific to ILC could be developed. Another possible explanation for increased rates of discordance is that clinical staging might need tailoring for ILC, given its different growth pattern.

In conclusion, our study demonstrated that patients with ILC are significantly more likely to have discordant clinical and genomic risk compared to those with IDC when stratified by the 70-gene signature. Given the current active investigation into the best treatment strategy for patients with discordant risk profiles, histology-specific analyses of ongoing trials as well as further investigation into ILC specific prognostic and predictive tools are warranted.

### Prognosis and treatment of patients with breast tumors of one centimeter or less and negative axillary lymph nodes [^45ca6049]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Uncertainty about prognosis and treatment of axillary lymph node-negative patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative or ER-positive invasive breast tumors of 1 cm or less prompted the analysis of data from five National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project randomized clinical trials.

Methods

Two hundred thirty-five patients with ER-negative tumors and 1024 patients with ER-positive tumors were identified in these trials. Patients with ER-negative tumors received surgery alone or surgery and chemotherapy. Patients with ER-positive tumors received surgery alone; surgery and tamoxifen; or surgery, tamoxifen, and chemotherapy. End points were relapse-free survival (RFS), event-free survival, and overall survival. A result was considered to be statistically significant with a P value of.05 or less; all statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

The 8-year RFS of women with ER-negative tumors who received surgery alone or with chemotherapy was 81% and 90%, respectively (P = .06). Survival was similar in both groups (93% and 91%; P = .65). The 8-year RFS of women with ER-positive tumors was 86% after surgery alone, 93% when tamoxifen was added (P = .01), and 95% after the addition of tamoxifen and chemotherapy (P = .07 compared with tamoxifen). Survival in the three groups was 90%, 92% (P = .41), and 97%, respectively. The difference between the latter two groups was significant (P = .01). Regardless of ER status or treatment, overall mortality was 8%; one half of the deaths were related to breast cancer. Several covariates affected the risk of recurrence in ER-negative and ER-positive patients. Risk was greater in women with tumors of 1 cm than in those with tumors of less than 1 cm, in women aged 49 years or younger than in those aged 50 years or older, and in women with infiltrating ductal or lobular carcinoma than in those with other histologic tumor types.

Conclusions

Chemotherapy and/or tamoxifen should be considered for the treatment of women with ER-negative or ER-positive tumors of 1 cm or less and negative axillary lymph nodes.

### Tumor size and survival in breast cancer – a reappraisal [^18ae5753]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2010). Medium credibility.

The size of a breast cancer at diagnosis has conventionally been thought of as a fundamental and critical determinant of clinical outcome. However, the tendency of some subtypes of breast cancer to behave aggressively, despite being small (</=1 cm in diameter), questions the premise that cancer size should always be considered in treatment decisions. Although there is an association between tumor size and lymph-node involvement for most tumor types, this pattern is not invariable. We speculate that the uncoupling of tumor size, lymph-node status and prognosis in some subtypes of breast cancers might reflect an underlying disproportionate relationship between the number of cancer cells with metastatic potential and the size of the cancer. Alternatively, some small cancers might harbor cells that are inherently aggressive and are likely to metastasize. These observations have implications for the screening and treatment of breast cancers, particularly for women with basal-like and BRCA1-related breast cancers.

### Immunological subtypes in breast cancer are prognostic for invasive ductal but not for invasive lobular breast carcinoma [^45e25e9a]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

With regard to molecular subtype, no correlation was observed between tumour immune subtype and molecular subtype. Based on previous studies, we know that tumours overexpressing HER2 and basal-like tumours generally present with more aggressive clinical characteristics than Luminal A and Luminal B tumours (;). Our results confirm that tumour aggressiveness, as established by molecular subtypes of BC, is not dependent on a tumour's immunological profile. In addition, immunological profiling was found to be prognostic only for Luminal A tumours. Luminal A tumours make up the largest group of IDC. Therefore it is not surprising that these results show a similar prognostic association within the immune profiles.proposed that ILC is frequently strongly ER+, HER2−, and presents with low Ki67 expression, making it more likely to be characterised as a Luminal A molecular subtype. This finding may lead to the assumption that outcomes for molecular and histological subtypes are similar, but this was not confirmed in our analyses. This implies that a simple extrapolation cannot be made and that histological subtypes are presumably far more complex.

In this report we investigated the relationship of the clinical outcome of BC patients with immunological and histological profiles. Our results show that tumour immune biology differs greatly between IDC and ILC patients, confirming that ILC and IDC are completely different entities. Further studies are needed to validate these differences between IDC and ILC.

Ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion (DCIS-M)—margin definition states that DCIS-M is defined as an invasive focus ≤1 mm in size and should refer to the DCIS margin definition when considering the optimal margin width (>2 mm), given the lesion’s predominant DCIS characteristics and treatment patterns.

Future

This analysis showed that patients with ILC are affected disproportionately by discordance between clinical and genomic risk, whether genomic risk is measured by the 70-gene signature (from the authors’ prior work) or by the 21-gene RS (as in this analysis). Such discordance puts patients and providers in a challenging position, with clinical stage suggesting the need for cytotoxic treatment such as chemotherapy but molecular assays suggesting limited benefit. This issue is of particular concern for patients with ILC because multiple studies have suggested decreased responsiveness to chemotherapy in the non-metastatic setting. The ability to tailor care for patients with ILC will require addressing the many issues that result in this discordance, including improved methods of detection to prevent diagnosis at later stages that result in lower clinical risk, ILC-specific molecular assays that can more precisely identify the subset of patients who would benefit the most from chemotherapy, and targeted therapies that have higher efficacy than those currently available.

SSO–ASTRO–ASCO DCIS margins—evidence on margin width and ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) reports that a frequentist meta-analysis comparing thresholds of 2, 3 or 5, and 10 mm versus wider than 0 or 1 mm included 7883 patients with a median follow-up of 6.5 years and found ORs for IBTR of 0.51 (95% CI, 0.31 to 0.85; P = .01) for 2 mm, 0.42 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.97; P = .04) for 3 or 5 mm, and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.33 to 1.08; P = .09), with pairwise comparisons showing no significant differences among thresholds (all P > .40); predicted 10-year IBTR probabilities were 10.1% (95% CI, 6.3% to 16.0%) for 2-mm negative margins, 8.5% (95% CI, 3.6% to 18.9%) for 3- or 5-mm, and 11.7% (95% CI, 6.7% to 19.4%) for 10-mm margins, while a Bayesian network meta-analysis showed ORs versus positive margins of 0.45 (95% CrI, 0.32 to 0.61) for wider than 0 or 1 mm, 0.32 (95% CrI, 0.21 to 0.48) for 2 mm, 0.30 (95% CrI, 0.12 to 0.76) for 3 mm, and 0.32 (95% CrI, 0.19 to 0.49) for 10 mm, with adjustments not altering estimates and a relative OR of 0.99 (95% CrI, 0.61 to 1.64) between the 10- and 2-mm thresholds indicating no statistically meaningful difference; the 2‑mm threshold was chosen based on a statistically significant decrease in IBTR versus 0 or 1 mm (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.85; P = .01) and weak Bayesian evidence (relative OR, 0.72; 95% CrI, 0.47 to 1.08), and clinical judgment must be used for smaller negative margins (> 0 or 1 mm), with the conclusion that re-excision could be selectively employed with margins smaller than 2 mm.
