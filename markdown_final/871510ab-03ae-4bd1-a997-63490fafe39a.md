## Question

What is the role of ANA in monitoring disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are used to monitor disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between ANA as a screening test versus specific autoantibodies that track activity. Then, I should verify which serologies are actually included in validated disease activity indices. Next, I will review the evidence for serial anti-dsDNA testing and how to interpret changes. After that, I need to check guideline positions on ANA and anti-dsDNA in routine monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and caveats, including assay variability and cost-effectiveness considerations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate screening with monitoring. ANA is a broad screening test that detects antibodies to nuclear antigens and is highly sensitive but nonspecific for SLE, whereas anti–double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) is a specific subset of ANA that has been linked to disease activity, particularly renal involvement, and is the serologic component embedded in activity indices like SLEDAI-2K [^113bfRPo] [^116J72uE] [^11348V3X].

> Wait, let me verify the role of ANA itself in activity monitoring. I initially thought ANA titers might track activity, but hold on, that's not correct. ANA is not part of validated disease activity instruments and is not recommended for serial monitoring of established SLE, whereas anti-dsDNA and complement are the serologic anchors used in SLEDAI and in treat-to-target frameworks such as LLDAS, which require serologic activity assessment [^116J72uE] [^11348V3X].

> I need to check the evidence base for anti-dsDNA as an activity biomarker. Anti-dsDNA levels fluctuate with disease activity in many patients, correlate with lupus nephritis, and are mechanistically tied to immune complex–mediated inflammation and complement consumption, supporting their inclusion in activity indices and their clinical utility for longitudinal tracking in the right context [^111oqSXo] [^114xSzMZ] [^116J72uE].

> Next, I should review the large longitudinal datasets on serial anti-dsDNA. The SMART-SLE analyses of 37,582 visits in 3,484 patients showed that both the absolute anti-dsDNA ratio to the upper limit of normal and 2-fold changes in either direction independently predicted subsequent flares, including in persistently anti-dsDNA–positive patients, with adjusted hazard ratios around 1.3–1.6 depending on the metric and cohort, which strengthens the case for serial quantification in clinical practice [^115p1Tge] [^114KXFUs] [^115TKqvf].

> Hold on, I should verify how to interpret "volatility" of anti-dsDNA. The SMART-SLE team found that increases greater than 2-fold raised flare risk, but interestingly, decreases greater than 2-fold also signaled higher flare risk, possibly reflecting immune complex deposition and consumption or shifts in B cell activity. This means both upward and downward swings can be informative and should prompt closer clinical assessment rather than reflex treatment changes alone [^112C29Kv] [^114KXFUs].

> I will now examine how guidelines translate this into practice. The 2025 ACR SLE guideline conditionally recommends regular disease activity assessment and prefers SLEDAI for quantification, which inherently includes anti-dsDNA and complement; for lupus nephritis, the 2024 ACR LN guideline advises measuring anti-dsDNA and complement at every clinic visit (not more than monthly) to help detect activity changes, while recognizing their modest sensitivity/specificity and the need to integrate with clinical and urine data [^11413tUV] [^112JacDm] [^111iVaDB].

> But wait, what if the patient is persistently anti-dsDNA positive — does serial testing still help? The SMART-SLE data indicate yes. Even in persistently positive patients, absolute values above three times the upper limit of normal and 2-fold changes predict flares, so abandoning serial testing solely due to persistent positivity would discard actionable prognostic information, though the frequency should be individualized to disease phase and clinical status [^115p1Tge] [^114KXFUs].

> I should double-check assay and implementation issues before recommending routine serial testing. There is no gold standard for anti-dsDNA assays, and inter-assay variability complicates interpretation; harmonizing to a ratio of the upper limit of normal helps, and clinicians should avoid comparing results across different platforms, especially when assessing fold changes, to reduce misclassification of trends [^114xSzMZ] [^114Jighn].

> Let me consider cost-effectiveness and when to avoid unnecessary testing. Repeat ANA or broad ENA panels add little during established disease monitoring and can generate noise. Focusing serial testing on anti-dsDNA and complement in patients with a history of serologic–clinical concordance, and avoiding serology-only "treatment" of isolated lab changes, aligns with evidence and stewardship principles [^11348V3X] [^111iVaDB].

> Next, I should review complementary biomarkers and indices so I don't overstate anti-dsDNA. Complement C3/C4, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, and validated indices such as SLEDAI-2K and BILAG remain essential; anti-nucleosome antibodies may track activity in some cohorts but are not yet standard in guidelines, and anti-Sm titers, while specific, have not consistently tracked activity or treatment response in longitudinal analyses [^111iVaDB] [^112fZD2t] [^114mkVCZ].

> I need to ensure I address the ANA-negative SLE question. A small minority of patients are ANA-negative by modern criteria, and while they can still have active disease, their serologic monitoring strategy should emphasize anti-dsDNA and complement if positive, alongside clinical indices, recognizing that anti-dsDNA dynamics may be less informative if absent altogether [^116BFcgW] [^111iw6iF].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the practical approach. For established SLE, do not use serial ANA titers to monitor activity. Instead, monitor anti-dsDNA quantitatively and complement at clinically meaningful intervals, with higher frequency during active disease or nephritis and at least every 3–6 months in stable patients, interpreting absolute values and 2-fold changes in the context of SLEDAI/BILAG and organ-specific assessments to guide timely intervention without overtreating serology alone [^116J72uE] [^111iVaDB].

---

ANA testing is not useful for routine monitoring of SLE activity because it is a **nonspecific screening test** [^113bfRPo] that lacks correlation with disease activity or flares [^116J72uE]. Serial ANA testing is discouraged; instead, monitor **anti-dsDNA and complement (C3/C4)** [^1112SkoR] to assess activity, especially in lupus nephritis [^111iVaDB]. ANA may be positive in other autoimmune diseases and healthy individuals, so results must be interpreted in clinical context [^113bfRPo] [^117BEZ5q]. Use validated activity indices (SLEDAI, BILAG) [^11413tUV] and anti-dsDNA/complement to guide management, not ANA [^111iVaDB].

---

## Diagnostic role of ANA in SLE

- **High sensitivity**: ANA is positive in ~95% of SLE [^117S9Umx], making it a sensitive screening test [^117S9Umx].
- **Low specificity**: ANA is not specific to SLE and can be positive in other autoimmune diseases and healthy individuals [^117S9Umx] [^117BEZ5q].
- **Entry criterion**: The 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria require ANA positivity (≥ 1:80) as an entry criterion, underscoring its diagnostic importance [^1113unX5] [^114ZNfsX].

---

## Limitations of ANA in monitoring disease activity

- **Poor correlation**: ANA titers do not reliably correlate with disease activity or flares [^116J72uE].
- **Persistent positivity**: ANA often remains positive regardless of activity, limiting its utility for monitoring [^114t92Ww] [^11123ciQ].
- **Not in indices**: ANA is not included in validated activity indices (SLEDAI, BILAG), which rely on anti-dsDNA and complement [^116J72uE] [^1168bHWK].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize the **limited role of ANA** in monitoring SLE:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding ana monitoring** |
|-|-|
| American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2025 | - Regularly assess disease activity <br/> - Prefer SLEDAI or PGA <br/> - ANA not recommended for routine monitoring [^11413tUV] [^112JacDm] |
| British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) 2018 | - Monitor anti-dsDNA and complement <br/> - ANA not recommended for routine monitoring [^1122dK6A] |
| European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2020 | - Monitor anti-dsDNA and complement in lupus nephritis <br/> - ANA not recommended for routine monitoring [^1112SkoR] |

---

## Alternative biomarkers for monitoring disease activity

Given ANA's limitations, **alternative biomarkers** are recommended:

- **Anti-dsDNA antibodies**: Correlate with activity, especially lupus nephritis; serial testing is useful [^114xSzMZ] [^115p1Tge].
- **Complement levels (C3/C4)**: Reflect activity and immune complex formation; monitor serially [^1112SkoR] [^111iVaDB].
- **Validated indices**: SLEDAI and BILAG are preferred for standardized activity assessment [^11413tUV] [^112W8Ppb].

---

## Clinical scenarios where ANA testing may be useful

Although not for routine monitoring, **ANA testing may be useful** when:

- **Initial diagnosis**: Suspected SLE or new multisystem symptoms [^113bfRPo] [^117BEZ5q].
- **Classification**: Meeting EULAR/ACR criteria for research or trials [^112pyiZY] [^114ZNfsX].
- **Differential diagnosis**: Differentiating SLE from other autoimmune diseases [^113bfRPo] [^117BEZ5q].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

ANA is a sensitive screening tool for diagnosis but is **not useful for routine monitoring** of SLE activity because of low specificity and poor correlation with flares [^113bfRPo] [^116J72uE]. Clinicians should rely on anti-dsDNA, complement, and validated indices (SLEDAI, BILAG) to guide management [^11413tUV] [^1122dK6A].

### Differences in dynamics of specific antinuclear antibodies and their susceptibility to B cell-targeting treatment in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^112eJZT6]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In this study, we aimed to determine the dynamics of specific ANAs in patients with SLE. Firstly, we performed a retrospective observational study exploring the prevalence and seroconversion of ANAs over time in a very large cohort of patients with SLE. Subsequently, we analyzed ANA titer dynamics in a separate longitudinal SLE cohort and in patients with SLE who participated in clinical trials investigating B cell–targeted treatments. We used enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)–based titer determination for each specific ANA, allowing for more direct comparison of the degree of fluctuation of autoantibody levels. In the clinical trials, we analyzed ANA levels in response to treatment as well as their relationship with clinical outcomes.

### Refractory disease in systemic lupus erythematosus [^1155Z31N]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

There is no definition or guidelines for refractory disease (RD) in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). However, new therapies have been tested mainly in refractory patients. The concept, like the disease, is complex and implies deeper knowledge on the disease pathogenesis and patients' subsets. RD is not included in current activity indices of the disease, what raises the question of how are we monitoring its response to new drugs. In this paper, we analyse some concepts considered important for the global definition of RD in SLE and in some specific organ involvements, excluding lupus nephritis. Management issues will be addressed also. Finally, we review therapeutic options in particular subsets of the disease, namely, cutaneous, articular, haematological and neuropsychiatric lupus. Crucial to the management of a patient suspected to be refractory is an accurate diagnosis, assuring that the persistent clinical manifestations are derived primarily from SLE and not from a concomitant or alternative process. Likewise, certainty about the patient compliance with the therapy prescribed is a frequent unrecognized problem that erroneously might lead to a classification of RD. Therapy of RD for SLE, in general and in most particular involvements, is currently based mainly on the clinician's own experience and judgement, with few randomized trials effectively addressing the issue. In such a heterogeneous disease, consideration of approval of drugs for single-organ indications may pave the way for new therapies. Better biomarkers are needed to add accuracy to the currently used activity indices in order to monitor RD and consolidate its definition. Prospective studies directed to RD in the main SLE involvements are needed to improve our understanding on the management of the disease and foster the development of targeted new drugs.

### Anti-nucleosome antibodies outperform traditional biomarkers as longitudinal indicators of disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus [^112fZD2t]. Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine whether anti-nucleosome antibodies function as activity-specific biomarkers in SLE.

Methods

Fifty-one patients were recruited and followed prospectively with periodic clinical and biochemical assessments over a 14-month period. Disease activity was determined by the SLEDAI-2K. Anti-nucleosome antibody levels were measured by an ELISA and its utility as an activity-specific biomarker as compared with that of anti-dsDNA antibodies and C3 was assessed both at baseline and in longitudinal analysis.

Results

Anti-nucleosome antibodies were significantly elevated in SLE patients vs controls and showed a moderate positive correlation with disease activity. The utility of anti-nucleosome antibodies in identifying patients with active disease in a cross-sectional analysis was comparable to that of anti-dsDNA antibodies and C3. Analysis of variance demonstrated that the level of anti-nucleosome antibodies and C3 varied significantly with changes in disease activity over time. Changes in clinical state were not mirrored by changes in anti-dsDNA antibodies. In time-dependent analysis, anti-nucleosome antibodies showed a better fit over time than anti-dsDNA antibodies and C3. In pairwise comparisons, C3 and anti-nucleosome antibodies outperformed other models, including the conventional pairing of C3 and anti-dsDNA antibodies, however, no biomarker alone or as a group accurately predicted impending remissions or exacerbations.

Conclusion

Anti-nucleosome antibodies demonstrate greater fidelity as a biomarker for changes in SLE disease activity than traditional biomarkers, supporting the routine monitoring of this antibody in clinical practice.

### Conceptual framework for defining disease modification in systemic lupus erythematosus: a call for formal criteria [^115wdJZs]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Application of SLE-specific disease-modifying criteria

The disease modification definition for SLE could be applied to both clinical trials and clinical practice (with the notable difference that clinical trials include a comparison arm while clinical practice does not) using specific measures at year 1 to determine an impact on minimising disease activity with the fewest treatment-associated toxicities and at year 5 or later to evaluate slowing or preventing organ damage progression, with interim measures suggested for years 2–5 to determine whether an intervention is on track for achieving disease modification at the 5-year mark, as outlined in table 2.

Table 2
Proposed matrix for application of the SLE-specific disease modification criteria in clinical trials and clinical practice

The 1-year and 5-year timeframes were chosen to assess early markers and confirmed disease modification, respectively, based on thresholds for assessment of disease activity and organ damage in clinical trials and longitudinal studies. Examples of tools to be used to assess disease activity were provided, without specifying a single tool, to allow for evolution of this definition and how it can be assessed. A range of steroid thresholds are suggested to reflect the range recommended in treatment guidelines and criteria for remission and low disease activity state.

### New insights into the role of antinuclear antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus [^112DeUmt]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease characterized by antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) that form immune complexes that mediate pathogenesis by tissue deposition or cytokine induction. Some ANAs bind DNA or associated nucleosome proteins, whereas other ANAs bind protein components of complexes of RNA and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Levels of anti-DNA antibodies can fluctuate widely, unlike those of anti-RBP antibodies, which tend to be stable. Because anti-DNA antibody levels can reflect disease activity, repeat testing is common; by contrast, a single anti-RBP antibody determination is thought to suffice for clinical purposes. Experience from clinical trials of novel therapies has provided a new perspective on ANA expression during disease, as many patients with SLE are ANA negative at screening despite previously testing positive. Because trial results suggest that patients who are ANA negative might not respond to certain agents, screening strategies now involve ANA and anti-DNA antibody testing to identify patients with so-called 'active, autoantibody-positive SLE'. Evidence suggests that ANA responses can decrease over time because of the natural history of disease or the effects of therapy. Together, these findings suggest that, during established disease, more regular serological testing could illuminate changes relevant to pathogenesis and disease status.

### Epigenetics and systemic lupus erythematosus: unmet needs [^1144xkPd]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic relapsing-remitting autoimmune disease affecting several organs. Although the management of lupus patients has improved in the last years, several aspects still remain challenging. More sensitive and specific biomarkers for an early diagnosis as well as for monitoring disease activity and tissue damage are needed. Genome-wide association and gene mapping studies have supported the genetic background for SLE susceptibility. However, the relatively modest risk association and the studies in twins have suggested a role for environmental and epigenetic factors, as well as genetic-epigenetic interaction. Accordingly, there is evidence that differences in DNA methylation, histone modifications, and miRNA profiling can be found in lupus patients versus normal subjects. Moreover, impaired DNA methylation on the inactive X-chromosome was suggested to explain, at least in part, the female prevalence of the disease. Epigenetic markers may be help in fulfilling the unmet needs for SLE by offering new diagnostic tools, new biomarkers for monitoring disease activity, or to better characterize patients with a silent clinical disease but with an active serology. Anti-DNA, anti-phospholipid, and anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies are thought to be pathogenic for glomerulonephritis, recurrent thrombosis and miscarriages, and neonatal lupus, respectively. However, tissue damage occurs occasionally or, in some patients, only in spite of the persistent presence of the antibodies. Preliminary studies suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may explain why the damage takes place in some patients only or at a given time.

### Development of quality indicators to evaluate the monitoring of SLE patients in routine clinical practice [^112egaNv]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

The assessment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients in routine clinical practice is mainly based on the experience of the treating physician. This carries the risk of unwanted variability. Variability may have an impact on the quality of care offered to SLE patients, thereby affecting outcomes. Recommendations represent systematically developed statements to help practitioners in reducing variability. However, major difficulties arise in the application of recommendations into clinical practice. In this respect, the use of quality indicators may raise the awareness among rheumatologists regarding potential deficiencies in services and improve the quality of health care. The aim of this study was to develop a set of quality indicators (QI) for SLE by translating into QIs the recently developed EULAR Recommendations for monitoring SLE patients in routine clinical practice and observational studies. Eleven QIs have been developed referring to the use of validated activity and damage indices in routine clinical practice, general evaluation of drug toxicity, evaluation of comorbidities, eye evaluation, laboratory assessment, evaluation of the presence of chronic viral infections, documentation of vaccination and of antibody testing at baseline. A disease specific set of quality assessment tools should help physicians deliver high quality of care across populations. Routine updates will be needed.

Methods

Study design, setting and participants

Data from the Asia Pacific Lupus Collaboration (APLC) cohort were used to conduct this study. This is a multi-country longitudinal registry of patient data collected prospectively across 25 sites in 13 countries. All patients met either the 1997 ACR Modified Classification Criteria or the 2012 SLICC Classification Criteria for SLE and provided written consent to be part of the APLC cohort. Each site obtained local ethics approval to participate in the APLC research activities. Storage of the central dataset and analyses of the pooled data have been approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (MUHREC Project ID 18778).

Data collection

Data were collected during routine visits for patient care via electronic point of care data entry or paper or electronic forms from 2013 until 2021. Baseline data collected included age, duration of SLE, sex, ethnicity, baseline serology and comorbidities. At each visit SLEDAI-2K, physician global assessment (PGA, measured 0–3), medication information and pathology results including serology were collected. Only visits where an anti-dsDNA result was available were included in analysis, and only patients who had at least two such visits were included. Flares were routinely captured at each visit using the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment–SLEDAI flare index (SFI). This captures flare using a composite of the following: (i) increases of at least 3 points in the SELENA-SLEDAI disease activity instrument, (ii) other new or worsening activity, medication changes and hospitalization not been captured in the SELENA-SLEDAI, and (iii) an increase in the physician's global assessment (visual analogue scale) ≥ 1.0. The severity of flare was captured as previously defined by Petri et al. Damage accrual was recorded at baseline and annually using the SLICC-ACR Damage Index (SDI). Patients were categorized based on their anti-dsDNA results into three cohorts: persistently negative (patients who never had anti-dsDNA values above upper limit of normal range), fluctuating (anti-dsDNA results varying between negative and positive) and persistently positive (patients who always had anti-dsDNA results above upper limit of normal range).

### Incomplete systemic lupus erythematosus: what remains after application of American College of Rheumatology and systemic lupus international collaborating clinics criteria? [^111zBp8Y]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by formation of antinuclear autoantibodies (ANAs) and is known to have a wide range of clinical features 1. The judgment of experienced physicians is generally accepted as the gold standard for the diagnosis of SLE; however, especially for research aims, accurate disease classification is important to create comparable, consistent study groups. For that purpose, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for SLE were proposed 2, 3. A patient is classified as having SLE when 4 of 11 cumulative clinical and immunologic ACR criteria are met (Table 1) (3). In order to increase sensitivity, the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) more recently composed new criteria that were validated in 2012 4 (Table 1). The most important differences between the ACR 1997 criteria and the SLICC 2012 criteria include the merging of criteria for subacute or acute cutaneous lupus and photosensitivity and addition of alternative forms of chronic cutaneous lupus; the addition of nonscarring alopecia as a clinical criterion; the redefinition of arthritis; the redefinition of the hematologic criteria; the separation and extension of immunologic criteria; the allowance of biopsy‐confirmed lupus nephritis in the presence of ANAs or anti–double‐stranded DNA (anti‐dsDNA) to be sufficient for classification of SLE; and the requirement of at least 1 immunologic and 1 clinical criterion for SLE classification. Currently, new classification criteria for SLE are under review by a ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) collaboration 5.

### Serum soluble nucleosome and the broad family of antinucleosome antibodies are associated with organ and tissue damage in systemic lupus erythematosus in a Chinese population [^114vkKAk]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Nucleosomes and the broad family of antinucleosome antibodies (ANAs; anti-double-stranded DNA, antihistone and antinucleosome antibodies) may contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We collected clinical information on 90 patients with SLE and 73 healthy volunteers and measured serum levels of the ANA family using a double-sandwich ELISA. The results showed that the levels of serum nucleosomes of patients with SLE was significantly lower and the levels of ANA were significantly higher than healthy controls. Negative correlations between serum nucleosomes and ANA, and positive correlations between individual ANAs were found. Patients with SLE with positive ANA had a significantly higher frequency of renal disorders than those with negative ANA. Determination of serum nucleosomes and ANAs contributes to SLE monitoring.

### Anti-DNA antibodies – quintessential biomarkers of SLE [^114xSzMZ]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibodies that recognize and bind to DNA (anti-DNA antibodies) are serological hallmarks of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and key markers for diagnosis and disease activity. In addition to common use in the clinic, anti-DNA antibody testing now also determines eligibility for clinical trials, raising important questions about the nature of the antibody-antigen interaction. At present, no 'gold standard' for serological assessment exists, and anti-DNA antibody binding can be measured with a variety of assay formats, which differ in the nature of the DNA substrates and in the conditions for binding and detection of antibodies. A mechanism called monogamous bivalency — in which high avidity results from simultaneous interaction of IgG Fab sites with a single polynucleotide chain — determines anti-DNA antibody binding; this mechanism might affect antibody detection in different assay formats. Although anti-DNA antibodies can promote pathogenesis by depositing in the kidney or driving cytokine production, they are not all alike, pathologically, and anti-DNA antibody expression does not necessarily correlate with active disease. Levels of anti-DNA antibodies in patients with SLE can vary over time, distinguishing anti-DNA antibodies from other pathogenic antinuclear antibodies. Elucidation of the binding specificities and the pathogenic roles of anti-DNA antibodies in SLE should enable improvements in the design of informative assays for both clinical and research purposes.

Since the first systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) guidelines published by the American College of Rheumatology in 1999, accumulating data from observational and randomized-controlled studies, including the advent of biological agents, have stimulated the production of recommendations by various committees and task forces. Still, several areas relating to the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of SLE remain uncertain due to limited or inconclusive evidence, therefore emphasizing the role of expert consensus in reaching balanced and informative statements. This review outlines the most recent SLE recommendations highlighting key differences and important challenges that will also need to be considered in future updates.

### New classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus [^112pyiZY]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To compare the recently published European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for SLE with the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Centers (SLICC) criteria and the earlier ACR criteria, focusing on their key concepts.

Recent Findings

Although the SLICC criteria introduced numbers of new criteria items, the new EULAR/ACR criteria added only noninfectious fever, based on an early SLE cohort study and an SLE patient survey, and condensed hematological, mucocutaneous and neurological items. Whereas the SLICC criteria maintained the overall structure familiar from the ACR criteria, the EULAR /ACR criteria use antinuclear antibodies (ANA) as an obligatory entry criterion, have weighted criteria and group these in domains. Where the SLICC criteria greatly increased sensitivity, losing some specificity, the EULAR/ACR criteria increased specificity again, for excellent classification criteria performance.

Summary

Despite differences in structure and statistical performance, the EULAR/ACR and SLICC criteria agree on the importance of both immunological and clinical findings, on the high impact of lupus nephritis by histology, and on most clinical items.

### SMART-SLE: serology monitoring and repeat testing in systemic lupus erythematosus-an analysis of anti-double-stranded DNA monitoring [^11348V3X]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is a chronic autoimmune multisystem condition with a preponderance for affecting women of childbearing age. Higher disease activity, glucocorticoid exposure and increased numbers of flares have each been demonstrated to increase the risk of irreversible organ damage. Therefore, SLE patients require long term monitoring of disease activity in order to reduce the development of damage. Disease activity monitoring has been difficult to standardize given the heterogeneous nature of SLE; some patients have only mild manifestations with no evidence of damage, whereas others have severe disease with end stage organ damage. Monitoring patients using tools that predict flare is potentially of value to identify addressable risk factors for poor outcomes.

Several studies have sought to determine whether biomarkers can predict flare in SLE, including titres of autoantibodies to double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA). However, studies of flare prediction lack standardized methodology, and analyses of cross-sectional data have limited ability to guide strategies in the clinic. Furthermore, some patients are persistently serologically active, and the utility of repeating anti-dsDNA tests in this context is poorly understood, while a subgroup of SLE patients are clinically quiescent despite being serologically active, and fluctuations in anti-dsDNA and complement do not appear to predict flare in these patients. Lastly, providers use different assays to measure anti-dsDNA, thus encumbering standardization, monitoring and cross-referencing.

Despite these limitations, anti-dsDNA measurement is often performed repeatedly during SLE management. Widely used disease activity indices such as the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) require anti-dsDNA antibody test results to assign a score. Attainment of the lupus low disease activity state (LLDAS) has been demonstrated to reduce damage accrual in SLE, but SLEDAI is included in the definition of LLDAS, meaning serological testing is required to assess LLDAS attainment. As new treatments for SLE emerge, and treatment targets become part of routine practice, SLEDAI or other formal disease activity measurements may be required as part of reimbursed drug access, meaning the potential for a surge in the serial use of these tests, despite limited understanding about cost-effectiveness. We have recently reported very low utility of repeat testing for other common autoantibodies, anti-nuclear antibodies and extractable nuclear antibodies, albeit in the setting of diagnostic screening rather than monitoring of established disease. Should anti-dsDNA antibodies be serially tested in patients in whom the result is always positive?

### SMART-SLE: serology monitoring and repeat testing in systemic lupus erythematosus-an analysis of anti-double-stranded DNA monitoring [^111oDfzi]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

In univariable Cox regression analyses, disease activity and laboratory values at each visit were analysed to determine whether they predicted flare at the subsequent visit. To determine the association of anti-dsDNA as a continuous variable with risk of flare, two approaches were used: absolute value of anti-dsDNA ratio, and change in anti-dsDNA ratio from the previous visit, recorded as amplitude and direction.

The results of the Cox regression analyses of associations with flare for the whole cohort, including patients who were persistently anti-dsDNA negative, are shown in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, available at Rheumatology online. As the primary aim was to determine whether serial anti-dsDNA monitoring in patients who are persistently anti-dsDNA positive had utility, we focused on these patients. As an absolute value, anti-dsDNA ratio > 3 was significantly associated with an increased risk of flare at the subsequent visit in persistently anti-dsDNA positive patients (unadjusted HR [95% CI] 1.64 [1.40, 1.91], P < 0.001) (Table 4). In the persistently anti-dsDNA positive cohort, change in anti-dsDNA ratio of at least 2-fold in a positive or negative direction had an unadjusted HR (95% CI) for flare of 1.35 (1.09, 1.68) (P = 0.007) and 1.29 (1.05, 1.59) (P = 0.014), respectively (Table 4). An increase or decrease of < 2-fold did not predict flare.

### SMART-SLE: serology monitoring and repeat testing in systemic lupus erythematosus-an analysis of anti-double-stranded DNA monitoring [^114KXFUs]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Disease activity monitoring in SLE includes serial measurement of anti-double stranded-DNA (dsDNA) antibodies, but in patients who are persistently anti-dsDNA positive, the utility of repeated measurement is unclear. We investigated the usefulness of serial anti-dsDNA testing in predicting flare in SLE patients who are persistently anti-dsDNA positive.

Methods

Data were analysed from patients in a multinational longitudinal cohort with known anti-dsDNA results from 2013 to 2021. Patients were categorized based on their anti-dsDNA results as persistently negative, fluctuating or persistently positive. Cox regression models were used to examine longitudinal associations of anti-dsDNA results with flare.

Results

Data from 37582 visits of 3484 patients were analysed. Of the patients 1029 (29.5%) had persistently positive anti-dsDNA and 1195 (34.3%) had fluctuating results. Anti-dsDNA expressed as a ratio to the normal cut-off was associated with the risk of subsequent flare, including in the persistently positive cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.56; 95% CI: 1.30, 1.87; P < 0.001) and fluctuating cohort (adjusted HR 1.46; 95% CI: 1.28, 1.66), both for a ratio > 3. Both increases and decreases in anti-dsDNA more than 2-fold compared with the previous visit were associated with increased risk of flare in the fluctuating cohort (adjusted HR 1.33; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.65; P = 0.008) and the persistently positive cohort (adjusted HR 1.36; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.71; P = 0.009).

Conclusion

Absolute value and change in anti-dsDNA titres predict flares, including in persistently anti-dsDNA positive patients. This indicates that repeat monitoring of dsDNA has value in routine testing.

### Prognostic parameters for flare in systemic lupus erythematosus [^115bgLfS]. Rheumatology (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize prognostic parameters for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flares.

Methods

In a prospective study, 120 SLE patients attending our out-patient clinic were evaluated every 3 months for 2 yr. At every visit clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters were assessed and the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) was determined. A correlation analysis of the number of flares in the first year and SLEDAI as a marker of disease activity after 1 and 2 yr with several parameters determined at the start of the study was performed.

Results

Flares were predicted by erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P = 0.001), anaemia (P = 0.006) and lymphopenia (P = 0.005). The SLEDAI after 1 yr was predicted by the titre of antinuclear antibodies (P = 0.009), antibodies against double-stranded DNA (P = 0.007), lymphopenia (P = 0.007), anaemia (P = 0.0002) and SLEDAI determined at the start of the study (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Anaemia and lymphopenia predict both flares and SLEDAI within the next year of follow-up.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus biomarkers: the challenging quest [^113a6mQ1]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

SLE, a multisystem heterogeneous disease, is characterized by production of antibodies to cellular components, with activation of both the innate and the adaptive immune system. Decades of investigation of blood biomarkers has resulted in incremental improvements in the understanding of SLE. Owing to the heterogeneity of immune dysregulation, no single biomarker has emerged as a surrogate for disease activity or prediction of disease. Beyond identification of surrogate biomarkers, a multitude of clinical trials have sought to inhibit elevated SLE biomarkers for therapeutic benefit. Armed with new -omics technologies, the necessary yet daunting quest to identify better surrogate biomarkers and successful therapeutics for SLE continues with tenacity.

### Don't order ANA and other autoantibody testing on a child… [^114t92Ww]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

The ANA has a high sensitivity for only one disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, but has very poor specificity for systemic lupus erythematosus and every other rheumatic disease. Therefore, it is not useful or indicated as a general screen of autoimmunity. A positive ANA may occur secondary to polyclonal activation of the immune system following an infection, or it may be positive without any identifiable reason/disease in up to 32% of the population. Limiting patients on which to order ANA would reduce unnecessary physician visits and laboratory expenses, as well as parental anxiety. "Lupus panels" and other similar panels should also not be ordered without concerns for specific autoimmune disease. Additionally, since the ANA may always be positive and may fluctuate in titer, it is not recommended to retest it unless there is some new clinical concern.

### Antinuclear antibody testing for the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus [^113bfRPo]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune inflammatory condition that may involve multiple organ systems. Although the antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is positive in nearly every case of SLE, it is not specific for this disease and must be interpreted in the appropriate clinical context. Key features that warrant ANA testing include unexplained multisystem inflammatory disease, symmetric joint pain with inflammatory features, photosensitive rash, and cytopenias. ANA staining patterns and more specific autoantibody testing may be helpful in diagnosis of suspected SLE or ANA-associated disease. For patients with nonspecific symptoms, such as malaise and fatigue, ANA testing is of limited value.

### Evolution of disease burden over five years in a multicenter inception systemic lupus erythematosus cohort [^115iVass]. Arthritis Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

We describe disease activity, damage, and the accrual of key autoantibodies in an inception systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cohort.

Methods

The Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) International Research Network, comprising 27 centers from 11 countries, has followed an inception cohort of SLE patients yearly according to a standardized protocol. Of these patients, 298 were followed for a minimum of 5 years and constitute the study population. Disease activity was assessed using the SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) and damage was assessed using the SLICC/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI). Antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-DNA, and anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) levels and lupus anticoagulant were assessed yearly. Descriptive statistics were generated and repeated-measures general linear models were used to evaluate SLEDAI-2K and SDI over time between whites and nonwhites.

Results

Of the 298 patients, 87% were women, 55% were white, 12% were African American, 14% were Asian, 16% were Hispanic, and 2% were categorized as "other". At enrollment, the mean age was 35.3 years, the mean SLEDAI-2K score was 5.9, and the mean disease duration was 5.5 months. Mean SLEDAI-2K scores decreased in the first year and then remained low. SLEDAI-2K scores were significantly lower at each year in whites compared to nonwhites. Mean SDI scores increased progressively over 5 years; there was no significant difference between whites and nonwhites. As expected, ANA positivity was high and anti-DNA positivity was relatively low at enrollment, and both increased over 5 years. Although lupus anticoagulant increased slightly over 5 years, aCL positivity did not.

Conclusion

Disease activity in newly diagnosed patients decreases over their first 5 years, while damage increases. Antibody positivity ran variable courses over this period.

### Rheumatologic tests: a primer for family physicians [^117BEZ5q]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with a suspected connective tissue disorder should undergo serologic testing to confirm the diagnosis and, in some cases, to monitor disease activity and predict flares. Patients with suspected systemic lupus erythematosus should be tested for antinuclear antibodies. However, antinuclear antibodies are not specific and may be present in many other connective tissue disorders and nonrheumatologic diseases. Thus, patients with suspected systemic lupus erythematosus should undergo further testing to confirm the diagnosis. Patients with Sjögren syndrome may have a positive antinuclear antibody titer, but often also have positive anti-Sjögren antigen A or B results. Similarly, antinuclear antibodies can be present in patients with scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disease, and dermatomyositis or polymyositis. Additional tests are needed to help confirm the diagnosis. In patients with findings of rheumatoid arthritis, a positive rheumatoid factor titer suggests the diagnosis, but as with antinuclear antibodies, it is not specific and can occur in other conditions. Rheumatoid factor can also be negative in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A positive anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody titer is more specific for rheumatoid arthritis and can help confirm the diagnosis. Physicians should order these serologic tests only when patients have a high pretest probability of a specific connective tissue disorder.

### Biomarkers in connective tissue diseases [^113dHKEJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Autoimmune connective tissue diseases are clinically variable, making biomarkers desirable for assessing future disease risk, supporting early and accurate diagnosis, monitoring disease activity and progression, selecting therapeutics, and assessing treatment response. Because of their correlations with specific clinical characteristics and often with disease progression, autoantibodies and other soluble mediators are considered potential biomarkers. Additional biomarkers might reflect downstream pathologic processes or appear because of ongoing inflammation and damage. Because of overlap between diseases, some biomarkers have limited specificity for a single autoimmune connective tissue disease. This review describes select current biomarkers that aid in the diagnosis and treatment of several major systemic autoimmune connective tissue disorders: systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides. Newly proposed biomarkers that target various stages in disease onset or progression are also discussed. Newer approaches to overcome the diversity observed in patients with these diseases and to facilitate personalized disease monitoring and treatment are also addressed.

Diagnostic criteria and clinical course

SLE may involve any of the vital organs. Not surprisingly, it has very diverse clinical manifestations ranging from fatigue and mild skin rash to end-stage renal failure. The diagnostic criteria also reflect this diversity. The Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) group has recently published a set of classification criteria. This set includes 11 clinical criteria related to cutaneous, mucosal, serous, renal, neurological and haematological involvement, and 6 immunological criteria including the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), anti-Smith (anti-Sm) and antiphospholipid antibodies, a direct Coombs' test (in the absence of haemolytic anaemia) and low levels of complement.SLE diagnostic criteria are met if a patient has four or more criteria (at least one clinical and one immunological) or a biopsy-proven nephritis compatible with lupus in the presence of ANA or anti-dsDNA.

The clinical course of SLE is characterised by spontaneous or treatment-induced remissions and relapses. Disease activity is assessed by evaluating clinical manifestations, such as the number and type of skin lesions, or arthritis, together with laboratory and immunological tests, including complete blood count, serum complement levels and titres of anti-dsDNA. However, several indices have been developed for more sensitive and accurate monitoring of disease. The 2008 EULAR (The European League Against Rheumatism) recommendations suggest that at least one of the following indices should be used to monitor disease activity: the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment (SELENA)–SLEDAI, the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) index, the European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement or the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure. In addition, the assessment of patients' health status can be performed with health-related quality of life measures, such as the 36-item short form health survey (SF-36), or the more lupus specific LupusQoL.

### Assessment of SLE activity for acute clinical decision-making: use of a colour-coded threat-level approach for the non-rheumatologist [^114fXTaa]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

SLE activity indices are useful in clinical monitoring of patients to identify those most at risk of adverse outcomes, to help guide management decisions, to determine the urgency of treatment and to evaluate response to such treatment. They can be used to assess the disease longitudinally, document patterns of disease and outcomes and record the attainment of low lupus disease activity state, which is emerging as a reasonable therapeutic target.

SLE activity indices are typically applied in clinical trials and in specialist centres. They are often not used as part of usual care in busy clinical practices or by non-specialist medical practitioners. In small island developing states such as the islands of the Caribbean, there is a dearth of rheumatologists in spite of the high prevalence of SLE, and there are resource limitations which challenge the use of the most commonly applied disease activity indices. The Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index score may not accurately reflect disease severity, and some clinical manifestations of SLE are not represented. Additionally, some laboratory tests, for example, complements and anti-dsDNA titre, are not available in all clinical settings. The British Isles Lupus Assessment Group Index is complicated, requiring some training and experience. The Lupus Foundation of America Rapid Evaluation of Activity in Lupus clinician-reported outcome was developed to be an accurate and practical measure but has not yet been assessed when used by non-specialists.

### Canadian Rheumatology Association recommendations for the assessment and monitoring of systemic lupus erythematosus [^114ncbCV]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop recommendations for the assessment of people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Canada.

Methods

Recommendations were developed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. The Canadian SLE Working Group (panel of Canadian rheumatologists and a patient representative from Canadian Arthritis Patient Alliance) was created. Questions for recommendation development were identified based on the results of a previous survey of SLE practice patterns of members of the Canadian Rheumatology Association. Systematic literature reviews of randomized trials and observational studies were conducted. Evidence to Decision tables were prepared and presented to the panel at 2 face-to-face meetings and online.

Results

There are 15 recommendations for assessing and monitoring SLE, with varying applicability to adult and pediatric patients. Three recommendations focus on diagnosis, disease activity, and damage assessment, suggesting the use of a validated disease activity score per visit and annual damage score. Strong recommendations were made for cardiovascular risk assessment and measuring anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies in the peripartum period and conditional recommendations for osteoporosis and osteonecrosis. Two conditional recommendations were made for peripartum assessments, 1 for cervical cancer screening and 2 for hepatitis B and C screening. A strong recommendation was made for annual influenza vaccination.

Conclusion

These are considered the first guidelines using the GRADE method for the monitoring of SLE. Existing evidence is largely of low to moderate quality, resulting in more conditional than strong recommendations. Additional rigorous studies and special attention to pediatric SLE populations and patient preferences are needed.

### ANA as an entry criterion for the classification of SLE [^114XjZ9i]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease with highly variable clinical and immunological manifestations. In the classification of patients with this condition, the presence of an antinuclear antibody (ANA) is an important element, with new criteria from the American College of Rheumatology and European League against Rheumatism positioning ANA positivity by an immunofluorescence assay on HEp2-cells (HEp2-IFA) or by an equivalent solid phase assay as the entry criterion. This positioning is based on assumptions about the frequency of ANA positivity in SLE as well as the reliability of the assays. Studies indicate that these assumptions are still a matter of uncertainty since both types of assay show considerable variability and patients with SLE may display negative results in ANA testing. These findings suggest caution in positioning ANA positivity as an entry criterion for classification and point to the value of alternative serological approaches for ANA determinations.

### Autoantibody-positive healthy individuals display unique immune profiles that may regulate autoimmunity [^115XJMU8]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are detected in almost one‐fifth of the general population, yet few individuals are diagnosed as having an autoimmune disease 1, 2. Thus, a substantial percentage of the population carries detectable levels of circulating autoantibodies without developing clinical symptoms. Autoantibodies are also present in the sera of patients with systemic autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), many years before clinical disease onset 3, 4. Although some ANA‐positive healthy individuals eventually develop clinical autoimmunity, many do not. The transition to clinical SLE has been correlated with autoantibody profiles combined with female sex, but other risk factors, including age, ANA titer, number of autoantibody specificities, and type I interferon (IFN) signature, do not definitively identify ANA‐positive healthy individuals in whom autoimmune disease develops eventually 5, 6, 7, 8. Comparing ANA‐positive healthy individuals with SLE patients and ANA‐negative healthy controls provides a unique perspective in the dissection of pathogenic mechanisms in autoimmunity and may reveal the means to provide regulatory control.

A delicate balance of inflammatory and regulatory immune cells is required to control infection without promoting autoreactivity. Evolving work has suggested that interactions between both the adaptive and innate immune systems are critical for autoimmune disease pathogenesis 9, 10, 11, 12. For example, IFN‐associated gene signatures are elevated in peripheral blood of SLE patients and correlate with increased disease activity 13, 14, 15, 16. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) are a primary source of type I IFN in SLE 17, 18 and produce type I IFN upon Toll‐like receptor (TLR) stimulation, particularly TLR‐7 and TLR‐9. These receptors may be activated by immune complexes containing double‐stranded DNA (dsDNA) and/or RNA‐associated binding proteins in SLE 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. The IFN signature in SLE is detected in leukocytes involved in both innate and adaptive immunity, such as B cells, T cells, neutrophils, and myeloid cells. However, whether ANA‐positive healthy individuals have a heightened IFN response remains unknown 15, 16.

### Recommendations for the use of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies in the diagnosis and follow-up of systemic lupus erythematosus – A proposal from an expert panel [^112Vfhrv]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Anti-dsDNA autoantibodies are listed as one of the classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and are relatively effective indicators for monitoring disease activity and treatment response. Therefore, clinicians rely on them to diagnose and adjust medication and treatment strategies for SLE patients. However, the use of anti-dsDNA antibodies is not free from controversy. Part of this controversy stems from the fact that anti-dsDNA antibodies are found in several disorders, besides SLE. In addition to this, anti-dsDNA antibodies are a heterogeneous group of antibodies, and their determination still lacks proper standardization. Moreover, anti-dsDNA testing specificity and diagnostic performance change depending on the population under study. These and other issues result in inconsistency and encumber the clinical use of anti-dsDNA antibodies. A panel of medical laboratory and clinical experts on SLE discussed such issues based on their clinical experience in a first meeting, establishing a series of recommendations. The proceedings of this first meeting, plus an exhaustive review of the literature, were used to compose a paper draft. The panel subsequently discussed and refined this draft in a second meeting, the result of which is this paper. This document is relevant to clinical laboratories as it guides to improving diagnosis and monitoring of SLE. Simultaneously, it will help laboratories compile more informative reports, not limited to a mere number. It is also relevant to clinical doctors who wish to better understand laboratory methods so that they can do a more efficient, better-aimed laboratory test ordering.

### Cell-bound complement activation products in SLE [^116J72uE]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Numerous instruments have been developed and validated to assess SLE disease activity and organ damage. The most commonly used instruments are SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), of which several versions have been developed; the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM); the European Consensus Lupus Activity Measure (ECLAM); the British Isle Lupus Assessment Group Index (BILAG); and the SLICC/ACR Damage Index (SDI) for SLE. In addition to these instruments, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) could offer a pragmatic quantitative measure of patient well-being over time. The patient perspective is increasingly recognised to be important, and numerous PROMs, some specific for lupus and some generic, have been developed and are being used in clinical studies. Although the importance of monitoring disease activity over time is also well recognised in clinical practice, disease activity instruments have limitations, including no change in the overall score when some manifestations improve and others worsen, and that a similar score in different patients may result from involvement of different organs. In addition, the use of SLE indices requires training to complete and interpret accurately, and these instruments are not routinely used in most clinical settings. ANA testing is not useful for monitoring SLE disease activityand, in fact, is not part of disease activity indices. Conversely, anti-dsDNA antibodies have been shown in some studies to correlate with disease activity and kidney involvement; however, conflicting results have been reported. Also complement protein levels are included in disease activity instruments; however, the limitations discussed in the next section render these markers suboptimal. It follows that better biomarkers are needed as an objective means to monitor disease activity.

### Sensitivity of classification criteria from time of diagnosis in an incident systemic lupus erythematosus cohort: a population-based study from Norway [^115UcQLh]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex, heterogeneous autoimmune disease, with partly overlapping phenotypes that evolve from disease onset and undergo multiple changes across the course of the disease. Immune complexes containing autoantibodies is a hallmark of the disease and compiled data from the recent international SLE classification project (detailed below) showed that 98% of patients scored positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) by standardised indirect immunofluorescence testing. While the presence of additional, more specific autoantibodies binding double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), Smith ribonucleoprotein (anti-Sm) and membrane phospholipids (anti-PL) makes the diagnosis more likely, they are never more than diagnostic aids.

In SLE, the immune-mediated inflammation has destructive potential. Thus, if the disease is left untreated, targeted organs are at high risk of structural damage and loss of function. This implies that diagnostic delay, with the thwarted start-up of immune-suppressive therapies, is critical to avoid, as it may result in a situation where the patient already at time of diagnosis has severe, and sometimes irreversible, damage in one or more organ systems. Moreover, there is evidence that delayed diagnosis may increase the likeliness of persistent disease activity and flares, which has an impact on disease burden, damage accrual and mortality.

In the absence of diagnostic criteria, the current 'gold-standard' case definition for SLE and the basic eligibility criterion for all types of SLE research (including studies of early SLE), is 'diagnosis confirmed by expert clinical assessment'. However, this case definition is liable to bias, thus the case definition for research must be accompanied by classification criteria to secure homogeneity and comparability. Requiring high specificity, classification, in general, comes with the risk of low sensitivity. Accordingly, classification may exclude a significant proportion of patients, for example, from testing of new treatments in clinical trials.

Reflecting the need for better representation of SLE patients in clinical trials, it was an expressed ambition of the 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology/American College of Rheumatology (EULAR/ACR) classification criteria to increase sensitivity, especially for patients with early disease, compared with the 1997 ACR criteria. This consequently accommodates inclusion earlier in the disease course to trials on newer treatments. Moreover, the new criteria were constructed as an additive scoring system, and as proposed when the criteria were launched, recent studies have linked higher scores to a more severe disease progression and higher risk of organ damage.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus classification and diagnosis [^116BFcgW]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Since the European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology 2019 classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were published, they were externally validated by groups worldwide. In particular, the new criteria worked well also in East Asian and pediatric cohorts. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) as an entry criterion were critically discussed, but the group of ANA-negative patients is small (< 5%) worldwide. Specificity of the criteria is dependent on correct attribution only of those criteria that are not better explained by other causes. Although the classification criteria should not be used for diagnosis, many novel aspects inform diagnostic considerations.

### Role of specialty care in the management of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^111rYTwq]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the role of rheumatologists in the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Methods

The lupus clinic database was searched for patients with 3 consecutive visits (every 3–4 months) of which the first 2 visits recorded a SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) of 0. The clinic notes were examined by a physician blinded to the SLEDAI score at the third visit. The physician classified the rheumatologist's action by the following scale: 1 = no change, 2 = closer followup, 3 = new investigations, 4 = increase medications, 5 = lower medications. All interventions (2–5) were further scored as being related to or independent of SLE.

Results

Of the 142 SLE patients identified, 70 patients remained inactive (SLEDAI = 0) and 72 patients experienced flare (SLEDAI > 0) at the third visit. In total, 74% of patients, regardless of the status of disease activity, required intervention; 96% of interventions in patients with clinical flare, 72% with serological flare, and 63% with inactive disease were due to management of SLE. The most frequent intervention related to SLE in patients with clinical flare was increasing medication, while in inactive SLE lowering medication was the most common intervention.

Conclusion

Even after a period of relative disease quiescence the majority of patients with lupus require active intervention during a subsequent routine clinic visit. Most interventions are related to the management of SLE. Therefore ongoing monitoring by rheumatologists in the management of lupus seems prudent.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a complex multisystem autoimmune disease that affects 1 in 2000 adult women in the United Kingdom. Lupus affects Afrocaribbeans and South Asians more frequently and more severely than white British. The disease can affect almost any part of the body and is characterised by remission and relapses. It is most common in women of reproductive age but can present at any age from 1 to 90 years and in men, but the diagnosis is probably missed in some men. It is important to distinguish active lupus features due to inflammatory and thrombotic mechanisms from chronic damage and to be aware that infection is an important trigger that may co-exist or mimic lupus activity. The disease is associated with a variety of autoantibodies that can help in making the diagnosis. Monitoring the disease is usually done using a clinical disease activity index such as the BILAG index, anti-dsDNA antibodies, C3 and C4 levels. Anti-C1q antibodies may have a role in monitoring the disease and in predicting those at risk of renal involvement or flare. The prognosis depends on the organs involved. There is an increased risk of premature atherosclerosis as a complication of lupus and this and infection are the most common causes of death in lupus patients.

### New lupus criteria: a critical view [^1157FtaX]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the validation of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2019 classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Recent Findings

Positive antinuclear antibodies, which constitute the obligatory entry criterion of the EULAR/ACR criteria, were found in the vast majority of SLE patients worldwide, with 97% (94–100%) of patients antinuclear antibodies positive in studies investigating EULAR/ACR criteria performance. Combined over the publications, EULAR/ACR criteria sensitivity was 92% (range 85–97%). Specificity varied more relevantly, with the publications published after the EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria showing 93% (83–98%) specificity. Of particular relevance is the good performance of the EULAR/ACR criteria seen in pediatric SLE as well as in early SLE.

Summary

The new classification criteria have been investigated in an impressive number of cohorts worldwide, adding to the data from the EULAR/ACR criteria project cohort. It is critical to strictly keep to the attribution rule, that items are only counted if there is no more likely alternative explanation than SLE, the domain structure, where only the highest weighted item in a domain counts, and the limitation to highly specific tests for antibodies to double-stranded DNA.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus outcome measures for systemic lupus erythematosus clinical trials [^112ju4pn]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

The assessment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease activity in clinical trials has been challenging. This is related to the wide spectrum of SLE manifestations and the heterogeneity of the disease trajectory. Currently, composite outcome measures are most commonly used as a primary endpoint while organ-specific measures are often used as secondary outcomes. In this article, we review the outcome measures and endpoints used in most recent clinical trials and explore potential avenues for further development of new measures and the refinement of existing tools.

Background

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototype of the autoimmune diseases presenting a variety of immunological features and clinical behaviors characterized by an autoantibody response to nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens. Clinical symptoms such as arthralgia or arthritis, skin lesions, and systemic disorders are typical manifestations of organ damages in the joint, kidney, central nervous system, heart, etc. Although precise mechanisms of pathogenesis and the development of specific clinical patterns are largely unknown, there still seems to follow a defined schema of progression as starting from a preclinical phase of disease to pathologic autoimmunity, developing into distinct organ dysfunction.

There is a cluster of autoantibodies involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, where they function against nuclear antigens. SLE is facilitated by generating numerous autoantibodies, particularly unusual serum antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), antibodies directed against double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), anti-histone antibodies, anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies, anti-phospholipid (aPL) antibodies, or anti-Smith (anti-Sm) nuclear antigens in abnormal titer. These autoantibodies are more likely to be disease biomarkers and clinical predictors as they are associated with some clinical features and disease phenotype prediction. Anti-dsDNA is among the most common biomarkers for the early diagnosis of SLE, given that it is frequently occurring in most patients' serum samples, before and after the diagnosis. Also, anti-dsDNA antibody is fluctuated with, and correlates with, the kidney. A study of 40 untreated patients with lupus nephritis indicated a clear correlation between the presence of anti-dsDNA and disease severity on renal biopsy. These data link the anti-dsDNA antibody levels to the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score and lupus flare. The test of anti-dsDNA antibody is vital and remains an interesting research to observe, and besides being widely used in the clinical diagnosis, it is also considered to track the patient's progress and investigate the pathogenesis and development of diseases. Also, the fluctuation of the level of anti-dsDNA antibodies and complement proteins is tightly associated with disease activity and therapeutic effect. Anti-histone antibodies are often found in a special type of lupus which is caused by certain medicine. Anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies have been suggested to be closely related to neonatal lupus erythematosus and photosensitivity. Anti-phospholipid antibodies are clinically associated with anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) which is a typical autoimmune disease. In addition, antibodies to Smith are highly specific for SLE. The pathogenic role and the contribution of anti-Sm antibodies are still not very clear. But, its high specificity for SLE diagnosis indicates important immunological diagnostic criteria for the disease. However, the sensitivity is not very high and less than 20% of Caucasian SLE patients and about 30–40% of African, African-American, and Asian patients can be detected in a multi-ethnic lupus cohort with 2322 patients. As to ANA, a phase II randomized study has pointed out that ANAs are found to be negative in more than 20% of SLE patients in a period of time during the disease process. On the other hand, it can be found positive within a range of autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren's syndrome (SS), scleroderma, and rheumatoid arthritis. In the case of this scenario, although ANA has been widely applied as a serological marker for diagnosis of SLE for many years, its value has been sometimes unreliable for its poor specificity. In a retrospective study, more than 90% of patients who were referred to a tertiary rheumatology clinic for a positive ANA test result had no evidence for an ANA-associated rheumatic disease. The poor predictive value of a positive ANA was largely due to unnecessary testing in patients with low pretest probabilities for an ANA-associated rheumatic disease. Beyond that, there are many other types of diagnostic indicators in lupus, including acute-phase proteins, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and complement protein level, but little is known about the stability and accuracy of them.

### ANA titers in lupus erythematosus and certain chronic dermatoses… [^115Vcp96]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

One hundred twenty patients with acute and chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, and a variety of chronic skin diseases were studied for the presence of antinuclear antibodies in their sera. Fourteen of 19, or 74% of those with active acute systemic lupus erythematosus were found to have positive ANA tests in dilutions of 1: 20 up to 1: 1, 280, while in chronic discoid lupus erythematosus the ANA test was found to be negative in 43% and positive in dilutions of less than 1: 20 in the remaining 57%. All other patients with chronic skin disorders had negative ANA tests as did the 20 control subjects. Quantitation of the fluorescent antibody test is of value in differentiating chronic discoid from acute systemic lupus erythematosus. Carnabuci GJ, Luscombe HA, Stoloff IL.

### Differences in dynamics of specific antinuclear antibodies and their susceptibility to B cell-targeting treatment in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^114mkVCZ]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The variation in ANA dynamics previously observed across different studies may be attributed to three potential factors. First, several studies date back to the 1980s and 1990s, a period when treatment protocols differed significantly from contemporary practices, often involving medications with a lesser impact on autoantibodies. Second, the studies employed different assay methodologies, such as the use of qualitative rather than quantitative approaches. Lastly, some studies feature small sample sizes, particularly concerning SS‐B, which increases the risk of bias.

Regarding pathogenicity, analysis of the correlation between clinical outcomes and specific autoantibody titer reductions has been suggested as an approach to provide insight into the contribution of autoantibodies to disease pathogenesis. The reasoning is that if an autoantibody is pathogenic and the titer is strongly reduced, it should coincide with the reduction of clinical symptoms. Such an analysis can only be performed for autoantibodies whose titers considerably diminish after treatment. In our study, we analyzed the association of anti‐dsDNA and anti‐Sm titer reduction with clinical outcomes and found only anti‐dsDNA titer reductions to associate with renal responses, UPCR reduction, and normalization of complement levels. These results were somewhat unexpected because anti‐Sm positivity has been associated with lupus nephritis and disease severity in some studies, anti‐Sm antibodies have been eluted from lupus nephritis kidneys, and anti‐Sm antibodies are capable of fixating complement. The lack of association could be due to lower power for anti‐Sm related to their lower frequency in SLE, leading to lower power to detect associations of titer changes to disease activity compared to anti‐dsDNA. However, there was no trend of any kind for an association of anti‐Sm titer reductions to clinical outcomes or normalization of complement levels.

### SMART-SLE: serology monitoring and repeat testing in systemic lupus erythematosus-an analysis of anti-double-stranded DNA monitoring [^114Jighn]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations to this study. First, due to the multisite nature of this cohort, there were multiple assays used to measure anti-dsDNA. To attempt to account for this, we analysed all anti-dsDNA results as a ratio to the upper limit of the normal range for each assay. This may not have captured variations in dynamic range between ELISA-based and other assay formats. Furthermore, availability of anti-dsDNA results may influence the treating physician's clinical assessment, including the PGA, and impact the scoring of flares. This study was performed in the Asia–Pacific region, which includes countries with variations in healthcare systems and access to therapies, and ideally findings would be confirmed in independent cohorts.

In conclusion, this study, performed in a large longitudinally followed multinational cohort, suggests that serial monitoring of anti-dsDNA in patients who are persistently anti-dsDNA positive is not redundant. Rather, absolute values and change between visits are useful in predicting flares. Patients who were persistently anti-dsDNA negative were clinically differentiated from persistently positive and fluctuating anti-dsDNA patients, suggesting a different disease trajectory in which other predictors of flare should be sought. Future research into the predictive value of fluctuations in anti-dsDNA in patients who are serologically active but clinically quiescent would be of value.

INTRODUCTION

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that can affect virtually every organ system. SLE can be perceived as a prototypical autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies directed to nuclear antigens (antinuclear antibodies [ANAs]) are a preponderant feature. Among ANAs, anti–double‐stranded DNA (anti‐dsDNA) antibodies are highly associated with SLE. They are present in the majority of patients with SLE and can reflect disease activity. Anti‐Smith (anti‐Sm) is another ANA considered specific for SLE, although it is present less frequently than anti‐dsDNA. Other SLE‐associated antibodies are anti‐U1RNP, anti‐SS‐A (also called Ro), and anti‐SS‐B (also called La); these are also associated with other autoimmune diseases. Together with anti‐Sm, these are grouped as antibodies against RNA‐binding proteins (RBPs).

Requirement of consensus definition for iSLE

Currently, researchers use various definitions for iSLE, which hinders comparability between different studies. Ideally, a classification system would include patients who are at the highest risk of developing SLE or serious organ damage and exclude those who have prolonged mild symptoms or develop other autoimmune diseases. Prospective documentation of a consistent group of patients with iSLE is required in order to better define the high‐risk group and to determine predictive biomarkers. We therefore ask for the development of a consensus on the definition of iSLE in order to, ideally, combine forces and start prospective documentation of patients with iSLE.

Definition of iSLE involves a very heterogeneous group of patients and should include patients at the highest risk of developing SLE. Mucocutaneous symptoms, serositis, renal symptoms, anticardiolipin antibodies, low complement, and anti‐dsDNA are all associated with progression to SLE. Table 3 shows our proposed definition of iSLE, which aims at including patients with a high risk of developing SLE or serious organ involvement. ANA positivity at a titer ≥ 1:80 should be present in order to be classified as iSLE, as this is a key feature of SLE. A recent systematic review and metaregression 22 on the diagnostic value of ANAs reported 97.8% sensitivity and 74.7% specificity for ANA at a titer ≥ 1:80. Also, in an observational study 23 on 616 patients who were referred due to possible SLE, 99.5% of patients with early SLE were ANA positive. The ACR/EULAR international collaboration on development of new classification criteria for SLE has also reached consensus on using positive ANA at a titer ≥ 1:80 as entry criterion 5.

### The role of cytokines as biomarkers in systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus nephritis [^115KuvbN]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis. This is currently a very active area of research. Of particular interest is the use of cytokines as biomarkers of disease activity in SLE and lupus nephritis. Can cytokine measurements assist in early detection of renal flare in known lupus nephritis? Can such measurements be used to distinguish between flare and chronic damage? Or help to confirm renal remission? Could they be used to help assess the required duration of immunosuppression and reduce the need for invasive renal biopsy? This review discusses limitations of current laboratory methods in monitoring SLE, how measurements of cytokines may contribute in relation to following disease activity and summarizes what is known about cytokines as biomarkers in SLE and lupus nephritis.

Introduction: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Monitoring of anti-DNA antibody levels can reflect disease activity, by contrast a single anti-RBP antibody determination is thought to suffice for clinical purposes. Recently, evidence suggests that ANA levels may decrease over time secondary to the natural history of lupus or to treatments.

Objectives: To investigate the trend of ANA and anti-dsDNA autoantibodies titers over time in children with a diagnosis of SLE.

Methods: We enrolled 15 children with a diagnosis of SLE, fulfilling the SLICC criteria. For all patients included in the study ANA and anti-dsDNA antibodies testing was carried out from diagnosis every 3–4 months for 2 years. ANA were defined as negative for titers lower than 1:80. Laboratory parameters, clinical and demographic data was retrieved and analyzed.

Results: Following two years of follow-up, all patients had ANA titers significantly lower than at time of SLE diagnosis (Mann Whitney test, p = 0.0002). After two years of follow-up, 11 patients (73%) still had positive ANA (group 1), while 4 patients (26%) had negative ANA (group 0). At time of diagnosis no significant differences in ANA titers (Mann Whitney test, p = 0.74) nor in disease activity, as measured by SLEDAI, (Mann Whitney test, p = 0.88) were observed (table 1). No significant differences in organ involvement were observed (table 1). Assessing the change over time in ANA titers, the 2 groups of patients showed two different patterns: in group 0, ANA titers quickly declined and disappeared in the first 6 months after diagnosis; in group 1, ANA titers declined more slowly, remaining positive at 2-year follow-up. Both C3 and C4 increased in the follow-up period, with no different patterns between the 2 groups. Similarly, anti-dsDNA antibodies titers declined over time with no clear different patterns between the 2 groups.

Abstract

Objective

Disease activity monitoring in SLE includes serial measurement of anti-double stranded-DNA (dsDNA) antibodies, but in patients who are persistently anti-dsDNA positive, the utility of repeated measurement is unclear. We investigated the usefulness of serial anti-dsDNA testing in predicting flare in SLE patients who are persistently anti-dsDNA positive.

Methods

Data were analysed from patients in a multinational longitudinal cohort with known anti-dsDNA results from 2013 to 2021. Patients were categorized based on their anti-dsDNA results as persistently negative, fluctuating or persistently positive. Cox regression models were used to examine longitudinal associations of anti-dsDNA results with flare.

Results

Data from 37 582 visits of 3484 patients were analysed. Of the patients 1029 (29.5%) had persistently positive anti-dsDNA and 1195 (34.3%) had fluctuating results. Anti-dsDNA expressed as a ratio to the normal cut-off was associated with the risk of subsequent flare, including in the persistently positive cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.56; 95% CI: 1.30, 1.87; P < 0.001) and fluctuating cohort (adjusted HR 1.46; 95% CI: 1.28, 1.66), both for a ratio > 3. Both increases and decreases in anti-dsDNA more than 2-fold compared with the previous visit were associated with increased risk of flare in the fluctuating cohort (adjusted HR 1.33; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.65; P = 0.008) and the persistently positive cohort (adjusted HR 1.36; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.71; P = 0.009).

Conclusion

Absolute value and change in anti-dsDNA titres predict flares, including in persistently anti-dsDNA positive patients. This indicates that repeat monitoring of dsDNA has value in routine testing.

### Characterisation and outcomes of different subsets of low disease activity States in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^112UHZPi]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

With LLDAS with clinical activity used as reference, the other two subsets of LLDAS did not show additional protection associations for subsequent flares overall. However, LLDAS without any clinical or serological activity showed a significantly greater protective association with severe flares compared with LLDAS with clinical features, highlighting the need for close monitoring of patients in LLDAS who still have some clinical activity.

Organ damage accrual, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications, has become the leading cause of death in patients with SLE. Therefore, the ultimate treatment goal of SLE should be prevention of damage accrual.LLDAS attainment has been found to be associated with reduced organ damage accrual in several studiesand the present study confirmed that all subsets of LLDAS have equally protective associations with damage accrual in the ensuing 36 months. This is reassuring regarding the use of LLDAS as a treat to target end point in clinical practice, and also in extrapolating the value of different rates of LLDAS attainment in clinical trials, which typically have a duration of only 1 year.

The Italian Society of Laboratory Medicine Study Group on the Diagnosis of Autoimmune Diseases has generated a series of guidelines for the laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases intendedfor the use of clinical pathologists and laboratory physicians. These guidelines are based on a systematic review of published works and expert panel discussion and consist of 13 recommendations for antinuclear antibodies, anti-double-stranded native DNA, and antinuclear specific antibodies. To improve analytic performances and help select the most appropriate test for specific autoantibodies, as well as provide education and guidance in the use of these tests, special emphasis is placed on laboratory methods.

Methods

Study design and population

We designed a post-hoc analysis of data from two randomized, double blind, phase III clinical trials, i.e. BLISS-52 (NCT00424476) and BLISS-76 (NCT00410384), which enrolled 865 and 819 patients with SLE, respectively. Inclusion criteria for both trials were age ≥ 18 years, SLE diagnosis according to the revised 1997 ACR criteria, active disease defined as a Safety of Estrogens in Lupus National Assessment SLEDAI (SELENA-SLEDAI) score ≥ 6, and serological activity defined as ANA titre ≥ 1:80 and/or serum anti-double stranded (ds)DNA antibody levels ≥ 30 IU/ml. Organ damage was assessed using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC)/ACR Damage Index (SDI). Key exclusion criteria included pregnancy, severe active lupus nephritis and severe active neuropsychiatric SLE. Access to data was granted by GlaxoSmithKline (Uxbridge, UK) through the Clinical Study Data Request consortium. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1, and in more detail in the initial BLISS publications.

RESULTS

Distinct rates of seroconversion between specific

To study whether differences in seroconversion exist between specific ANAs, historical laboratory data from EHRs of patients with a clinical diagnosis of SLE were analyzed. For each ANA, more than 200 patients had multiple measurements for which the range of variation over time could be assessed (Supplementary Table 4). Representative examples of antibody fluctuations are shown in Figure 1A and B. Figure 1C–H displays the range of antibody levels per ANA, with each bar representing an individual patient. With the exception of anti‐dsDNA, upper limits of routine care measurements are applicable; variation above this limit is unknown. Although restricted by this measurement limit, it appears that especially for anti–SS‐A and anti–SS‐B levels, fewer patients have a wide range of antibody levels. Anti‐Sm/RNP, on the other hand, seem to display antibody level ranges similar to anti‐dsDNA.

### SMART-SLE: serology monitoring and repeat testing in systemic lupus erythematosus-an analysis of anti-double-stranded DNA monitoring [^112C29Kv]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically address the utility of serial anti-dsDNA testing in a large cohort of patients where results are not varying between negative and positive. Our findings demonstrate utility in serial quantification of anti-dsDNA in patients who were persistently positive, by showing that absolute values and changes in anti-dsDNA were predictive of flare. After multivariable adjustment, patients who had an increase in anti-dsDNA of > 2-fold had a 26% increased risk of flare. These results are in keeping with some previous studies that have shown an increase in anti-dsDNA can precede a flare, although this has not been demonstrated in all studies. Interestingly, the risk of flare was also increased in patients whose anti-dsDNA reduced > 2-fold, by 36%, suggesting either that it is the volatility of anti-dsDNA results between visits that is predictive, or potentially that different organ systems are affected differently in relation to anti-dsDNA but captured similarly in the flare instrument used. This was true for patients in the fluctuating cohort and the persistently positive cohort. Deposition of antibodies into specific organs is potentially another explanation for this phenomenon. One previous study has found that a reduction of anti-dsDNA around the time of increased disease activity occurred in a select few patients prior to the initiation of therapy rather than prior to disease flare. This observation was observed particularly for renal flares with the authors of this study hypothesizing that dsDNA deposition in the kidney was responsible for the reduction in titres.

The adjusted hazards ratios between fluctuating and persistently positive groups were similar for both the absolute anti-dsDNA ratio and the change in anti-dsDNA ratio. This suggests that patients who have ever been anti-dsDNA positive represent a subset of patients distinct from those who have always been negative. More recently there has been work looking into inflammatory and regulatory cytokines and their ability to predict flare. Future studies of the association of anti-dsDNA with these cytokines would be of interest.

We also found that an increase in the absolute value of anti-dsDNA at a given time point was associated with the likelihood of flare at the subsequent visit. Patients who have positive anti-dsDNA at baseline have been shown to be more likely to flare. Our findings suggest a role for both the absolute value of anti-dsDNA and the variability of the result in predicting the risk of future flare.

### Diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus [^116UdRoD]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystem inflammatory disease that is often difficult to diagnose. Before the diagnosis can be established, four of 11 clinical and laboratory criteria must be met. Antinuclear antibody titer is the primary laboratory test used to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus. Because of the low prevalence of the disease in primary care populations, the antinuclear antibody titer has a low predictive value in patients without typical clinical symptoms. Therefore, as specified by the American College of Rheumatology, this titer should be obtained only in patients with unexplained involvement of two or more organ systems. Patients with an antinuclear antibody titer of 1:40 and characteristic multiorgan system involvement can be diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus without additional testing; however, patients with an antibody titer of 1:40 who fail to meet full clinical criteria should undergo additional testing, including tests for antibody to double-stranded DNA antigen and antibody to Sm nuclear antigen. While an antinuclear antibody titer of less than 1:40 usually rules out systemic lupus erythematosus, patients with persistent, characteristic multisystem involvement may be evaluated for possible antinuclear antibody-negative disease.

Discussion

Disease activity monitoring in SLE has long been challenging. This is in part due to the spectrum of disease manifestations that present in SLE and in part due to the challenges of finding biomarkers with which to monitor disease activity. In many centres, anti-dsDNA antibodies are measured repeatedly during SLE management, based on studies suggesting they can correlate with or predict disease flare. For example, Ho et al. described an increase in dsDNA prior to a flare with a subsequent decrease at the time of flare. Gladman et al. described a subset of SLE patients who have persistent serological activity but remain clinically quiescent, and we and others have shown that such patients are at higher risk of flare than serologically negative patients, but whether absolute levels or fluctuations in anti-dsDNA predict disease flare in patients who are persistently positive is poorly understood. Recent studies, albeit in the setting of screening rather than disease monitoring, have highlighted low utility of serial autoantibody testing, and the healthcare cost of ongoing testing in patients whose result does not change between positive and negative, a group comprising two-thirds of our cohort, is significant. In the current study, we examined whether quantification of anti-dsDNA could predict increased risk of flare for SLE patients in patients whose results were persistently positive, as well as in SLE patients in general.

### Correlations between antinucleosome antibodies and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, C3, C4, and clinical activity in lupus patients [^114NFbtp]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the correlations between antinucleosome antibodies and anti-double-stranded (ds) DNA antibodies, complement (C) 3 and 4 levels, and clinical activities in SLE patients.

Methods

Antinucleosome antibodies and anti-dsDNA antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The levels of C3 and C4 were measured by nephelometry. Clinical activities were determined by SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI).

Results

Of 65 SLE patients, the prevalence of antinucleosome antibodies were higher than anti-ds DNA antibodies (52.3 vs 36.9%, respectively, p < 0.05). Similar results were obtained in 45 active SLE patients, 64.4% for antinucleosome antibodies and 46.7% for anti-ds DNA antibodies. Of 34 patients lacking anti-ds DNA antibodies, 16 (47.1%) were shown antinucleosome antibodies. Activity of antinucleosome antibodies was significantly correlated with the SLEDAI scores and inversedly correlated with the C3 levels but not with the C4 levels.

Conclusion

Antinucleosome antibodies could be one of the earliest and most sensitive markers in diagnosis of SLE, particularly in anti-dsDNA antibodies-negative patients. More importantly, antinucleosome antibodies is correlated with clinical activities and C3 levels.

### Preclinical systemic lupus erythematosus [^117YQx5J]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Preclinical lupus encompasses a spectrum from enhanced SLE risk without clinical symptoms to individuals with autoantibodies and some SLE clinical features without meeting ACR classification. Studies have identified antibody and serological biomarkers years before disease onset. Incomplete lupus and undifferentiated connective tissue disease may occur during preclinical disease periods, but only 10–20% of these individuals transition to SLE and many have a mild disease course. Further studies are warranted to characterize biomarkers of early disease, identify individuals in need of close monitoring or preventive interventions, and elucidate mechanisms of disease pathogenesis without confounding factors of immunosuppressive medications or organ damage.

### Assessment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^111RD5S4]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the archetypal autoimmune disease given its complex clinical and molecular manifestations. Like the other rheumatic diseases, appropriate management is critically dependent upon the proper assessment of disease activity, organ damage, and quality of life. Here, we describe the components of the comprehensive assessment of SLE, including accurate physical and laboratory diagnosis, monitoring of disease activity, recording of accumulated organ morbidity, and integration of these with the patient's own perceptions of health status and quality of life. In doing so, we will review the most appropriate laboratory tests and indices currently used in standard clinical care and in clinical research.

### Burden of autoantibodies and association with disease activity and damage in systemic lupus erythematosus [^114S3i1i]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether immunological burden of autoantibodies as reflected by the number of cumulative antibodies present at inception and after 3 and 5 years is associated with or predicts subsequent disease activity and damage in lupus.

Methods

Patients with SLE followed from inception at a single centre between 1992 and 2007 were included. Twelve autoantibodies were assayed in each patient at years 1, 3 and 5 of disease. The relationship between the burden of autoantibodies and outcomes, SDI (Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics Damage Index), AMS (Adjusted Mean SLEDAI-2K) and AMS excluding anti-ds DNA (AMS-DNA) was evaluated as an association and as prediction. We determined the association between autoantibody burden and outcomes at years 1, 3 and 5 and the prediction using autoantibody burden at year 1 and year 3 to predict outcomes at years 3 and 5 respectively.

Results

Between 1992 and 2007, 235 inception patients were identified. Of these, 223, 163 and 129 patients had 10 or more autoantibodies tested at years 1, 3 and year 5 following diagnosis respectively. There was no association between the burden at years 1, 3 and 5 and outcome measures at years 1, 3 and 5 respectively. Furthermore, burden of autoantibodies at years 1 and 3 did not predict the outcome measures at years 3 and 5 respectively.

Conclusions

Immunological burden in SLE at years 1, 3 or 5 as reflected by the number of autoantibodies found, was not associated with or predictive of subsequent disease activity or damage over time.

### SMART-SLE: serology monitoring and repeat testing in systemic lupus erythematosus-an analysis of anti-double-stranded DNA monitoring [^1153K4tY]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The primary aim of this study was to assess the utility of serial dsDNA monitoring in established SLE patients whose results were persistently positive, to determine whether the need for serial testing could be obviated in this group. Patients who were persistently anti-dsDNA positive had a different disease phenotype compared with those who were persistently anti-dsDNA negative, with a shorter disease duration at enrolment, younger age of diagnosis and more musculoskeletal involvement at baseline, in keeping with previous literature. Patients who were persistently anti-dsDNA positive also had higher disease activity over time, including when anti-dsDNA was subtracted from the SLEDAI-2K measure and when disease activity was measured using a physician global assessment. Use of immunosuppressive medications and cumulative prednisolone exposure was lowest in the persistently anti-dsDNA negative cohort, and of note, the cumulative prednisolone dose, and likelihood of cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate use, was highest in the fluctuating cohort. It is not clear if the associations with fluctuating anti-dsDNA reflect the impact of these drugs on anti-dsDNA or disease characteristics intrinsic to these patients that led to these treatments being used. The fluctuating cohort was followed for a longer period of time, influencing cumulative prednisolone dose. Although biological use was infrequent in this cohort, the increased use of B cell-targeting therapies such as rituximab and belimumab in patients who have fluctuating or persistently positive anti-dsDNA reflects the subset of patients that were included in clinical trials.

### Differences in dynamics of specific antinuclear antibodies and their susceptibility to B cell-targeting treatment in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^113g4rXB]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The presence of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) is characteristic for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Antibody dynamics over time are thought to reflect the cellular source of ANAs and their therapeutic targetability. Anti-dsDNA is the most prevalent and well-studied of all ANAs, and fluctuations in anti-dsDNA serum levels are associated with disease activity. Antibody dynamics of other ANAs, such as antibodies targeting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), are often considered more stable compared to anti-dsDNA. However, anti-RBPs may be heterogeneous in nature and their fluctuation has not been extensively analysed. Therefore, we aimed to study the dynamics of the different ANAs and their susceptibility to B cell targeting treatments in SLE patients.

Methods

Seroconversion of specific ANAs was analyzed using electronic health records from SLE patients. Titers of specific ANAs and anti-varicella zoster virus (VZV) were determined in serum from a longitudinal SLE patient cohort, and serum from SLE patients treated with rituximab and belimumab.

Results

Anti-Sm/RNP, like anti-dsDNA titers, seroconverted more frequently compared to anti-SS-A/SS-B. Furthermore, anti-Sm/RNP as well as anti-dsDNA titers, but not anti-SS-A/SS-B titers, fluctuated significantly compared to stable anti-VZV controls. Likewise, reductions in anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm/RNP titers after B cell depleting treatment were comparable in magnitude. However, only anti-dsDNA titer reductions associated with clinical outcomes.

Conclusions

Together, these results show that anti-Sm/RNP and anti-dsDNA, in contrast to anti-SS-A/SS-B, frequently fluctuate and their levels can decrease following B cell-targeted treatments. Thus, distinct ANAs have variable kinetics, potentially reflecting their derivation from different B cell differentiation pathways.

### 2024 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the screening, treatment, and management of lupus nephritis [^111iVaDB]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Lupus nephritis — proteinuria and serologic monitoring: In people with LN who have sustained complete renal response, quantifying proteinuria every 3–6 months will minimize the risk of missing an LN flare that would require more aggressive treatment. For people with LN, serum complement and anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody should be measured at every clinic visit (but not more frequently than monthly); while hypocomplementemia and elevated anti-dsDNA antibodies have only modest sensitivity and specificity for LN activity, several studies suggest they may herald new onset LN or LN flare, changes in these levels should prompt careful clinical and laboratory assessment but should not necessarily trigger preemptive treatment in the absence of clinical manifestations, and anti-C1q antibodies are potentially useful biomarker but this antibody test may not be universally available.

Systemic lupus erythematosus guideline discussion — In this guideline, we recommend HCQ, limiting glucocorticoid exposure, and early introduction of conventional and/or biologic immunosuppressive therapies to achieve remission or low disease activity while minimizing medication toxicity for all people with SLE. Many recommendations are conditional and do not specify one particular immunosuppressive agent, or even one class of agent, and the guideline strongly emphasizes the role of shared decision-making between patients and clinicians. Routine assessment of medication adherence is suggested.

### Validation of the 2019 EULAR / ACR classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus in an academic tertiary care centre [^113kKUDP]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2019, the EULAR and the ACR jointly published new classification criteria that incorporated state-of-the-art knowledge about the role of serological findings in SLE. The working group employed sophisticated methodology. The new classification was meticulously derived from a carefully curated cohort of patients with lupus and non-lupus, and the initial publication included a carefully assembled validation cohort. The non-lupus subjects in this cohort had 'conditions mimicking SLE', and prior to both derivation and validation, all subjects were centrally adjudicated for the absence or presence of SLE.

The sensitivity of the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification was improved over the 1997 version and comparable to the 2012 SLICC classification. The specificity of the 2019 classification was 93% in the validation cohort, which was equal to the 1997 ACR classificationwhen applied to the same cohort, and superior to the 2012 SLICC classification, which, interestingly, exhibited the same specificity as in the initial publication (84%). Overall, the 2019 criteria had a larger combined sensitivity and specificity than the 1997 and the 2012 criteria (1.90 vs 1.76 and 1.80, respectively, in the validation cohort).

Importantly, the 2019 classification declared a history of antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity as an entry criterion. This excludes a small number of patients with lupus who have never had a positive ANA test from being classified as SLE, which the authors deemed acceptable for the purpose of recruiting for clinical trials.

Derivation and validation of the 2019 EULAR/ACR were extremely well done, and the new classification was implemented immediately by rheumatologists worldwide. But how does the classification perform in daily clinical practice, where recruitment for studies takes place? Here we report the application of the criteria in a cohort of patients with SLE, patients with non-SLE ARD, and patients with hepatic diseases from a large outpatient clinic of a university medical centre in Germany.

### SMART-SLE: serology monitoring and repeat testing in systemic lupus erythematosus-an analysis of anti-double-stranded DNA monitoring [^115TKqvf]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

We next adjusted for covariables that we considered important predictors of flare or that had demonstrated significance in univariable analysis. The final four models included the following parameters measured at the previous visit: lymphocyte count < 1 × 10⁹/l, prednisolone dose ≥ 7.5 mg, ESR, cutaneous, serositis and renal activity as measured on SLEDAI-2K. CRP was excluded from the final models due to collinearity with ESR, and the Pr/Cr ratio was excluded due to collinearity with renal activity. Haematological activity, vasculitis activity, central nervous system activity, and C3 and C4 were dropped from the final model as they became insignificant during the multivariable analysis. After multivariable adjustment, associations with flare were observed in persistently anti-dsDNA positive patients and fluctuating patients for both anti-dsDNA ratio as an absolute value and for fold change in anti-dsDNA between visits (Table 5). An absolute anti-dsDNA ratio > 3 demonstrated a hazards ratio (95% CI) of 1.35 (1.17, 1.57) in the fluctuating cohort and 1.51 (1.26, 1.81) in the persistently positive cohort. In persistently anti-dsDNA positive patients, a change in anti-dsDNA ratio of at least 2-fold in a positive or negative direction at the prior visit had an adjusted HR (95% CI) for flare of 1.26 (1.00, 1.57) (P = 0.050) and 1.36 (1.07, 1.71) (P = 0.010), respectively. The fluctuating cohort had a HR (95% CI) of 1.45 (1.14, 1.84) for a 2-fold increase and a HR (95% CI) of 1.35 (1.07, 1.75) for a 2-fold decrease in the anti-dsDNA ratio.

Table 5.
Adjusted hazard ratios of associations with flare (multivariable analysis)

One hundred and ninety-eight patients (5.7%), despite meeting SLE classification criteria, did not have a record of a positive ANA test result. Analysis after removal of these patients did not impact on the associations of anti-dsDNA with flare (Supplementary Table S3, available at Rheumatology online).

### New therapeutic strategies in systemic lupus erythematosus management [^111VhtuQ]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

The current treatment approach for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as outlined in the recommendations by international medical associations including EULAR and the ACR, is mostly eminence-based rather than evidence-based. However, knowledge on SLE is growing quickly, and such new advances need to be translated into clinical practice. Questions remain regarding the choice and timing of drug administration and tapering until withdrawal, which both can affect the balance between the control of disease activity and damage to organs triggered by long-standing and/or disproportionate immunosuppression. Currently, the treating physicians of patients with SLE are required to weigh the present with the future situation of their patients in an optimized balance between therapeutic harm and benefit. In this Review, the available therapeutic strategies and main challenges in the approach to SLE treatment are discussed. Remission and low disease activity are desirable therapeutic goals. Although the drug armamentarium for SLE has not expanded much in the past few decades, there are nonetheless opportunities to make better choices and explore combination therapies; such opportunities offer the potential of a personalized medicine strategy.

Table 3.
Disease activity and flare in SLE patients categorized as anti-dsDNA persistently negative, fluctuating or persistently positive

Disease activity also varied between the cohorts. Time-adjusted mean SLEDAI-2K (AMS) was highest in persistently anti-dsDNA positive patients (median [IQR] 4.3 [3.2, 6.0]) and lowest in persistently anti-dsDNA negative patients (median [IQR] 1.4 [0.3, 2.8]) (P < 0.001) (Table 3). As anti-dsDNA contributes 2 points to the SLEDAI-2K, we subtracted this domain and found that time-adjusted mean SLEDAI-2K excluding anti-dsDNA remained highest in the persistently anti-dsDNA positive cohort (median [IQR] 2.3 [1.2, 4.0] vs persistently anti-dsDNA negative 1.1 [0.1, 2.5], fluctuating 2.1 [0.9, 3.7] and total cohort 2.0 [0.6, 3.4], P < 0.001). Persistently anti-dsDNA negative patients were more likely to have damage at baseline compared with fluctuating and persistently positive patients with 493 (41.3%) patients having a baseline SDI ≥ 1 compared with fluctuating (439 [38.9%]) and persistently positive (318 [34.2%]) (P = 0.003) cohorts (Table 3).

A total of 5097 flares were recorded in 1988 (57.1%) patients during the observation period, with a range of 0–36 flares per patient; 1211 (34.8%) of patients experienced recurrent flares; 1255 flares occurred in the persistently anti-dsDNA positive cohort (583/1029 patients [56.7%]) compared with 2613 flares in the fluctuating cohort (830/1195 patients [69.5%]); and 594 (49.7%) fluctuating patients had recurrent flares (≥ 2) during the observation period, a higher proportion compared with patients who were persistently positive (315 [30.6%]) or persistently negative (302 [24.0%]) (P < 0.001) (Table 3).

### Systemic lupus erythematosus: one year in review 2024 [^1177FFik]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is classically regarded as the landmark of systemic autoimmune diseases, characterised by protean, multi-systemic manifestations and a highly variable clinical course. Over the last years, both clinical and translational clinical research efforts led to significant steps forward in management and treatment of SLE. However, numerous aspects of SLE, from pathogenesis to treatment, still remain challenging, and several unmet needs persist for both patients and physicians. Following the previous annual reviews of this series, herewith, we aim to report the most relevant new updates on SLE, issued in 2023. In particular, we focused on biomarkers, clinical aspects and outcomes, comorbidities, as well as new treatment targets and real-world evidence.

### Disease-specific quality indicators, guidelines, and outcome measures in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [^112J2k11]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

The assessment of quality of care is becoming increasingly important, but as yet no standard set of measures to assess quality has been developed. The ACR Quality Measures Committee has selected the following areas of study to develop quality indicators: diagnostic/classification criteria, outcome measures/response criteria, treatment guidelines/management recommendations, definition of quality indicators, and definition of data collection systems. The aim of the present review is to evaluate existing guidelines and outcome measures concerning disease/activity monitoring, autoantibody and laboratory assessment, outcomes, and therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that could be used to define disease-specific quality indicators. Much data is available in the literature that could serve to define a starter set of quality indicators for SLE. Monitoring issues are discussed in the ACR and EULAR recommendations. As far as therapy is concerned, the ACR has provided indicators for rheumatoid arthritis that could also be applied to SLE, as well as indications for anti-malarial monitoring. The outcomes measures most frequently used in SLE are damage and death, but organ-specific definitions of outcome and response are being evaluated. The development of quality measures for SLE is just beginning; existing information could serve to construct a starter set of indicators such as the one proposed here. Certainly much progress will be made in the near future. A practical, user-friendly tool for physicians that will help them deliver high quality care to populations is also needed.

### Clinical utility of common serum rheumatologic tests [^111g85XH]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Serum rheumatologic tests are generally most useful for confirming a clinically suspected diagnosis. Testing for rheumatoid factor is appropriate when rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome or cryoglobulinemia is suspected. Antinuclear antibody testing is highly sensitive for systemic lupus erythematosus and drug-induced lupus. Anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies correlate with lupus nephritis; the titer often corresponds with disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus. Testing for anti-Ro (anti-SS-A) or anti-La (anti-SS-B) may help confirm the diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus; these antibodies are associated with the extraglandular manifestations of Sjögren's syndrome. Cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing is highly sensitive and specific for Wegener's granulomatosis. Human leukocyte antigen-B27 is frequently present in ankylosing spondylitis and Reiter's syndrome, but the background presence of this antibody in white populations limits the value of testing. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a diagnostic criterion for polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis; however, specificity is quite low. ESR values tend to correlate with disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis and may be useful for monitoring therapeutic response.

### Classifying and diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus in the 21st century [^114ZNfsX]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Autoantibodies

In essence, SLE is a multi-autoantibody and immune complex disease. With more autoantibody tests available over time, immunological abnormalities are seen in essentially all patients with SLE. In parallel, the importance of securing the presence of immunological abnormalities has become obvious, with the phase II belimumab clinical trial showing effects in serologically active patients only. While the latter is not surprising, the SLICC criteria have responded by making at least one immunological criterion an absolute requirement for SLE classification.

A systematic literature search and metaregression within the EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria project found that the vast majority of SLE patients [97.8% (95% CI 96.8, 98.5)] have positive ANAs, or have at least been ANA positive historically. In a Delphi exercise, SLE experts all over the world also closely linked ANA and SLE. Given the high sensitivity of the ANA test, combined with its low specificity, and the fact that ANAs are used as a screening parameter in clinical routines, ANAs are now an obligatory entry criterion for the EULAR/ACR 2019 SLE classification criteria. While this precludes (always) ANA-negative SLE patients from classification by the new criteria, this is a very uncommon situation acceptable for classification.

### Different indirect immunofluorescence ANA substrate performance in a diagnostic setting of patients with SLE and related disorders: retrospective review and analysis [^11123ciQ]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In this study, ANA seroconversion (negative to positive) occurred even within 2 years of initial testing using the same assay. In 2002, an ACR committee suggested that due to a lack of evidence, 'serial ANA testing is of unknown value'. ANA positivity may change with fluctuations in antibodies such as anti-dsDNA, which in turn correlate with disease activity, and it has also been established that autoantibodies start to be detectable and specificities accumulate prior to the onset of SLE. One retrospective cohort study of 36 715 ANA tests done in 28 840 patients found that 19% of patients with an initially negative ANA HEp-2 test had a positive result on at least one repeat test on the same ANA kit over a 7-year period (median time to first positive result 1.74 years). In addition, patients with SLE may lose ANA positivity with decreasing ANA titres over the disease course, as shown in a small prospective study of 54 recently diagnosed SLE cases followed up to 96 months. We recommend that future larger studies should longitudinally examine different ANA, autoantibodies and their assays to maximise the utility of diagnosis and monitoring of SLE and other ARDs.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus: diagnosis and treatment [^1113unX5]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematologic, integumentary, musculoskeletal, neuropsychiatric, pulmonary, renal, and reproductive systems. It is a chronic disease and may cause recurrent flare-ups without adequate treatment. The newest clinical criteria proposed by the European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology in 2019 include an obligatory entry criterion of a positive antinuclear antibody titer of 1: 80 or greater. Management of SLE is directed at complete remission or low disease activity, minimizing the use of glucocorticoids, preventing flare-ups, and improving quality of life. Hydroxychloroquine is recommended for all patients with SLE to prevent flare-ups, organ damage, and thrombosis and increase long-term survival. Pregnant patients with SLE have an increased risk of spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. Preconception counseling regarding risks, planning the timing of pregnancy, and a multidisciplinary approach play a major role in the management of SLE in patients contemplating pregnancy. All patients with SLE should receive ongoing education, counseling, and support. Those with mild SLE can be monitored by a primary care physician in conjunction with rheumatology. Patients with increased disease activity, complications, or adverse effects from treatment should be managed by a rheumatologist.

### Diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines [^116gsJ3N]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is complex and variability in practices exists. Guidelines have been developed to help improve the management of SLE patients, but there has been no formal evaluation of these guidelines. This study aims to compare the scope, quality, and consistency of clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of patients with SLE.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched up to April 2014. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument and textual synthesis was used to appraise and compare recommendations.

Results

Nine clinical practice guidelines and 5 consensus statements were identified, which covered 7 topics: diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, neuropsychiatric SLE, lupus nephritis, antiphospholipid syndrome, and other manifestations of lupus. The methodological quality of the guidelines was variable, with the overall mean AGREE II scores ranging from 31% to 75%, out of a maximum 100%. Scores were consistently low for applicability, with only 1 guideline scoring above 50%. There was substantial variability in the treatments recommended for class II and V lupus nephritis, the recommended duration of maintenance therapy for class III/IV lupus nephritis (from 1 to 4 years), and timing of ophthalmologic examination for patients taking corticosteroids.

Conclusion

Published guidelines on SLE cover a complex area of clinical care, but the methodological quality, scope, and recommendations varied substantially. Collaborative and multidisciplinary efforts to develop comprehensive, high-quality evidence-based guidelines are needed to promote best treatment and health outcomes for patients with SLE.

### An update on clinical trials for cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^11747bAj]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

3 OUTCOME MEASURES

A critical review of the clinical trial methodologies used in CLE lupus therapeutic development reveals significant gaps, particularly in the outcome measures used to evaluate SLE and their applicability to CLE. The primary outcome measures, including the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)and the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group Index (BILAG), are primarily designed for systemic manifestations. BILAG captures partial change over time with some skin measures like skin eruption and alopecia, while SLEDAI documents presence or absence of organ involvement, including skin features such as new rash and mucosal ulcers. In response to these limitations, composite outcome measures such as the SLE Responder Index (SRI) and BILAG‐Based Combined Lupus Assessment (BICLA) were developed. However, these too rely heavily on systemic disease measures, perpetuating a clear inadequacy in addressing the specific needs of CLE patients.

The minimization of skin concerns is further compounded by SLE trial entry criteria. Historically, SLE clinical trials have framed inclusion guidelines based on criteria from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) or the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC), which do not require positive serology. However, the 2019European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR)/ACR classification criteria necessitate a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) for diagnosis, excluding a significant portion of CLE patients, particularly the 18% with a negative ANA, who would have qualified under previous criteria. This reliance on serology, coupled with the poor standardization of ANA testing, makes entry into clinical trials problematic for many CLE patients.

This systematic exclusion is not just a matter of classification but has real‐world implications. The majority of CLE patients, who may not have concomitant SLE, are excluded from the trials designed for SLE, leading to a lack of targeted treatments for CLE. Despite the considerable impact of CLE on patients' quality of life, the therapeutic options remain inadequate. It is imperative that we establish targeted investigations to address and alleviate the unique challenges faced by CLE patients.

Importantly, although a substantial group of anti‐Sm–positive patients had a reduction in anti‐Sm titer (Figure 3G and I), this decrease did not associate with the renal response at both weeks 24 and 48 (Figure 4C and D). Likewise, titer decreases for the other ANAs did not show a statistically significant correlation with renal response (data not shown). When analyzing the reduction in proteinuria, only anti‐dsDNA titer reductions were associated with reduced UPCR (Supplementary Figure 5).

An important correlate of antibody effector functions and immune complex deposition is complement consumption, leading to decreased complement levels in serum. Most patients had a reduced C3 serum concentration at baseline, which increased in all three treatment arms at both weeks 24 and 48 (Supplementary Figure 6A and B). Normalization of C3 levels associated with stronger reductions in anti‐dsDNA titers but not in anti‐Sm titers (Figure 4E–J).

### Information on diagnosis and management of systemic lupus erythematosus derived from the routine measurement of 8 nuclear autoantibodies [^111ANDc4]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the value of routine measurement of a panel of 8 nuclear autoantibodies (ANA/8) for the diagnosis and management of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Methods

To estimate disease sensitivity of ANA/8, we studied 25 patients with new SLE and 114 with new and established SLE. To estimate disease specificity, 100 patients with other autoimmune rheumatic diseases were included. We used computerized statistical analysis of the level of 8 ANA in relation to clinical activity determined as Systemic Lupus Activity Measure disease activity scores (DAS). Data were collected retrospectively from the charts of 114 patients with 698 visits and evaluated by multiple and piece-wise linear regression analysis (PWLRA) and correlation and cluster analyses.

Results

The disease sensitivity of the 3 types of SLE profiles identified was 100% for new SLE patients (n = 25) and 87% for mixed SLE patients; the disease specificity was 98%. Autoantibody levels of anti-ssDNA, dsDNA, and Scl-70 were the best individual correlates of general and organ-specific DAS. Twenty-four percent (R2) of the variability in the general DAS was explained by the multiple regression (R = 0.49), with significant contribution made by anti-Scl-70 (beta = 0.39), dsDNA (beta = 0.17), Sm (beta = 0.10), and SSA (beta = 0.08). PWLRA indicated that for 68% of the 698 clinical presentations (average 6/patient), the observed DAS and the predicted DAS from autoantibody levels were both low and clustered; they were partially discrepant for the remaining 32%, which was explained by the relatively high correlation of DAS with prior changes in autoantibody levels (R = 0.6). The changes in DAS and in anti-dsDNA levels were significantly predicted by the multiple regression at one prior visit, with anti-ssDNA as the main contributor.

Conclusion

The ANA/8 profile showed ~ 100% sensitivity and ~ 98% specificity for SLE and correlated with contemporary and subsequent changes in DAS and autoantibody levels. Among autoantibodies of this profile, anti-ssDNA (ssDNA) was the most sensitive indicator of SLE and the main contributor to prediction of subsequent changes in DAS.

### Predictors of flares in systemic lupus erythematosus: preventive therapeutic intervention based on serial anti-dsDNA antibodies assessment. analysis of a monocentric cohort and literature review [^113YHMV6]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) may experience flare of disease activity. The aim of this study was to assess incidence, clinical features and predictors of flares, focusing on the relationship with serially assessed anti-double stranded DNA antibodies (anti-dsDNA) serum levels by Farr assay and pre-emptive therapeutic approaches of flares, through the analysis of a monocentric cohort of SLE patients and a literature review. Clinical and laboratory data of 120 out of 334 SLE patients, fulfilling inclusion criteria for enrolment and followed up between 1997 and 2012, were retrospectively collected. For the purposes of the study, a flare was defined as any new SLE manifestation or worsening of a pre-existing manifestation resulting in change of therapy. A review of the literature was performed searching for articles published between 1980 and 2015. Over a median (IQR) follow-up of 5.9 (3.0–8.9) years, 87 flares were recorded in 59 (49%) patients. The estimated incidence rate was 0.11 flare per patient-year, at the low-end of values reported in literature (0.19–1.76 patient-year). In our cohort, fluctuating anti-dsDNA serum levels were associated with flare development whereas precautionary change of therapy in presence of increased anti-dsDNA levels > 50% was effective in preventing flares (p < 0.05). Results from literature review highlighted that increasing anti-dsDNA and precautionary change of therapy were predictive and pre-emptive of flares, respectively, in some studies but not in others. Differences in laboratory methods and patient selection, in terms of ethnicity, disease duration, and background therapy are likely to be crucial in determining discordant results.

### What is the clinical significance of anti-Sm antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus? A comparison with anti-dsDNA antibodies and C3 [^114EMuhv]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the clinical value of anti-Sm antibodies in diagnosis and monitoring of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and their ability to predict lupus flares compared with that of anti-dsDNA antibody and complement (C3) assays.

Methods

Autoantibodies against Smith antigen (Sm) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in sera from SLE (n = 232), myositis (n = 26), systemic sclerosis (n = 81), Sjögren's syndrome (n = 88), and rheumatoid arthritis patients (n = 165) and healthy donors (n = 400) were determined by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (both from Euroimmun). New thresholds for both autoantibodies were calculated by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. Cross-sectional, longitudinal and predictive analyses of anti-Sm and disease activity were also performed.

Results

Sensitivities of 25.9% for anti-Sm (cut-off: 3.6 relative units/ml) and 30.2% for anti-dsDNA (cut-off 157.4 international units/ml) were obtained at a specificity of 99%. 14.8% of anti-dsDNA-negative patients were positive for anti-Sm, and more than half (51.4%) of anti-dsDNA-positive patients were also positive for anti-Sm. Anti-Sm antibodies were associated with age (p = 0.0174), the number of ACR criteria (p = 0.0242), the ACR criteria renal (p = 0.0350) and neurologic disorder (p = 0.0239), the BILAG category constitutional symptoms (p = 0.0227), fatigue (p = 0.0311) and cross-sectional disease activity (r = 0.2519, p = 0.0224). Although no correlations with lupus activity were observed in the longitudinal and predictive analysis, a remarkable association was found between anti-Sm and proteinuria.

Conclusions

Anti-Sm antibodies are essential for diagnosis of SLE, especially in anti-dsDNA-negative patients. However, our data suggest that anti-Sm monitoring is only helpful in SLE patients with active lupus nephritis.

### Unique interplay between antinuclear antibodies and nuclear molecules in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus [^111oqSXo]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease that primarily affects young women and causes a wide range of inflammatory manifestations. The hallmark of SLE is the production of antibodies to components of the cell nucleus (antinuclear antibodies [ANAs]). These antibodies can bind to DNA, RNA, and protein complexes with nucleic acids. Among ANAs, antibodies to DNA (anti-DNA) are markers for classification and disease activity, waxing and waning disease activity in many patients. In the blood, anti-DNA antibodies can bind to DNA to form immune complexes with two distinct roles in pathogenesis: (1) renal deposition to provoke nephritis and (2) stimulation of cytokine production following uptake into innate immune cells and interaction with internal nucleic acid sensors. These sensors are part of an internal host defense system in the cell cytoplasm that can respond to DNA from infecting organisms; during cell stress, DNA from nuclear and mitochondrial sources can also trigger these sensors. The formation of immune complexes requires a source of extracellular DNA in an immunologically accessible form. As shown in in vivo and in vitro systems, extracellular DNA can emerge from dead and dying cells in both a free and a particulate form. Neutrophils undergoing the process of NETosis can release DNA in mesh-like structures called neutrophil extracellular traps. In SLE, therefore, the combination of ANAs and immunologically active DNA can create new structures that can promote inflammation throughout the body as well as drive organ inflammation and damage.
