## Question

Diabetes management protocols

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diabetes management protocols across settings, presented in a clear, step-by-step format with explicit self-verification language. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principles that anchor modern diabetes care. Then, I should verify outpatient foundational elements like DSMES, lifestyle, and first-line pharmacotherapy. Next, I will examine inpatient protocols, including glycemic targets, insulin strategies, and hypoglycemia prevention. After that, I should review special populations and acute complications. Finally, I will integrate quality improvement, equity, and technology-enabled care, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together with appropriate citations [^1114hJVh] [^113i7ypa] [^113cz27Z].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principles so I don't jump to specifics too quickly. Modern diabetes care is person-centered, team-based, and iterative, with shared decision-making and individualized targets; it also embeds social determinants of health and cost/access considerations into treatment choices, and it emphasizes continuous quality improvement with reliable metrics and registries to close gaps in care [^1114hJVh] [^114opwT2] [^112dk8qE].

> I need to check the outpatient cornerstones next. Diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) is not a one-time event but an ongoing process aligned with national standards, delivered at diagnosis, annually, and at transitions or when goals are unmet; it should be culturally tailored and empowerment-focused to improve adherence and outcomes [^1157Df3R]. Lifestyle therapy remains foundational across the continuum, with structured nutrition, weight management, and physical activity integrated from onset and sustained long term; concurrent training (aerobic plus resistance) yields dose-responsive benefits and should be individualized to capacity and comorbidities [^114JZZer] [^112vmkQ5]. For pharmacologic initiation, metformin is first-line unless contraindicated, ideally started alongside lifestyle at diagnosis, with timely escalation to avoid therapeutic inertia and with explicit attention to access and affordability [^114dK8ee] [^111BMTFs] [^115JRcg9].

> Hold on, I should verify inpatient glycemic targets before choosing insulin protocols. For most noncritically ill inpatients, a glucose target of 140–180 mg/dL is reasonable, with 100–140 mg/dL considered only if safely achievable without hypoglycemia; less stringent targets are appropriate for those with high clinical complexity or hypoglycemia risk, and critically ill adults should generally be managed with continuous IV insulin targeting persistent hyperglycemia ≥ 180 mg/dL while avoiding overly aggressive lower targets due to hypoglycemia risk [^117RujRr] [^115FU21i]. I should confirm that institutions implement validated written or computerized order sets for dysglycemia management to standardize safe, personalized care and reduce errors [^113NsNrq] [^116Rrdo7].

> Next, I will examine inpatient insulin strategies, but wait, let me verify the role of basal–bolus regimens. For noncritically ill patients with adequate intake, basal, prandial, and correction-dose insulin is preferred; sliding-scale insulin alone is ineffective and should be avoided except for occasional corrections when already near target, and continuous IV insulin infusion is the most effective method in critical care when combined with validated protocols and frequent or near-continuous glucose monitoring during instability [^117RujRr] [^112vX71X] [^115FU21i]. I should double-check that order sets incorporate decision support and explicit hypoglycemia prevention plans to operationalize safety at the bedside [^112vX71X] [^113cz27Z].

> I will now review hypoglycemia prevention and management because this is a key inpatient safety domain. All systems should adopt a hypoglycemia surveillance protocol with patient-specific plans to identify, treat, and prevent episodes, mandatory documentation and tracking of events, and immediate therapy review when glucose is less than 70 mg/dL to prevent recurrence; structured education for patients at risk and referral for impaired awareness are essential outpatient correlates [^113cz27Z] [^112792Rc] [^116FdDsw] [^113UDoSs]. But wait, what if the patient is on CGM in the hospital? I need to ensure we reconcile that inpatient CGM remains largely investigational for dosing decisions and that we rely on validated POC workflows while monitoring regulatory and operational readiness for broader CGM adoption [^1142ps3f].

> Let me consider special populations and acute complications so I don't miss high-risk scenarios. For diabetic ketoacidosis, evidence-based protocols using IV insulin, isotonic fluids, and electrolyte replacement improve outcomes; a two-bag system can reduce errors and workload compared with frequent bag changes, but adherence to core DKA pathways is what drives results [^113aLPgv]. For older adults or those with limited life expectancy, less stringent inpatient targets are appropriate to minimize hypoglycemia harm, and for pediatrics, management must balance avoidance of frequent hypoglycemia with growth and neurodevelopmental safety, often requiring more frequent monitoring and caregiver education [^117RujRr] [^112oJghX]. I should confirm that foot risk assessment and preventive care are embedded in protocols given the high burden of diabetic foot disease and the proven impact of multidisciplinary prevention [^112nabLN].

> Next, I should review chronic comorbidity integration, especially CKD and CVD, because glycemic decisions cannot be made in isolation. In diabetes with CKD, a comprehensive strategy that addresses blood pressure, lipids, and albuminuria, and that aligns medication choices with kidney function and cardiovascular risk, is recommended; SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists have outcome benefits and should be prioritized when indicated alongside lifestyle and BP control [^111A8S9U] [^113FAqMC]. For patients with established ASCVD or high risk, I need to ensure early addition of agents with proven cardiovascular risk reduction rather than escalating insulin alone, consistent with complication-centric algorithms [^115tN3h7] [^115QFVaz].

> I should double-check that our quality improvement infrastructure is explicit and measurable. Systems should use registries, dashboards, and benchmarking to track process and outcome metrics, embed Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles, and foster interprofessional team-based care with clear roles and communication pathways; this is particularly important for inpatient glycemic programs where team structure and protocol fidelity correlate with safety and length-of-stay improvements [^1114hJVh] [^11227pYa]. Let me verify that hypoglycemia surveillance and transition-of-care elements are built into these QI frameworks to sustain gains [^113cz27Z].

> But wait, what about equity and access, since cost and literacy often derail best practices? I need to ensure protocols include routine assessment of financial barriers, deployment of cost-lowering strategies, and integration of DSMES that is linguistically and culturally appropriate; task-sharing models in resource-limited settings demonstrate meaningful HbA1c reductions when non-physician providers deliver education and adherence support under supervision [^115JRcg9] [^113nBRKF]. I should confirm that medication selection also weighs price, simplicity, and access alongside clinical effectiveness to avoid nonadherence due to cost [^115QFVaz].

> Let me reconsider technology-enabled care because it can both enhance and complicate management. CGM is highly recommended to assist patients in reaching glycemic goals safely, with particular value for hypoglycemia-prone individuals; however, inpatient CGM for dosing remains limited and requires robust protocols and education if expanded beyond emergency use contexts [^1158rB6p] [^1142ps3f]. Digital and mobile tools can augment DSMES and support adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes, but I should verify that digital literacy and numeracy are assessed to avoid widening disparities in benefit from these innovations [^115QtPS5] [^114dERD3].

> I should confirm that psychosocial screening and behavioral support are embedded in routine care, not treated as optional. Elevated rates of depression, diabetes distress, and suicidality warrant structured screening at key touchpoints, with referral to evidence-based interventions like collaborative goal-setting and motivational interviewing that improve both distress and glycemic outcomes in real-world settings [^1166nW4s] [^1155X6AA]. Hold on, I should verify that these behavioral components are integrated into order sets and care pathways so they are not overlooked during busy encounters [^1166nW4s].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise protocol to ensure nothing critical is missing. Foundation: build team-based, person-centered care with DSMES, lifestyle, and shared decision-making; initiate metformin unless contraindicated and escalate every 3 months if not at goal, adding agents with cardiorenal benefit when indicated and minimizing hypoglycemia risk; in the hospital, use validated order sets, prefer basal–bolus insulin, avoid sliding-scale monotherapy, and implement hypoglycemia surveillance with event tracking; for DKA, follow standardized IV insulin and fluid protocols; across transitions, reconcile medications, provide survival skills education, arrange timely follow-up, and apply QI cycles to iteratively improve performance and equity [^111BMTFs] [^113NsNrq] [^113cz27Z] [^113aLPgv] [^1114hJVh].

Diabetes management protocols are **evidence-based, team-based, and individualized** to optimize glycemic control, prevent complications, and improve quality of life [^1114hJVh]. Core elements include **lifestyle interventions** (nutrition, physical activity, weight management) [^114JZZer], **pharmacotherapy** (metformin first-line; add agents based on comorbidities and patient factors) [^113i7ypa], and **structured self-management education** with routine monitoring of A1C, blood pressure, and lipids [^1157Df3R] [^114opwT2]. In the hospital, use **validated insulin protocols** [^112vX71X], avoid sliding-scale insulin, and implement hypoglycemia surveillance [^113cz27Z]. Individualize A1C targets, address social determinants, and integrate digital tools and CGM to enhance adherence and outcomes [^1174JCJs] [^115JRcg9] [^1158rB6p].

---

## Core components of diabetes management protocols

### Lifestyle interventions

- **Nutrition therapy**: Individualized meal plans emphasizing balanced macronutrients, portion control, and consistent carbohydrate intake [^notfound].

- **Physical activity**: At least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, plus resistance training [^notfound].

- **Weight management**: Aim for 5–10% weight loss in overweight/obese patients to improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacologic therapy

- **First-line therapy**: Metformin unless contraindicated; consider early combination therapy if A1C ≥ 1.5% above target [^116weoCm].

- **Second-line agents**: Choose based on comorbidities (ASCVD, CKD, HF), hypoglycemia risk, weight effects, and patient preferences [^114opwT2].

- **Insulin therapy**: Initiate for persistent hyperglycemia despite oral therapy or as initial therapy in severe hyperglycemia (A1C ≥ 10% or fasting glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL) [^114dK8ee].

---

### Self-management education and support (DSMES)

DSMES provides **structured education** on diabetes self-management, including glucose monitoring, medication adherence, and lifestyle behaviors [^1157Df3R]. Ongoing support reinforces skills, improves adherence, and sustains behavior change [^113HvNGo].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring of **A1C** every 3–6 months, with individualized targets based on patient characteristics [^1174JCJs], and routine assessment of blood pressure, lipid profile, kidney function, and cardiovascular health are essential [^114opwT2]. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is recommended for patients on intensive insulin regimens or with frequent hypoglycemia [^1158rB6p].

---

## Hospital-based diabetes management protocols

### Glycemic targets

For non-critically ill patients, the **target glucose range** is 140–180 mg/dL; consider 100–140 mg/dL if safely achievable [^117RujRr]. For critically ill patients, initiate continuous intravenous insulin infusion (CII) for persistent hyperglycemia ≥ 180 mg/dL, with validated protocols to minimize hypoglycemia [^115FU21i].

---

### Insulin therapy protocols

Use **basal-bolus regimens** — basal, prandial, and correction insulin — as the preferred inpatient approach [^117RujRr]. Avoid sliding-scale insulin as monotherapy because it is ineffective and increases hypoglycemia risk [^113gXvKb]. Implement hypoglycemia surveillance protocols to identify, treat, and prevent episodes, with documentation and quality improvement tracking [^113cz27Z].

---

### Transition of care

Provide **discharge planning** with clear insulin and medication instructions, follow-up appointments, and DSMES referrals [^1157Df3R]. Communicate with outpatient providers to ensure continuity of care and medication reconciliation [^notfound].

---

## Individualized care and patient-centered approach

Individualized care tailors **glycemic targets** to age, comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences [^114opwT2]. Shared decision-making engages patients in treatment decisions to improve adherence and satisfaction [^116CCtvi]. Address social determinants by assessing financial barriers, access to care, and cultural factors to optimize outcomes [^115JRcg9].

---

## Integration of technology and digital health tools

- **Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)**: Improves glycemic control and reduces hypoglycemia [^1158rB6p].

- **Telemedicine**: Facilitates remote monitoring, education, and support, especially in underserved populations [^notfound].

- **Digital platforms**: Mobile apps and online resources enhance self-management and adherence [^notfound].

---

## Quality improvement and evaluation

Quality improvement relies on **evidence-based care models** aligned with ADA/AACE guidelines and regular assessment of outcomes using metrics such as A1C, blood pressure, lipid control, and patient-reported outcomes [^1114hJVh]. Ongoing education for healthcare professionals ensures current best practices and guideline adherence [^113HvNGo].

---

## Challenges and barriers

Key barriers include **limited access to care**, medications, and diabetes education — particularly in underserved populations [^1143FcBd]. Patient adherence is hindered by complexity, **side effects**, and socioeconomic factors [^113UTgjP]. Health system constraints, such as **fragmented care** and limited resources, further impede optimal management [^113nBRKF].

---

## Emerging trends and future directions

Emerging directions include **precision medicine** with tailored therapy based on genetic, metabolic, and clinical phenotypes [^1177BTMe]. Integrated care models coordinate diabetes care with cardiovascular, renal, and mental health services [^notfound]. Expanded use of digital health and artificial intelligence supports personalized, data-driven care [^114dERD3].

---

Diabetes management protocols are **comprehensive, evidence-based, and individualized**, integrating lifestyle, pharmacotherapy, education, and technology to optimize outcomes. Hospital protocols emphasize insulin-based care and hypoglycemia prevention, while outpatient care focuses on sustained self-management and risk reduction.

### Comparing the efficacy, safety, and utility of intensive insulin algorithms for a primary care practice [^117TFomu]. Diabetes Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Diabetes management is firmly based within the primary care community. Landmark randomized, controlled trials have demonstrated that even modest reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) can yield improvements in economic and medical end-points. Diabetes is a chronic, progressive disease associated with loss of pancreatic β-cell function. Therefore, most patients will eventually require insulin therapies in order to achieve their individualized targeted HbA 1c as their β-cell function and mass wanes. Although clinicians understand the importance of early insulin initiation, there is little agreement as to when to introduce insulin as a therapeutic option. Once initiated, questions remain as to whether to allow the patients to self-titrate their dose or whether the dosing should be tightly regulated by the clinician. Physicians have many evidence-based basal insulin protocols from which to choose, all of which have been shown to drive HbA1c levels to the American Diabetes Association target of ≤ 7%. This article will discuss ways by which insulin therapies can be effectively introduced to patients within busy primary care practices. Published evidence-based basal insulin protocols will be evaluated for safety and efficacy.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American diabetes association consensus statement on inpatient glycemic control [^114Fwz15]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Although hyperglycemia is associated with adverse patient outcomes, intervention to normalize glycemia has yielded inconsistent results. Indeed, recent trials in critically ill patients have failed to showa significant improvement in mortality with intensive glycemic control or have even shown increased mortality risk. Moreover, these recent RCTs have highlighted the risk of severe hypoglycemia resulting from such efforts. These outcomes have contributed to confusion regarding specific glycemic targets and the means for achieving them in both critically ill and noncritically ill patients.

Recognizing the importance of glycemic control across the continuum of care, the AACE and the ADA joined forces to develop this updated consensus statement on inpatient glycemic management. The central goals were to identify reasonable, achievable, and safe glycemic targets and to describe the protocols, procedures, and system improvements needed to facilitate their implementation. This document is addressed to health care professionals, supporting staff, hospital administrators, and other stakeholders focused on improved management of hyperglycemia in inpatient settings. Consensus panel members extensively reviewed the most current literature and considered the following questions:
Does improving glycemic control improve clinical outcomes for inpatients with hyperglycemia?
What glycemic targets can be recommended in different patient populations?
What treatment options are available for achieving optimal glycemic targets safely and effectively in specific clinical situations?
Does inpatient management of hyperglycemia represent a safety concern?
What systems need to be in place to achieve these recommendations?
Is treatment of inpatient hyperglycemia cost-effective?
What are the optimal strategies for transition to outpatient care?
What are areas for future research?

### Pathways to quality inpatient management of hyperglycemia and diabetes: a call to action [^11227pYa]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Implementation and impact of glycemic management teams

In 2004, the American College of Endocrinology published a position statement outlining the rationale for inpatient glycemic control. Following this early consensus conference, numerous successful campaigns were launched to inspire and produce champions in the burgeoning field of inpatient diabetes management. In 2009, the American College of Endocrinology partnered with the American Diabetes Association and released a call to action that outlined strategies for successful implementation of inpatient glucose management programs. Although clinical studies evaluating insulin use in the hospital setting have continued to emerge since then, rigorous scientific studies examining the risks and benefits of institutional programs with multilevel interventions have lagged behind. The optimal study should evaluate valid process (e.g. protocol adherence and prescribing practices), intermediary (e.g. glycemic control), clinical (e.g. nosocomial infections), and economic (e.g. length of stay) outcomes, as well as institutional acceptance and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, the expertise of glycemic management teams may be particularly important when managing patients treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or other special populations, such as those receiving enteral and parenteral nutrition, glucocorticoids, and transplant medications (see below). In this era of accountable care, high-quality research to identify the most effective glycemic management program characteristics and components, and the information systems required to maintain them, is absolutely imperative, since 30–50% of adult inpatients have diabetes and/or hyperglycemia during their hospital stay.

Suggested future directions.

Given ethical considerations in not exposing all inpatients to the same quality of care and logistical issues, RCTs in this area are challenging. However, several groups have described quality improvement statistical methodologies that allow systematic evaluation of a program's impact on outcomes using process control charts. These methodologies should be used to 1) systematically evaluate the impact of multicomponent glucose management programs on process, intermediary, and clinical outcomes before and after the interventions, and (2) evaluate institutional interventions through regularly scheduled cycles of performance improvement (e.g. Plan-Do-Study-Act) allowing real-time alternations to make interventions most effective. Finally, multicenter prospective "trials" are needed to examine the impact of different team-based glycemic control strategies at single healthcare organizations (e.g. physician-led team vs. midlevel care provider-led team) on process, intermediary, and clinical outcomes.

### Empowering patients in chronic care to improve diabetes distress and glycaemic control: protocol for a hybrid implementation-effectiveness clinical trial [^1155X6AA]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes mellitus is a global epidemic affecting more than 380 million individuals. 1 Individuals with diabetes often struggle to make the behavioural and lifestyle changes necessary to prevent diabetes complications. 2 Diabetes care experiences often carry a high emotional burden leading to worry and distress associated with diabetes self‐care. 3 Furthermore, patients with high levels of diabetes‐related distress are significantly more likely to have poor glycaemic control, self‐care and quality of life. 3 Identifying and implementing effective behavioural change interventions into routine practice is essential and requires the engagement of a coordinated, interprofessional team that supports patients. 4 Goal‐setting promotes diabetes control by improving self‐management behaviours and trust in one's clinicians. 5 Collaborative goal‐setting is an evidence‐based, behaviour change strategy for improving diabetes outcomes in primary care. 6

Empowering Patients in Chronic Care (EPIC) is a patient‐centred intervention that uses collaborative goal‐setting to improve diabetes outcomes. EPIC uses a group‐based approach and motivational interviewing techniques to activate patients, 7 guide them in setting diabetes goals and action plans, 6 develop skills to communicate goals with healthcare providers, 8 and negotiate action plans to achieve their goals. 5 An efficacy study demonstrated that EPIC significantly improved haemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) levels compared with usual diabetes care plus diabetes and nutrition education. 7 Moreover, EPIC sustained significant HbA 1c improvements over 12 months, contrasting many diabetes education and self‐management interventions that experience significant regression to mean after 4 months. 9

Translating behaviour change interventions into routine primary care can be challenging. Barriers to implementation include economic disincentives, administrative burdens, education and time pressures. 10 The patient‐centred medical home is a model of primary care designed to address some of these barriers using behavioural and systems‐based methods to activate and empower patients and coordinate interprofessional teams to improve chronic illness care. 11 Building on the prior evidence‐base for the EPIC intervention, we partnered with a large health system implementing a patient‐centred medical home model to conduct a randomized clinical effectiveness trial of the EPIC intervention embedded across several of its primary care networks. 12 The aims of this trial are to evaluate: (a) the clinical effectiveness of EPIC to improve diabetes control and reduce diabetes‐related distress among adults with diabetes, and (b) the implementation of EPIC in several primary care practices. We hypothesized that patients who received EPIC would have significant improvements in HbA 1c and diabetes distress levels post‐intervention and that these effects would be sustained 10‐months after enrolment.

### Improving care and promoting health in populations: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1114hJVh]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

American Diabetes Association — Diabetes and population health recommendations are as follows. Ensure treatment decisions are timely, rely on evidence-based guidelines, capture key elements within the social determinants of health, and are made collaboratively with people with or at risk for diabetes and caregivers based on individual preferences, prognoses, comorbidities, and informed financial considerations. B Align approaches to diabetes management with evidence-based care models. These models emphasize person-centered team care, integrated long-term treatment approaches to diabetes and comorbidities, and ongoing collaborative communication and goal setting between all team members and with people with diabetes. A Care systems should facilitate in-person and virtual team-based care, include those knowledgeable and experienced in diabetes management as part of the team, and utilize patient registries, decision support tools, proactive care planning, and community involvement to meet needs of individuals with diabetes. B Assess diabetes management, risk factors, and complications (Table 4.1) using reliable and relevant data metrics to improve processes of care and health outcomes, with attention to care costs, individual preferences and goals for care, and treatment burden. B Health systems should adopt a culture of quality improvement, implement benchmarking programs, and engage interprofessional teams to support sustainable and scalable process changes to improve quality of care and health outcomes.

### Brief intervention in type 1 diabetes-education for self-efficacy (BITES): protocol for a randomised control trial to assess biophysical and psychological effectiveness [^111dToGQ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Self-management is a critical component in effective preventive care for people with diabetes and a key focus area for public policy in the UK. Educational interventions designed to provide diabetes patients with self-management skills have been shown to reduce blood glucose concentration which in turn has the potential to reduce rates of complications. However, the evidence to support type, quantity, setting and mode of delivery of self-management education is sparse.

In the UK, the Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) group was the first to deliver an effective educational programme for type 1 diabetes. DAFNE is based on a successful inpatient programme developed in Düsseldorf, Germany and is delivered in 35 hours over five consecutive days. Many diabetes teams in the UK have since developed brief educational programs delivered in 15 to 24 hours over 4 to 6 weeks.

In response to Department of Health initiatives and in light of reported benefits in trials, we developed an educational and psychosocial intervention that is acceptable to people with diabetes, feasible and cost-effective in practice. This local study will also test the feasibility of a multi-centre pragmatic randomised trial in this field, and provide evidence about the likely size of the therapeutic effect.

### Diabetes management in correctional institutions [^116YMrLG]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

SELF-MANAGEMENT EDUCATION

Self-management education is the cornerstone of treatment for all people with diabetes. The health staff must advocate for patients to participate in self-management as much as possible. Individuals with diabetes who learn self-management skills and make lifestyle changes can more effectively manage their diabetes and avoid or delay complications associated with diabetes. In the development of a diabetes self-management education program in the correctional environment, the unique circumstances of the patient should be considered while still providing, to the greatest extent possible, the elements of the "National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education". A staged approach may be used depending on the needs assessment and the length of incarceration. Table 2 sets out the major components of diabetes self-management education. Survival skills should be addressed as soon as possible; other aspects of education may be provided as part of an ongoing education program.

Table 2
Major components of diabetes self-management education

Ideally, self-management education is coordinated by a certified diabetes educator who works with the facility to develop polices, procedures, and protocols to ensure that nationally recognized education guidelines are implemented. The educator is also able to identify patients who need diabetes self-management education, including an assessment of the patients' medical, social, and diabetes histories; diabetes knowledge, skills, and behaviors; and readiness to change.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: the use of advanced technology in the management of persons with diabetes mellitus [^1169r7xq]. Endocrine Practice (2021). High credibility.

Advanced diabetes technology — evidence review and grading methods — AACE committees identified the need for the guideline and empaneled a task force for development in adherence to the 2017 AACE Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Practice Guidelines. A methodologist conducted comprehensive PubMed searches using medical subject headings, field descriptions, and free-text terms for human studies in English between January 1, 2012 and February 1, 2021, and bibliographies of select articles were also reviewed. The AACE methodologist and staff assigned evidence levels and study types and extracted structured data from full-text articles; the methodologist assigned a quality grade for each article that informed grades for the confidence and strength of evidence for each recommendation. When supporting literature was lacking, recommendations were developed based on expert opinion and consensus, and final recommendation grades and strength of evidence were confirmed through discussion and consensus of the full task force.

### The OPTIMISE study protocol: a multicentre optimisation trial comparing continuous glucose monitoring, snacking habits, sleep extension and values-guided self-care interventions to improve glucose time-in-range in young people (13–20 years) with type 1 diabetes [^111BJbY5]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes are required to perform multiple self-care tasks every day. The complexities associated with adhering to intensive self-management plans highlight the need for intervention studies to target direct and indirect factors that may support young people to achieving young people's glycaemic goals. This research uses a pragmatic approach to develop an effective, robust, and scalable intervention to support young people with type 1 diabetes to increase their glucose TIR.

The strength of this research is the factorial experimental design that enables an estimation of the main effect of each component on TIR and the interactions between components. This will result in an intervention that optimises both resource-use and health outcomes because only the most active combination of components will be included and less effective components will not. Once the optimised intervention is identified then its effectiveness can be assessed in a randomised controlled trial. This research will add to the evidence of effective diabetes self-care behaviour change strategies targeting a whole-person approach to the care of young people with type 1 diabetes.

Team-driven protocols — process and monitoring: It is not enough to have a designated team; the team must be used effectively and outcomes should be monitored in a structured fashion, with a pathway to set up team structure, establish goals, and ensure goals are met. Published CPCs from medical and surgical societies establish best practices, though they are not always feasible in all settings, and current CPCs exist for PAD in diabetes and diabetic foot.

Choosing the Optimal Insulin-Replacement Protocol

Optimal diabetes management should be patient-centered. With the exception of the 4-T Study, all of the protocols mentioned in this manuscript allowed patients (including those who are insulin naive) to titrate their own insulin regimens. Insulin pen delivery devices should be used to titrate and administer insulin due to their ease of use and dosing accuracy. Patients may find increasing insulin 1 to 2 units more difficult when using a syringe and vial versus dosing with a pen device. One should consider stopping oral agents when insulin is initiated. However, continued use of metformin appears to be a rational choice as metformin may minimize weight gain associated with insulin use. Metformin has also been associated with a lower cancer mortality rate compared with nonuse of the drug.

Using the TITRATE protocol as a model, one would initiate basal insulin at the dose of 0.1–0.2 units/kg once daily (usually at bedtime). The desired targeted fasting blood glucose level could be identified for the patient. Although TITRATE had a very aggressive target of 70–90 mg/dL or 80–110 mg/dL, certainly less stringent glycemic goals could be recommended to each patient based upon individualized treatment targets, duration of diabetes, age, history of hypoglycemic unawareness, or history of cardiovascular disease.

Psychosocial screening — scope and timing note that "Health care teams and clinical practices should develop and implement psychosocial screening protocols to ensure routine monitoring of psychosocial well-being and to identify potential concerns among people with diabetes, following published guidance and recommendations", recognizing that "Clinically significant behavioral health diagnoses are considerably more prevalent in people with diabetes than in those without". Screening content "may include, but are not limited to, attitudes about diabetes, expectations for treatment and outcomes… general and diabetes-related mood, stress, and/or quality of life… available resources… and/or psychiatric history", and "Given elevated rates of suicidality among people with diabetes, screening for suicidality may also be warranted". Key times include that "Key opportunities for psychosocial screening occur at diabetes diagnosis, during regularly scheduled management visits, during hospitalizations, with new onset of complications, during significant transitions in care… at the time of medical treatment changes, or when problems with achieving A1C goals, quality of life, or self-management are identified".

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^116FGaQW]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a chronic illness that requires continuing medical care and ongoing patient self-management education and support to prevent acute complications and to reduce the risk of long-term complications. Diabetes care is complex and requires that many issues, beyond glycemic control, be addressed. A large body of evidence exists that supports a range of interventions to improve diabetes outcomes.

These standards of care are intended to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, payors, and other interested individuals with the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals, and tools to evaluate the quality of care. While individual preferences, comorbidities, and other patient factors may require modification of goals, targets that are desirable for most patients with diabetes are provided. These standards are not intended to preclude clinical judgment or more extensive evaluation and management of the patient by other specialists as needed. For more detailed information about management of diabetes, refer to references–.

The recommendations included are screening, diagnostic, and therapeutic actions that are known or believed to favorably affect health outcomes of patients with diabetes. A grading system (Table 1), developed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and modeled after existing methods, was used to clarify and codify the evidence that forms the basis for the recommendations. The level of evidence that supports each recommendation is listed after each recommendation using the letters A, B, C, or E.

### Effects of concurrent aerobic and strength training in patients with type 2 diabetes: Bayesian pairwise and dose-response meta-analysis [^112vmkQ5]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Clinical implications

The findings of this study support the use of CT as a multi-benefit therapeutic strategy with the ability to flexibly adjust training doses to optimize outcomes based on patient-specific needs and abilities according to the exercise dose recommendation table (based on HbA1c) (table 3). It was also highlighted that patients with high HbA1c levels and low BMI achieved more significant intervention effects on CT. This suggests that CT is particularly effective in enhancing glycemic control and body composition in these patients. Therefore, CT should be considered a key component of a comprehensive type 2 diabetes management program that helps improve patients' overall health and reduces the risk of associated complications. These findings have important implications for clinical practitioners supporting patients with type 2 diabetes. Our findings emphasize that the systematic inclusion of concurrent training in treatment regimens, with precise dosage adjustments tailored to individual characteristics, is critical to combating this chronic metabolic disease and improving patients' quality of life and health outcomes. Clinical practitioners can use these results to optimize treatment regimens and, more effectively, help patients achieve their health goals. In addition, these findings provide valuable clinical guidance to advance personalized medicine and ensure more efficient treatment protocols.

### Empowering patients in chronic care to improve diabetes distress and glycaemic control: protocol for a hybrid implementation-effectiveness clinical trial [^116CCtvi]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The current study is a multisite, randomized clinical trial evaluating real‐world effectiveness and implementation of a collaborative goal‐setting intervention using practice‐based healthcare professionals in routine primary care settings. If evidence supports improvement in diabetic outcomes in this "real‐world" trial, then EPIC could be a viable, innovative strategy to improve the standard of care in diabetes self‐management.

Testing interventions delivered by practice‐based (not research‐based) healthcare professionals at multiple sites are logistically more complex and require significantly greater resources. We partnered with HCPs and clinic administrators to assess openness to adoption of EPIC. 12 We assessed the local culture, context and experience of each clinic to develop a robust bidirectional engagement between the research and clinic teams that considered: (a) ensuring that the intervention fell within recommended guidelines and fit the clinical organization's approach to patient care, (b) developing an open communication strategy with each of the clinics, (c) identifying and addressing the needs as shared by the healthcare professionals who would be carrying out the intervention. Only after this groundwork was complete did we attempt to bring EPIC out of the research laboratory and test it in "real‐world" settings.

To facilitate the EPIC intervention, it was important to align our activities with ongoing strategic priorities of our operational partner. Thus, we structured EPIC to align with our partner clinics' implementation of shared decision‐making for HbA 1c goals among their patients with diabetes. To align with our partners' focus on patient‐centredness, we also elicited patient's health‐related values that provide the motivation to control diabetes, improve health, and live according to what is most important. When healthcare decisions are aligned with patients' health values, patients are more likely to consent and adhere to those decisions. 3, 23

### Once-weekly insulin versus once-daily insulin for type 1 diabetes treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115tnAEF]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4.1 Clinical Practice Implications

Implementing once‐weekly insulin therapy in T1DM requires careful consideration of several key clinical practice elements. Patient selection is paramount, with ideal candidates being those who demonstrate poor adherence to daily regimens, maintain stable glucose control, or face significant barriers to daily insulin administration. Conversely, patients requiring frequent dose adjustments, those with a history of severe injection site reactions, or individuals with highly variable insulin requirements may be less suitable for this approach. Treatment decisions should carefully weigh the trade‐offs between a slight increase in HbA1c, a higher risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia, and potential adherence benefits, while also considering patient preferences and lifestyle factors. The monitoring strategy should be particularly rigorous during the initial transition period, incorporating more frequent blood glucose measurements, early assessment of injection sites, and close tracking of glycaemic patterns. Long‐term follow‐up should focus on regular evaluation of injection sites, monitoring for cumulative effects on glycaemic control, and ongoing assessment of patient satisfaction and adherence. Risk mitigation strategies should address both injection site reactions through proper site rotation and technique education, as well as glycaemic control through optimised mealtime insulin dosing and potential CGM use. Comprehensive patient education is essential, covering the new administration schedule, injection site management, the importance of maintaining scheduled doses, and modified sick‐day protocols. Healthcare systems must consider various factors, including potential reductions in supply costs and healthcare utilisation, insurance coverage implications and resource allocation for increased initial education time and modified follow‐up schedules. Future research priorities should address long‐term safety and efficacy, quality of life impact, cost‐effectiveness, optimal patient population identification and transition protocol development. Implementation should follow a structured approach, beginning with low‐risk patients and establishing clear monitoring protocols and communication channels. Success should be measured through systematic outcome monitoring, adverse event tracking, patient satisfaction assessment and adherence rate evaluation. While once‐weekly insulin presents a promising option for select T1DM patients, particularly those struggling with daily administration adherence, successful implementation requires careful patient selection, comprehensive monitoring and robust risk mitigation strategies within a framework of shared decision‐making between healthcare providers and patients.

Tier 1: well-validated core therapies

These interventions represent the best established and most effective and cost-effective therapeutic strategy for achieving the target glycemic goals. The tier one algorithm is the preferred route of therapy for most patients with type 2 diabetes.

Step 1: lifestyle intervention and metformin.

Based on the numerous demonstrated short- and long-term benefits that accrue when weight loss and increased levels of activity are achieved and maintained, as well as the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle interventions when they succeed, the consensus is that lifestyle interventions should be initiated as the first step in treating new-onset type 2 diabetes (Fig. 2). These interventions should be implemented by health care professionals with appropriate training — usually registered dietitians experienced in behavioral modification — and be sensitive to ethnic and cultural differences among populations. Moreover, lifestyle interventions to improve glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels, and to promote weight loss or at least avoid weight gain, should remain an underlying theme throughout the management of type 2 diabetes, even after medications are used. For the 10–20% of patients with type 2 diabetes who are not obese or overweight, modification of dietary composition and activity levels may play a supporting role, but medications are still generally required early in the course of diabetes (seebelow).

The authors recognize that for most individuals with type 2 diabetes, lifestyle interventions fail to achieve or maintain the metabolic goals either because of failure to lose weight, weight regain, progressive disease, or a combination of factors. Therefore, our consensus is that metformin therapy should be initiated concurrently with lifestyle intervention at diagnosis. Metformin is recommended as the initial pharmacological therapy, in the absence of specific contraindications, for its effect on glycemia, absence of weight gain or hypoglycemia, generally low level of side effects, high level of acceptance, and relatively low cost. Metformin treatment should be titrated to its maximally effective dose over 1–2 months, as tolerated (see text box, entitled Titration of Metformin). Rapid addition of other glucose-lowering medications should be considered in the setting of persistent symptomatic hyperglycemia.

Process

The guidelines and algorithm that follow are derived from two sources. One source is the clinical trials that address the effectiveness and safety of the different modalities of therapy. Here, the writing group reviewed a wide variety of studies related to the use of drugs as monotherapy or in combination to lower glycemia. Unfortunately, the paucity of high-quality evidence in the form of well-controlled clinical trials that directly compare different diabetes treatment regimens remains a major impediment to recommending one class of drugs, or a particular combination of therapies, over another.

The second source of material that informed our recommendations was clinical judgement, that is, our collective knowledge and clinical experience, which takes into account benefits, risks, and costs in the treatment of diabetes. As in all clinical decision making, an evidence-based review of the literature must also be supplemented by value judgements, where the benefits of treatment are weighed against risks and costs in a subjective fashion. While we realize that others may have different judgements, we believe that the recommendations made in this new iteration of our treatment algorithm will guide therapy and result in improved glycemic control and health status over time.

### Study protocol for exploring diabetes numeracy and health literacy across Europe (EDUCATE): a multicentre cross-sectional study [^114dERD3]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Achieving optimal glycaemic control remains a challenge for the majority of people with diabetes, particularly those on insulin therapy. Effective adherence to treatment regimens depends heavily on an individual's ability to read, understand and apply self‐management instructions. Over the past decade, advanced digital tools have been increasingly integrated into diabetes care to further support people with diabetes in achieving the recommended glycaemic targets. However, not all individuals benefit equally from these innovations. Hypoglycaemia remains a common and feared acute complication of insulin therapy, even among users of automated insulin delivery systems. Health literacy, digital health literacy and numeracy each play a distinct but interconnected role in the successful use of digital diabetes tools. Health literacy can be defined as 'the knowledge and competence to access, understand, appraise, and apply health information in order to make judgements and take decisions in everyday life concerning healthcare, disease prevention, and health promotion to maintain or improve quality of life'. Similarly, numeracy — a key component of health literacy — can be defined as 'the ability to understand and use numbers in daily life', whereas digital health literacy refers to 'someone's ability to use digital devices, software and applications effectively'.

### Producing a preference-based quality of LIFE measure to quantify the impact of HYPOGLYCAEMIA on people living with diabetes: a mixed-methods research protocol [^1155PC9b]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The global prevalence of diabetes is projected to rise to 783 million by 2045. Diabetes management usually requires glucose‐lowering medications, often with insulin or insulin secretagogues that have hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) as a side‐effect. Hypoglycaemia can have significant physiological and clinical consequences and affects the quality of life (QoL) of people living with diabetes (PLWD).

QoL is a multidimensional construct, that encompasses three broad components: physical (e.g. pain, mobility), psychological (e.g. self‐esteem, mood) and social (e.g. relationships with others). Health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) has been defined as "a term referring to the health aspects of quality of life, generally considered to reflect the impact of disease and treatment on disability and daily functioning; it has also been considered to reflect the impact of perceived health on an individual's ability to live a fulfilling life".HRQoL measures can be generic (i.e. reflecting the impact of health or illness generally) or condition‐specific (i.e. attributing QoL ratings to a particular medical condition or illness, or perhaps to a particular aspect of that condition).

A recent review of hypoglycaemia‐specific patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMs) found them limited in terms of their content and structural validity for assessing the impact of hypoglycaemia on QoL, suggesting a new PROM is required. Assessments of QoL or HRQoL are increasingly incorporated in the economic evaluation of clinical interventions and regulatory decision‐making; none of the PROMs evaluated in the review were suitable for this purpose, as they do not have the necessary scoring system based on preferences (i.e. are not preference‐based measures, PBMs). Whilst generic PBMs exist, they rarely reflect outcomes relevant (i.e. lack sensitivity) to the specific patient groups, and hence, over‐ or under‐estimate the cost‐effectiveness of the interventions examined. Interventions that are designed to alleviate hypoglycaemia come at a financial cost to individuals or healthcare systems, and therefore it is important that they are evaluated appropriately in terms of cost‐effectiveness analyses, which make use of valid and reliable PBMs, as well as their usefulness to the individual. Thus, there is a clear need for a new PROM and PBM to assess hypoglycaemia‐specific HRQoL among PLWD, developed according to best‐practice guidelines, with good validity and reliability, and able to directly inform the economic evaluation of health interventions.

### Association between diabetes self-management education attendance, hospital admissions and mortality in type 2 diabetes: a cohort analysis protocol [^1143FcBd]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes is a complex condition leading to disability and premature mortality with 7000 excess deaths in the United Kingdom in 2022. The International Diabetes Federation estimates 537 million people are living with diabetes globallyof whom approximately 4.3 million reside in the United Kingdom. Over 90% have type 2 diabetes, with an increased prevalence in areas with high deprivation, poor healthcare access, poorer housing, reduced finances and lower educational attainment.

Diabetes self‐management education (DSME), which includes support for healthy food and lifestyle choices, is fundamental to achieving good glycaemic control and is recommended internationally to help prevent diabetes‐related micro‐ and macrovascular complications. Indeed, early delivery of DSME with timely pharmacotherapy may be particularly beneficial through the so‐called legacy effect.

Despite the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) stating that DSME is the foundation for successful diabetes management and prevention of metabolic comorbidities, the UK National Diabetes Audit suggests of 71% of people with type 2 diabetes offered DSME, only 7% attend.

Conclusions

Type 2 diabetes is epidemic. Its long-term consequences translate into enormous human suffering and economic costs; however, much of the morbidity associated with long-term microvascular and neuropathic complications can be substantially reduced by interventions that achieve glucose levels close to the nondiabetic range. Although new classes of medications and numerous combinations have been demonstrated to lower glycemia, current-day management has failed to achieve and maintain the glycemic levels most likely to provide optimal healthcare status for people with diabetes.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a well-characterized disease affecting a significant population of pregnant women worldwide. It has been widely linked to undue weight gain associated with factors such as diet, obesity, family history, and ethnicity. Poorly controlled GDM results in maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Improved outcomes therefore rely on early diagnosis and tight glycaemic control. While straightforward protocols exist for screening and management of diabetes mellitus in the general population, management of GDM remains controversial with conflicting guidelines and treatment protocols. This review highlights the diagnostic and management options for GDM in light of recent advances in care.

Choosing specific diabetes interventions and their roles in treating type 2 diabetes

Numerous reviews have focused on the characteristics of the specific diabetes interventions listed below. In addition, meta-analyses and reviews have summarized and compared the glucose-lowering effectiveness and other characteristics of the medications. The aim here is to provide enough information to justify the choices of medications, the order in which they are recommended, and the use of combinations of therapies. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of high-quality studies that provide head-to-head comparisons of the ability of the medications to achieve the currently recommended glycemic levels. The authors highly recommend that such studies be conducted. However, even in the absence of rigorous, comprehensive studies that directly compare the efficacy of all available glucose-lowering treatments and their combinations, we feel that there are enough data regarding the characteristics of the individual interventions to provide the guidelines below.

An important intervention that is likely to improve the probability that a patient will have better long-term control of diabetes is to make the diagnosis early, when the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes are usually less severe. Lower levels of glycemia at the time of initial therapy are associated with lower A1C levels over time and decreased long-term complications.

2.4 Procedures

2.4.1 EPIC intervention

Participants enrolled in the EPIC intervention attended six bimonthly group sessions (approximately 60 minutes each). The sessions focused on collaborative goal‐setting and patient‐centred action planning. They were led by one to three HCPs. The intervention took approximately three months to complete. Figure 2 details the six sessions' structure and themes. A 10‐minute individual session immediately follow group sessions for each participant. During the individual sessions, participants met with an EPIC‐trained HCP to discuss their personal concerns, questions, and to set and adjust goals, including medications or monitoring instructions if indicated. The research team developed a detailed guide/workbook for the EPIC‐trained HCPs and participants to use throughout the intervention.

Figure 2

2.4.2 Enhanced usual care

Participants randomized to the EUC arm received routine care that included (a) educational materials about diabetes management, (b) an opportunity to participate in any self‐management resources routinely offered at their site, such as traditional diabetes education, nutritional counselling, medication management or weight loss support and (c) communication with their provider indicating the patient's desire for additional diabetes resources.

2.5 Primary outcome measurements

2.5.1 Effectiveness outcomes

To measure effectiveness and maintenance of the intervention, this study will examine two primary outcomes post‐intervention and 6 months post‐intervention: (a) change in HbA 1c level and (b) change in the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) score. We measured serum HbA 1c levels using clinical laboratories at the respective clinics using a standardized method of ion‐exchange liquid chromatography. Diabetes distress is an outcome of measure because it is an important patient‐reported quality of life measure for diabetes that is correlated with diabetes control. EPIC fundamentally rests on the individual with diabetes setting goals and actions plans to achieve those goals. The goals they set could address the distinct domains of diabetes‐related distress that include emotional, physician‐related, regime‐related, or interpersonal distress. Cumulatively, these add to diabetes distress. To measure distress specific to diabetes, we used the DDS, a 17‐item self‐report instrument that has high internal consistency, reliability (Cronbach's α = .93) and correlation with self‐care behaviours (r = .30, P < .001) and physical activity (r = .13, P < .01). 18

Grading of scientific evidence.

There has been considerable evolution in the evaluation of scientific evidence and in the development of evidence-based guidelines since the ADA first began publishing practice guidelines. Accordingly, we developed a classification system to grade the quality of scientific evidence supporting ADA recommendations for all new and revised ADA position statements.

Recommendations are assigned ratings of A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence (Table 1). Expert opinion (E) is a separate category for recommendations in which there is as yet no evidence from clinical trials, in which clinical trials may be impractical, or in which there is conflicting evidence. Recommendations with an "A" rating are based on large well-designed clinical trials or well-done meta-analyses. Generally, these recommendations have the best chance of improving outcomes when applied to the population to which they are appropriate. Recommendations with lower levels of evidence may be equally important but are not as well supported. The level of evidence supporting a given recommendation is noted either as a heading for a group of recommendations or in parentheses after a given recommendation.

Table 1
ADA evidence-grading system for clinical practice recommendations

Of course, evidence is only one component of clinical decision-making. Clinicians care for patients, not populations; guidelines must always be interpreted with the needs of the individual patient in mind. Individual circumstances, such as comorbid and coexisting diseases, age, education, disability, and, above all, patients' values and preferences, must also be considered and may lead to different treatment targets and strategies. Also, conventional evidence hierarchies, such as the one adapted by the ADA, may miss some nuances that are important in diabetes care. For example, while there is excellent evidence from clinical trials supporting the importance of achieving glycemic control, the optimal way to achieve this result is less clear. It is difficult to assess each component of such a complex intervention.

ADA will continue to improve and update the Clinical Practice Recommendations to ensure that clinicians, health plans, and policymakers can continue to rely on them as the most authoritative and current guidelines for diabetes care. Our Clinical Practice Recommendations are also available on the Association's website at.

Inpatient diabetes management — noncritically ill targets and insulin therapy: For most noncritically ill persons in the hospital setting, a glucose target of 140 to 180 mg/dL is recommended; a lower target range (100 to 140 mg/dL) may be reasonable when glycemic control can be achieved without hypoglycemia, whereas less stringent targets are appropriate for those with high clinical complexity, terminal illness, limited life expectancy, or high risk for hypoglycemia. Insulin therapy following approved protocols is recommended as the preferred therapy for managing hyperglycemia in the hospital, and for noncritically ill persons with T2D, an individualized approach is recommended and may include consideration of noninsulin agents alone or in combination with insulin. For hospitalized persons with satisfactory oral intake, the insulin regimen should include basal, prandial, and correction doses; for those without adequate food intake, basal, prandial, and correction doses should be used as necessary, and extensive use of "sliding-scale" insulin should only be used for those whose glucose are in the target range most of the time, and only occasionally exceed it.

Institutions should implement protocols using validated written or computerized provider order entry sets for management of dysglycemia in the hospital that allow for a personalized approach.

Grading of scientific evidence.

There has been considerable evolution in the evaluation of scientific evidence and in the development of evidence-based guidelines since the ADA first began publishing practice guidelines. Accordingly, we developed a classification system to grade the quality of scientific evidence supporting ADA recommendations for all new and revised ADA position statements.

Recommendations are assigned ratings of A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence (Table 1). Expert opinion (E) is a separate category for recommendations in which there is as yet no evidence from clinical trials, in which clinical trials may be impractical, or in which there is conflicting evidence. Recommendations with an "A" rating are based on large well-designed clinical trials or well-done meta-analyses. Generally, these recommendations have the best chance of improving outcomes when applied to the population to which they are appropriate. Recommendations with lower levels of evidence may be equally important but are not as well supported. The level of evidence supporting a given recommendation is noted either as a heading for a group of recommendations or in parentheses after a given recommendation.

Of course, evidence is only one component of clinical decision-making. Clinicians care for patients, not populations; guidelines must always be interpreted with the needs of the individual patient in mind. Individual circumstances, such as comorbid and coexisting diseases, age, education, disability, and, above all, patients' values and preferences, must also be considered and may lead to different treatment targets and strategies. Also, conventional evidence hierarchies, such as the one adapted by the ADA, may miss some nuances that are important in diabetes care. For example, while there is excellent evidence from clinical trials supporting the importance of achieving glycemic control, the optimal way to achieve this result is less clear. It is difficult to assess each component of such a complex intervention.

ADA will continue to improve and update the Clinical Practice Recommendations to ensure that clinicians, health plans, and policymakers can continue to rely on them as the most authoritative and current guidelines for diabetes care. Our Clinical Practice Recommendations are also available on the Association's website at.

Behavioral self-management in diabetes and chronic kidney disease — self-management strategies should be key components of a multifaceted treatment plan with attention to multiple behaviors (C), including monitoring and treatment of glycemia, blood pressure, nutrition, smoking cessation, exercise, and adherence to medicines; behavioral self-management in patients with diabetes and CKD is particularly challenging because of the intensive nature of the diabetes regimen, and education alone is not sufficient to promote and sustain healthy behavior change.

Allocation

We assessed a total of 267/553 studies (48%) to have used appropriate methods for random sequence allocation. Only 17 studies (3%) used non‐random methods and we judged them at high risk of bias for this domain. The rest of the studies provided insufficient information about the sequence generation process to judge the risk of bias (n = 269, 49%). We rated allocation concealment as adequate in 225 studies (41%), either because the unit of allocation was by institution, team or professional and allocation was performed on all units at the start of the study, or a suitable method was used to conceal allocation. We judged 19 studies (3%) at high risk of bias, and more than half of studies (n = 309, 56%) did not provide enough information to assess whether allocation concealment was appropriate.

Blinding

Blinding was not a major issue as most of our outcomes of interest were objective measures. We assessed 76% (419/553) of studies to be low risk of bias; 5% (27/553) to be high risk of bias and 19% (107/553) as unclear risk.

Incomplete outcome data

We assessed 36% of studies (198/553) to be low risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and 13% (72/553) of studies to be unclear. We assessed more than half (51% of studies; 283/553) to be high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. Cluster trials were at greater risk of patient‐level attrition than patient‐randomised trials.

Selective reporting

We judged 41% of included studies (224/553) as low risk and 35% (195/553) as high risk for selective outcome reporting. The latter had discrepancies between the expected primary outcomes reporting and published data. We judged studies at unclear risk (24%, 132/553) if they lacked a study protocol or trial register entry, or registration was performed retrospectively.

Other potential sources of bias

For the risk of other potential sources of bias, we judged 87% of studies (480/553) to be low risk, 11% (63/553) to be unclear risk and 2% (10/553) to be high risk.

### Utility of precision medicine in the management of diabetes: expert opinion from an international panel [^1177BTMe]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Different Models for Understanding Diabetes Clusters

Researchers have noted the heterogenous nature of diabetes and attempted to identify different variables that can help improve our understanding of the pathophysiological architecture of T2DM.

Ahlqvist et al. used patient data from Swedish patients who had beene recently diagnosed with diabetes. During the study, machine learning algorithms were applied, and diabetes subtypes were classified. The investigators identified five subtypes based on six different variables (age at diagnosis, body mass index, glycated hemoglobin, glutamate decarboxylase antibodies, homeostasis model assessment, and c-peptide).

McCarthy et al. proposed a different model, called the 'palette model', which categorizes every individual according to the various pathophysiological processes that have been identified to contribute to the risk and progression of diabetes. The model considers that every person with diabetes will have multiple parallel defects that will affect several other processes.

Although it is well accepted that the role of precision medicine in diabetes management is indisputable, the path by which prescision medicine can be used to optimize the prevention and treatment of diabetes and other diseases is still unclear. In this regard, a few precision medicine initiatives have been proposed that present a clear plan for clinical translation. Some of the factors that should be considered in order to achieve this objective include an understanding of the disease, the identification of disease-specific biomarkers, vertical integration of biomarkers and algorithms, regulatory agencies and approval, patient engagement, testing of biomarker/s in clinical trials, clinician engagement, regulatory approval, implications on the economics of healthcare, clinical translation (including continuing education of clinicians and support) and patient feedback.

Global Initiatives on Precision Medicine Relevant to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

The rapid growth of large data sets, machine learning and collaborative networks have given rise to many initiatives, many of which were started globally, with the aim to understand the role of precision medicines in T2DM.

A joint statement published by the ADA and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) contained a general recommendation on moving toward a 'patient-centered approach' from a protocol-driven approach. This position statement is based on an evaluation of the safety, efficacy and tolerability of each class of diabetes drugs and recommends that "Choice is based on patient preferences as well as various patient, disease, and drug characteristics, with the goal being to reduce glucose concentrations while minimizing side effects, especially hypoglycemia".

In this regard, countries like Australia, China, the European Union, Sweden, Saudi Arabia, Nordic nations and the UK are not far behind.

### Impact of technology-based interventions for children and young people with type 1 diabetes on key diabetes self-management behaviours and prerequisites: a systematic review [^115QtPS5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is increasing in prevalence in the UK, affecting over 30,000 children and young people and so diabetes management typically begins early in life. The management of T1DM is complex and involves key self-management behaviours outlined in national recommendations (NICE), including: self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), insulin administration, dietary management and regular physical activity, with the aim of maintaining optimal blood glucose levels. Further, NICE guidance highlights key psychological and clinical (HbA1c) prerequisites to self-management behaviour. A focus on any or all of these components will lead to improved diabetes control.

Technology-based interventions may augment face-to-face interactions with therapeutic staff, thereby offering the potential to reduce the costs and dependence on clinical staff of providing additional services beyond regular clinical visits. Efficacious delivery of policy objectives in clinical care through technology-based mediums could therefore contribute to reducing the economic burden of T1DM. Technology-based interventions also augment standard services, increasing access and availability of evidence-based practices outside clinical settings. This could be a useful adjunct to the usual care of children and young people with T1DM, particularly as increasing independence and self-reliance is a concern amongst this group. Prior non-systematic reviews demonstrate that technology-based interventions promoting diabetes self-management may be acceptable to children and young people with T1DM, and have the potential to improve certain outcomes and behaviours (e.g. HbA1c, blood glucose monitoring).

The purpose of this systematic review is to critically analyse the literature assessing the effectiveness of technology-based interventions for children and young people with T1DM on the diabetes self-management behaviours and prerequisites that are highlighted by current treatment guidelines as being crucial for effective diabetes management. In this way, this review will identify aspects of national guidance which may be effectively promoted to children and young people using technological tools.

### Implementation of a multi-level community-clinical linkage intervention to improve glycemic control among south Asian patients with uncontrolled diabetes: study protocol of the DREAM initiative [^112d9iRs]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent studies have demonstrated that EHR access and communication between the PCP and CHW can facilitate the acceptance and effectiveness of emerging care management models and lead to improved patient outcomes. Further, an emerging body of literature suggests that CHW and PCP efforts can be bolstered through integration of HIT tools that support referral to social services that address upstream determinants of health. However, no studies have been conducted in small primary care settings focusing on South Asian American communities. Several studies have noted that integrating health systems, provider, patient, and community level intervention components may enhance the impact of diabetes management interventions; however, few have examined the impact of integrating multiple components and engagement of both physician and non-physician members of the healthcare team, including CHWs, in these efforts. Scalable and sustainable models that assess the integration and implementation of multi-level interventions in clinical practice settings are needed, particularly for immigrant and LEP populations such as the South Asian community.

This study protocol for the Diabetes Research, Education, and Action for Minorities (DREAM) Initiative, a multi-level diabetes management intervention designed to support South Asian patients with uncontrolled diabetes in NYC through clinic-community linkages, will support our aims to: 1) Test the effectiveness of a multi-level diabetes management intervention compared to usual care; and 2) Use a mixed-methods approach to systematically assess the implementation process and delineate factors influencing fidelity, adoption, and maintenance of the intervention within clinical and community settings. We hypothesize that compared to usual care, individuals receiving the multi-level diabetes management intervention will be 15% more likely to achieve at least a 0.5% reduction in HbA1c at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include a decrease in weight, body mass index (BMI), and LDL cholesterol; change in use of community and social services and self-efficacy related to healthcare, diabetes management, medication adherence, and health behaviors; and cost-effectiveness.

Type 1 diabetes — insulin administration technique and site management should emphasize subcutaneous delivery and prevention of lipohypertrophy. Exogenously delivered insulin should be injected or infused into subcutaneous tissue, not intramuscularly. Recent evidence supports the use of short needles (e.g., 4–mm pen needles) as effective and well tolerated compared with longer needles. People treated with insulin and/or caregivers should receive education about proper injection or infusion site rotation and how to recognize and avoid injecting in areas of lipohypertrophy, and examination of insulin administration sites and assessment of injection technique are key components of a comprehensive diabetes medical examination and treatment plan.

Comprehensive multifactorial care components in diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD): As key components of multifaceted intervention, clinicians should encourage people with diabetes and CKD to adopt healthy lifestyles that include improved nutrition, exercise, and smoking cessation, and interventions should focus on aggressive treatment of CKD stage 1–5; although glycemic control has not been proven beneficial for kidney outcomes, it reduces risks for retinopathy and neuropathy, and treatment of elevated LDL-C improves cardiovascular outcomes in people with diabetes (except for those with LDL-C concentrations between 120 and 190 mg/dL who initiate statin therapy while on hemodialysis therapy); comprehensive care includes management of diabetes according to current standards, achieving glycemic targets with a combination of lifestyle approaches, behavioral self-management, and medicines, attention to screening for common comorbidities and referral to specialists such as those for eye and foot care, and, given the greatly increased CVD risk, managing risk factors with a goal of minimizing CVD.

Research and operational considerations — The guideline calls for further research, including evaluating accuracy and safety of initiating CGM devices in different inpatient populations to define inpatients at high risk who can be recommended to benefit, and assessing whether inpatient CGM should be used to determine insulin dosing given current reliance on POC-BG checks for patients wearing their own CGMs when hospitalized. Operationally, hospitals should monitor regulatory changes as inpatient CGM currently has emergency use authorization due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and expanding CGM use will require substantial resource utilization and support with HCP education, clear protocols, process maps, and documentation guidelines.

### Task-sharing interventions for improving control of diabetes in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113nBRKF]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Task-shared interventions for diabetes management mainly comprise non-pharmacological lifestyle interventions and pharmacological components. When delivered by higher cadres of health workers, both the non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions resulted in meaningful reductions in HbA 1c. In general, diabetes self-management education and support have been proven to be effective in glycaemic control. Additionally, diabetes self-management education programmes have been organised in high-income settings using health-care workers such as nurses, pharmacists, and certified diabetes educators. Health systems in LMICs have traditionally been organised around vertical disease management programmes and hence the care processes have mostly centred on physicians. This places a high work burden on physicians and poorly defines the roles of other health-care workers in LMICs. Therefore, it is necessary to restructure and organise roles for non-physician health-care workers and to provide adequate training and supervision for effectively managing diabetes and other chronic non-communicable disease conditions in an integrated team-based care model.

The non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions delivered by pharmacists in the studies included emphasised medication adherence as a key strategy that resulted in better glycaemic outcomes. Similar effects of glycaemic control were shown in studies that emphasised improving adherence to glycaemic medications. Hence, adherence improvement should be considered as a major component of task sharing intervention studies in management of diabetes outcomes in LMICs.

The wide prediction intervals of the effect estimates observed in our study could be attributable to the variation in glycaemic outcomes of task-sharing strategies across different WHO regions. The WHO regions differ in terms of health-care system characteristics and doctor–population ratios. Further, they employ different cadres of health workers for task-sharing interventions. Therefore, careful selection of the cadre of health workers and the capacity for supervision by physicians are important parameters in the scale-up of task-sharing interventions to improve glycaemic outcomes in LMICs.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^116qZT8W]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Glycemic management in type 2 diabetes mellitus has become increasingly complex and, to some extent, controversial, with a widening array of pharmacological agents now available, mounting concerns about their potential adverse effects and new uncertainties regarding the benefits of intensive glycemic control on macrovascular complications. Many clinicians are therefore perplexed as to the optimal strategies for their patients. As a consequence, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) convened a joint task force to examine the evidence and develop recommendations for antihyperglycemic therapy in nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes. Several guideline documents have been developed by members of these two organizations and by other societies and federations (,–). However, an update was deemed necessary because of contemporary information on the benefits/risks of glycemic control, recent evidence concerning efficacy and safety of several new drug classes, the withdrawal/restriction of others, and increasing calls for a move toward more patient-centered care.

This statement has been written incorporating the best available evidence and, where solid support does not exist, using the experience and insight of the writing group, incorporating an extensive review by additional experts (acknowledged below). The document refers to glycemic control; yet this clearly needs to be pursued within a multifactorial risk reduction framework. This stems from the fact that patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; the aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure and lipid therapy, antiplatelet treatment, and smoking cessation) is likely to have even greater benefits.

These recommendations should be considered within the context of the needs, preferences, and tolerances of each patient; individualization of treatment is the cornerstone of success. Our recommendations are less prescriptive than and not as algorithmic as prior guidelines. This follows from the general lack of comparative-effectiveness research in this area. Our intent is therefore to encourage an appreciation of the variable and progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, the specific role of each drug, the patient and disease factors that drive clinical decision making, and the constraints imposed by age and comorbidity. The implementation of these guidelines will require thoughtful clinicians to integrate current evidence with other constraints and imperatives in the context of patient-specific factors.

### Triaging and initial treatment in the patient with suspected type 2 diabetes [^111vKSNn]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Insulin titration protocol: weaning — manage insulin reduction with the following steps and thresholds. If still on MDI, stop short acting insulin and contact approximately every 3 days to review glucoses. Wait until fasting numbers are < 100 mg/dl for at least 2–3 days in a 5–7 day period. If so, cut back long-acting insulin dose by 20%/10 units, but may consider 30%/15–20 units if glucoses are 80 mg/dl or less, and consider reliability of patient contact when making the decision to more aggressively wean insulin. Once the dose is down to 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day, consider stopping, and consider using a small decrease in insulin as a motivational factor to continue to maintain contact. If patient was lost to follow-up between onset visit and follow-up visit, but has an HbA1c < 6% 3 months+ after diagnosis and is on full-dose metformin (or pioglitazone), stop long-acting insulin with careful monitoring after. If HbA1c is 6.5–7% at the next visit, add a second agent.

The National Standards for DSMES include delivery of content addressing "Pathophysiology of diabetes and treatment options", "Healthy coping", "Healthy eating", "Being active", "Taking medication", "Monitoring", "Reducing risk (treating acute and chronic complications)", and "Problem solving and behavior change strategies". Critical time points for DSMES evaluation and referral include "Annually and/or when not meeting treatment goals, whichever is more frequent", "When complicating factors (e.g., health conditions, physical or functional limitations, emotional factors, and basic living needs) that influence self-management develop", and "When transitions in life and care occur". DSMES is person-centered and empowerment-focused, as "DSMES empowers individuals with diabetes by providing them with tools to make informed self-management decisions (4)", "DSMES should be person-centered — placing the person with diabetes and their family and/or support system at the center of the care model as they work in collaboration with health care professionals", and "Person-centered care is respectful of and responsive to individual and cultural preferences, needs, and values".

Diabetic foot disorders clinical practice guideline (CPG) — based on the consensus of current clinical practice and review of the clinical literature — states that foot ulcerations, infections, Charcot neuroarthropathy, and peripheral arterial disease frequently result in gangrene and lower limb amputation; consequently, foot disorders are leading causes of hospitalization for persons with diabetes and account for billion-dollar expenditures annually in the US, and dramatic reductions in frequency have been achieved by taking a multidisciplinary approach to patient management. The guideline reviews three major pedal complications of diabetes — diabetic foot ulcers, diabetic foot infections, and the diabetic Charcot foot — and provides evidence-based guidance for general patterns of practice without dictating care of all affected patients. In context, an estimated 7% of the US population has diabetes, and if the outlined concepts are incorporated into patient management protocols, a major reduction in diabetic limb amputations is certainly an attainable goal.

### The IDEAL (insulin therapy DE-intensificAtion with iglarLixi) randomised controlled trial-study design and protocol [^113UTgjP]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple daily injection insulin regimen (MDI), also referred to as intensive insulin therapy (IIT), represents the most complex type of insulin regimen used in the management of people with type 2 diabetes (PwT2D). Correspondingly, MDI regimen has been the last intensification step in the therapeutic guidelines for management of hyperglycaemia in T2D after non-pharmacological interventions, use of oral antidiabetic medication(s) and basal or premixed insulins. The major advantage of all insulin-based therapies is their rapid and dose-dependent glucose-lowering effect. This is counterbalanced by the increased risk of hypoglycaemia, a frequently observed tendency to weight gain and the necessity for frequent glucose monitoring and possible insulin dose adaptations by patients negatively affecting their compliance with therapy and quality of life. These unwanted side effects of insulin therapy become more prominent with the increased complexity of insulin regimens and increased number of injections per day.

The introduction of novel antidiabetic medications with pleiotropic effects reaching far beyond the reduction of glycaemia (HbA1c) such as glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) or sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) meant that insulin-based therapies were moved further down the treatment algorithms in the most relevant clinical guidelines for T2D management. Fixed-ratio combinations of basal insulin analogues and GLP-1 RA (FRC) benefit from complementary mechanisms of action of their two components that cumulatively address seven of the eight pathophysiological processes of the DeFronzo's ominous octet. Basal insulins provide control of fasting glucose, while GLP-1 RAs influence both fasting and postprandial glycaemia and reduce food intake and glycaemia by stimulation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppression of glucagon secretion, delay in gastric emptying and suppression of appetite. Consequently, the glucose-lowering effect of FRCs is complemented by comparable or lower risk of hypoglycaemia compared to basal insulin therapy, neutral effect on body weight and a lower risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects compared to GLP-1-RA when used alone. Because of these favourable developments, we are currently seeing a significant pool of PwT2D in whom the MDI regimen was initiated at a time when no other options were available. Yet, currently, these individuals could benefit from simplified insulin regimens ideally taking advantage of the beneficial effects of the novel classes of antidiabetic medications.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^111gjVNW]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Algorithm

The algorithm (Fig. 2) takes into account the characteristics of the individual interventions, their synergies, and expense. The goal is to achieve and maintain A1C levels of < 7% and to change interventions at as rapid a pace as titration of medications allows when target glycemic goals are not being achieved. Mounting evidence suggests that aggressive lowering of glycemia, especially with insulin therapy, in newly diagnosed diabetes can result in sustained remissions, i.e. normoglycemia without need for glucose-lowering medications. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, and patients should be informed that they are likely to require the addition of glucose-lowering medications over time.

The amylin agonists, α-glucosidase inhibitors, glinides, and DPP-4 inhibitors are not included in the two tiers of preferred agents in this algorithm, owing to their lower or equivalent overall glucose-lowering effectiveness compared with the first- and second-tier agents and/or to their limited clinical data or relative expense (Table 1). However, they may be appropriate choices in selected patients.

Nearly 10% of the population in the United States has diabetes mellitus. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a well-known, serious, acute metabolic complication. While it is primarily associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus two-thirds of the time, it also occurs in type 2 diabetes mellitus approximately 34% of the time, often as a manifestation of the syndrome of ketosis-prone diabetes. The incidence of DKA continues to rise. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there were 140 000 hospital discharges from DKA in 2009 in the United States, about 75% increase over the last two decadeswith an estimated cost annually of > $2 billion and accounts for > 500 000 hospital days per year.

Along with identification of triggering factors, management of DKA involves correction of hyperglycemia, volume depletion, acid–base derangements and electrolyte imbalances. Because of the complexities in the management protocol, many cases of DKA are managed in intensive care units (ICUs) across the United States. Losses of fluids and electrolytes are significant causes of mortality and morbidity in DKA. The mortality is < 1% in American adults; however, rises to > 5% in the elderly population with significant comorbidities. In the United States, the age-adjusted mortality rate for hyperglycemic crisis declined between 1980 and 2009. In 2009, hyperglycemic crises caused 64% lower mortality than in 1980.

Evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of DKA have been published periodically in North Americaand Europeimproving the understanding and facilitating the development of management protocols. The outcomes of DKA have been shown to improve with adherence to treatment guidelines. Minor variants of the commonly used treatment protocol for DKA based on the published guidelines use insulin infusions and intravenous electrolyte solution and dextrose solution when blood sugar drops below 250 mg/dL. In order to correct dehydration in patients with DKA, intravenous electrolyte solutions are administered at the beginning of the treatment. As the blood glucose levels fall, a new bag of intravenous fluid with different dextrose concentrations would be ordered, and multiple sequential changes of bags would occur during the course of treatment. Despite their proven effectiveness, a varying degree of non-adherence to guidelines has been documented in the literature compromising the success of published protocols. Successful implementation of the conventional DKA protocol requires not only careful assessment of the clinical status of the patient and laboratory values, but frequent changes to intravenous fluids between saline and dextrose solutions.

Behavior Change in Persons with Diabetes: Does It Really Matter?

Management of diabetes is complex and challenging. Although medications and the approach to diabetes management are constantly changing, behavior is one component of diabetes management that remains constant. Behaviors associated with diabetes management among patients include timely administration of medication, calculating the appropriate dose based on available information, talking with others about diabetes, taking supplies and being prepared for unexpected events, and making timely appointments and ordering supplies. Behavioral management of diabetes has a positive impact on health outcomes.

The first step for a successful behavioral change in patients with diabetes includes providing information about the desired behavior change. The key considerations for advice on behavior change include:
Maintaining clarity in communication: Clearly communicating information on the desired behavior change may eliminate misunderstandings between physicians and patients with diabetes. Strategies to facilitate accurate understanding of recommendations include the following:
Simplifying the message: Focusing on a single recommendation at a time and providing a small quantity of information in multiple formats depending on the literacy level of the patient.
Focusing on a single recommendation at a time with small chunks of information.
Providing information in multiple formats (e.g. spoken, written, etc.) and at the literacy level of the individual.
Applying the teach-back method: For better comprehension of patients with low health literacy, they may be asked to teach the provider the key information that they have understood. In a direct observation study, which included 38 physicians and 74 patients with diabetes, it was reported that good glycemic control was achieved among patients with diabetes in whom the teach-back method was employed compared with those for whom this method was not used.
Avoiding 'one-size-fits–all' recommendations: Tailoring recommendations according to the patient's characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity, age and resources, help in successful behavior change. Motivational interviewing is one of the clinical approaches that provides health behavior advice in the context of individual beliefs and preferences, with potential applications and benefit in diabetes. In a randomized controlled trial, which included 66 teenagers (14–17 years) with type 1 DM attending a diabetes clinic in South Wales, UK, motivational interviewing facilitated improved behavioral changes in terms of positive well-being and improved quality of life and subsequent improvement in glycemic control.
Planning proper timing for health behavior message delivery: Diabetes care visits are often scheduled quarterly, making it difficult to provide timely behavioral recommendations. Advising patients to pair the recommended behavior with an existing daily routine (e.g. pairing blood glucose monitoring with brushing teeth in the morning and evening) can help in sustaining the recommended behavior.
Being empathetic and supportive: Healthcare providers should be compassionate and supportive while communicating about self-management of diabetes. For example, the tone of the healthcare provider while providing recommendations for behavior change should be encouraging instead of discouraging. Shaming, guilt trips and scaring the patients do not help in implementing and sustaining behavior change.

Recommendations

All patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital should have their diabetes clearly identified in the medical record. (E)
All patients with diabetes should have an order for blood glucose monitoring, with results available to all members of the health care team. (E)
Goals for blood glucose levels: Critically ill surgical patients' blood glucose levels should be kept as close to 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) as possible and generally < 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l). (A) These patients require an intravenous insulin protocol that has demonstrated efficacy and safety in achieving the desired glucose range without increasing risk for severe hypoglycemia. (E) Critically ill nonsurgical patients' glycemic targets are less well defined. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols targeting blood glucose levels < 110–140 mg/dl have been shown to reduced morbidity and mortality in some, but not all studies. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols that effectively and safely keep blood glucose < 140 mg/dl are recommended. (C) For non–critically ill patients, there is no clear evidence for specific blood glucose goals. Since cohort data suggest that outcomes are better in hospitalized patients with fasting glucose < 126 mg/dl and all random glucoses < 180–200, these goals are reasonable if they can be safely achieved. Insulin is the preferred drug to treat hyperglycemia in most cases. (E) Due to concerns regarding the risk of hypoglycemia, some institutions may consider these blood glucose levels to be overly aggressive for initial targets. Through quality improvement, glycemic goals should systematically be reduced to the recommended levels. (E)
Scheduled prandial insulin doses should be appropriately timed in relation to meals and should be adjusted according to point-of-care glucose levels. The traditional sliding-scale insulin regimens are ineffective as monotherapy and are generally not recommended. (C)
Using correction dose or "supplemental" insulin to correct premeal hyperglycemia in addition to scheduled prandial and basal insulin is recommended. (E)
Glucose monitoring with orders for correction insulin should be initiated in any patient not known to be diabetic who receives therapy associated with high risk for hyperglycemia, including high-dose glucocorticoids therapy, initiation of enteral or parenteral nutrition, or other medications such as octreotide or immunosuppressive medications. (B) If hyperglycemia is documented and persistent, initiation of basal/bolus insulin therapy may be necessary. Such patients should be treated to the same glycemic goals as patients with known diabetes. (E)
A plan for treating hypoglycemia should be established for each patient. Episodes of hypoglycemia in the hospital should be tracked. (E)
All patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital should have an A1C obtained if the result of testing in the previous 2–3 months is not available. (E)
A diabetes education plan including "survival skills education" and follow-up should be developed for each patient. (E)
Patients with hyperglycemia in the hospital who do not have a diagnosis of diabetes should have appropriate plans for follow-up testing and care documented at discharge. (E)

### Enhancing clinical service design for multimorbidity management: a comprehensive approach to joined-up care for diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure [^112ELYf3]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

3.1.2 Shared care protocols

There are limited shared protocols and guidelines for patients with multiple conditions. A recent Cochrane review concluded that there were limited benefits in clinical outcomes to support shared policies in the management of people with multimorbidity. This was largely due to the relatively small number of randomised controlled trials conducted to address this research question. However, the management of CKD and DM has gained significant interest in recent years due to the close relationship between the two conditions. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KIDIGO) produced a guideline titled " Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease" in 2020, and it was updated in 2022. The guideline encouraged healthcare services to adopt team‐based integrated care to manage patients with DM and CKD. It suggested delivering care by an interdisciplinary team of physicians and other supporting healthcare professionals in defined steps: establishing a register with risk assessment, assessing cardiometabolic risk factors and kidney function, reviewing treatment targets, reinforcing self‐management, and providing counselling on diet and exercise.

In addition, the 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic HF referenced the management of concomitant HF and CKD. It highlighted the need to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with CKD by using the four pharmacological pillars of heart failure treatment: an angiotensin receptor‐neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), a beta‐blocker, an MRA, and a sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (Figure 1). However, it did not provide specific guidance on introduction, monitoring, and dose adjustments. Recent RCTs have also identified that non‐steroidal MRA and the glucose‐lowering agent glucagon‐like peptide‐1 agonists (GLP1 RAs) can also improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes. Therefore, there is a pressing need to adapt to the rapidly evolving evidence base within CKM care and ensure guidelines and protocols are updated promptly to support front‐line clinicians across multiple specialities. This coupled with local improvement programmes may improve the low uptake of renal and cardiac protective medicines and reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines on glycemic control for critically ill children and adults 2024 [^115FU21i]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Glycemic management — critically ill adults: Clinicians should initiate glycemic management protocols and procedures to treat persistent hyperglycemia, ≥ 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) in critically ill adults, and clinicians should use glycemic management protocols and procedures that demonstrate a low risk of hypoglycemia among critically ill adults and should treat hypoglycemia without delay; based on available randomized controlled trial data, we "suggest against" titrating an insulin infusion to a lower BG target INT: 4.4–7.7 mmol/L (80–139 mg/dL) as compared with a higher BG target range, CONV: 7.8–11.1 mmol/L (140–200 mg/dL) to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia; observational data suggest a potential benefit of personalized glucose targets that more closely match chronic prehospital glycemic control, and we recommend high-quality interventional trials of individualized glycemic targets in critically ill adults, stratified by prior glycemic control; we "suggest" using continuous IV insulin infusion rather than intermittent subcutaneous insulin in the acute management of hyperglycemia in critically ill adults; we "suggest" frequent (≤ 1 hr, continuous or near-continuous) glucose monitoring compared with monitoring at intervals greater than hourly in the management of hyperglycemia in critically ill adults on IV insulin during periods of glycemic instability; and we "suggest" use of a protocol that includes explicit decision support tools (tools) over a protocol with no such tools in critically ill adults receiving IV insulin infusions for the management of hyperglycemia.

### ABM clinical protocol # 27: breastfeeding an infant or young child with insulin-dependent diabetes [^116WbvXV]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #27 — principles of management for infants and young children with diabetes emphasize maintaining blood glucose within a target range with the least variability. Conventionally, caregivers are instructed to perform capillary glucose levels in young children before meals and snacks, occasionally after meals, at bedtime, before exercise in older children, when low blood glucose is suspected, and after treating low blood glucose until normoglycemic, with a frequency of 6–10 times/day. In addition, caregivers are instructed to give insulin for all meals and snacks containing more than 10–15 g of carbohydrates. Monogenic diabetes is caused by a single gene variant and includes neonatal diabetes and Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY); although insulin is often used, occasionally oral sulfonylureas are used after initial diagnosis and stabilization, and expressed breast milk is an excellent alternative to breastfeeding in these rare cases when neonatal diabetes and associated manifestations make breastfeeding difficult to initiate at birth.

Decision cycle for person-centered glycemic management in type 2 diabetes — goals of care are to prevent complications and optimize quality of life, and treatment goals and plans should be co-created by the care team and people with diabetes based on their individual preferences, values, and goals. The cycle includes assessing key person characteristics (the individual's priorities; current lifestyle and health behaviors; comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease [CKD], cardiovascular disease [CVD], and heart failure [HF]; clinical characteristics such as age, A1C, and weight; issues such as motivation, depression, and cognition; and social determinants of health), considering specific factors that impact choice of treatment (individualized glycemic and weight goals; impact on weight, hypoglycemia, and cardiovascular and kidney protection; underlying pathophysiology; side effect profiles; complexity of treatment plan including frequency and mode of administration; treatment cost and time to optimize medication use and reduce treatment discontinuation; and access to, availability of medication, and lifestyle choices), and using shared decision-making to create a management plan (ensure access to diabetes self-management education and support [DSMES], explore personal preferences, use person-first strengths-based empowering language, and include motivational interviewing, goal setting, and shared decision-making). Agree on a management plan by specifying SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time limited), then review and agree on the plan regularly, operate in an integrated system of care, and undertake the decision cycle regularly (at least once or twice a year); using a nonjudgmental approach that normalizes lapses in diabetes management may help minimize the person's resistance to reporting problems with self-management.

### Type 2 diabetes therapies: a STEPS approach… [^115QFVaz]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Only a few years ago, lifestyle modification, sulfonylureas, metformin, and insulin were the only treatment options for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Now, family physicians have approximately 40 medications in 10 categories to manage hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the availability of so many choices makes therapeutic decisions more complex. A concise and organized way to evaluate pharmacotherapy options for diabetes is to use the five patient-oriented STEPS criteria: safety, tolerability, effectiveness, price, and simplicity. 3 Table 1 presents the STEPS approach for each category of diabetes medication. 4–37 It permits side-by-side comparisons of the pros and cons, and reveals some insights for clinical decision making. 38 The STEPS criteria show why: it is safe and fairly well-tolerated, has excellent long-term effectiveness on patient-oriented outcomes, is moderately priced, and has a simple dosing regimen.

No other diabetes medication excels in the STEPS criteria as well as metformin. However, most patients with type 2 diabetes require more than one medication. The STEPS approach can help us choose subsequent medications if metformin does not provide adequate glycemic control for our patients. Focusing first on effectiveness, the table shows evidence of improved patient-oriented outcomes from glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in patients who are at high cardiovascular risk or have known cardiovascular disease. 22, 25, 26 whereas others have no evidence of benefit and still others have outcome studies that have not been completed. 39, 40 Major guidelines are increasingly aligned with a STEPS approach to pharmacotherapy for type 2 diabetes.

Although it has traditionally focused on disease-oriented outcomes, the American Diabetes Association was more patient-oriented in 2018, strongly recommending metformin as first-line therapy, with additional agents added after consideration of hypoglycemia risk, comorbidities, potential adverse effects, effectiveness, price, and delivery method. 41 The American Academy of Family Physicians–endorsed 2017 guideline on pharmacotherapy for type 2 diabetes from the American College of Physicians shares an emphasis on safety, tolerability, effectiveness, and price when making initial choices about monotherapy and combination therapy, while focusing on improving patient-oriented outcomes amidst a dearth of evidence regarding specific combinations of hypoglycemic drugs.
