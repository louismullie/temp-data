## Question

Picture of ac avulsion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a picture of an acromioclavicular (AC) avulsion injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "AC avulsion" means clinically and radiographically. Then, I should verify the best imaging modality and standardized views to depict it. Next, I will consider how to classify the injury and why that matters for the image request. After that, I should review what key radiographic signs to look for and how to quantify them. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically grounded description that aligns with consensus guidance and evidence, and I will note limitations and alternatives if a true image cannot be provided here.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislead us: "AC avulsion" in this context typically refers to an acromioclavicular joint separation with ligamentous avulsion, most often involving the coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments, and sometimes with bony avulsion fragments from the coracoid or clavicle, rather than a single discrete bone fragment avulsion alone [^116VHtE8] [^116B7W6B].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging hierarchy before describing the picture: for acute shoulder trauma with suspected AC injury, radiography is the first-line modality, and bilateral Zanca views are the standard for classification and quantification. MRI is the problem-solving tool for soft-tissue detail and occult injuries, while ultrasound can assist with acute CC ligament assessment when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated [^1169tftn] [^116VHtE8] [^115ZBKeB].

> I need to ensure the radiographic protocol is precise: bilateral Zanca views (AP with 10–15° cephalic tilt centered on the AC joint) allow side-to-side comparison of the coracoclavicular distance and AC joint width, which are foundational to Rockwood grading; some centers add a bilateral Alexander view to better assess horizontal instability, though consensus varies on its routine use, and weighted stress views can unmask occult high-grade injuries in select cases [^116VHtE8] [^1131MwKu] [^114vDpos].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about classification without anchoring it: the Rockwood system (types I–VI) remains the most widely used, but interobserver reliability is modest unless standardized bilateral views and measurements are used; recent expert consensus supports subdividing type III into stable IIIA versus unstable IIIB based on horizontal instability and scapular dyskinesis, which directly affects management decisions [^111YY8Se] [^111DBt2p] [^1121Z18f].

> Let me think about the key radiographic signs I should describe so the "picture" is clinically meaningful: on a Zanca view, increased coracoclavicular distance (> 25% versus the contralateral side) suggests complete CC ligament disruption and higher-grade injury; posterior clavicle displacement relative to the acromion indicates horizontal instability and supports type IV designation; asymmetry in AC joint width and step-off at the joint line are additional clues, and these findings correlate with MRI-demonstrated ligamentous injury patterns that often exceed what plain films suggest [^116VHtE8] [^112MwgUB].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the coracoclavicular distance threshold was a fixed 13 mm, but I should double-check that: the 13 mm value is a rough adult average and not the diagnostic cutoff; the correct approach is to compare the injured side to the contralateral side, with a relative increase greater than about 25% indicating complete CC ligament disruption and supporting higher Rockwood grades, whereas absolute values vary with patient size and projection [^116VHtE8] [^1131MwKu].

> I will now examine quantitative parameters that improve detection: the acromial center line to dorsal clavicle (AC–DC) distance on a lateral Alexander view better captures vertical displacement than CC distance alone, and the glenoid center line to posterior clavicle (GC–PC) distance helps quantify horizontal instability; these metrics show excellent reliability and validity against 3D CT and can mitigate projectional underestimation of severity seen with CC distance alone [^117BD5Xq] [^1113fLtn] [^114ZDurb].

> But wait, what if the injury is pediatric or involves the coracoid apophysis? I should confirm that physeal injuries at the lateral clavicle or coracoid can mimic AC dislocation in adolescents; MRI helps distinguish physeal fracture from true dislocation, and management differs because physeal injuries generally heal well with conservative care due to remodeling potential, so I need to keep age-specific anatomy in mind when interpreting any "picture" of an AC-region injury [^116VP6qc] [^111mSZWw].

> Let me reconsider the practical "picture" request: since I cannot display actual images here, the clinically accurate description is a bilateral Zanca radiograph showing asymmetric widening of the AC joint space and increased coracoclavicular distance on the injured side, with or without posterior translation of the clavicle relative to the acromion; MRI would show complete disruption of the AC capsule and CC ligaments with edema and possible bony avulsion fragments, while ultrasound could depict discontinuity or hematoma within the CC ligaments in the acute setting [^116VHtE8] [^112MwgUB] [^115ZBKeB].

> Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with consensus on when advanced imaging changes management: MRI and ultrasound can reclassify injuries and reveal occult ligamentous or intra-articular pathology, which is particularly relevant in high-demand athletes or when horizontal instability is suspected; this can shift treatment from nonoperative to operative or alter surgical planning, reinforcing why the "picture" is not just aesthetic but therapeutically decisive [^111aUmKG] [^112MwgUB] [^1169tftn].

> In summary, I need to ensure the description remains reference-aligned: an AC avulsion is best depicted on standardized bilateral Zanca radiographs demonstrating increased coracoclavicular distance and AC joint asymmetry, with MRI confirming ligamentous avulsion and soft-tissue injury; careful attention to horizontal instability and side-to-side comparison improves classification accuracy and guides whether conservative or surgical management is indicated, which is the essence of what a "picture of AC avulsion" should convey for clinical decision-making [^116VHtE8] [^111DBt2p] [^1121Z18f].

---

An AC avulsion is best visualized on **bilateral Zanca radiographs** [^116VHtE8] as superior displacement of the distal clavicle and increased coracoclavicular distance, indicating coracoclavicular ligament rupture [^112MwgUB]. MRI confirms **ligamentous injury** and detects associated lesions, while ultrasound can assess acute coracoclavicular ligament tears [^115ZBKeB] [^111aUmKG]. Management is guided by Rockwood classification: types I–II are managed conservatively, types IV–VI typically require surgery, and type III is individualized based on symptoms and instability [^113w89Xq] [^1172g28c].

---

## Imaging modalities and findings

### Radiography

- **Initial imaging**: Radiography is first-line for suspected AC joint injury [^1169tftn] [^116BAxYM].
- **Standard views**: Bilateral Zanca views (AP with 10–15° cephalic tilt) are standard for classification and comparison [^116VHtE8] [^111DBt2p].
- **Key findings**: Increased coracoclavicular distance (> 25% vs contralateral) indicates coracoclavicular ligament rupture and higher-grade injury [^116VHtE8] [^112MwgUB].

---

### Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

MRI provides **detailed soft-tissue assessment**, confirming coracoclavicular and acromioclavicular ligament injuries and detecting associated lesions (e.g. rotator cuff, labral tears) [^112MwgUB] [^111aUmKG]. It can reclassify injuries in ~50% of cases, often revealing more severe ligamentous injury than radiographs suggest [^111aUmKG] [^112MwgUB].

---

### Ultrasound

Ultrasound is a **noninvasive, dynamic alternative** for acute coracoclavicular ligament assessment, with high sensitivity/specificity versus MRI [^115ZBKeB]. It is particularly useful when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated [^115ZBKeB].

---

## Classification system

The **Rockwood classification** is most commonly used:

| **Type** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| I | Sprain of acromioclavicular ligament, intact coracoclavicular ligaments |
| II | Rupture of acromioclavicular ligament, sprain of coracoclavicular ligaments |
| III | Rupture of acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments, clavicle elevated 25–100% |
| IV | Posterior displacement of clavicle into trapezius |
| V | Clavicle elevated 100–300% |
| VI | Inferior displacement of clavicle below coracoid |

---

## Clinical management

- **Types I–II**: Conservative management (sling, analgesia, physical therapy) [^113w89Xq] [^1172g28c].
- **Types IV–VI**: Surgical intervention is generally recommended [^113w89Xq] [^1172g28c].
- **Type III**: Controversial; individualized based on symptoms, instability, and patient factors [^113w89Xq] [^1128bTE2].

---

## Potential complications

Complications include **persistent pain**, instability, and degenerative changes [^111NVMjG]. Loss of reduction and hardware complications can occur after surgical fixation [^111NVMjG]. Associated injuries (e.g. rotator cuff tears, clavicle fractures) are common and may require additional treatment [^1145GMLd] [^115tPZob].

---

AC avulsion is identified by **radiographic displacement** and confirmed by MRI or ultrasound; management follows Rockwood grading, with conservative care for low-grade and surgery for high-grade or symptomatic cases.

### Acromioclavicular joint injuries and reconstructions: a review of expected imaging findings and potential complications [^111FK7EY]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Shoulder injuries, including acromioclavicular (AC) joint separations, remain a common reason for presentation to the emergency room. Although the diagnosis can be made apparent through proper history and physical examination by the emergency medicine physician, ascertaining the degree of injury can be difficult on the basis of clinical evaluation alone. While there is consensus in the literature that low-grade AC joint injuries can be treated with conservative management, high-grade injuries will generally require surgical intervention. Furthermore, the treatment of grade 3 injuries remains controversial, making it incumbent upon the radiologist to become comfortable with distinguishing this diagnosis from lower or higher grade injuries. Imaging of AC joint injuries after clinical evaluation is generally initiated in the emergency room setting with plain film radiography; however, on occasion, an alternative modality may be presented to the emergency room radiologist for interpretation. As such, it remains important to be familiar with the appearance of AC joint separations on a variety of modalities. Another possible patient presentation in both the emergent and nonemergent setting includes new onset of pain or instability in the postsurgical shoulder. In this scenario, the onus is often placed on the radiologist to determine whether the pain or instability represents the sequelae of reinjury versus a complication of surgery. The purpose of this review is to present an anatomically based discussion of imaging findings associated with AC joint separations as seen on multiple modalities, as well as to describe and elucidate a variety of potential complications which may present to the emergency room radiologist.

### Acromioclavicular joint: what to look for… [^112UJ6Gc]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) pathology is a common source of shoulder girdle pain, frequently coexisting with and sharing overlapping clinical features of rotator cuff and glenohumeral articular lesions. ACJ trauma and osteoarthritis dominate clinical presentation; however, an array of pathologies can affect the joint. MR imaging of the ACJ is a powerful secondary diagnostic tool in early diagnosis of ACJ pathology and in accurate assessment of ACJ injuries, helping to resolve clinically challenging cases and allowing for individualized treatment planning. Knowledge of ACJ anatomy, biomechanics, and pathology is fundamental to interpreting and providing a clinically relevant ACJ MR imaging report.

### Combined acromioclavicular joint dislocation and coracoid avulsion in an adult [^116B7W6B]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Avulsion fracture of coracoid process with acromioclavicular joint dislocation is extremely rare. We report a case of coracoid avulsion with acromioclavicular disruption in a 24-year-old man who sustained injuries in a road traffic accident. Although acromioclavicular (AC) dislocation was obvious from an initial radiograph, coracoid avulsion was picked up in a CT scan. Open reduction and internal fixations of the coracoid with a 4mm cannulated screw, an AC joint with two K-wires and an anchor suture, resulted in rapid recovery. The patient had complete range of shoulder movements at the end of 3months and he resumed his professional activities. After 1year, he had normal shoulder movement without any functional limitations.

### Scapulothoracic dissociation: evaluation and management [^113C1qPV]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Scapulothoracic dissociation is a rare, potentially limb- and life-threatening injury of the shoulder girdle. The injury is characterized by lateral displacement of the scapula resulting from traumatic disruption of the scapulothoracic articulation. The typical physical examination findings consist of substantial swelling of the shoulder girdle, along with weakness, numbness, and pulselessness in the ipsilateral upper extremity. Radiographic evaluation includes measurement of the scapular index on a nonrotated chest radiograph and assessment for either a distracted clavicle fracture or a disrupted acromioclavicular or sternoclavicular joint. Although vascular injury occurs in most patients, emergent surgery is performed only in patients with either limb-threatening ischemia or active arterial hemorrhage. Management of neurologic injury can be delayed if necessary. The location and severity of neurologic injury determine whether observation, nerve grafting, nerve transfer, or above-elbow amputation is performed. Skeletal stabilization procedures include plate fixation of clavicle fractures and reduction of distracted acromioclavicular or sternoclavicular joints. The extent of neurologic injury determines clinical outcomes. Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form scores are significantly lower in patients with complete brachial plexus avulsion injury than in patients with postganglionic injury.

### Acute shoulder injury [^113UspPJ]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute shoulder injury is commonly encountered by clinicians, surgeons, and radiologists. A comprehensive evaluation of the shoulder by the radiologist is essential to accurately relay findings that have a direct impact on acute and long-term management. In this review, imaging features of acute injuries involving the proximal humerus, glenohumeral joint, rotator cuff, tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii, and acromioclavicular joint are discussed. Modalities include ultrasound examination, conventional radiography, computed tomography scans, and MR imaging. Emphasis is placed on radiographic features that have an impact on patient management.

### Imaging of the acromioclavicular joint: anatomy, function, pathologic features, and treatment [^116VHtE8]. Radiographics (2020). Medium credibility.

The acromioclavicular joint is an important component of the shoulder girdle; it links the axial skeleton with the upper limb. This joint, a planar diarthrodial articulation between the clavicle and the acromion, contains a meniscus-like fibrous disk that is prone to degeneration. The acromioclavicular capsule and ligaments stabilize the joint in the horizontal direction, while the coracoclavicular ligament complex provides vertical stability. Dynamic stability is afforded by the deltoid and trapezius muscles during clavicular and scapular motion. The acromioclavicular joint is susceptible to a broad spectrum of pathologic entities, traumatic and degenerative disorders being the most common. Acromioclavicular joint injury typically affects young adult males and can be categorized by using the Rockwood classification system as one of six types on the basis of the direction and degree of osseous displacement seen on conventional radiographs. MRI enables the radiologist to more accurately assess the regional soft-tissue structures in the setting of high-grade acromioclavicular separation, helping to guide the surgeon's selection of the appropriate management. Involvement of the acromioclavicular joint and its stabilizing ligaments is also important for understanding and classifying distal clavicle fractures. Other pathologic processes encountered at this joint include degenerative disorders; overuse syndromes; and, less commonly, inflammatory arthritides, infection, metabolic disorders, and developmental malformations. Treatment options for acromioclavicular dysfunction include conservative measures, resection arthroplasty for recalcitrant symptoms, and surgical reconstruction techniques for stabilization after major trauma.

### Acromioclavicular joint injuries: multicenter expert consensus study using the Delphi method [^112Ai6z3]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acromioclavicular (AC) joint injuries pose significant challenges in clinical management, necessitating consensus guidelines for optimal treatment. There is a lack of consensus in several areas, including imaging protocols, surgical techniques, and rehabilitation timelines. This study aims to develop a consensus regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of AC joint separations.

Methods

Using the Delphi method to gather expert opinions, 18 fellowship-trained surgeons from the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons participated in 3 survey rounds, achieving a 100% response rate over each round.

Results

A total of 76 consensus statements were identified in 6 areas: history, physical examination, radiology, treatment, surgical technique, and rehabilitation. Consensus was reached on some of the fundamental principles of AC separation management, such as the importance of a comprehensive history and physical examination, multiple radiographic views of the joint, indications for surgery, and the usefulness of allograft tendon augmentation for repair of the joint when surgery is indicated.

Conclusion

The Delphi method proved effective in gathering diverse perspectives and quantifying consensus among experts, offering important insights into the management of AC joint injuries. Continued research efforts are warranted to address areas of controversy and establish improved guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of these injuries.

### Management of acromioclavicular joint injuries [^113w89Xq]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Although recent advances have been made in the treatment of acromioclavicular (AC) joint injuries, they are still challenging for shoulder surgeons. There is a consensus that type I and II injuries should be treated nonoperatively, whereas acute type IV, V, and VI injuries should be treated surgically. There is no algorithm for correctly diagnosing and treating type III injuries, but the current trend is toward nonoperative treatment except for those with persistent symptoms and functional limitations after a course of conservative management. If surgery is indicated, newer anatomic techniques of reconstructing the coracoclavicular (CC) and AC ligaments are recommended.

### Acromioclavicular joint injuries: diagnosis and management [^1172g28c]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

Acromioclavicular joint injuries represent nearly half of all athletic shoulder injuries, often resulting from a fall onto the tip of the shoulder with the arm in adduction. Stability of this joint depends on the integrity of the acromioclavicular ligaments and capsule as well as the coracoclavicular ligaments and the trapezius and deltoid muscles. Along with clinical examination for tenderness and instability, radiographic examination is critical in the evaluation of acromioclavicular joint injuries. Nonsurgical treatment is indicated for type I and II injuries; surgery is almost always recommended for type IV, V, and VI injuries. Management of type III injuries remains controversial, with nonsurgical treatment favored in most instances and reconstruction of the acromioclavicular joint reserved for symptomatic instability. Recommended techniques for stabilization in cases of acute and late symptomatic instability include screw fixation of the coracoid process to the clavicle, coracoacromial ligament transfer, and coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction. Biomechanical studies have demonstrated that anatomic acromioclavicular joint reconstruction is the most effective treatment for persistent instability.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute shoulder pain: 2024 update [^1169tftn]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Trauma is a predominant cause of acute shoulder pain, commonly secondary to fractures (clavicle, scapula, or proximal humerus) or soft tissue injuries (typically involving the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular ligaments, or labroligamentous complex). Radiography is the imaging modality of choice for initial assessment of acute shoulder pain and identification of potential fractures. In cases where radiographs yield normal or inconclusive results, additional imaging modalities such as ultrasound, MRI, or CT of the shoulder without contrast, or MR or CT arthrography, may be useful to diagnose the underlying pathology. These modalities aid in the detection of conditions including nondisplaced fractures, tears of the labrum and rotator cuff, as well as detailed assessment of soft tissue and bony injury following glenohumeral joint dislocation. This document presents a comprehensive review of the evidence supporting or refuting the use of various imaging modalities in diagnosing acute shoulder pain. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Acromioclavicular separations: complications and how to avoid them [^1152XRDP]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Management of acromioclavicular separations remains controversial. A variety of surgical techniques have been described, but no clear consensus has formed regarding optimal treatment. As these techniques have evolved, so have the complication profiles. This review aims provide a review of the complications following management of acromioclavicular joint injections based on the chosen surgical technique. Complications of nonsurgical treatment will also be highlighted. Evidence-based strategies for minimizing complications are provided to allow surgeons to optimize both their preoperative patient discussion and intraoperative decision making.

### Ultrasound of the coracoclavicular ligaments in the acute phase of an acromioclavicular disjonction: comparison of radiographic, ultrasound and MRI findings [^115ZBKeB]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Acromioclavicular joint injuries are typically diagnosed by clinical and radiographic assessment with the Rockwood classification, which is crucial for treatment planning. The purpose of this study was to describe how the ultrasound findings of acromioclavicular joint injury compare with radiography and MRI findings.

Methods

Forty-seven patients with suspected unilateral acromioclavicular joint injury after acute trauma were enrolled in this prospective study. All patients underwent digital radiography, ultrasound and 3T MRI. A modified Rockwood classification was used to evaluate the coracoclavicular ligaments. The classifications of acromioclavicular joint injuries diagnosed with radiography, ultrasound and MRI were compared. MRI was used as the gold standard.

Results

The agreement between the ultrasound and MRI findings was very good, with a correlation coefficient of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.72–0.90; p < 0.0001). Ultrasound detected coracoclavicular ligament injuries with a sensitivity of 88.9%, specificity of 90.0%, positive predictive value of 92.3% and negative predictive value of 85.7%. The agreement between the ultrasound and radiography findings was poor, with a correlation coefficient of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.51–0.82; p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Ultrasound is an effective examination for the diagnostic work-up of lesions of the coracoclavicular ligaments in the acute phase of an acromioclavicular injury.

Key Points

- Ultrasound is appropriate for acute acromioclavicular trauma due to its accessibility.
- Ultrasound contributes to the diagnostic work-up of acute lesions of the coracoclavicular ligaments.
- Ultrasound is appropriate in patients likely to benefit from surgical treatment.
- Ultrasound could be a supplement to standard radiography in acute acromioclavicular trauma.

### Functional outcomes of type V acromioclavicular injuries with nonsurgical treatment [^111ozSH3]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

This study investigated nonsurgical management of type V acromioclavicular (AC) injuries to determine functional outcomes and to attempt to identify factors associated with positive results.

Methods

In a retrospective chart review, patients with radiographic and clinical evidence of type V AC injuries per the Rockwood classification were included in the study. Patients treated nonsurgically for ≥ 6 months were considered eligible for analysis. Functional outcomes were assessed using Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores.

Results

Twenty-two patients with a mean age of 42.2 ± 12.8 years were included in the study. The average coracoclavicular distance at the time of presentation was 26.3 mm (+199%). Mean DASH and ASES scores were 27.8 ± 17.7 and 62.8 ± 17.1, respectively, at an average of 34 months from the time of injury. Patients with normal DASH (≤ 10) and ASES (> 92) scores were younger than those with abnormal scores. At final assessment, 77% of the patients were currently working, with nine patients performing manual labor.

Conclusion

Following nonsurgical management of type V AC injuries, most patients are able to return to work but have limited functional outcome scores. A small subset of patients with type V AC injuries can achieve normal functional outcomes with nonsurgical management.

### High degree of consensus achieved regarding diagnosis and treatment of acromioclavicular joint instability among ESA-ESSKA members [^111THXMq]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Injuries of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint are quite common, accounting for 3–12% of all shoulder injuries. The incidence even rises up to 40–50% when it comes to contact sports, with the highest prevalence in men in their second or third decade of life. It seems evident that diagnosis and management of acute and chronic AC joint dislocations need to be well stated. However, although a plethora literature is available, a clear consensus has still not been achieved.

Traditionally, AC joint dislocations have been diagnosed on radiographs, through bilateral standard anteroposterior (AP) and Zanca views, and then classified according to the Rockwood classification. Conservative management is usually preferred in low-grade injuries (Rockwood type I and II), whereas symptomatic high-grade injuries (types IV–VI) are routinely managed surgically. Management of acute type III injuries is still an ongoing subject of controversy. Decision making is often based on patient's work and sporting activity as well as surgeon's personal opinion and experience. However, concerns have been raised on each step of the decision-making process. Even when it comes to conservative management, best type and length of immobilization have not been defined yet. Regarding surgical therapy, the wide range of available new surgical procedures clearly reflects the lacking of a golden standard; each technique is associated with limitations and, finally, none of them have been demonstrated to be superior to the others with respect to clinical outcomes.

Therefore, the European Shoulder Associates (ESA), section of the European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery and Arthroscopy (ESSKA), aimed to develop a consensus on the evaluation and management of AC joint dislocation to provide a unified expert opinion on this topic. It was hypothesized that there would be a high degree of consensus in the diagnosis and the treatment of AC joint dislocations despite the plethora of literature on diagnostic tools and treatment options.

### Evaluation and treatment of acromioclavicular joint injuries [^113QAhch]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Acromioclavicular joint injuries and, more specifically, separations are commonplace both in general practice and during athletic participation. This article reviews the traditional classification as well as the clinical evaluation of patients with acute and chronic acromioclavicular joint separations. It also highlights many recent advances, principally in the anatomy and biomechanics of the acromioclavicular joint ligamentous complex. The concept of increases in superior translation as well as disturbances in horizontal translation with injuries to this joint and ligaments are discussed. This information, coupled with the unpredictable long-term results with the Weaver-Dunn procedure and its modifications, have prompted many recent biomechanical studies evaluating potential improvements in the surgical management of acute and chronic injuries. The authors present these recent works investigating cyclic loading and ultimate failure of traditional reconstructions, augmentations, use of free graft, and the more recent anatomic reconstruction of the conoid and trapezoid ligaments. The clinical results (largely retrospective), including acromioclavicular joint repair, reconstruction and augmentation with the coracoclavicular ligament, supplemental sutures, and the use of free autogenous grafts, are summarized. Finally, complications and the concept of the failed distal clavicle resection and reconstruction are addressed. The intent is to provide a current, in-depth treatise on all aspects of acromioclavicular joint complex injuries to include anatomy, biomechanics, benchmark studies on instability and reconstruction, clinical and radiographic evaluation, and to present the most recent clinical research on surgical outcomes.

### MR imaging appearances of acromioclavicular joint dislocation [^112bRYVJ]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

The key structures involved in dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) are the joint itself and the strong accessory coracoclavicular ligament. ACJ dislocations are classified with the Rockwood system, which comprises six grades of injury. Treatment planning requires accurate grading of the ACJ disruption, but correct classification can be difficult with clinical assessment. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has a well-established role in evaluation of ACJ pain. MR imaging performed in the coronal oblique plane parallel to the distal clavicle allows assessment of the acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments owing to its in-plane orientation in relation to these structures. This technique enables distinction between grade 2 and grade 3 injuries, which can be difficult with conventional clinical and radiographic evaluation. In addition, diagnosis of grade 1 injuries is possible by demonstration of a ruptured superiodorsal acromioclavicular ligament. Resultant thickening of the acromioclavicular or coracoclavicular ligament allows identification of chronic ACJ injuries.

### Current concepts in the treatment of acromioclavicular joint dislocations [^112VLaQa]. Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To conduct a systematic review of the literature in relation to 3 considerations in determining treatment options for patients with acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocations: (1) operative versus nonoperative management, (2) early versus delayed surgical intervention, and (3) anatomic versus nonanatomic techniques.

Methods

The PubMed database was searched in October 2011 using the single term acromioclavicular and the following search limits: any date, humans, English, and all adult (19+). Studies were included if they compared operative with nonoperative treatment, early with delayed surgical intervention, or anatomic with nonanatomic surgical techniques. Exclusion criteria consisted of the following: Level V evidence, laboratory studies, radiographic studies, biomechanical studies, fractures or revisions, meta-analyses, and studies reporting preliminary results.

Results

This query resulted in 821 citations. Of these, 617 were excluded based on the title of the study. The abstracts and articles were reviewed, which resulted in the final group of 20 studies that consisted of 14 comparing operative with nonoperative treatment, 4 comparing early with delayed surgical intervention, and 2 comparing anatomic with nonanatomic surgical techniques. The lack of higher level evidence prompted review of previously excluded studies in an effort to explore patterns of publication related to operative treatment of the AC joint. This review identified 120 studies describing 162 techniques for operative reconstruction of the AC joint.

Conclusions

There is a lack of evidence to support treatment options for patients with AC joint dislocations. Although there is a general consensus for nonoperative treatment of Rockwood type I and II lesions, initial nonsurgical treatment of type III lesions, and operative intervention for Rockwood type IV to VI lesions, further research is needed to determine if differences exist regarding early versus delayed surgical intervention and anatomic versus nonanatomic surgical techniques in the treatment of patients with AC joint dislocations.

Level Of Evidence

Level III, systematic review of Level II and Level III studies and one case series.

### Physeal injuries of the clavicle: pediatric counterparts to adult acromioclavicular and sternoclavicular joint separations [^116VP6qc]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The epiphyses at the medial and lateral ends of the clavicle are small, ossify relatively late, and may not fuse until early adulthood. Because of this unique anatomy, pediatric and young adult injuries that involve the clavicle often differ from the patterns typically seen in older adults. Clavicular trauma that affects the acromioclavicular joint laterally or sternoclavicular joint medially often results in a physeal fracture and as such, can go unrecognized or be mistaken for a joint dislocation. Radiographic assessment is challenging, particularly when the epiphysis is not yet ossified. However, MR imaging allows for visualization of the cartilage, periosteum and perichondrium, and ligaments of the affected joints. Lateral clavicle physeal injuries can be categorized by the Dameron and Rockwood system, the pediatric correlate to the Rockwood classification of adult acromioclavicular joint injuries. Medial clavicle physeal fractures, similar to adult sternoclavicular joint dislocations, may result in anterior or posterior displacement. Because of their great ability to heal and remodel, clavicular physeal fractures respond better to conservative management than true acromioclavicular or sternoclavicular joint dislocations. Therefore, it is essential to recognize the true nature of these injuries, as there are implications for successful treatment and appropriate prognosis.

### VAERS-data-HHS.gov… [^115Rhjvv]. vaers.hhs.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

On May 8, 2025, CDC and FDA expanded public access to VAERS data in the WONDER database and in VAERS downloadable files to provide a more complete picture of all reported adverse events following vaccination received. This enhancement is part of a broader CDC and FDA effort to improve transparency and access to vaccine safety data, while continuing to protect patient privacy. VAERS data is accessible by downloading raw data in comma-separated value files for import into a database, spreadsheet, or text editing program, or by using the CDC WONDER online search tool. Information provided to VAERS which identifies a person who received the vaccine or vaccines will not be made available to the public. De-identified VAERS data are available 4–6 weeks after the report is received. VAERS data change as new reports are received, so your results may change if you repeat the same search at a later date.

To learn more about interpreting data see Guide to Interpreting VAERS Data. VAERS data is available in two ways: Search data with an easy-to-use, menu-driven tool. Produce tables, maps, charts, and data extracts of vaccine adverse events. Download raw data for import into a database, spreadsheet, or text editing program. VAERS accepts reports of adverse events that occur following vaccination. how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind. The strengths of VAERS are that it is national in scope and can often quickly detect an early hint or warning of a safety problem with a vaccine. VAERS is one component of CDC's and FDA's multifaceted approach to monitoring safety after vaccines are licensed or authorized for use. There are multiple, complementary systems that CDC and FDA use to capture and validate data from different sources.

VAERS is designed to rapidly detect unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse events, also referred to as "safety signals. " If a possible safety signal is found in VAERS, further analysis is performed with other safety systems, such as the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink and Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Project, or in the FDA BEST system.

### What imaging-detected pathologies are associated with shoulder symptoms and their persistence? A systematic literature review [^113hdSsN]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Summary of the methodologic qualities of the studies included

Supplementary Table 2, available on the Arthritis Care & Research web site at, shows the results of the methodologic quality assessment of the included studies. The mean (range) score was 48% 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67 for cohort, 41% 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71 for cross‐sectional, and 50% 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 for case–control studies. A total of 31 studies were high quality, and 25 were low quality. Six studies did not explain the statistical test used 33, 42, 46, 52, 58, 71. Nine studies did not define pathology. The GRADE quality of evidence for the relationship for all imaging features/symptoms outcomes was very low because of study limitations (risk of bias and observational study design), quality, inconsistency, and indirectness.

### Operative versus nonoperative management of acute high-grade acromioclavicular dislocations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1128bTE2]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Management of high-grade acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocations has been controversial. Recent studies suggest no difference in outcomes between operative and nonoperative management of Rockwood types III-V injuries. The objective of this meta-analysis is to compare outcomes between operative and nonoperative management of high-grade AC joint dislocations.

Data Sources

Search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases through October 2016. A broad search strategy was used to identify English, comparative studies of AC joint dislocations.

Study Selection

Inclusion criteria included comparative studies of AC joint dislocations in adult patients with acute, high-grade AC dislocations.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed and assessed for bias according to the U.S. Preventative Task Force Quality Rating Criteria. Data were extracted for validated functional scores, clinical and radiographic outcomes, and complications.

Data Synthesis

Nineteen studies (n = 954) were included in the meta-analysis. Operative group had better cosmetic outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 0.05; P < 0.00001) and radiographic reduction (OR = 24.94; P < 0.0001). Constant scores favored the operative group, although the difference may not be clinically significant (MD = 3.14; P = 0.03). Nonoperative treatment was associated with faster return to work (MD = 4.17, P < 0.0001), lower implant complications (OR = 7.19, P < 0.0001), and reduced infection rate (OR = 3.65, P = 0.007). No difference was found for DASH Score, return to sport, radiologic evidence of osteoarthritis, and need for surgery after failed management.

Conclusions

No clinical difference in functional outcome scores was detected between operative and nonoperative management of high-grade AC joint dislocations. Patients in the nonoperative cohort had a more rapid return to work, but were associated with a poorer cosmetic outcome.

Level Of Evidence

Therapeutic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

### MRI versus radiography of acromioclavicular joint dislocation [^111aUmKG]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Acromioclavicular joint injuries are usually diagnosed by clinical and radiographic assessment with the Rockwood classification, which is crucial for treatment planning. In view of the implementation of MRI for visualization of the acromioclavicular joint, the purpose of this study was to describe the MRI findings of acromioclavicular joint dislocation in comparison with the radiographic findings.

Subjects and Methods

Forty-four patients with suspected unilateral acromioclavicular joint dislocation after acute trauma were enrolled in this prospective study. All patients underwent digital radiography and 1-T MRI with a surface phased-array coil. MRI included coronal proton density-weighted turbo spin-echo and coronal 3D T1-weighted fast field-echo water-selective sequences. The Rockwood classification was used to assess acromioclavicular joint injuries at radiography and MRI. An adapted Rockwood classification was used for MRI evaluation of the acromioclavicular joint ligaments. The classifications of acromioclavicular joint dislocations diagnosed with radiography and MRI were compared.

Results

Among 44 patients with Rockwood type I-IV injuries on radiographs, classification on radiographs and MR images was concordant in 23 (52.2%) patients. At MRI, the injury was reclassified to a less severe type in 16 (36.4%) patients and to a more severe type in five (11.4%) patients. Compared with the findings according to the original Rockwood system, with the adapted system that included MRI findings, additional ligamentous lesions were found in 11 (25%) patients.

Conclusion

In a considerable number of patients, the MRI findings change the Rockwood type determined with radiography. In addition to clinical assessment and radiography, MRI may yield important findings on ligaments that may influence management.

### The ligamentous injury pattern in acute acromioclavicular dislocations and its impact on clinical and radiographic parameters [^112MwgUB]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocations are classified according to the Rockwood (RW) classification, which is based on radiographic findings. Several authors have suggested magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for visualization of the capsuloligamentous structures stabilizing the AC joint. The aim of this study was to describe the ligamentous injury pattern in acute AC joint dislocations by MRI and investigate associations with clinical and radiographic parameters.

Methods

This prospective study included 45 consecutive patients (5 women and 40 men; mean age, 33.6 years [range, 19–65 years]) with an acute AC joint separation (RW type I in 5, RW type II in 8, RW type III in 18, and RW type V in 14). All patients underwent physical examination of both shoulders, and clinical scores (Subjective Shoulder Value, Constant score, Taft score, and Acromioclavicular Joint Instability Score) were used to evaluate the AC joint clinically as well as radiographically. Post-traumatic radiography included bilateral anteroposterior stress views and bilateral Alexander views to evaluate vertical instability and dynamic posterior translation. MRI was performed for assessment of the AC and coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments and the delto-trapezoidal fascia.

Results

Radiographic and MRI classifications were concordant in 23 of 45 patients (51%), whereas 22 injuries (49%) were misjudged; of these, 6 (13%) were reclassified to a more severe type and 16 (36%), to a less severe type. The integrity of the CC ligaments was found to have a clinical impact on vertical as well as horizontal translation determined by radiographs and on clinical parameters. Among patients with an MRI-confirmed complete disruption of the CC ligaments, 68% showed a radiographic CC difference > 30% and 75% showed complete dynamic posterior translation. Inferior clinical parameters were noted in these patients as compared with patients with intact CC ligaments or partial disruption of the CC ligaments (Constant score of 67 points vs. 49 points [P < .05] and Acromioclavicular Joint Instability Score of 51 points vs. 23 points [P < .05]). The inter-rater and intra-rater reliability for assessment of the ligamentous injury pattern by MRI was fair to substantial (r = 0.37–0.66).

Conclusion

The integrity of the CC and AC ligaments found on MRI has an impact on clinical and radiographic parameters.

### High degree of consensus achieved regarding diagnosis and treatment of acromioclavicular joint instability among ESA-ESSKA members [^114vDpos]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

From this first round, members were asked to participate in the consensus process. In the second round, 28 out of 49 (57%) responded, in the third round 29 (59%), and 30 (61%) in the fourth round. At the final round, which was again not online, 40 panel members were available for voting. Before opening the consensus questions, the panel was asked about their frequency of annual AC-joint surgeries. About 54% treated between 10–50 AC joints, whereas the other 46% treated less than 10 AC joints per year (Table 1).

Table 1
Average annual AC joint surgeries

Questions were divided into 5 blocks referring to the radiographic modalities to diagnose AC joint pathologies, the classification systems to grade differences, the surgical approach for acute and chronic cases as well as the postoperative treatment.

Radiographic evaluation

After the final round, the panel reached a consensus regarding the radiological approach to diagnose and classify AC joint dislocations. The consented radiographs are a true a.p. radiograph, as well as a panoramic view (bilateral Zanca radiographs) without loading of the arm. To address the horizontal instability through radiographs no consensus was reached. However, clinical override testing during body cross test was proposed by 93% of the panel members to identify horizontal instability. In addition, a consensus was reached after the third round (79.3%), that no additional imaging is needed for the assessment of AC joint instability (e.g. computed tomography, magnetic resonance or ultrasound, Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Graphical illustration of radiographic evaluation. Consensus was found after round 2 and 3, respectively. Panoramic views with true a.p. radiographs without additional imaging (MRI, CT, etc.) were found to be sufficient

Classification

After round three there was a clear consensus regarding different classifications. The Tossy classification and the Bannister classification are not recommended to classify the type of AC dislocation (93.1% respectively 93.10% voted against using this classification). So far, the Rockwood classification is still the most valid classification. The ISAKOS statement (concerning grade III) was consented to be sufficient for a comprehensive classification (Fig. 2).

### Scapulothoracic dissociation: diagnosis and treatment [^115EPuTL]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2003). Low credibility.

Scapulothoracic dissociation is an important and increasingly common clinical condition resulting from massive traction injury to the anterolateral shoulder girdle with disruption of scapulothoracic articulation. It frequently is accompanied by an acromioclavicular separation, displaced clavicular fracture, or sternoclavicular disruption. Vascular lesions have been reported in 88% of patients and severe neurologic injuries occur in 94% of patients. Many patients have a poor outcome with a flail extremity in 52%, early amputation in 21%, and death in 10%. Early recognition of this injury combined with a logical treatment protocol can help to decrease the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.

### Epidemiology of acromioclavicular joint injury in young athletes [^112nAgqX]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acromioclavicular (AC) joint injuries, particularly sprains, are common in athletic populations and may result in significant time lost to injury. However, surprisingly, little is known of the epidemiology of this injury.

Purpose

To define the incidence of AC joint injuries and to determine the risk factors for injury.

Study Design

Descriptive epidemiological study.

Methods

A longitudinal cohort study was performed to determine the incidence and characteristics of AC joint injury at the United States Military Academy between 2005 and 2009. All suspected AC joint injuries were reviewed by an independent orthopaedic surgeon using both chart reviews as well as assessments of radiological imaging studies. Injuries were graded according to the modified Rockwood classification system as well as dichotomized into low-grade (Rockwood types I and II) and high-grade (Rockwood types III, IV, V, and VI) injuries for analysis. Injury mechanisms, return-to-play timing, and athlete-exposures were documented and analyzed. χ² and Poisson regression analyses were performed, with statistical significance set at P < .05.

Results

During the study period, 162 new AC joint injuries and 17,606 person-years at risk were documented, for an overall incidence rate of 9.2 per 1000 person-years. The majority of the AC joint injuries were low-grade (145 sprains, 89%) injuries, with 17 high-grade injuries. Overall, male patients experienced a significantly higher incidence rate for AC joint injuries than female patients (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21–4.31). An AC joint injury occurred most commonly during athletics (91%). The incidence rate of AC joint injury was significantly higher in intercollegiate athletes than intramural athletics when using athlete-exposure as a measure of person-time at risk (IRR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.31–3.56). Similarly, the incidence rate of AC injury was significantly higher among male intercollegiate athletes when compared to female athletes (IRR, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.74–8.49) when using athlete-exposure as the denominator. The intercollegiate sports of men's rugby, wrestling, and hockey had the highest incidence rate of AC joint injury. Acromioclavicular injuries resulted in at least 1359 total days lost to injury and an average of 18.4 days lost per athlete. The average time lost to injury for low-grade sprains was 10.4 days compared with high-grade injuries at 63.7 days. Of the patients with high-grade injuries, 71% elected to undergo coracoclavicular/AC reconstructions. The rate of surgical intervention was 19 times higher for high-grade AC joint injuries than for low-grade injuries (IRR, 19.2; 95% CI, 7.64–48.23; P < .0001).

Conclusion

Acromioclavicular separations are relatively common in young athletes. Most injuries occur during contact sports such as rugby, wrestling, and hockey. Male athletes are at greater risk than female athletes. Intercollegiate athletes are at greater risk than intramural athletes. The average time lost to sport due to AC joint injury was 18 days, with low-grade injuries averaging 10 days lost. High-grade injuries averaged 64 days lost to sport, and 71% elected to undergo surgical repair/reconstruction.

### Acromioclavicular and sternoclavicular joint injuries [^111PmtCG]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Acromioclavicular (AC) joint injuries are a frequent diagnosis following an acute shoulder injury. The literature on AC joint dislocation is extensive, reflecting the intense debate surrounding the topic. The choice of treatment is influenced by factors including the type of injury, the patient's occupation, the patient's past medical history, the acuity of the injury, and patient expectations. Sternoclavicular (SC) joint dislocation is an uncommon injury. The treatment of acute anterior SC joint dislocations is controversial. It is difficult to study with a well-designed prospective study because of the low frequency of this injury. Posterior dislocations are much less common than anterior dislocations. Posterior dislocations, however, are more serious; they are associated with significant complications and require prompt attention.

### High degree of consensus achieved regarding diagnosis and treatment of acromioclavicular joint instability among ESA-ESSKA members [^112vFoz4]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The most important finding of the present study was that finally a consensus could be found on several topics. True AP view or a bilateral Zanca view were deemed sufficient for diagnosis, a separation line between acute and chronic was set at 3 weeks from trauma, arthroscopically assisted anatomic reconstruction using synthetic augmentation has been suggested in acute injuries, whereas the use of biological reconstruction with tendon graft was reserved to chronic cases. Clarification on postoperative protocol and conservative management have also been made.

Since AC joint dislocations are plagued by limited evidence-based literature, the present consensus really shed light on some controversial issues.

An emerging concept in the quest for a better understanding of AC joint pathology and improved clinical outcomes is the complementary role of either coracoclavicular (CC) and AC ligaments. Decades ago, biomechanical studies have clearly stated that CC ligaments are the main responsible for vertical stability, as well as AC ligaments and capsule are the primary stabilizers in the horizontal plane. Since clinical data has shown a vast number of persistent horizontal instability following modern arthroscopic AC joint reconstruction techniques, not only the surgical management but also the clinical assessment have been reconsidered.

It has been claimed that parameters assessable on AP and Zanca view do not allow for quantification of horizontal instability, therefore, the use of new radiographic parameters in a single lateral Alexander view has been recently recommended. Anyhow, the ESA panel agreed that a true AP view or a bilateral Zanca view without loading the arm are still adequate for a correct diagnosis, with no need of modified Alexander view to seek for horizontal instability. On the contrary, the clinical evaluation was deemed sufficient to evaluate instability in the horizontal plane.

Similarly, recent papers called into question the reliability of the Rockwood classification and further stated that, except for type IV, it does not assess horizontal instability. Once again, the consensus clarified that the Rockwood classification, recently modified by the ISAKOS statement, remains the most appropriate and comprehensive classification to guide the treatment choice so far.

### Imaging of traumatic shoulder girdle injuries [^112rB4nx]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Shoulder girdle trauma is one of the most common injuries encountered in emergency centers. These injuries can be easily overlooked due to the complex osteology of the shoulder. Although radiographs are usually sufficient for assessing traumatic shoulder injuries, cross-sectional imaging is sometimes indicated to assess portions of the shoulder not well visualized by radiographs. In this article, the authors review the spectrum of shoulder girdle injuries: sternoclavicular dislocations, clavicle fractures, acromioclavicular separations, shoulder dislocations, scapula fractures, and scapulothoracic dissociation. They also discuss the presentation, imaging evaluation, and classification of these injuries with emphasis on pitfalls in imaging diagnosis and indications for computed tomography/magnetic resonance.

### Young men in sports are at highest risk of acromioclavicular joint injuries: a prospective cohort study [^112Pdi4Z]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Participants

Inclusion criteria were acute shoulder injury within the last 3 months with a coinciding onset of symptoms. Injury to the clavicle, scapula, proximal third of the humeral bone, their articulations and surrounding soft tissues was included; whereas, injury to the middle and distal third of the humeral bone and adjacent soft tissues was excluded. Patients were excluded from registration if there was doubt regarding whether there had been an acute trauma causing the shoulder symptoms.

Variables

Age, gender, city district, date and time of injury and primary visit, activity, injury mechanism, multiple and concomitant injuries and MRI were registered. Conventional radiographs in two views were performed in all patients according to the clinical findings. The department's standard projections for the ACJ were 15° craniocaudal and caudocranial view. A panorama (bilateral Zanca) view was performed when requested by the physician. Supplementary modalities were computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The initial diagnosis was corrected when imaging and/or clinical examination during follow-up undoubtedly concluded differently. Patients with pain in the anterosuperior part of the shoulder, point tenderness over the ACJ and normal radiographs described by the radiologist regarding acute injury were classified as sprain (S435) (Rockwood type 1). Patients with similar symptoms but abnormal widening of the ACJ or coracoclavicular distance were classified as separation/dislocation (S431) (Rockwood types II–VI).

Bias

City district residency was recorded to control for potential bias. Although the Norwegian society is relatively homogenous, the districts vary somewhat regarding age distribution and socioeconomic parameters. The standard deviation of the mean acute shoulder injury incidence rates in the 15 districts did not indicate socioeconomic bias. The Oslo University Hospital Trauma Registry reported that only 25 Oslo residents with a shoulder injury diagnosis were treated in the unit without prior triage and consultation at the Department of Orthopaedic Emergency during the registration period.

### Editorial commentary: allograft acromioclavicular joint reconstruction provides long-term benefit for high-grade injuries in the active population but may not Be necessary for all patients [^112TFUSG]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Acromioclavicular (AC) joint separations are a challenging injury to treat, since some patients do very well with conservative treatment while others (particularly those with high demand activity requirements) develop debilitating symptoms and require surgical intervention. Surgical treatment for AC joint separations has traditionally carried high risk of complications, most notably loss of reduction and recurrent instability. The advancement of arthroscopic techniques has allowed for less invasive options with good functional outcomes, although the risk of recurrent instability still remains. Type V injuries have traditionally been an indication for surgery in most cases, but recent evidence has suggested equivalent outcomes between conservative and surgical treatment for these injuries. Although arthroscopic allograft AC joint reconstruction can provide excellent patient outcomes, the jury is still out on whether surgery is necessary for all type V AC joint injuries, and it is important to provide patients individualized counseling and treatment while adhering to the classic medical principle of "first, do no harm".

### Improved identification of unstable acromioclavicular joint injuries in a clinical population using the acromial center line to dorsal clavicle radiographic measurement [^117BD5Xq]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Accurate classification and subsequent management of acromioclavicular (AC) joint injuries remains a contentious topic. The updated Rockwood classification acknowledges "stable IIIA" and "unstable IIIB" injuries, a watershed accepted by ISAKOS and important in guiding clinical management. Traditionally, the coracoclavicular distance is used to classify these injuries, despite well-documented limitations. This study aimed to evaluate displacement in AC joint injuries by measuring both coracoclavicular (CC) distance and the newly proposed acromial center line to dorsal clavicle (AC-DC) distance, in a cohort of patients, and correlate the results between the 2 measurements and relationship to Rockwood grade.

Materials and Methods

Ninety consecutive cases of AC joint injury were evaluated radiographically for Rockwood classification, CC distance on anteroposterior radiographs, and AC-DC distance on Alexander view radiographs. Inter- and intraobserver reliability for each measurement was calculated as well as correlation between the 2 measurement types and the degree to which each measurement accurately represented the Rockwood classification.

Results

Although both CC and AC-DC measurements showed very high inter- and intraobserver reliability, the CC distance systematically underestimated the degree of AC joint displacement when compared with the AC-DC measurement as the severity of injury increased, particularly in the presence of posterior horizontal displacement such as that seen in Rockwood IV injuries.

Conclusion

The AC-DC measurement and use of the Alexander view provides the clinician with a more realistic appreciation of true AC joint displacement, especially in defining watershed cases (ie, IIIA/IIB/IV) and may better inform the decision-making process regarding management options and recommendations.

### Acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligamentous insertion distances depend on the scapular tilt and decrease with anterior direction of the inferior scapula angle [^112ApSzs]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acromioclavicular (AC) injuries represent up to 11% of shoulder girdle injuries. In the majority of cases, the injury mechanism is a fall on the adducted arm. The AC joint dislocation can be classified according to Rockwood. Most of the Rockwood type IV, V and VI AC joint injuries need to be reduced and stabilized surgically. For the surgical treatment of acute AC joint injuries, there is widespread consensus to perform an arthroscopic anatomic reconstruction with a suspensory device. Most of these arthroscopic procedures are performed in a beach chair position. In this position, the scapular deflection is often 'free-floating' without dorsal support.

Despite the varying treatment strategies, the complication rate remains high and varies between 5 and 89%. A common complication after operative treatment is loss of reduction. In a prospective multicentre study, Clavert et al. reported an incidence of 41.3% for radiological failure, when the side-to-side difference of the coracoclavicular distance was more than 50% increased during follow-up. This radiological failure was mirrored by a lower Constant Score and higher DASH score. Marsalli et al. noted recently a loss of reduction ≥ 1 mm in 78% of their patient cohort, whereby a loss of reduction > 5 mm increased the risk to develop pain in the AC joint. Other studies report a clinical loss of reduction rate of 12.5–14%. Chen et al. identified the coracoid EndoButton position, weight-bearing time of the upper limb and osteolysis as potential risk factors for loss of reduction in their study cohort.

### New quantitative radiographic parameters for vertical and horizontal instability in acromioclavicular joint dislocations [^114ZDurb]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

AC–DC and GC–PC are two novel quantitative radiographic parameters of vertical and horizontal instability in ACJ dislocations that demonstrate excellent reliability and validity. They are both measured on lateral Alexander radiographic views with reasonable inertness to projectional errors. The CC distance may underestimate the severity of ACJ separations especially when there is horizontal instability. We recommend the use of AC–DC for assessing vertical displacement and GC–PC for assessing horizontal displacement in a single Alexander view to guide the appropriate management of ACJ separations. A better appreciation of the degree of horizontal instability, especially in lower Rockwood grades (II, III) of ACJ dislocations, may improve management of these controversial injuries.

### A novel radiographic index for the diagnosis of posterior acromioclavicular joint dislocations [^112GafAA]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Posterior acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocations are frequently misclassified because posterior translation of the clavicle is difficult to evaluate in Zanca radiograph views. A novel radiographic index was used in this study to accurately diagnose posterior dislocations of the AC joint.

Hypothesis

This novel index has a high degree of accuracy for the diagnosis of posterior AC joint dislocations.

Study Design

Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2.

Methods

This was an analytic, descriptive study of 150 patients with different grades of AC injuries according to the Rockwood classification (30 patients for each grade of injury: I, II, III, IV, and V). The diagnosis of an AC injury was made both clinically and radiographically by using comparative Zanca and axillary views. Two measurements were performed in Zanca views: the coracoclavicular distance and the AC width distance. A width index was calculated for each patient. The Student t test, Bonferroni test, logistic regression, linear regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used for statistical analysis. Forty cases were impartially selected to obtain a κ concordance value.

Results

The average value of the AC width index per group (according to the Rockwood classification) was as follows: type I, 2.1% (range, -12% to 25%); type II, 4.2% (range, -19% to 29%); type III, 19.1% (range, -59% to 91%); type IV, 110.3% (range, 47% to 181%); and type V, -3.8% (range, -71% to 62%). There was a significant difference between the average width index in the patients with type IV injuries and those in the remaining groups (P < .05). The ROC curve showed that a width index of 60% has a sensitivity of 95.7% and specificity of 97.5%, with a positive predictive value of 96.7% and negative predictive value of 95.6% to predict a type IV injury. Intraobserver reliability was rated as substantial agreement for each of 3 observers; the interobserver reliability of the 3 independent raters was almost perfect.

Conclusion

An AC width index of ≥ 60% is highly accurate for the diagnosis of a posterior AC joint dislocation, with high intraobserver and interobserver concordance.

### New quantitative radiographic parameters for vertical and horizontal instability in acromioclavicular joint dislocations [^111evYV9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Validity

Validity was assessed with determination of convergent validity and discriminant validity. Convergent validity occurs when the scales of a measurement correlate as expected with the related scales of another measurement. For this purpose, the radiographic parameters were compared with the effective distances measured on 3-dimensional reconstructions of CT scans for each grade of dislocation. An independent radiologist who was not involved in the study determined the horizontal and vertical distance between the acromion and clavicle. Discriminant validity is the ability to detect relevant differences between different subgroups and is assessed by calculating the effect size between the different injury types.

The study was done in accordance with the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practice. According to the Swiss Human Research Act, this study does not require any IRB approval because neither human beings nor biological material were involved.

### ISAKOS upper extremity committee consensus statement on the need for diversification of the rockwood classification for acromioclavicular joint injuries [^1121Z18f]. Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Optimal treatment for the unstable acromioclavicular (AC) joint remains a highly debated topic in the field of orthopaedic medicine. In particular, no consensus exists regarding treatment of grade III injuries, which are classified according to the Rockwood classification by disruption of both the coracoclavicular and AC ligaments. The ISAKOS Upper Extremity Committee has provided a more specific classification of shoulder pathologies to enhance the knowledge on and clinical approach to these injuries. We suggest the addition of grade IIIA and grade IIIB injuries to a modified Rockwood classification. Grade IIIA injuries would be defined by a stable AC joint without overriding of the clavicle on the cross-body adduction view and without significant scapular dysfunction. The unstable grade IIIB injury would be further defined by therapy-resistant scapular dysfunction and an overriding clavicle on the cross-body adduction view.

### Biomechanics and treatment of acromioclavicular and sternoclavicular joint injuries [^1147t69L]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Acromioclavicular (AC) joint injuries are more common than sternoclavicular (SC) joint injuries. There is a spectrum of AC joint traumatic injuries that ranges from a ligament sprain to a complete dislocation. The majority of AC joint injuries are successfully treated non-operatively with a period of sling immobilisation followed by progressive physical therapy and shoulder range of motion exercises. In patients who have symptomatic AC joint injuries that are recalcitrant to non-operative treatment there exists a variety of surgical treatment options to reconstruct and stabilise the joint. The SC joint, like the AC joint, can suffer a spectrum of ligamentous injuries; however, when it comes to dislocation it can only dislocate anteriorly or posteriorly. Anterior dislocations are often successfully treated with closed reduction. Posterior dislocations have significant clinical implications because of the proximity of surrounding vessels and nerves. Any attempt at reduction of a posterior dislocation requires the presence of a cardiothoracic surgeon. The majority of AC and SC joint injuries typically result in ligamentous sprain and heal uneventfully with a period of immobilisation. If, however, patients remain symptomatic after non-operative treatment or have a dislocated joint, there are reduction manoeuvres and surgical techniques that allow joint stabilisation.

### Clinical and radiologic outcomes of surgical and conservative treatment of type III acromioclavicular joint injury [^1169BUzt]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

The management of acute acromioclavicular joint dislocations is controversial. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of posttraumatic anatomic alterations after surgical or conservative treatment of type III injuries and to analyze their effect on the outcome. Forty-three patients were evaluated retrospectively, clinically and radiographically, at a 12-month minimum follow-up. Thirty-two were treated surgically, using the Phemister technique, and 11 had conservative treatment. A comparison of the overall clinical results in both groups showed no statistically significant differences. The acromioclavicular joint was anatomically reduced in only half of the surgical patients. Those shoulders treated surgically showed a significantly higher incidence of osteoarthritis and coracoclavicular ligament ossification. Differences in clavicular deformity or osteolysis were not significant. None of these abnormalities had any influence on the clinical result. Because operative and conservative treatments achieve equally good clinical results and surgery carries a higher risk of osteoarthritis, we recommend managing this injury conservatively.

### What imaging-detected pathologies are associated with shoulder symptoms and their persistence? A systematic literature review [^1154NgBF]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Systematic literature search and selection

Following exclusion of duplicates, 4,383 articles were included, of which 119 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were screened. In total, 56 articles were included (41 cross‐sectional, 11 cohort, 4 case–control). Imaging modalities included 25 ultrasound 16, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 24 MRI 15, 16, 41, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 12 radiographs 27, 30, 49, 53, 55, 62, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 3 bone scintigraphy 65, 71, 72, 2 PET 73, 74, and no computed tomography. Of these studies, 10 assessed associations with 2 imaging modalities (16, 27, 30, 41, 44, 49, 53, 55, 62, 65). Most studies included both sexes; 8 studies did not state the sex ratio involved 35, 38, 41, 59, 62, 65, 71, 74, and 1 included males only 34. The nomenclature for defining imaging pathologies varied between studies, and there was no standardized way of defining pathology (see Supplementary Table 3, available on the Arthritis Care & Research web site at). There was heterogeneity between study populations.

### What role do plain radiographs have in assessing the skeletally immature acromioclavicular joint? [^111mSZWw]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Because of incomplete ossification of the coracoid process and acromion, acromioclavicular joint configuration in the skeletally immature patient differs from that of adults. Although comparison to radiographic standards for this joint is critical in the evaluation of acromioclavicular joint injuries, these standards are not well defined for children or adolescents.

Questions/Purposes

We therefore sought to determine (1) the reliability of numerous radiographic measurements of the skeletally immature acromioclavicular joint, including the vertical and shortest coracoclavicular interval, and the acromioclavicular joint offset; (2) the timing of ossification of the acromion and coracoid in males and females; and (3) the differences in the values of these radiographic measurements based on age and sex.

Methods

This study was based on a total of 485 subjects, 8 to 18 years old, who underwent conventional AP view radiographs of both shoulders. The 485 subjects were included to assess normal configuration around the acromioclavicular joint and 466 of these subjects were evaluated for comparison between both sides. The vertical and shortest coracoclavicular interval, coracoclavicular clavicle width ratio, acromioclavicular joint offset, and difference of the coracoclavicular interval of both sides were measured. A reliability test was conducted before obtaining the main measurements. The relationship of measurements with sex, age, and stage of ossification was evaluated.

Results

The vertical and shortest coracoclavicular interval showed excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient ([ICC], 0.918 and 0.934). The acromioclavicular joint offset showed low reliability (ICC, 0.543). The ossification centers of the acromion and the coracoid processes appeared and fused earlier in females than in males. The vertical coracoclavicular interval, which was not affected by partial ossification of the coracoid process, was less than 11 mm in the 90% quantile of total subjects in males and 10 mm in the 90% quantile in females. The difference of the vertical coracoclavicular interval of both sides was less than 50% in 436 of 466 (93.4%) patients.

Conclusions

The vertical coracoclavicular interval was the best parameter to assess acromioclavicular joint dislocation in skeletally immature patients. Comparison of both sides of the acromioclavicular joint could help to inform physicians in predicting the need for additional evaluations.

### Young men in sports are at highest risk of acromioclavicular joint injuries: a prospective cohort study [^114DQPRz]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To study the incidence of acromioclavicular joint injuries in a general population.

Methods

All acute shoulder injuries admitted to an orthopaedic emergency department were registered prospectively, using electronic patient records and a patient-reported questionnaire. The regional area was the city of Oslo with 632,990 inhabitants. Patients with symptoms from the acromioclavicular joint without fracture were registered as a dislocation (type II–VI) if the radiologist described widening of the joint space or coracoclavicular distance on standard anteroposterior radiographs. Patients without such findings were diagnosed as sprains (type I).

Results

Acromioclavicular joint injuries constituted 11% of all shoulder injuries (287 of 2650). The incidence was 45 per 10⁵ person-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 40–51). 196 (68%) were diagnosed as sprains and 91 (32%) as dislocations. Median age of all acromioclavicular joint injuries was 32 years (interquartile range 24–44), and 82% were men. Thirty percent of all acromioclavicular joint injuries were registered in men in their twenties. Sports injuries accounted for 53%, compared to 27% in other shoulder injuries [OR 3.1 (95% CI 2.4–4.0; p < 0.001)]. The most common sports associated with acromioclavicular joint injuries were football (24%), cycling (16%), martial arts (11%), alpine skiing and snowboarding (both 9%), and ice hockey (6%).

Conclusion

Our study suggests that in the general population, one in ten shoulder injuries involves the acromioclavicular joint and young men in sports are at highest risk. A prognostic level II cohort study.

### Acromioclavicular joint reconstruction: complications and innovations [^112kRCZr]. Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Minimally invasive anatomic reconstruction of the acromioclavicular joint is a technically challenging procedure. The repair must be sufficiently strong and reconstitute the joint as closely as possible. This includes restoration of both superior-inferior stability, and the often overlooked anterior-posterior stability, of the acromioclavicular joint. There is no gold standard treatment for acromioclavicular joint separation.

### What imaging-detected pathologies are associated with shoulder symptoms and their persistence? A systematic literature review [^111pmCQZ]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Acromion pathology

Twelve studies (23, 27, 34, 46, 47, 50, 53, 55, 56, 57, 62, 68) evaluated the relationship between the acromion and symptoms (Tables 1, 2, and 3). Two ultrasound studies 23, 34, 3 MRI studies 47, 50, 57, 1 radiographic study 68, 2 combined MRI and radiographic studies 53, 62 and 1 combined ultrasound and radiographic study 27 evaluated the relationship of the acromion and pain. One study radiographically evaluated the relationship with function 68. Two MRI studies 46, 56 and 1 combined MRI and radiographic study 55 evaluated the relationship with symptoms using a composite score.

One high‐quality combined radiographic and ultrasound study 27 reported that the acromial index (lateral extension of the acromion relative to humeral head) was associated with pain, whereas 2 high‐quality radiographic studies 53, 68 reported no association with pain or function. Those with full‐thickness cuff tears had an increased prevalence of type 3 acromion compared to controls and patients with surgical impingement 47. No relationship existed between scapuloacromial angle 57, subacromial distance, or acromion shape 62 and impingement. One MRI study in patients with clinical impingement reported a reduction in the subacromial space during activity 50, and another reported decreased coracohumeral distance 62.

One high‐quality, adjusted ultrasound study reported displacement in the coracoacromial ligament in symptomatic patients 34. A difference in distance (2.1 mm) between the inferolateral edge of the acromion and the apex of the greater tuberosity of the humerus was observed in affected shoulders in a high‐quality study 23. Two studies of mixed quality reported an association with acromial humeral distance (AHD) and symptoms 46, 55, but another high‐quality study found no association 56. One study showed no relationship with acromial shape 55, whereas another was positively correlated to the intrinsic acromial angle 46.

In summary, high‐quality, unadjusted studies found conflicting results on the relationship between symptoms and the acromial index (lateral extension of the acromion relative to humeral head) 27, 53, 68 and AHD 55, 56. No relationship was found between scapuloacromial angle or acromion shape in high‐quality, unadjusted studies 55, 57.

### Editorial commentary: early surgery and restricted rehabilitation are recommended for high-grade acromioclavicular joint dislocation [^1114v4PL]. Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite acromioclavicular (AC) joint injuries being common, there are still controversies about the treatment; nonoperative versus surgical, who to operate, when to operate, which technique to use, and which rehabilitation protocol to use. Orthopaedic surgeons are often faced with these patients fearing not regaining normal function and to some degree acceptable cosmetic outcomes. Despite increasing interest in surgical management of type 3 AC joint injuries, surgical management has not been demonstrated to yield superior functional outcomes compared with nonoperative treatment. Interestingly, studies have demonstrated that good outcomes are achieved with most surgical techniques even though they are all associated with loss of initial reduction. This brings into question whether surgery is necessary in the early phase and how we can mitigate the effects of gravity to maintain reduction. Studies that can aid surgeons in patient selection for treatment protocols (nonoperative versus surgical) and timing of surgery are needed. We recommend early surgery, and restricted rehabilitation, for high-grade acromioclavicular joint dislocation.

### New quantitative radiographic parameters for vertical and horizontal instability in acromioclavicular joint dislocations [^116fp6as]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Rahm et al. Gastaud et al. and others have all shown that despite standardized protocols, classic axillary views are not recommended to assess posterior translation. Our assessment of the effect of projectional variation on our novel quantitative parameters demonstrated that even with 10° and 20° of malpositioning in various planes included, AC–DC and GC–PC continuously increased with increasing severity of ACJ separation. For AC–DC, the maximum mean difference to neutral was 3.2 mm in 20° of anteverted malpositioning, all the other projectional variations lead to a mean difference of less than 2 mm. The various mean projectional variations had even less of an impact on GC–PC with a maximum of 3.1 mm demonstrated with 20° of retroverted malpositioning. A comparative assessment of these quantitative radiographic parameters for ACJ separation to a normal uninjured control side may demonstrate a slight overestimation of AC–DC if the shoulder is too anteverted or adducted. And an underestimation is possible if the shoulder is too abducted or retroverted for AC–DC and anteverted for GC–PC. Both increase in anteversion and retroversion can generally be detected if the glenoid is not centred within the Y formed by the lateral and medial border of the scapula on the Alexander view.

### Bilateral weighted radiographs are required for accurate classification of acromioclavicular separation: an observational study of 59 cases [^1131MwKu]. Injury (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Misinterpretation of the Rockwood classification system for acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) separations has resulted in a trend towards using unilateral radiographs for grading. Further, the use of weighted views to 'unmask' a grade III injury has fallen out of favour. Recent evidence suggests that many radiographic grade III injuries represent only a partial injury to the stabilising ligaments. This study aimed to determine (1) whether accurate classification is possible on unilateral radiographs and (2) the efficacy of weighted bilateral radiographs in unmasking higher-grade injuries.

Methods

Complete bilateral non-weighted and weighted sets of radiographs for patients presenting with an acromioclavicular separation over a 10-year period were analysed retrospectively, and they were graded I-VI according to Rockwood's criteria. Comparison was made between grading based on (1) a single antero-posterior (AP) view of the injured side, (2) bilateral non-weighted views and (3) bilateral weighted views. Radiographic measurements for cases that changed grade after weighted views were statistically compared to see if this could have been predicted beforehand.

Results

Fifty-nine sets of radiographs on 59 patients (48 male, mean age of 33 years) were included. Compared with unilateral radiographs, non-weighted bilateral comparison films resulted in a grade change for 44 patients (74.5%). Twenty-eight of 56 patients initially graded as I, II or III were upgraded to grade V and two of three initial grade V patients were downgraded to grade III. The addition of a weighted view further upgraded 10 patients to grade V. No grade II injury was changed to grade III and no injury of any severity was downgraded by a weighted view. Grade III injuries upgraded on weighted views had a significantly greater baseline median percentage coracoclavicular distance increase than those that were not upgraded (80.7% vs. 55.4%, p = 0.015). However, no cut-off point for this value could be identified to predict an upgrade.

Conclusions

The accurate classification of ACJ separation requires weighted bilateral comparative views. Attempts to predict grade on a single AP radiograph result in a gross underestimation of severity. The value of bilateral weighted views is to 'unmask' a grade V injury, and it is recommended as a first-line investigation.

### Incidence of associated injuries with acute acromioclavicular joint dislocations types III through V [^1145GMLd]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Traumatic acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocations are common injuries among the active population. The injury mechanism requires excessive force delivered by a fall or blow to the shoulder. Associated injuries may occur and remain undetected if they are masked by the painful and prominent AC joint injury.

Hypothesis

Intra-articular injuries associated with high-grade AC joint dislocations are common.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

Between 2002 and 2007, 77 patients (68 male, 9 female; average age, 35.5 years; range, 17–62 years) were surgically treated for acute AC joint dislocations (Rockwood type III, 5; type IV, 30; and type V, 42). All patients underwent diagnostic glenohumeral joint arthroscopy. Concomitant intra-articular injuries were identified and treated.

Results

Intra-articular injuries were found in 14 of 77 patients (18.2%). Superior labral anterior posterior (SLAP) lesions were observed in 11 of 77 patients 14.3% (SLAP I, 3; II, 2; III, 3; and IV, 3). Nineteen percent of Rockwood V lesions had associated SLAP lesions (SLAP I excluded), whereas only 3.4% of Rockwood IV lesions showed SLAP lesions. A complete supraspinatus tear was detected in 1 case, and partial articular-sided supraspinatus tears were detected in 2 cases. Four patients sustained an accompanying fracture.

Conclusion

Concomitant injuries to the shoulder girdle obtained during traumatic AC joint separation may be more frequent than previously thought. Clinical diagnosis may be difficult in the setting of an acute and painful dislocated AC joint. Shoulder arthroscopy during arthroscopic AC joint stabilization may aid in detecting associated injuries.

### Biomechanical and radiographic analysis of partial coracoclavicular ligament injuries [^111tqba1]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

A spectrum of acromioclavicular joint injuries may exist between type II acromioclavicular joint disruption (coracoclavicular strain) and type III acromioclavicular joint injuries (coracoclavicular disruption). This may help explain the variability in outcomes seen in patients with type II acromioclavicular injuries.

Hypothesis

Injury to either the conoid or trapezoid ligaments would lead to instability of the acromioclavicular joint after complete acromioclavicular joint injury. A secondary hypothesis was that the resulting instability could be recognized with Zanca radiographs.

Study Design

Controlled laboratory study.

Methods

The acromioclavicular ligaments were sectioned in 40 cadaveric shoulder specimens. Ten intact specimens were loaded to failure to evaluate the normal failure patterns of the coracoclavicular ligaments. Thirty specimens then had either the conoid or trapezoid ligament sectioned after creation of complete acromioclavicular joint injury. Preinjury and postinjury radiographs and stability testing quantified the effect of coracoclavicular joint injury on acromioclavicular joint stability.

Results

During failure testing, the conoid always failed first. Sectioning of the conoid led to significant increases in posterior and superior displacement on radiographs and with materials testing. Sectioning of the trapezoid led to significant increases in posterior displacement for materials testing and superior displacement on radiographs.

Conclusion

Sectioning of the acromioclavicular ligaments in conjunction with partial disruption of the coracoclavicular ligament complex led to significant changes in both radiographic and mechanical measures of acromioclavicular stability. The conoid fails first when a load is applied to the coracoclavicular complex in a superior direction.

Clinical Relevance

Zanca radiograph may detect incomplete injury to the coracoclavicular ligaments associated with acromioclavicular disruption.

### Scapulothoracic dissociation with acromioclavicular separation: a case report of a novel fixation method [^116cWdHo]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2008). Low credibility.

We present a case of 39-year-old female with a scapulothoracic dissociation and acromioclavicular (AC) separation and who had fixation of the AC joint with a locking plate, coracoclavicular screw, and transarticular AC screw. The coracoclavicular and AC relationships were maintained during postoperative rehabilitation and after hardware removal. Use of a locking plate can lead to good functional outcome without the complications associated with the use of pin and wire constructs or without violating the subacromial space.

### New quantitative radiographic parameters for vertical and horizontal instability in acromioclavicular joint dislocations [^116sktW1]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Projectional variation

The effect of projectional variation due to malpositioning error on AC–DC measurements for vertical instability is less than one millimetre for deviation in the sagittal plane, and a maximum of 3.2 mm for 20° of anteversion (Fig. 5 a). Malpositioning with abduction and retroversion tends to slightly underestimate the true value, whilst adduction and anteversion leads to a slight overestimation. For GC–PC measurements, a projectional variation of 20° retroversion leads to 3.1 mm difference. (Figure 5 b). Extension, anteversion and abduction slightly overestimate the true value to within 2 mm, whilst adduction and flexion demonstrate negligible (< 0.3 mm) deviation.

Fig. 5
Effect of projectional variation relating to the malposition. Mean deviations of the projectional variations (± 10°, ± 20°) are shown for AC–DC (a) and GC–PC (b) compared to neutral. Mean values are calculated including the different injuries. Lower values indicate underestimation, higher values overestimation. Axial variations are shown in dotted, sagittal variations dot dashed and coronal variation dashed

### High degree of consensus achieved regarding diagnosis and treatment of acromioclavicular joint instability among ESA-ESSKA members [^115F3pgk]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Conservative treatment is once again an unclarified issue. It generally involves immobilization of the arm. Several types of arm immobilizers have been proposed ranging from a broadarm sling up to Kenny–Howard splint, taping and casts. Immobilization can last from 3 days up to 3 weeks based on Rockwood type, subsiding pain and/or different protocols available. Rehabilitation starts gradually after sling removal. Unfortunately, no previous studies aimed to clarify whether one immobilizer is better than the other neither if a longer period of immobilization has a biologic rationale, therefore, the final decision is always up to the surgeon's experience. The ESA panel aimed to summarize the current literature, thus providing a sort of reasonable guideline to follow and a consensus has been reached on this topic. Conservative management of low-grade AC joint dislocations was unified with postoperative management of high-grade AC joint dislocations. Three weeks of immobilization seemed a reasonable time to provide an initial biological ingrowth, thus avoiding risks related to a longer immobilization period (e.g. shoulder stiffness). However, 6 weeks are warranted before regaining full range of motion and activities of daily living. Sports activities are not allowed before 4 months. Anyhow, according to the ESA panel, pain still remains the main criteria for return to full activities as well as to switch a conservative management into a surgical one.

Nevertheless, some issues still remain controversial and represent the limitations of the present study. One for all, outcome measures to evaluate the management of ACJ injuries are not consistently reported in the literature, therefore, they could not even be included in the consensus process. Further, the lack of uniformity in reported outcomes and the abundance of conservative treatment protocols as well as surgical techniques reported in the literature make any kind of comparison difficult or somehow inconclusive.

Due to the lack of prospective randomized trials, this consensus statement is meant to be a guideline to get insight into the complex topic of diagnosis and treatment of AC joint dislocations for the general orthopaedic surgeon and even for shoulder specialists, respectively.

### New quantitative radiographic parameters for vertical and horizontal instability in acromioclavicular joint dislocations [^115qt1Am]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Static imaging does not allow us to assess the ligamentous structures that maintain ACJ stability — dynamic or stress views are necessary. Although both Tossy et al. and Rockwood have discussed ACJ separations in the context of the CC and AC ligaments, their radiographic classification systems is largely based on the vertical displacement in the coronal plane, except for the type IV injury. The Rockwood classification, using the CC distances and axillary views have showed a poor inter- and intraobserver reliability and additional 3 dimensional CT reconstruction of the ACJ does not provide further insight. There was poor agreement even among experienced surgeons as confirmed by Kraeutler et al.

This study indicates that the intra- and interobserver agreement on CC distances in the frontal plane for vertical displacement was excellent. However, AC–DC also demonstrated excellent reliability as a quantitative radiographic parameter for vertical instability in the Alexander view with considerably greater validity in comparison with CC distance. Hence, AC–DC was found to have not only the best agreement among surgeons but also the best convergent validity with the strongest correlation between AC–DC measurements and the actual effective vertical displacement. Additionally, the discriminant validity determined by the effect size showed excellent ability of AC–DC in differentiating various grades of ACJ dislocation. In contrast, the CC distance was less discriminant. The measurement of a low CC distance in the Zanca view despite the presence of significant posterior displacement in the horizontal plane suggests that the Rockwood system may underestimate the severity of ACJ separations and therefore misguide surgeons towards non-operative management and poor outcomes. This hypothesis is supported by both, Nemec et al. and Schaefer et al. who demonstrated a different degree of AC ligament injury on MRI in comparison with the original radiographic Rockwood classification system. Interestingly, up to 25% additional ligament injuries were detected by MRI.

### Interobserver and intraobserver reliability of radiographic classification of acromioclavicular joint dislocations [^111YY8Se]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Hypothesis and Background

The classification and treatment of acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocations remain controversial. The purpose of this study was to determine the interobserver and intraobserver reliability of the Rockwood classification system. We hypothesized poor interobserver and intraobserver reliability, limiting the role of the Rockwood classification system in determining severity of AC joint dislocations and accurately guiding treatment decisions.

Methods

We identified 200 patients with AC joint injuries using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code 831.04. Fifty patients met inclusion criteria. Deidentified radiographs were compiled and presented to 6 fellowship-trained upper extremity orthopedic surgeons. The surgeons classified each patient into 1 of the 6 classification types described by Rockwood. A second review was performed several months later by 2 surgeons. A κ value was calculated to determine the interobserver and intraobserver reliability.

Results

The interobserver and intraobserver κ values were fair (κ = 0.278) and moderate (κ = 0.468), respectively. Interobserver results showed that 4 of the 50 radiographic images had a unanimous classification. Intraobserver results for the 2 surgeons showed that 18 of the 50 images were rated the same on second review by the first surgeon and 38 of the 50 images were rated the same on second review by the second surgeon.

Conclusion

We found that the Rockwood classification system has limited interobserver and intraobserver reliability. We believe that unreliable classification may account for some of the inconsistent treatment outcomes among patients with similarly classified injuries. We suggest that a better classification system is needed to use radiographic imaging for diagnosis and treatment of AC joint dislocations.

### High degree of consensus achieved regarding diagnosis and treatment of acromioclavicular joint instability among ESA-ESSKA members [^1117bdEc]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

A consensus process with an international panel of experienced clinicians using the modified Delphi technique was implemented.

The Delphi procedure is a systematic instrument, which aims to measure and develop consensus when empirical evidence is lacking. The ESSKA-ESA followed the steps of this procedure to guarantee the quality of its work.

The process consisted of two consecutive phases: systematic literature reviews and consensus development.

Systematic review

The systematic literature reviews of imaging and treatment were published in 2018. These publications were made available for the questions of the Delphi consensus.

The results of the literature search were then allocated according to the three following items: imaging; classification; and treatment. All search results not allocated to the above were not considered for further evaluation.

Consensus development

According to Hsu et al. and Audige et al. the Delphi consensus was developed. Criteria for not further asking a question in the next round were: (a) ≥ 66.7% of the participants agreed on one answer; (b) The percentage of the answer was steady between two rounds; c) If no consensus was found in round 5, this question was marked as having "no consensus" for any of the answers.

In total, 5 rounds were performed within 18 months of the Delphi process (systematic reviews in May 2018, round 1 in October 2018, round 5 in November 2019). Round 1 consisted of a panel meeting at the ESA closed meeting in Athens, October 2018. Rounds 2 to 4 were based on online questionnaires. Round 5 was a panel meeting at ESSKA Specialty Days, Madrid, November 2019.

If an answer had not reached consensus within one round, the panel was informed about the percentage on respondent voting for the according answer. Suggestions for new answers were implemented in the next round in rounds 2 to 4. Each round was prepared by the main and senior authors, who remained blinded to respondent identities when reviewing responses.

Nomination and selection of panel members

Panel members were selected among the members of ESA for rounds 2 to 4. For round 1 and 5 the panel was made up by the auditorium willing to participate. For round 5, two participants were chosen to be vote counters. Respondents to either of rounds 2 to 4 were considered panel members and were invited to participate in the final, fifth Delphi round.

### Return to sport and clinical outcomes after surgical management of acromioclavicular joint dislocation: a systematic review [^111LLenC]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the rate at which athletes return to sport after surgical management of acute and chronic acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocations.

Methods

Three databases-PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE-were searched from database inception until October 28, 2017, by 2 reviewers independently and in duplicate. The inclusion criteria were English language studies that reported return to sport outcomes in patients undergoing surgical management of AC joint dislocations.

Results

Overall, 12 studies with a combined total of 315 patients met the inclusion criteria, with a mean age of 33.8 years (range, 18–65 years) and a mean follow-up of 34.9 months (range, 6–126 months). Of the 12 included studies, 1 was a prospective comparative study (Level II), 1 was a retrospective comparative study (Level III), 1 was a prospective case series (Level IV), and 9 were retrospective case series (Level IV). The rates of return to any level of sport ranged from 94% to 100% (I² = 0%), whereas the rates of return to the preinjury level of sport ranged from 62% to 100% (I² = 61%). The pooled rate of return to preinjury level of sport in type V AC joint separations was 86.2% (95% confidence interval = 68.1%-98.0%), whereas that after type III or IV AC joint injuries was 89.6% (95% confidence interval = 79.9%-96.9%).

Conclusions

An almost perfect rate of return to sport participation after surgical management of AC joint dislocations have been reported, with most returning to their preinjury level of sport. The rates of return to sport were comparable across the different types of injuries and surgical procedures.

Level Of Evidence

Level IV, systematic review of Level II, III, and IV investigations.

### Return to sport after surgical treatment for high-grade (rockwood III-VI) acromioclavicular dislocation [^117VSyEy]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

To conduct this systematic review, the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) were followed.

Search strategy

Using the search terms "acromioclavicular joint" and "return to sport/to play", an electronic search was performed in MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE and Cochrane with the assistance of a clinical librarian. There was no restriction on the date of publication. The final search was conducted in September 2018. Based on the titles and abstracts, two reviewers (D.V. and C.W.) independently identified potentially relevant articles for review of the full text. For each identified article, the reference list was screened and a manual search was conducted for articles that could potentially be relevant.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The included articles should be written in English or Dutch and evaluate the return to sport after any type of surgical intervention for high-grade (Rockwood III–VI) AC dislocation in patients practicing sports. There was no restriction on the type of sport, level of sport and age of the patient. Exclusion criteria were reviews of the literature, expert opinions, non-clinical studies, case reports and studies with a sample size of less than 20 athletes. Studies were also excluded when there were insufficient data on the number of patients practicing sports pre- and post-injury. Studies that also included non-athletes in the analysis were only included in this review when separate and sufficient data on the sports-practicing patients were presented.

Data extraction

Data from eligible studies were extracted based on a predefined data extraction form. The following data and baseline parameters were recorded when available: author, publication year, study design, level of evidence, numbers of patients, sex, age, laterality, Rockwood classification (or Tossy III when the Tossy classification was used), acute or chronic injury (with definition of the interval according to the author), operation technique, type of sports, and follow-up time.

The primary objective was to determine the rate of return to sport. Secondary outcomes were the time to return to sport, level of sport pre- and post-injury, clinical outcome scores and complications. Self-reported outcome measures or clinical outcome scores were only considered for analysis when three or more studies reported on this outcome.

### New quantitative radiographic parameters for vertical and horizontal instability in acromioclavicular joint dislocations [^111aJDRj]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) dislocations are a common injury in the young active population. They are invariably classified as per the Rockwood classification. This system is based on the comparative examination of bilateral anterior–posterior stress radiographs and evaluation of the coracoclavicular (CC) distance relative to the uninjured side. This allows an assessment of vertical instability. Several studies have shown that dynamic instability in the horizontal plane is associated with inferior clinical outcomes. Except for Type-4 injuries, the Rockwood classification system does not assess horizontal instability. Furthermore, we do not understand what effect horizontal instability may have on the quantitative assessment of vertical instability. The combined posterior–superior dislocation of the clavicle with respect to the acromion may lead to an unpredictable effect on the radiographic CC distance due to projection — a possible underestimation of the CC distance for example, may inappropriately influence non-operative management of potential high grade injuries.

To our knowledge, there is no reliable way of quantifying both vertical and horizontal instability in ACJ dislocations. The majority of radiographic parameters assessing horizontal instability that have been described in the literature to date are semi quantitative and do not account for the projectional differences that may lead to inaccuracies. Several authors have proposed the use of different radiographic views to assess horizontal instability. The Alexander view is one such view, but the radiographic projection of the ACJ in these views are very sensitive to subtle differences in anatomical position of the ACJ in the coronal, sagittal and axial planes relative to the radiograph beam. This makes comparative assessment (injured side vs uninjured side) with the use of bilateral Alexander views unreliable.

The aim of this study was to identify novel quantitative radiographic parameters for assessing not only vertical but horizontal instability in different Rockwood grades of ACJ dislocations and to investigate the effect of the projectional variation of these parameters in obtaining Alexander view radiographs. In detail, the study includes (1) the analysis of the reliability for the radiographic parameters, (2) the assessment of the validity compared to effective distance and within injury types and (3) the calculation of deviation within projectional variations.

### Return to sport after surgical treatment for high-grade (rockwood III-VI) acromioclavicular dislocation [^112TJcfL]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

After removal of duplicates, our initial search yielded 689 articles (370 from PubMed/MEDLINE, 283 from Embase, 36 from Cochrane) (see Fig. 1). Sixty-five articles were selected for full review after screening through titles and abstracts. Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria and were suitable for data extraction. By screening through the reference lists, one additional article was found to be suitable for inclusion in the review. Of the 12 included studies, there was 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) (level I), 1 prospective comparative study (level II), 4 retrospective comparative studies (level IV) and 6 retrospective case series (level IV). The median MINORS score for the comparative studies was 16.5/24 (range 16–23) and the median MINORS score for the non-comparative studies was 10/16 (range 8–10). Areas of improvement for most studies according to the MINORS were prospective data collection, unbiased assessment of the study endpoint and the prospective calculation of the study size. The RCT was not blinded for patients, personnel and outcome assessment, thereby at risk for detection bias and performance bias. The loss to follow-up was 18%, increasing the risk of attrition bias. Due to the high variety of the different types of sports, level of sports and the surgical techniques, in addition to the methodological heterogeneity and retrospective nature of most study designs, data were not pooled in an official meta-analysis.

Fig. 1
PRISMA flow diagram — inclusion of records

Among all included studies, 498 patients underwent surgery for AC dislocation. Baseline characteristics could not be stratified for athletes since many studies included mixed populations. There were 97 patients diagnosed with Tossy III, 93 patients with Rockwood III, 100 patients with Rockwood IV, 208 with Rockwood V and none with Rockwood VI. The weighted mean age was 34 years (range 28–46) with 87% males. The weighted mean follow-up was 34 months (range 22–48). Of all patients, 462 were athletes practicing all levels of sports, ranging from recreational to professional sports. The five most common sports practiced were mountain biking (13%), rugby (10%), soccer (9%), cycling (9%) and fitness (9%) (see Fig. 2).

### Complications after operative treatment of high-grade acromioclavicular injuries [^111NVMjG]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment of Rockwood type III-V acromioclavicular (AC) joint injuries remains controversial. Numerous reconstruction techniques have been proposed. The purpose of this study was to describe the complication profile in a large cohort of patients who underwent surgical management of AC joint separations using a variety of reconstruction strategies.

Methods

All patients who underwent surgery for AC joint injuries from 2013 to 2019 at a single institution were identified. Chart review was performed to capture patient demographics, radiographic measurements, operative techniques, postoperative complications, and revision surgery. Structural failure was defined as a radiographic loss of reduction of greater than 50% when comparing immediate and final postoperative imaging. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for complications and revision surgery.

Results

Of the 279 patients included in the study, 66 (24%) had type III separations, 20 (7%) type IV, and 193 (69%) type V. Fifty-three percent underwent surgery acutely (< 6 weeks of injury), and 40% were chronic (> 3 months). A total of 252 of the 279 surgeries (90%) were performed open and 27 (10%) were arthroscopically assisted. Allograft was used in 164 of 279 (59%) cases. Specific operative techniques (with or without allograft) included hook plating (1%), modified Weaver Dunn (16%), cortical button fixation (18%), and suture fixation (65%). At mean 28-week follow-up, 108 complications were identified in 97 patients (35%). Complications were identified at mean 20 ± 21 weeks. Sixty-nine structural failures (25%) were identified. Persistent AC joint pain requiring injection, clavicle fracture, adhesive capsulitis, and hardware complications were the other most common complications. Twenty-one patients (8%) underwent unplanned revision surgery at mean 38 ± 28 weeks after the index procedure, with the most common indication for structural failure, hardware complications, or fracture of the clavicle or coracoid. Patients who had surgery after 6 weeks from injury had a significantly greater risk of having a complication (odds ratio [OR] 3.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34–7.77, P = 0.009) and a significantly greater risk of having structural failure (OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.38–5.28, P = 0.004). Patients who had an arthroscopic technique had a greater risk of structural failure (P = 0.002). Complications, structural failure, and revision surgery were not significantly correlated with use of allograft or specific operative techniques.

Conclusion

Surgical management of AC joint injuries is associated with a relatively high complication profile. Loss of reduction in the postoperative period is common. However, the revision surgery rate is low. These findings are important for patient preoperative counseling.

### The V angle compliments radiographic assessment of acute acromioclavicular joint dislocations by differentiating between rockwood types III versus V and by considering dynamic horizontal translation in coronal radiographs [^116C1kUX]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) dislocations are usually graded radiographically according to Rockwood, but differentiation between Rockwood types III and V may be ambiguous. The potentially clinically relevant horizontal instability is barely addressed in coronal radiographs. It was hypothesized that a new radiologic parameter (V angle) would complement ACJ diagnostics on anteroposterior radiographs by differentiating between cases of Rockwood III and V while also considering the aspect of dynamic horizontal translation (DHT).

Methods

Ninety-five patients with acute ACJ dislocations (Rockwood types III and V) were included retrospectively between 2017 and 2020. On anteroposterior views (weightbearing: n = 62, non-weight-bearing: n = 33), the coracoclavicular (CC) distance and the newly introduced V angle for assessing scapular orientation were measured bilaterally. This angle is referenced between the spinal column and a line crossing the superior scapular angle and the crossing point between the supraspinatus fossa and the medial base of the coracoid process, reported as the side-comparative difference (non-injured side *minus* injured side). DHT on Alexander views was divided into stable, partially unstable or completely unstable.

Results

The V angle on the injured side alone (mean 50.0°; 95% confidence interval (CI), 48.6°-51.3°) showed no correlation with the side-comparative CC distance (r = -0.040; n.s.). Thus, the V angle on the non-injured side was considered, displaying a normal distribution (n.s.) with a mean of 58.0° (95% CI, 56.6°-59.4°). The side-comparative V angle showed a correlation with the side-comparative CC distance (r = 0.83; p < 0.001) and was able to differentiate between Rockwood types III (4.7°; 95% CI, 3.9°-5.5°; n = 39) and V (10.3°; 95% CI, 9.7°-11.0°; n = 56) (p < 0.001). A cut-off value of 7° had a 94.6% sensitivity and an 82.1% specificity (area under curve, AUC: 0.954; 95% CI, 0.915–0.994). The side-comparative V angle was greater for cases with complete DHT (8.7°; 95% CI, 7.9°-9.5°; n = 78) than for cases with partial DHT (4.8°; 95% CI, 3.3°-6.3°; n = 16) (p < 0.001). A cut-off value of 5° showed a sensitivity of 84.6% and a specificity of 66.7% (AUC 0.824; 95% CI, 0.725–0.924).

Conclusion

The scapular-based V angle on anteroposterior radiographs distinguishes between Rockwood types III and V as well as cases with partial or complete DHT.

### Acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis: comparison of findings derived from MR imaging and conventional radiography [^1153hgsT]. Clinical Imaging (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation between routine radiography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the analysis of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint osteoarthritis (OA). MR imaging studies of the shoulder in 50 patients performed over a 1-year period at a single institution with corresponding conventional radiographic examinations performed within 1 month of the MR imaging study were restrospectively evaluated by the consensus of two musculoskeletal radiologists with special attention to the AC joint. As conclusion, information provided by conventional radiography in the analysis of AC joint OA does not correlate with that provided by MR imaging. AC joint OA is more frequently detected with MR imaging than with radiography. MR imaging provides better assessment of the full extent of AC joint OA and its effect on the underlying RC.

### New quantitative radiographic parameters for vertical and horizontal instability in acromioclavicular joint dislocations [^1164Wxrt]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Radiographic imaging

Radiographic imaging included computed tomography (CT) scanning and conventional radiography. Once the Sawbone model was setup to simulate a particular Rockwood grade of ACJ dislocation, CT scans were performed on a Siemens Somatom Definition Flash System (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with the following scanning parameters: tube voltage 140 kV/; tube current 350mAs; matrix 512 × 512; slice thickness 0.6 mm. Then, a series of radiographs were taken for each injury type with the neutral position and with the simulated projectional variations (Fig. 2). First, an anterior–posterior (AP) Zanca view radiograph was taken with the standardized technique. The radiographic tube to image distance was 120 cm. The central beam was directed to the midpoint of the centre of the glenoid including an angle of 10° cranial tilt of the beam. Second, an lateral Alexander view radiograph focusing on the centre of the glenoid was taken. In total, 2 × 91 radiographs and 7 CT were obtained for further analysis. All images were assigned an identification number in random order and stored in the picture archiving and communications system (PACS).

Fig. 2
Overview of the radiographic imaging. First, an anterior–posterior Zanca view radiograph was taken with the standardized technique and second, a lateral Alexander view radiograph with an angle of 10° cranial tilt of the beam

Radiographic measurements

On the AP Zanca view, the commonly used and often published CC distance was measured as the distance between the knee of the coracoid and the inferior cortex of the clavicle for vertical displacement. Five new parameters were defined for radiographic analysis in the lateral Alexander view as shown in Fig. 3. The acromial centre line to dorsal clavicle (AC–DC) and centre cranialization (CCran) for vertical displacement, and maximal overlap (OL), lateral extension (LE) and the glenoid centre line to posterior clavicle (GC–PC) for horizontal displacement.

### What imaging-detected pathologies are associated with shoulder symptoms and their persistence? A systematic literature review [^115aqJV9]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Adhesive capsulitis

Six studies 15, 60, 65, 71, 73, 74 evaluated the relationship between adhesive capsulitis and pain (Tables 1, 2, and 3). Two high‐quality MRI studies reported enhancement of the joint capsule in the axillary recess, and RC interval was associated with pain intensity 15, 60. One MRI study showed that capsular thickening was associated with decreased external rotation 15. Two PET studies of mixed quality showed increased uptake of ¹⁸F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (¹⁸F-FDG) in the RC interval, anterior joint capsule, or axillary recess 73, 74. One low‐quality bone scintigraphy study reported no difference 71. One low‐quality study using bone scintigraphy and radiographs showed increased technetium uptake but no association between passive range of motion or recovery 65. In summary, high‐quality, unadjusted studies have shown imaging features associated with symptoms in adhesive capsulitis 15, 60, 73.

Other features

Several studies evaluated other pathology imaging features. None of these were adjusted. Radiographically, 1 high‐quality study showed that reduced upward and axial rotational tilts of the scapula were impaired in shoulder pain 66. There was no relationship in abnormal scapular planar glenohumeral motion measured using radiographs in patients with RC tears and pain in a low‐quality study 69. One high‐quality MRI study reported that the presence of glenohumeral effusion was not related to pain 59. One high‐quality radiographic study found that in symptomatic patients with full RC tears > 175 mm², pain was correlated with humeral migration 30. One low‐quality study reported an association between the absence of subacromial fat in patients with impingement 62. One high‐quality study reported no association between acromioglenoid angle, supraspinatus‐glenoid angle, and pain 53. Glenoid‐labral tear was associated with disability on MRI in a high‐quality study 16. In another high‐quality MRI study, glenoid‐labral tears or cartilage damage were not associated with pain or functional impairment 49. In 1 high‐quality ultrasound study, coracohumeral interval was significantly narrower in symptomatic shoulders (P < 0.0001) 33.

### A relook at the reliability of rockwood classification for acromioclavicular joint injuries [^111DBt2p]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Controversies for treatment of acromioclavicular joint injuries in particular type III injuries may be partially attributed to the lack of a standardized method of radiography and measurement technique. Previous studies looking at the Rockwood classification showed poor inter- and intraobserver reliability (Kappa value approximately 0.20–0.50). We hypothesized that the use of unilateral instead of bilateral acromioclavicular joint radiographs was the cause of this finding. In this article, we standardized the methodology to perform the radiograph and to measure the coracoclavicular distances. We designed the study to focus on the reliability of differentiating type III and type V injuries.

Methods

A standardized radiographic protocol for bilateral Zanca view was established in our institution. All patients who underwent this radiographic examination over a 3-year period were reviewed. Radiographs of 55 patients with significant (type III or V) injury met the inclusion criteria. For the interobserver reliability, a retrospective radiographic review was performed by 6 orthopedic surgeons and graded as either type III or V. For intraobserver reliability, a similar process was repeated by 3 observers after a period of 6 weeks.

Results

Going by the majority agreement of the 6 reviewers, there were 34 type III injuries and 19 type V injuries. The Fleiss kappa for interobserver reliability was calculated to be 0.624. The Cohen kappa for intraobserver reliability was calculated to be 0.696.

Discussion

The use of a standardized radiographic protocol-taking bilateral Zanca views on the same radiographic plate-would help eliminate a significant amount of variability and improve the reliability of classifying acromioclavicular joint injuries using the Rockwood classification, which uses a relative measure to the contralateral site as its definition criteria. Other possible sources of poor reliability may include the masking of injuries by muscle spasm, resulting in a misdiagnosis of a high-grade injury as a lower-grade one and the possible need to subclassify type III injuries.

Conclusion

Reliability of the Rockwood classification can be improved through the use of a standardized radiographic protocol to improve the detection of vertical instability. Similar to Rockwood dividing up Tossy grade 3 injuries when he noted the differential outcome and intervention, Rockwood type III injuries would likely require further subclassification as it remains an anomalous tool with high variability. Further studies are required to understand the pathologic basis of transition of type III into type V injury.

### Return to sport after surgical treatment for high-grade (rockwood III-VI) acromioclavicular dislocation [^112DD2L3]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acromioclavicular (AC) joint injuries are common in young athletes with an incidence of 9.2 per 1000 person-years. The incidence of AC injuries is higher in contact sports and is highest in adults in their 20s. Full recovery with return to pre-injury level of sports and minimal time lost to injury is essential in the treatment of these injuries.

The Rockwood classification is most commonly used for classifying AC joint injuries according to the severity. Most type I and II dislocations are treated conservatively. For type IV to VI AC joint dislocations, surgical treatment generally is the intervention of choice. The optimal management of type III AC joint dislocations remains controversial. A trend is set toward initial non-surgical treatment, unless non-surgical treatment fails in patients with persistent pain or the inability to return to sport or work.

Many surgical techniques have been described for the repair of AC joint dislocations. When evaluating surgical treatment, existing literature mainly measures functionality with outcome scores or self-reported outcome measures. Limited literature exists about the rate of return to sport in this population. However, return to sport has been found to be a good indicator of success after treatment for injuries to the musculoskeletal body. Analyzing the rate of return to sport could provide surgeons and patients with relevant outcome information to optimize shared decision making. The purpose of this systematic review is to assess the rate of return to sport after surgical intervention in high-grade AC dislocation (Rockwood III–VI), to help surgeons address patient expectations. In contrast to the existing literature on this topic, the present review aims to combine outcomes of sports-practicing patients of studies with larger sample sizes and more recent studies with higher levels of evidence.

### Advanced imaging of glenohumeral instability: the role of MRI and MDCT in providing what clinicians need to know [^114BQmrN]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The inherently unstable anatomy of glenohumeral (GH) joint predisposes it to shoulder dislocation. Shoulder dislocation can occur either due to acute trauma or due to chronic microtraumas in the setting of underlying morphological abnormality. A plain radiograph is the initial imaging modality for diagnosis and management of shoulder dislocation and its associated osseous abnormalities such as Hill-Sachs deformity or osseous Bankart lesion. However, advanced imaging techniques such as multidetector CT (MDCT) with three-dimensional (3D) volume rendering and MRI can be helpful in further characterization of osseous abnormalities and detection of associated soft tissue injuries, respectively. These additional findings may be useful for optimal surgical repair for GH joint stabilization. In this pictorial essay, we present the clinically relevant osseous and soft tissue pathologies in various types of shoulder dislocation, with emphasis on pathologies that can be demonstrated using advanced imaging examinations. Discussed pathologies include glenoid fractures, labral tears, Bankart lesion, Hill-Sachs defect, Perthes lesion, anterior labral posterior sleeve avulsion (ALPSA), glenolabral articular disruption (GLAD), humeral avulsion of the glenohumeral ligament (HAGL), Kim lesion, and other associated soft tissue and nerve injuries.

### Editorial commentary: acromioclavicular joint reconstruction with double-bundle constructs provides improved maintenance of reduction but comparable clinical outcomes versus single-bundle constructs [^113PDEJk]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment of acute acromioclavicular (AC) joint separations is dependent on a variety of factors, including severity, acuity, patient demographics, activity level, and surgeon preferences. For more severe or unstable separations (Rockwood types IIIB, IV, V, and VI), surgical intervention is typically recommended. Over 160 surgical techniques have been described, but none have emerged as a gold standard. Arthroscopic-assisted or all-arthroscopic fixation of the coracoclavicular ligaments with suture buttons has become increasingly popular due to lower complication rates compared with more rigid fixation. Configurations include single-bundle (SB) constructs and double-bundle (DB) configurations that more anatomically reconstruct the conoid and trapezoid ligaments but with longer operative times. Clinical studies with short-term follow-up have demonstrated improved maintenance of fixation for DB compared with SB constructs but no significant differences in clinical outcomes. In our experience, SB suture button-only constructs lead to unacceptable failures due to loss of reduction. We recommend either a single suture button construct augmented with allograft or DB suture button constructs for the treatment of acute AC joint separations.

### Midshaft clavicle fractures with associated ipsilateral acromioclavicular joint dislocations: incidence and risk factors [^115tPZob]. Injury (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Simultaneous ipsilateral clavicle and acromioclavicular (AC) joint injury have been infrequently reported in the literature at this time. The purpose of this study was to assess incidence as well as assess risk factors for this dual injury pattern.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database (Level III evidence), evaluating 383 adult patients without previous shoulder girdle injury or trauma with a minimum 1-year follow-up who sustained a displaced diaphyseal clavicle fracture. All patients in the study underwent either nonoperative management or surgical reduction and stabilization of a diaphyseal clavicle fracture with a plate and screw construct. Study subjects were followed with serial radiographs. Clavicle and shoulder radiographs, as well as chest radiographs and contralateral films in questionable cases, were used to assess for acromioclavicular joint injury in both operative and nonoperative groups. Additional data was collected on concurrent injuries, patient demographics, fracture characteristics, fixation techniques, surgical/post-operative data, and operative or nonoperative treatment.

Results

We found that 13/183 (7.1%) of patients undergoing fixation of a diaphyseal clavicle fracture had an ipsilateral AC joint injury, while 13/200 (6.5%) of patients undergoing conservative management had an ipsilateral AC joint injury. Critical analysis of the data revealed that presence of ipsilateral scapular body fractures, and a likely incidental association with superior plating fixation, were associated with an increased rate of this injury pattern.

Conclusions

Ipsilateral clavicle fracture and AC joint injury is much more common than traditionally believed, with an incidence of 6.8% overall. It is unknown how the presence of an associated AC injury influences outcome, as AC injury was not universally symptomatic.

### Can symptomatic acromioclavicular joints be differentiated from asymptomatic acromioclavicular joints on 3-T MR imaging? [^1163zEpQ]. European Journal of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate retrospectively whether symptomatic acromioclavicular joints can be differentiated from asymptomatic acromioclavicular joints on 3-T MR imaging.

Methods

This study included 146 patients who underwent physical examination of acromioclavicular joints and 3-T MR imaging of the shoulder. Among them, 67 patients showing positive results on physical examination were assigned to the symptomatic group, whereas 79 showing negative results were assigned to the asymptomatic group. The following MR findings were compared between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups: presence of osteophytes, articular surface irregularity, subchondral cysts, acromioclavicular joint fluid, subacromial fluid, subacromial bony spurs, joint capsular distension, bone edema, intraarticular enhancement, periarticular enhancement, superior and inferior joint capsular distension degree, and joint capsular thickness. The patients were subsequently divided into groups based on age (younger, older) and the method of MR arthrography (direct MR arthrography, indirect MR arthrography), and all the MR findings in each subgroup were reanalyzed. The meaningful cutoff value of each significant continuous variable was calculated using receiver operating characteristic analysis.

Results

The degree of superior capsular distension was the only significant MR finding of symptomatic acromioclavicular joints and its meaningful cutoff value was 2.1mm. After subgroup analyses, this variable was significant in the older age group and indirect MR arthrography group.

Conclusion

On 3-T MR imaging, the degree of superior joint capsular distension might be a predictable MR finding in the diagnosis of symptomatic acromioclavicular joints.

### Arthroscopic treatment of a massive acromioclavicular joint cyst [^112j8FUS]. Arthroscopy (2007). Low credibility.

A healthy 75-year-old man presented with a 9-month history of an enlarging painless shoulder mass. On examination, there was a 10 × 10 cm firm mass overlying the acromioclavicular (AC) joint. The active range of motion of the shoulder joint was 130 degrees of forward elevation, 90 degrees of abduction, 60 degrees of abduction and internal rotation to the level of the waist. There was weakness of the rotator cuff. Plain radiographs showed degenerative changes of the AC joint with superior migration of the humeral head. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large cyst arising from a degenerative AC joint with an associated major tear of both the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. Arthroscopy of the AC joint and debridement of the cyst was performed in the lateral decubitus position. The major rotator cuff tear of supraspinatus and infraspinatus was confirmed. A conservative subacromial decompression and AC joint excision arthroplasty was performed. As the superior AC ligament was opened, dark brown gelatinous material was seen emanating from the cyst. A thorough debridement of the cyst was performed until the lavage fluid was clear. At last follow-up 6 months after surgery, the shoulder remained asymptomatic with no evidence of recurrence of the cyst. Arthroscopic treatment of a massive AC joint cyst allows assessment of associated pathology, is minimally invasive, and allows early rehabilitation.

### New quantitative radiographic parameters for vertical and horizontal instability in acromioclavicular joint dislocations [^1113fLtn]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Validity

Whereas the validity was excellent for AC–DC in vertical displacement and for GC–PC in horizontal displacement, the remaining measurements showed moderate validity (Table 2).

The convergent validity, which represents the correlation between a radiographic parameter and the effective distance measured on CT, was 0.972 for AC–DC and 0.968 for GC–PC. Despite radiographic projectional variation of up to 20° due to malpositioning, convergent validity remained excellent for AC–DC and GC–PC with only marginal decrease in the correlation coefficient.

The discriminant validity, which represents a parameters ability to distinguish between different grades of ACJ separations, was excellent for AD-DC (0.952) and for GC–PC (0.964). Although CCran also demonstrated good discriminant validity (0.905), this measurements do not increase or decrease with an increase in vertical displacement between the different grades of ACJ separation as illustrated in Table 3. Hence, it has no utility in clinical practice.

Table 3
Radiographic parameters and effective CT distance for each injury type

Data are presented with mean and standard deviations (SD) as absolute value measured in millimetre (mm). SD derives from projectional variations. Differences were tested for significance with independent ANOVA analysis and presented with p-value

*Values are significant at level < 0.05

The individual values with 95% CI for AC–DC (Fig. 4 a) and GC–PC (Fig. 4 b) demonstrate that these measurements differentiate worsening severity of the ACJ dislocation effectively. In contrast, the CC distance does not differentiate the various grades of injury as well (Fig. 4 c). Although the width of the 95% CI for AC–DC and GC–PC increases with the degree of projectional variation, minor deviations are negligible because they are less extensive than differences between injury type. Whereas vertical displacement measured by AC–DC is able to differentiate between all ACJ dislocations groups, the horizontal displacement measured by GC–PC is unable to clearly differentiate between the control and RWII-0 groups, as well as RWII-25 and RWIII-0 groups.

### Return to play after surgical treatment for acromioclavicular joint dislocation: a systematic review [^112MpE2S]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation is a common clinical problem among young and athletic populations. Surgical management is widely used for high-grade dislocations (Rockwood III-VI) and in high-demand athletes at high risk of recurrence.

Purpose

To systematically review the evidence in the literature to ascertain the rate and timing of return to play (RTP) and the availability of specific criteria for safe RTP after surgical treatment for AC joint dislocation.

Study Design

Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

A systematic literature search based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines was conducted in the PubMed database. Clinical studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported on RTP after surgical treatment for AC joint dislocation. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS.

Results

We found 120 studies including 4327 cases meeting our inclusion criteria. The majority of patients were male (80.2%), with a mean age of 37.2 years (range, 15–85) and a mean follow-up of 34.5 months. Most were recreational athletes (79%), and the most common sport was cycling. The overall rate of RTP was 91.5%, with 85.6% returning to the same level of play. Among collision athletes, the rate of RTP was 97.3%, with 97.2% returning to the same level of play. In overhead athletes, the rate of RTP was 97.1%, with 79.2% returning to the same level of play. The mean time to RTP was 5.7 months (range, 1.5–15). Specific RTP criteria were reported in the majority of the studies (83.3%); time to return to play was the most commonly reported item (83.3%). Type III Rockwood injuries had the highest RTP rate at 98.7% and the earliest RTP at 4.9 months. Among the different surgical techniques, Kirschner wire fixation had the highest rate of RTP at 98.5%, while isolated graft reconstruction had the earliest RTP at 3.6 months.

Conclusion

The overall rate of RTP was reportedly high after surgical treatment for AC joint dislocation, with the majority of patients returning to their preinjury levels of sport. There is a lack of consensus in the literature for what constitutes a safe RTP, with further focus on this topic required in future studies.

### Arthroscopically assisted stabilization of acute high-grade acromioclavicular joint separations [^116FDMmz]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results after arthroscopically assisted and image intensifier — controlled stabilization of high-grade acromioclavicular (AC) joint separations using the double TightRope technique with the first-generation implant.

Hypothesis

The double TightRope technique using the first-generation implant leads to good clinical and radiological results by re-creating the anatomy of the AC joint.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

Thirty-seven consecutive patients (4 women and 33 men; mean age, 38.6 years) who sustained an acute AC joint dislocation grade V according to Rockwood were included in this prospective study. The Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV), the Constant Score (CS), the Taft Score (TS), and a newly developed Acromioclavicular Joint Instability Score (ACJI) were used for final follow-up. Bilateral stress views and bilateral Alexander views were taken to evaluate radiographic signs of recurrent vertical and horizontal AC joint instability.

Results

Twenty-eight patients (2 women and 26 men; mean age, 38.8 years [range, 18–66 years]) could be evaluated after a mean follow-up of 26.5 months (range, 20.1–32.8 months). The interval from trauma to surgery averaged 7.3 days (range, 0–18 days). The mean SSV reached 95.1% (range, 85%-100%), the mean CS was 91.5 points (range, 84–100) (contralateral side: mean, 92.6 points), the mean TS was 10.5 points (range, 7–12), and the ACJI averaged 79.9 points (range, 45–100). The final coracoclavicular distance was 13.6 mm (range, 5–27 mm) on the operated versus 9.4 mm (range, 4–15 mm) on the contralateral side (P < .05). Radiographic signs of posterior instability were noted in 42.9% of cases. Patients with evidence of posterior instability had significantly inferior results in the TS and the ACJI (P < .05). Neither coracoid fractures nor early (within 6 weeks postoperatively) loss of reduction due to tunnel malpositioning or implant loosening was observed.

Conclusion

The combined arthroscopically assisted and image intensifier — controlled double TightRope technique using implants of the first-generation represents a safe technique and yields good to excellent early clinical results despite the presence of partial recurrent vertical and horizontal AC joint instability.

### Prevalence and pattern of glenohumeral injuries among acute high-grade acromioclavicular joint instabilities [^111AVyis]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

With increasing numbers of arthroscopically assisted acromioclavicular (AC) joint stabilization procedures has come an increase in reports of concomitant glenohumeral injuries among AC joint separations. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence, pattern, and cause of glenohumeral pathologies among a large patient population with acute high-grade AC joint instability.

Materials and Methods

A total of 125 patients (13 women, 112 men) with high-grade AC joint dislocation (6 Rockwood II; 119 Rockwood V) underwent diagnostic glenohumeral arthroscopy before AC joint repair. Pathologic lesions were evaluated for acute or degenerative origin and, if considered relevant, treated all-arthroscopically.

Results

Concomitant glenohumeral pathologies were found in 38 of 125 patients (30.4%). Analysis of pathogenesis distinguished different patterns of accompanying injuries: acute intra-articular lesions, related to the recent shoulder trauma, were found in 9 patients (7.2%), degenerative lesions, considered to be unrelated to the recent trauma, were found in 18 (14.4%), and 11 (8.8%) had an unclear traumatic correlation (intermediate group). Within the acute and the degenerative group, affected structures were predominantly partial, articular-sided tears of the anterosuperior rotator cuff, including instabilities of the pulley complex, followed by pathologies of the long head of the biceps and superior labrum anteroposterior lesions. The intermediate group presented mainly with articular-sided partial tears of the subscapularis tendon.

Conclusions

This prospective study showed a high prevalence (30%) of concomitant glenohumeral pathologies, of which some indicate additional surgical therapy and could be missed by an isolated open AC repair. Hence, the arthroscopic approach for AC joint stabilization allows for the diagnosis and treatment of associated intra-articular pathologies.

### The importance of biomechanical properties in revision acromioclavicular joint stabilization: a scoping review [^113BRkda]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Treatment of failed primary reconstruction of the unstable acromioclavicular (AC) joint remains challenging for orthopaedic surgeons. When approaching revision cases, the reason for failure has to be precisely identified. The purpose of this manuscript was to perform a critical review of the literature regarding treatment options for failed AC joint stabilization techniques and to provide a treatment algorithm for salvage procedures.

Methods

A thorough search included electronic databases for articles published up to April 15th, 2019. Inclusion criteria were set as (1) studies that reported on clinical outcomes following surgical or conservative treatment of AC joint dislocation; (2) studies reporting on failure or complications of primary treatment; (3) chronic instabilities caused by delayed or secondary treatment as well as (4) revision and salvage procedures.

Results

The search strategy identified a total of 3269 citations. The final dataset comprised 84 studies published between 1954 and 2019. A total of 5605 patients (9.63% females) were involved with a mean age of 34.5 years. Overall, complication rates varied between 5 and 88.9% in patients with AC joint instability.

Conclusion

In the current literature, evidence for treatment of revision AC joint instability is still lacking, however, surgical treatment continues to evolve. The importance of failure analysis and clinically relevant algorithms were highlighted in this review. Adequately restoring native joint biomechanics is needed for ensuring an optimal healing environment that will translate into patient satisfaction and long-term stability.

RC tears

Sixteen studies evaluated the relationship of RC tears and symptoms (16, 21, 26, 29, 30, 32, 35, 45, 48, 49, 52, 54, 56, 58, 62, 72) (Tables 1, 2, and 3). Nine evaluated the relationship with shoulder pain 16, 21, 30, 32, 35, 45, 49, 52, 72, 4 with shoulder disability 16, 29, 45, 54, and 8 studies with symptoms using a composite pain and function score 26, 29, 32, 48, 49, 54, 56, 58.

RC tear was associated with pain in 4 ultrasound studies 16, 21, 32, 35, 3 MRI studies 16, 52, 62, and 1 bone scintigraphy study 72. These studies were unadjusted, and the majority were of low quality. Larger RC tear size (mean size 22.7 mm) was associated with pain in 1 low‐quality study 35. One study reported no association of RC tear size and symptoms, although in symptomatic tears > 175 mm², pain was correlated with tear size 30. Two high‐quality studies reported no association between RC tear size or location with pain, one of which was well‐adjusted 45, 48. The type of RC tear (partial or full) was not associated with severity of pain 32.

RC tear was associated with disability in 2 high‐quality MRI studies 16, 54. RC tear was not associated with functional disability in 1 high‐quality ultrasound study 16 and 2 high‐quality MRI studies, one of which was well‐adjusted 45, 49. One study reported an association of RC tears with disability on MRI but not on ultrasound 16. RC tear was associated with worse composite scores in 2 ultrasound studies 26, 32. There was no association between RC tears and composite scores in 2 ultrasound studies 29, 32 and 5 MRI studies 48, 49, 54, 56, 58. In summary, in 1 high‐quality, well‐adjusted study, RC tears were not associated with pain or function 45. The other studies were of mixed quality, unadjusted, and reported conflicting findings.

### New quantitative radiographic parameters for vertical and horizontal instability in acromioclavicular joint dislocations [^112wfTAA]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Sawbone modelling of ACJ dislocations

A Sawbone model of a scapula with clavicle (Pacific Research Laboratories, Inc. Vashon, WA, USA) was mounted on a specifically designed holding device (Fig. 1). This system allowed precise positioning of the clavicle relative to the acromion in order to simulate ACJ dislocations with both vertical and horizontal displacement. A radiopaque ball was fixed to the lateral border of the acromion along the line of the inferior border of the acromion and the lateral clavicle to allow calibration during radiographic analysis.

Fig. 1
Sawbone modelling. Specially designed holding device where a Sawbone Model was mounted. This model allows to simulate different ACJ dislocation as well as navigation in axial, sagittal and coronal direction according to measurement protocol

The Sawbone model was then setup to simulate ACJ dislocations as per the Rockwood classification system (Grades I to V) with the addition of horizontal posterior displacement for each injury type (Table 1). The degree of displacement simulated for each type of injury was based on the measurement of the height/width of the clavicle. This measurement was then utilized to simulate the appropriate vertical and horizontal instability for each injury type.

Table 1
Overview of the seven simulated ACJ dislocations

Rockwood classification (RW) with vertical displacement served as basis (first column) and was combined with the addition of horizontal displacement for each injury type. The degree of displacements are given in percentage based on the measurement of the height/width of the clavicle (= 100%)

Projectional variations

Projectional variation was simulated for every Rockwood grade of ACJ dislocation. Therefore, the Sawbone construct was tilted in the coronal (medial–lateral) and sagittal (anterior–posterior) planes, and rotated in the axial plane (anteversion-retroversion). The projectional variations for each injury type were simulated with 10° and 20° in any direction, resulting in one neutral position and twelve variations as follows:
Sagittal — Flexion and Extension — +20°/+ 10°/−10°/−20°
Coronal — Abduction and Adduction — +20°/+ 10°/−10°/−20°
Axial — Ante- and Retroversion — +20°/+ 10°/−10°/−20°
