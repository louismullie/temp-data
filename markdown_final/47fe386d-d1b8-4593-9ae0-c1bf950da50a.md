## Question

What can cause vaginal itching?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what can cause vaginal itching. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and scope so I'm precise about "vulvar" versus "vaginal" itch. Then, I should verify the most common etiologies and their relative frequencies. Next, I will differentiate infectious from noninfectious causes and consider age-specific patterns. After that, I should review the diagnostic pathway, including point-of-care tests versus NAAT and when to biopsy. Finally, I will synthesize management principles, highlight red flags, and note medication and systemic contributors, all while double-checking that each assertion is supported by appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm terminology so I don't misclassify the complaint. "Vulvar" refers to external genital skin, "vaginal" to the internal canal, and "vulvovaginal" encompasses both; clarifying location helps focus the differential and testing strategy, and the literature itself often uses these terms interchangeably, which I should keep in mind to avoid confusion during evidence synthesis [^111r2RiP] [^113dmELK]. I should also remember that low-estrogen states at the extremes of age alter mucosal physiology and can shift the differential toward atrophic and irritant processes, so age context matters here as well [^117GQ2Nc].

> I need to verify the epidemiology and leading causes. Across symptomatic presentations with discharge, odor, irritation, itching, or burning, the three most common diagnoses are bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis; when a cause is identified, BV accounts for about 40–50%, VVC for 20–25%, and trichomoniasis for 15–20%, with noninfectious etiologies comprising roughly 5–10% of cases, which is useful for pre-test probability framing but does not replace targeted testing [^112C9UWw].

> Now, infectious causes first, and I should confirm diagnostic standards before I assume anything. For BV, the diagnostic standard is Gram stain with Nugent scoring, though Amsel criteria are commonly used clinically and Hay-Ison criteria can be applied on microscopy; pathophysiology involves a dysbiotic shift toward anaerobes with elevated pH, and treatment is metronidazole or clindamycin delivered orally or intravaginally, with attention to recurrence strategies in persistent disease [^112C9UWw] [^1179gpny] [^112B4ctM]. Wait, let me verify safety nuances: intravaginal clindamycin can favor Candida overgrowth and patients should avoid latex products during use due to mineral oil in the cream, which affects barrier integrity, so counseling is essential [^117BE7Fv].

> For candidiasis, I should confirm that microscopy remains first-line where feasible and that culture is the gold standard in complicated or recurrent cases, and then align treatment accordingly. Office KOH microscopy or molecular assays can support diagnosis, but for recurrent or non-albicans infections culture and susceptibility are most informative; azoles remain first line for uncomplicated VVC, topical azoles are preferred in pregnancy, and diabetes, HIV, recent antibiotics, and hormonal factors increase risk of VVC and recurrence, which should be part of the history and anticipatory guidance [^114CjmaX] [^114nfuvL] [^117H1WNW]. I should double-check that patients with HIV follow the same treatment regimens but may have higher recurrence, which is consistent with guideline summaries [^114CjmaX].

> Next, I will examine trichomoniasis because it is often underdiagnosed without NAAT. NAAT is recommended for diagnosis; metronidazole or tinidazole are first-line therapies, with single-dose and multidose regimens available, and for persistent or recurrent disease, higher-dose or extended nitroimidazole courses are recommended, which I should remember when symptoms recur after initial therapy or with partner reinfection [^115eerEw] [^113GQ4Qd] [^116tzp9v]. I should confirm partner management and testing for other STIs as a routine part of care given co-infection risks, which is standard practice in STI management frameworks [^115eerEw].

> Hold on, let me not overlook other infectious contributors. Chlamydia and gonorrhea can present with irritation or pruritus, while HSV frequently produces prodromal itching before vesicular or ulcerative lesions, and HPV-related warts can itch, so visual inspection and appropriate NAAT or serologic testing when indicated remain important adjuncts to the workup [^116ziajn] [^1176vKHo]. I should also keep parasitic infestations like pubic lice and scabies on the list if there are excoriations without discharge, as well as pinworms in children with nocturnal vulvar itching, although pinworm data are mostly case based [^11696D5M].

> Let me consider noninfectious inflammatory dermatoses next, because mislabeling them as infection is a frequent pitfall. Contact dermatitis, lichen simplex chronicus, psoriasis, lichen sclerosus, and lichen planus are common vulvar inflammatory causes of itch; management includes irritant and allergen avoidance, strategies to break the itch–scratch cycle, and disease-specific anti-inflammatory therapy, with sedating antihistamines at night sometimes used to limit nocturnal scratching damage while definitive therapy takes effect [^112dGb9E] [^111q6mZd] [^116ZSMGL] [^1171QNKE] [^111fRFqg]. I should confirm that persistent or diagnostically uncertain lesions merit biopsy to exclude neoplasia or to define dermatoses histopathologically, which is consistent with gynecologic dermatology guidance [^117KBNLw].

> I need to check for estrogen-deficiency states, particularly postmenopause, because genitourinary syndrome of menopause is a leading cause of chronic vulvovaginal pruritus in that age group. GSM presents with dryness, irritation, itching, and dyspareunia in the setting of elevated pH and thin epithelium; randomized trials show that low-dose vaginal estradiol improves symptoms, pH, and cytology versus placebo, and guideline-based care also includes nonhormonal moisturizers and lubricants, with selection individualized to patient preferences and contraindications [^113DSerZ] [^114iyiBE] [^1151ggJF] [^1127VvTm]. Let me verify safety guidance and remind myself that local therapy is preferred over systemic for GSM symptom control when appropriate [^1127VvTm].

> Age-specific considerations matter. In prepubertal girls, low estrogen leads to a more alkaline environment, making irritant vulvitis and secondary infections more likely, and nocturnal vulvar pruritus should prompt consideration of enterobiasis with family treatment when confirmed, whereas in reproductive-age patients infectious vaginitis predominates, and in postmenopause GSM and neoplasia move higher on the list as background risk shifts [^117GQ2Nc] [^11696D5M] [^112C9UWw].

> But wait, what about medication-induced itch or treatment-emergent adverse effects that can cloud the clinical picture. Several FDA labels list genital or vaginal itching as possible adverse drug reactions, including ofloxacin and cefaclor, and intravaginal metronidazole can cause vaginal irritation or itching, so a careful medication timeline is essential; contraceptive vaginal rings can also cause local irritation or injury, which patients may report as itch or discomfort, and separating device-related irritation from infection is sometimes necessary [^112PQCTQ] [^117XnCn9] [^115j8jwT] [^111iSCTw] [^113sgUvL] [^112KjTNs]. Let me also remember that SGLT2 inhibitors raise genital mycotic infection risk via glycosuria, indirectly contributing to pruritus in susceptible patients, which I should screen for in the medication history, even though detailed mechanistic data here are from secondary reviews [^1129ihGQ] [^114CjmaX].

> I should confirm that neoplastic causes are rare but high stake. Squamous cell carcinoma and extramammary Paget disease can present with pruritus as an early symptom, and any persistent, ulcerated, or pigmented lesion requires biopsy rather than empiric therapy, given the diagnostic delay risk when skin cancers mimic inflammatory dermatoses or chronic infection [^116ow1Lc] [^117KBNLw].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and test performance so I don't over-rely on insensitive methods. Bedside microscopy supports BV and VVC diagnosis, but sensitivity is modest and can miss coinfections; NAAT is preferred for trichomonas and has higher sensitivity for several pathogens, pH testing informs BV or atrophy, culture helps in recurrent or complicated VVC, and patch testing can clarify allergic contact dermatitis in selected cases; speculum exam may be unnecessary for sample collection in many cases, but is useful to visualize lesions when suspected [^1179gpny] [^115eerEw] [^112C9UWw] [^113Qyic3] [^111T7j1U] [^113sRn5n]. Hold on, I should verify that when lesions persist or diagnosis remains unclear after initial management, biopsy is indicated, which aligns with gynecologic practice guidance [^117KBNLw].

> The documents emphasize emphasize emphasize how critical it is to distinguish infectious from noninfectious etiologies and to use appropriate diagnostics rather than empiric treatment alone. Wait, I should correct that repetition: the documents emphasize accurate phenotyping and targeted testing, with BV, VVC, and trichomoniasis dominating the infectious category, and dermatoses and GSM leading the noninfectious category, which should guide both testing and initial management choices [^112C9UWw] [^114CjmaX] [^115eerEw].

> I will now examine red flags and referral triggers so I don't miss time-sensitive conditions. Ulcerated, eroded, indurated, or pigmented lesions, refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed therapy, severe pain with neuropathic features, and postmenopausal bleeding warrant gynecology or dermatology referral and usually biopsy, and visible lesions in the vagina or cervix merit speculum-based assessment when feasible [^111T7j1U] [^116ow1Lc] [^117KBNLw].

> Let me synthesize management principles by etiology and double-check each point. Treat BV with oral or intravaginal metronidazole or intravaginal clindamycin, address recurrence with evidence-based suppressive options when needed, and counsel on potential Candida overgrowth with clindamycin; treat uncomplicated VVC with topical azoles or oral fluconazole, reserving topical azoles in pregnancy and culture-guided regimens for recurrent or non-albicans disease; treat trichomoniasis with nitroimidazoles and escalate dosing for persistence, coupled with partner management; for contact dermatitis and LSC, eliminate irritants, provide education to stop the itch–scratch cycle, and consider sedating antihistamines at night as adjuncts; for GSM, prioritize local vaginal estrogen or nonhormonal moisturizers to restore mucosal health and relieve itch, individualized to risk profile and preferences [^112C9UWw] [^113GQ4Qd] [^112B4ctM] [^117BE7Fv] [^114CjmaX] [^116ZSMGL] [^111q6mZd] [^112dGb9E] [^113DSerZ] [^1151ggJF]. I should confirm supportive care as well, such as avoiding fragranced products and wet wipes, wearing breathable fabrics, and using bland emollients externally for barrier support in dermatoses, which is consistent with EADV guidance [^112dGb9E].

> Finally, I need to ensure my key takeaways are concise and accurate. Most symptomatic vulvovaginal itching is due to BV, VVC, or trichomoniasis, but inflammatory dermatoses and GSM are common noninfectious causes, particularly at age extremes; bedside microscopy helps but NAAT substantially improves sensitivity for several pathogens; medication histories and systemic risks such as diabetes and HIV inform both predisposition and treatment response; and persistent, atypical, or lesion-associated pruritus requires biopsy rather than repeated empiricism so that neoplastic and inflammatory mimics are not missed [^112C9UWw] [^113Qyic3] [^114CjmaX] [^1127VvTm] [^116ow1Lc]. Hold on, before I conclude, I should double-check that each section ties back to the initial plan: definitions and scope, leading causes with frequencies, infectious versus noninfectious and age-specific nuances, diagnostic pathway with test performance and when to biopsy, and targeted management with red flags, all supported by the cited sources, which it does.

Vaginal itchiness is most often due to **infectious causes** such as vulvovaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and trichomoniasis [^112C9UWw], but it can also result from **dermatologic conditions** (lichen sclerosus, lichen planus, contact dermatitis) [^114EfZw4], hormonal changes (menopause, pregnancy) [^1127VvTm], systemic diseases (diabetes, Sjögren's) [^1151ggJF], neuropathic or psychogenic factors [^114HHsKQ], and medications or irritants [^116qJ3td] [^117XnCn9] [^112PQCTQ]. Evaluation should include a focused history, physical exam, and **targeted testing** (wet mount, pH, NAATs) [^112C9UWw] [^115eerEw] [^114nfuvL], with management tailored to the cause and potentially including antifungals, antibiotics, topical steroids, estrogen therapy, or avoidance of irritants [^114iyiBE] [^112dGb9E].

---

## Infectious causes

Infections are the **most common cause** of vaginal itchiness and include [^112C9UWw] [^112rrSZy] [^1133uHFx]:

- **Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC)**: Caused by Candida species, typically C. albicans; presents with itching, discharge, and irritation; risk factors include antibiotics, diabetes, pregnancy, and immunosuppression [^114CjmaX] [^117H1WNW].

- **Bacterial vaginosis (BV)**: An imbalance of vaginal microbiota with elevated pH and anaerobic overgrowth; often with discharge and odor, but can cause itching [^114wuNHM] [^1179gpny].

- **Trichomoniasis**: A sexually transmitted protozoan infection causing itching, discharge, and irritation [^111FME8R].

- **Other infections**: Chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes simplex virus, and HPV can also cause itching [^116ziajn] [^1176vKHo].

---

## Dermatologic conditions

Several **dermatologic conditions** can cause vaginal itchiness, such as [^114EfZw4]:

- **Lichen sclerosus**: Chronic inflammatory condition with hypopigmented, pruritic lesions, often in postmenopausal women [^114EfZw4].

- **Lichen planus**: Chronic inflammatory disorder causing itching, scarring, and atrophy of vulvar skin [^111fRFqg].

- **Contact dermatitis**: Allergic or irritant reactions to products such as soaps, detergents, or feminine hygiene products [^116qJ3td] [^112dGb9E].

- **Psoriasis**: Immune-mediated inflammation causing scaling, redness, and itching [^117KBNLw].

---

## Hormonal changes

Hormonal fluctuations significantly affect vaginal health and can cause **itching**. In **menopause**, estrogen decline leads to vaginal atrophy, dryness, and itching [^1127VvTm] [^113DSerZ]. Pregnancy-related hormonal changes increase susceptibility to infections and itching; menstrual cycle fluctuations may cause transient itching [^117H1WNW].

---

## Systemic diseases

Systemic conditions can contribute to vaginal itchiness, including **diabetes mellitus**, in which hyperglycemia predisposes to infections and neuropathic itch [^117H1WNW] [^114HHsKQ], and **Sjögren's syndrome**, which causes dryness and itching [^1151ggJF]. Liver and kidney diseases can also produce pruritus due to systemic accumulation of pruritogens [^114HHsKQ].

---

## Neuropathic and psychogenic factors

Neuropathic and psychogenic factors can cause or exacerbate vaginal itchiness. **Neuropathic itch** results from nerve damage or dysfunction causing abnormal sensory experiences [^114HHsKQ], while **psychogenic itch** stems from psychological conditions such as anxiety or depression, which contribute to chronic pruritus.

---

## Medications and irritants

Certain medications and irritants can cause vaginal itchiness, including **antibiotics** that disrupt normal vaginal flora and lead to fungal overgrowth [^112PQCTQ] [^117XnCn9] [^117BE7Fv]. Hormonal contraceptives may alter hormone levels, leading to dryness and itching, and topical medications can provoke irritation or allergic reactions, causing itching [^116qJ3td].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A comprehensive diagnostic approach includes a detailed history, physical exam, and assessment of lesions or discharge [^111T7j1U], along with wet mount microscopy, pH testing, NAATs, and cultures [^112C9UWw] [^115eerEw] [^114nfuvL]. **Biopsy** is indicated for persistent or unclear lesions [^114EfZw4].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Infectious causes**: Antifungals for VVC, antibiotics for BV, and nitroimidazoles for trichomoniasis [^112C9UWw] [^113GQ4Qd] [^114CjmaX].

- **Dermatologic conditions**: Topical corticosteroids, emollients, and avoidance of irritants [^114EfZw4] [^117KBNLw] [^112dGb9E].

- **Hormonal changes**: Local estrogen therapy or non-hormonal moisturizers [^114iyiBE] [^1151ggJF] [^113DSerZ].

- **Neuropathic and psychogenic itch**: Neuromodulators, psychological interventions, and lifestyle modifications [^117TM4SQ] [^116sZjdP].

---

Vaginal itchiness has **diverse causes** — including infections, dermatologic conditions, hormonal changes, systemic diseases, neuropathic and psychogenic factors, and medications or irritants. Effective management requires a comprehensive diagnostic approach and targeted treatment [^112rrSZy].

### Vaginitis: diagnosis and treatment [^112C9UWw]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Vaginitis is defined as any condition presenting with symptoms of abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, irritation, itching, or burning. The most common causes of vaginitis are bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. Bacterial vaginosis is implicated in 40% to 50% of cases when a cause is identified, with vulvovaginal candidiasis accounting for 20% to 25% and trichomoniasis for 15% to 20% of cases. Noninfectious causes, including atrophic, irritant, allergic, and inflammatory vaginitis, are less common and account for 5% to 10% of vaginitis cases.

Diagnosis is made using a combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, and office-based or laboratory testing. Bacterial vaginosis is traditionally diagnosed with Amsel criteria, although Gram stain is the diagnostic standard. Newer laboratory tests that detect Gardnerella vaginalis DNA or vaginal fluid sialidase activity have similar sensitivity and specificity to Gram stain.

Bacterial vaginosis is treated with oral metronidazole, intravaginal metronidazole, or intravaginal clindamycin. The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis is made using a combination of clinical signs and symptoms with potassium hydroxide microscopy; DNA probe testing is also available. Culture can be helpful for the diagnosis of complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis by identifying nonalbicans strains of Candida. Treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis involves oral fluconazole or topical azoles, although only topical azoles are recommended during pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends nucleic acid amplification.

### Ofloxacin [^112PQCTQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The most common side effects of ofloxacin tablets include sleep problems, headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, itching, external genital itching in women, vaginal inflammation (vaginitis), and taste changes.

Ofloxacin tablets may cause false-positive urine screening results for opiates when testing is done with some commercially available kits. A positive result should be confirmed using a more specific test.

These are not all the possible side effects of ofloxacin tablets. Inform your healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. For medical advice about side effects, call your doctor. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1–800-FDA-1088.

- **How should I store ofloxacin tablets**: Store ofloxacin tablets at 20° to 25° C (68°F to 77°F). Keep the bottle that ofloxacin tablets come in closed tightly. Keep ofloxacin tablets, and all medicines, out of the reach of children.

- **General information about ofloxacin tablets**: Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a Medication Guide. Do not use ofloxacin tablets for a condition for which it is not prescribed. Do not give ofloxacin tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms. It may harm them.

### Efficacy of vaginal estradiol or vaginal moisturizer vs placebo for treating postmenopausal vulvovaginal symptoms: A randomized clinical trial [^114iyiBE]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Nearly half of postmenopausal women report bothersome vulvovaginal symptoms, yet there is limited data supporting the efficacy of commonly recommended treatments. This trial aimed to compare the efficacy of a low-dose vaginal estradiol tablet and a vaginal moisturizer, each compared with a placebo, in treating moderate-to-severe postmenopausal vulvovaginal symptoms.

This study was a 12-week multicenter randomized clinical trial that enrolled postmenopausal women experiencing moderate to severe symptoms such as vulvovaginal itching, pain, dryness, irritation, or pain with penetration.

- **Interventions**: Participants were allocated to one of the following interventions: a vaginal 10-μg estradiol tablet (daily for the first two weeks, followed by twice weekly) combined with a placebo gel (applied three times a week) for 102 women; a placebo tablet combined with a vaginal moisturizer for 100 women; or a dual placebo for 100 women.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome measured was the decrease in severity (on a scale of 0–3) of the most bothersome symptom (MBS) between enrollment and week 12. Additional measures included a composite vaginal symptom score, the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score ranging from 2–36, the modified Female Sexual Distress Score-Revised item 1, treatment satisfaction and meaningful benefit, the Vaginal Maturation Index, and vaginal pH levels.

- **Results**: The trial enrolled 302 women with a mean (standard deviation) age of 61 (4) years. The majority were white (267 [88%]), college educated (200 [66%]), and sexually active (245 [81%]). Data for the primary analysis was provided by 294 women (97%). Pain with vaginal penetration was identified as the most bothersome symptom (182 [60%]), followed by vulvovaginal dryness (63 [21%]). The mean baseline MBS severity was similar across the treatment groups.

### Scratching the surface: A comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^1133uHFx]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Infectious causes**: Vulvovaginal itching of acute onset is frequently attributed to infection with fungal, bacterial, or parasitic species. Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) results from an overgrowth of Candida species, predominantly Candida albicans, due to disruptions in the normal vaginal flora. The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines stimulates nerve endings in the vaginal area, resulting in pruritus, edema, and erythema of the region. VVC is not typically acquired through contagion but rather from alterations in the environment that are favorable for fungal species, such as the obliteration of healthy vaginal microbiome defenses, moisture trapping in the inguinal region, elevated skin surface pH, and states with lower immunological defenses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or higher glucose availability seen in pregnancy and diabetes.

	- Yosipovitch et al. found that the skin surface pH in intertriginous areas, such as the inguinal region, is significantly higher in diabetic patients compared with healthy individuals, which may promote susceptibility to candidal infections. This elevated pH can create an environment conducive to Candida overgrowth and infection. Tinea cruris affects the inguinal creases and labia majora, presenting with a visible rash, unlike the discharge characteristic of candidiasis.

- **Bacterial vaginosis (BV)**: An imbalance in the vaginal microbiota results in elevated pH that is more favorable for pathogenic anaerobic bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis, than protective bacteria, such as Lactobacilli.

### Acog practice bulletin. Clinical management guidelines for obstetrician-gynecologists, number 72, May 2006: Vaginitis [^116Ph5fQ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Vaginal symptoms are common in the general population and are among the most frequent reasons for patient visits to obstetrician-gynecologists. Vaginitis may have significant consequences in terms of discomfort and pain, days lost from school or work, and impacts on sexual functioning and self-image. It is associated with sexually transmitted diseases and other infections of the female genital tract, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as well as adverse reproductive outcomes in pregnant and non-pregnant women. Treatment is usually directed at the specific cause of vaginal symptoms, which most commonly include bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. The purpose of this document is to provide information about the diagnosis and treatment of vaginitis.

### Scratching the surface: A comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^1172sndJ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Hormonal fluctuations throughout a woman's life significantly impact the occurrence of vaginal itching. Estrogen is particularly important in developing and maintaining the thickness and functionality of the vulvar epithelium, vaginal pH, and the composition of the microflora. During childhood, the vulvar and vaginal pH are neutral or alkaline due to the lack of acid-producing Lactobacilli. At higher pH levels, the activity of proteases such as KLKs and mast cell tryptase may increase, leading to greater activation of itch receptors on nerve cells, keratinocytes, or endothelial cells.

In prepubertal girls, conditions linked to abnormal expression of proteases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis, are prevalent. When estrogen levels rise with the onset of puberty, glycogen increases in the vulvar epithelium, promoting the growth of Lactobacilli and lowering the pH. During reproductive age, VVC, allergic and irritant contact dermatitis, LS, and LSC are commonly diagnosed. LS affecting the genital skin is most often seen in postmenopausal women and is thought to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors.

During pregnancy, an increase in sex hormone production affects the production of IgE, mediator release, and mast cells, which can also lead to increased itching. During and after menopause, the decline in estrogen leads to a higher pH, thinning of the vaginal epithelium, reduced lubrication, and increased susceptibility to irritation due to tissue atrophy and loss of the integrity of the skin barrier. This process can result in genitourinary syndrome.

### Pruritic vulvovaginitis in a young girl: A case of vulvovaginal enterobiasis [^11696D5M]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Vulvovaginal enterobiasis is underreported and often a missed diagnosis in prepubertal girls presenting with isolated nocturnal vulvar pruritus. An 8-year-old girl with intense nocturnal vulvar itching for four months was diagnosed with enterobiasis after microscopy of a vaginal swab revealed Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm) ova. The child and her family were treated with two doses of oral albendazole, two weeks apart, resulting in symptom resolution. This case highlights the importance of considering enterobiasis as a differential diagnosis for nocturnal vulvar pruritus to prevent delayed treatment.

### Psychological treatment for vaginal pain: Does etiology matter? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113kZ7iY]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The classification of vaginal pain within medical or psychiatric diagnostic systems primarily relies on the presumed presence or absence of an underlying medical etiology. Focusing on the experience of pain itself, rather than the etiology, emphasizes commonalities in treatment aims to improve pain and the sexual, emotional, and cognitive experience. Thus, exploring how vaginal pain conditions with varying etiologies respond to psychological treatment may reveal the extent to which they are similar or distinct.

- **Aim**: To examine the combined and relative efficacy of psychological treatments for vaginal pain conditions.

- **Methods**: A systematic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL was conducted. Eleven randomized controlled trials were included in a meta-analysis, and standardized mean differences and odds ratios were calculated. Additionally, effect sizes for individual psychological trial arms were calculated.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcome measures were pain and sexual function.

- **Results**: Psychological and medical treatments demonstrated equivalent effects. Effect sizes for psychological treatment arms were comparable across various vaginal pain conditions.

- **Conclusions**: The effectiveness was equivalent regardless of presumed medical or psychiatric etiology, suggesting that presumed etiology may not be useful in selecting treatment. Research recommendations and clinical implications are discussed.

- **Treatments for vulvovaginal itch**: The management of vulvovaginal pruritic diseases involves a range of treatments. Dosing, duration, and the route of administration are highly dependent on several factors, including disease severity, patient tolerance, and response to treatment.

It is important to note that psychotropic medications, such as selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), may play a role in managing symptoms associated with vulvovaginal itching.

### Scratching the surface: A comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^112GFNNd]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Vulvovaginal itching is a common yet often under-recognized condition affecting women across all age groups. Despite its prevalence, many dermatologists receive minimal training in vulvar diseases, leading to delayed diagnoses and prolonged discomfort for patients. This review explores the broad spectrum of causes, including infections, inflammatory conditions, neuropathic disorders, and systemic illnesses. The complexity of vulvovaginal pruritus often requires a multidisciplinary approach to accurately diagnose and treat.

Contributing factors such as hormonal changes, personal hygiene practices, and environmental exposures must also be considered. Treatment strategies typically begin with lifestyle modifications and topical therapies, such as corticosteroids and antifungals, but can extend to systemic medications and biologics for resistant cases. Additionally, nonpharmaceutical options such as sitz baths and psychological interventions can be crucial for managing chronic symptoms.

However, there remains a significant gap in research, particularly regarding the characterization of female-specific pruritus and its long-term impact on quality of life. Despite some advances, the available studies largely focus on isolated causes rather than the holistic nature of the condition. Further research is urgently needed to develop comprehensive, evidence-based guidelines for diagnosing and treating vulvovaginal itching, a condition that has a profound effect on both physical and emotional well-being.

The complexity of vulvovaginal pruritus often requires a multidisciplinary approach to accurately diagnose and treat. Contributing factors such as hormonal changes, personal hygiene practices, and environmental exposures must also be considered.

Treatment strategies typically begin with lifestyle modifications and topical therapies, such as corticosteroids and antifungals, but can extend to systemic medications and biologics for resistant cases. Additionally, nonpharmaceutical options such as sitz baths and psychological interventions can be crucial for managing chronic symptoms. However, there remains a significant gap in research, particularly regarding the characterization of female-specific pruritus and its long-term impact on quality of life. Despite some advances, the available studies largely focus on isolated causes rather than the holistic nature of the condition. Further research is urgently needed to develop comprehensive, evidence-based guidelines for diagnosing and treating vulvovaginal itching, a condition that has a profound effect on both physical and emotional well-being.

### Diagnosis and management of vulvar skin disorders: ACOG Practice Bulletin, Number 224 [^114EfZw4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Vulvar skin disorders include a variety of inflammatory conditions of the vulva that may also affect the extragenital area. Pruritus and pain are two of the most common presenting symptoms in vulvar clinics. Vulvovaginal symptoms are often chronic and can adversely affect sexual function and sense of well-being. This Practice Bulletin provides updated diagnostic and management recommendations for the most common vulvar skin conditions associated with inflammation, including contact dermatitis, lichen simplex chronicus, lichen sclerosus, and lichen planus. Other vulvovaginal disorders, such as vaginitis, vulvar low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (previously termed vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia), genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy), and vulvar pain (vulvodynia), are addressed in other documents from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

### A randomized, multicenter, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of estradiol vaginal cream 0.003% in postmenopausal women with dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom [^113DSerZ]. Menopause (2018). High credibility.

Vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) is characterized by vaginal changes, dyspareunia, and itching/irritation. The efficacy and safety of a lower-dose estradiol vaginal cream (0.003%) were evaluated in postmenopausal women with VVA-related dyspareunia.

This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involved sexually active postmenopausal women with moderate-severe dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom, ≤ 5% vaginal superficial cells, and vaginal pH > 5.0. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive either 0.003% estradiol vaginal cream (15 μg estradiol; 0.5 g cream) or placebo (0.5 g cream). The cream was applied daily for 2 weeks, followed by three applications per week for 10 weeks. Co-primary outcomes included changes in dyspareunia severity, vaginal cytology, and vaginal pH from baseline to the final assessment, with additional efficacy outcomes and safety also assessed.

A total of 550 participants, with an average age of 58 years, were randomized. Compared with placebo, the estradiol group showed reduced dyspareunia severity (mean change from baseline ± SD: -1.5 ± 1.0 for estradiol vs -1.2 ± 0.9 for placebo), decreased vaginal pH (-1.36 ± 0.89 vs -0.53 ± 0.92), and improved vaginal cytology (percentage of superficial and parabasal cells: 10.1 ± 16.7 vs 1.4 ± 6.1 and -48.5 ± 45.1 vs -14.6 ± 39.6; P < 0.001, all) at the final assessment. Additionally, estradiol reduced dyspareunia severity at weeks 8 and 12, vaginal/vulvar irritation and itching at weeks 4 and 12, and dryness at week 12 compared to placebo (P < 0.01, all). The severity of VVA, pH, and cytology significantly improved at week 12 with estradiol compared to placebo (P < 0.001, all). However, vulvovaginal mycotic infections were more frequent with estradiol.

### Botryomycosis of the vulva: A case report [^111rmVg4]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Vulvar ulcers may be caused by various etiologies including infection, trauma, dermatosis, and cancer. We report a case of a vulvar ulcer caused by botryomycosis.

- **Case details**: An 85-year-old woman presented with vulvar itching, pain, bleeding, and ulcerations suspicious for cancer. Biopsies of the ulcers returned without dysplasia or malignancy. She was referred to the tertiary care vulvar vaginal disease clinic. Dermatopathologic reevaluation of pathologic slides diagnosed lichen sclerosus and botryomycosis. The patient was treated with ciprofloxacin for 7 weeks with complete resolution of vulvar ulcerations.

- **Conclusion**: Botryomycosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of infectious etiology of vulvar ulcers.

### Scratching the surface: A comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^1129ihGQ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Systemic conditions may present with or contribute to vulvovaginal itching. This kind of itch is referred to as neurogenic, not to be mistaken with the term neuropathic. While neuropathic itch is due to nerve dysfunction or damage, neurogenic itch is caused by circulating molecular irritants, called pruritogens, which bind to unmyelinated C-fibers and trigger the central nervous system's itch response. Both forms of itch have a different mechanism than inflammatory or infectious itch because they are not modulated by histamine but rather by the nervous system. Golpanian et al. points toward the pathophysiology of genital itch involving transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, such as TRPA1 and TRPV1, which play a crucial role in the transmission of itch signals in the genital region, contributing to chronic itch conditions.

Systemic causes often involve mixed mechanisms, with predisposition to infection, associated dermatoses, molecular irritants, and the stressors associated with illness creating a recipe for chronic itch. Diabetic patients serve as an example of a population with predisposition to multiple itch etiologies. High blood sugar levels in patients can alter the vaginal environment to increase the susceptibility to infections such as vulvovaginal candidiasis. Additionally, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a common medication for type 2 diabetes mellitus, which increases the glucose concentrations in the urine, causing predisposition to fungal growth. Finally, poorly controlled diabetes can also result in vulvar itch.

### Level of use and safety of botanical products for itching vulvar dermatoses. Are patch tests useful [^113sRn5n]? Contact Dermatitis (2016). Low credibility.

Topical remedies based on botanical ingredients are popular among those with itching vulvar dermatoses. This study assessed the usage of botanical substances in subjects affected with such complaints, the incidence of side effects, and the diagnostic usefulness of patch testing.

Sixty-six patients completed a questionnaire to evaluate the prevalence and type of topical botanical preparations used, as well as the occurrence of adverse reactions. Patients underwent patch testing with the Italian baseline series, a topical medicament series, and a botanical series.

Results showed that 42 patients (63.6%) reported using natural topical products on the vulva. Seven patients (16.7%) noted adverse reactions; 27 showed positive reactions with the baseline series; 14 (21.2%) had at least one relevant reaction, mainly to allergens in topical products and cosmetics; and 2 (3%) showed positive reactions to the botanical series. Of the 7 patients reporting adverse effects from botanical products, 3 (42.8%) showed relevant sensitization.

The study concludes that the use of natural topical products is widespread among women with itching vulvar diseases, and contact dermatitis is a possible adverse effect. The usefulness of the botanical series is questionable due to the wide variety of botanical ingredients.

### Scratching the surface: A comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^117KoDJx]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

The accurate diagnosis and effective management of vulvovaginal itching are crucial for improving patient outcomes. Many patients seek care from dermatologists, gynecologists, and other primary care providers when these symptoms begin. Given the wide range of potential causes, a thorough diagnostic approach is essential. Misdiagnosis or delayed treatment can exacerbate symptoms and significantly impact a patient's quality of life.

The management of vulvovaginal pruritus requires a comprehensive approach that considers both the physical and psychological burdens of the condition. Women with chronic pruritus often experience distress, embarrassment, and negative impacts on sexual health, necessitating a patient-centered strategy that integrates dermatologic and gynecologic care with psychological support when needed. Future research should further explore gender-specific management strategies to optimize treatment outcomes and improve the quality of life for affected individuals.

Tailoring management plans to the specific causes and patient needs, while considering multimodal treatment approaches, can lead to more successful long-term outcomes. Educating patients about their condition and involving them in the management process is also vital to prevent recurrence and ensure adherence to treatment plans. Despite these advancements, much research remains to be done on the specific characteristics of vulvovaginal itching and how it affects quality of life across different patient populations, highlighting the need for ongoing studies to better understand and address the condition.

### Scratching the surface: A comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^111T7j1U]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025).

A physical examination should include an inspection of the vulvovaginal area to identify any visible signs such as lesions, excoriations, skin or tissue changes, or abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, or consistency. Identified lesions should be well examined, and the patient should be asked whether they are the perceived source of itch, are painful, or are tender to touch.

If vaginal itching is present, a wet mount preparation with microscopy of vaginal discharge, STI testing, and pH testing are often the first line, with DNA probe testing having higher accuracy. A speculum exam may not be needed, as specimens may be collected using a swab that can be inserted into the vagina without a speculum. However, a speculum exam is helpful with visualizing vaginal lesions, such as herpetic lesions or condylomas in the vaginal canal or with cervical visualization. If a provider is unable to perform a speculum exam or if there are upper vaginal or cervical symptoms or lesions that cannot be assessed, a referral to gynecology may be necessary.

Additionally, concerning symptoms such as ulcerated, eroded, or discolored vulvar lesions, pelvic pain, sexual dysfunction, or abnormal vaginal bleeding may also warrant a referral. Vulvoscopy is used for magnified visualization of external vulvar lesions. For uncertain or persistent lesions that do not respond to treatment, punch biopsy may be necessary, and microbiological tests may help confirm diagnoses in cases of refractory infections. The goal is to create diagnostic algorithms based on symptoms, signs, and morphological features.

### Scratching the surface: A comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^112utiWA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

The exact prevalence of vulvovaginal pruritus is difficult to determine due to the broad range of conditions that can cause it, but it is a common condition affecting most women at some point in their lives. Vulvar pruritus may affect women of all ages, and there is a notable correlation between age and the prevalence of many specific causal conditions. For instance, in one study, vulvovaginitis was reported in 61.8% of gynecological issues in childhood and adolescence, with a high frequency of dermatitis in prepubertal populations. Infectious causes such as vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and trichomoniasis affect adolescent and adult women more frequently than children.

Age-related hormonal changes affect the vulvar anatomy, resulting in unique risk factors for vulvar pruritus across different age groups. For children aged 2–7 years, vaginal discomfort and pruritus may stem from early physiological and floral changes. Prepubertal girls are susceptible to conditions such as atopic and irritant dermatitis due to a lack of estrogenization of the vagina. Additionally, the proximity of the anus to the vagina and poor hygiene increase the risk of inoculation with digestive bacteria and vaginal dysbiosis. The absence of labial fat pads and pubic hair as protective barriers constitutes risk factors for dermatoses and pruritus-inducing infections in this age group. In contrast, estrogen loss occurring in the postpartum or postmenopausal state, or from medications, results in thinning of the vaginal epithelium and reduced elasticity, thus increasing vulnerability to irritation and infection.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^113Qyic3]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Vaginitis is clinically diagnosed by complaints of itching, burning, and odor accompanied by vaginal discharge. However, providing effective treatment is challenging because of limitations in accurately diagnosing the cause of vaginitis at the time of a woman's visit. Conventional microscopy (Gram stain and wet mount), which is typically available in emergency departments (EDs), is not only time-consuming but also markedly insensitive for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis (BV), trichomoniasis (TV), and Candida, particularly with coinfections.

For example, one study of 1,740 women with vaginitis (BV, 783; Candida, 523; TV, 122; and mixed BV/Candida, 185) compared standard microscopy to nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT; using reference standards of culture for TV and Candida and Nugent criteria for BV). The study reported that the sensitivities for microscopy to detect BV, TV, and Candida were 76.8%, 68.6%, and 56.9%, respectively. For NAAT, the sensitivities were significantly higher at 92.8%, 96.5%, and 90.2%, respectively. Specificities for both microscopy and NAAT were generally greater than 90%. For detecting coinfections using microscopy, sensitivities dropped dramatically to 10%–20%. Considering both single and multiple infections, using microscopy misses as many as one-quarter to one-half of infections overall. The CDC's STI guidelines currently acknowledge microscopy's very poor sensitivity, recommending NAAT for TV and Candida culture testing (or empirical treatment for Candida) if microscopy is negative.

### Risk factors of HIV vertical transmission in a cohort of women under a PMTCT program at three peri-urban clinics in a resource-poor setting [^114LkG7s]. Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

There were significant differences between the HIV vertical transmitters and the non-transmitters in the presence of abnormal vaginal discharge, genital itchiness, genital ulcers, and dysuria. However, physical examination confirmation of genital ulcer disease was not statistically different. When considering the types of abnormal vaginal discharge individually — yellow, gray, and curd-like — there were no statistical differences between the two groups. The confirmed presence of vaginal infections, namely, T. vaginalis, B. vaginosis, and C. albicans in the mother at enrollment, was associated with HIV vertical transmission and remained a risk after multivariate analysis of all maternal factors, with a risk ratio of 1.72 (1.03 to 2.88).

When infant characteristics were examined by HIV status, low birth weight infants and those who subsequently died during follow-up were more likely to be HIV infected. Breastfeeding was not a statistically significant risk factor for being HIV infected. The median duration of exclusive breastfeeding was low in these two groups and was not significantly different between the transmitters (3 months, interquartile range 2 to 6) and non-transmitters (4 months, interquartile range 2 to 6). Forty percent of mother-infant pairs who did not receive nevirapine transmitted HIV compared with 30% of those who received nevirapine. Potential confounding was controlled for using a multivariate analysis of risk factors for HIV vertical transmission.

### Scratching the surface: A comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^114cG7ZM]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Neuropathic itch is thought to occur through disruption in normal nerve signaling, which leads to abnormal pain and itch signals being transmitted to the brain. Neuropathic causes of vaginal itching are linked to damage or dysfunction of nerve fibers in the vulvar region, leading to abnormal sensory experiences. The nerve damage results in decreased desensitizing neurotransmitter activity on the skin and hypersensitization of neurons in the central nervous system, resulting in an excessive or inappropriate sensation of itch, burning, paresthesia, or other uncomfortable sensations on non-diseased skin. This can be intense and difficult to treat, causing high morbidity. The damage may occur from various neuronal points, and neuropathology is often defined by the location of dysfunction. Examples include small fiber polyneuropathy (SFPN), myelopathy, and central nervous system (CNS) lesions. Vaginal and vulvar itch could be present in cases of spinal injuries, lumbosacral spinal stenosis, or lumbosacral arthritis involving nerve or nerve root compression at the L4–S2 vertebrae, as well as those with reactivation of varicella zoster, suggesting the role of dermatomal innervation in causing pruritus of the vulvar area.

Sensitive skin in the genital area may contribute to the itch by exacerbating abnormal sensory responses in the vulvovaginal region. The genital skin has a thinner stratum corneum, increased hydration, and a semi-occlusive environment, making it more permeable and vulnerable to irritation and hypersensitivity.

### Vulvodynia: Diagnosis and management [^117TM4SQ]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of vulvodynia is made by taking a careful history, ruling out infectious or dermatologic abnormalities, and eliciting pain in response to light pressure on the labia, introitus, or hymenal remnants. Several treatment options have been used, although the evidence for many of these treatments is incomplete. Treatments include oral medications that decrease nerve hypersensitivity (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, anticonvulsants), pelvic floor biofeedback, cognitive behavioral therapy, local treatments, and (rarely) surgery. Most women experience substantial improvement when one or more treatments are used.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vulvar dermatoses [^117KBNLw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Vulvar symptoms such as pain, dyspareunia, and pruritus are common and may significantly affect a woman's well-being and sexual function. Despite this, these symptoms are often underreported by women. When identified, vulvovaginal symptoms should be addressed by healthcare providers to optimize care. The evaluation of patients with vulvovaginal complaints begins with a thorough history and physical examination. A biopsy is indicated when there is concern for malignancy or the diagnosis is uncertain.

Treatment, if possible, should be evidence-based. However, for many vulvar disorders, including vulvar dermatoses, treatment is based on limited evidence and anecdotal experience. Although many vulvar dermatoses represent chronic conditions and thus cannot be simply cured, control is possible for the majority of women. Patient education regarding vulvar hygiene and skin care is the foundation for optimal management of inflammatory vulvar dermatoses. These conditions may be triggered or worsened by aggressive hygiene. Additionally, patients should be counseled regarding the need for individually tailored long-term maintenance to achieve optimal outcomes.

### Scratching the surface: A comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^116ow1Lc]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Neoplastic causes**: Vulvar malignancies are uncommon, accounting for about 2–5% of all gynecologic cancers, and primarily include squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), melanoma, and extramammary Paget's disease. Vulvar pruritus is rarely caused by neoplasms, but it is not an uncommon manifestation of these conditions. Up to 50–60% of patients with vulvar malignancy report moderate-to-severe itching as the first symptom. Interestingly, one study even found a correlation between itch severity and the subsequently determined cancer stage. Benign neoplastic conditions such as syringomas and hidradenoma papilliferum can also present as pruritic nodules on the vulva and cause itching.

The pathophysiology of itch in vulvar neoplasms is often mixed, but severe itch is usually associated with eosinophilic and inflammatory mediator infiltration, which takes place in the invaded, superficial layers of the neoplastic and surrounding skin. The itch sometimes even precedes the appearance of the neoplastic lesion as the skin reacts to the changes beginning to occur. While malignant neoplasms may invade the neural tissues in the affected and nearby skin, this process is usually associated with pain rather than itch. Of note, vulvar melanoma lesions were rarely associated with itching in one study and mostly devoid of inflammatory cells on histological examination. Meanwhile, SCC was associated with both inflammatory cells on histology and itch. Another study looked at symptomatology of extramammary Paget's disease of the vulva and found itching in 95% of patients.

### Vaginitis in nonpregnant patients: ACOG practice bulletin summary, number 215 [^112rrSZy]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Vaginitis is defined as inflammation or infection of the vagina and is associated with a spectrum of symptoms, including vulvovaginal itching, burning, irritation, dyspareunia, "fishy" vaginal odor, and abnormal vaginal discharge. Vaginal symptoms are some of the most frequent reasons for patient visits to obstetrician-gynecologists and may have important consequences in terms of discomfort and pain, days lost from school or work, sexual functioning, and self-image.

Distinguishing vaginal from vulvar symptoms is important to direct evaluation and treatment. The purpose of this document is to provide updated evidence-based guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of the common causes of vaginitis in nonpregnant patients. Information on the treatment of vaginitis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is covered elsewhere.

Guidelines are subject to change. For the most up-to-date information on vaginitis diagnosis and treatment, see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Diseases webpage, which is available at https://www.cdc.gov/std/.

### Scratching the surface: A comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^116ymn36]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Atrophic dermatitis should be high on the differential for postmenopausal women with acute or chronic itch or women taking medications that modulate or suppress estrogen. Timing of itch onset in relation to hormonal medications should be considered. Another important differential to consider is genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), a chronic, progressive condition caused by estrogen deficiency, which affects the vulvovaginal and lower urinary tract. GSM commonly presents with symptoms such as vulvovaginal dryness, burning, irritation, and pruritus, making it a potential cause of unexplained itching in postmenopausal women. If GSM is suspected, referral to gynecology is warranted for further evaluation and management. The presence of vaginal atrophy can be assessed during a physical exam.

Other causes of vulvovaginal pruritus should be considered when common infectious and inflammatory causes have been ruled out and the clinical picture suits another domain, especially in cases of chronic pruritus or when treatment has failed to improve symptoms. Neuropathic itching may arise from conditions such as vulvodynia, small fiber polyneuropathy (SFPN), scars and burns, postherpetic neuralgias, radiculopathies, or spinal nerve compression. The presence of risk factors for neuropathy, associated burning pain or neurological symptoms, pruritus with a dermatomal distribution or in the location of previous lesions, or sensory abnormalities may be associated. Nerve conduction studies, imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lower spine to assess for spinal stenosis, and mapping of pruritus by neural distribution are recommended.

### Vulvovaginal candidiasis: A review of the evidence for the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^114CjmaX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common cause of vulvovaginal itching and discharge. This article discusses the latest CDC STI treatment guidelines for VVC.

- **Methods**: A literature search of relevant topics was performed, and a team of experts was convened to discuss several aspects:
	1. Diagnosis and testing modalities
	2. Treatment of uncomplicated VVC
	3. Treatment of complicated VVC
	4. VVC caused by non-albicans yeast
	5. Alternative treatment regimens
	6. Susceptibility testing of yeast
	- **Special Populations**:
		7. Pregnancy
		8. HIV and VVC

- **Results**: Yeast culture remains the gold standard for diagnoses, while newer molecular assays have been developed for diagnosing VVC and perform well. Azole antifungals remain the treatment of choice for uncomplicated VVC. Two new drugs, TOL-463 and recently FDA-approved ibrexafungerp, appeared promising in clinical trials. For recurrent VVC, oteseconazole, not yet commercially available, may represent a new option. For non-albicans yeast infections in symptomatic patients, boric acid appears useful. No evidence supports the use of alternative treatments, including probiotics. Fluconazole during pregnancy may be associated with spontaneous abortion and craniofacial and heart defects. In women with HIV infection, lower CD4+ T-cell counts are associated with increased rates of VVC, and VVC is associated with increased viral shedding. Treatment measures in women with HIV infection are identical to those in women without HIV infection.

- **Conclusions**: There has been significant new knowledge generated about VVC since the 2015 CDC guidelines.

Acute pruritus frequently arises from infectious causes, which should be strongly considered in the initial differential diagnosis. Common infectious causes that do not cause lesions and can be evaluated quickly include vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), bacterial vaginosis (BV), trichomoniasis (TV), chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Parasitic infestations such as pubic lice and pinworms should also be readily considered in patients with excoriations but no other visual lesions, particularly in children and sexually active individuals with risk factors like contact with infected individuals or children with frequent exposure to other children.

If there is suspicion for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV status should be evaluated, as affected individuals are prone to more severe infection or reinfection. If lesions are present, their appearance and associated symptoms should guide the differential diagnosis. Herpetic lesions, condylomas, molluscum contagiosum, scabies, and syphilis primary lesions all have distinctive appearances and can be confirmed with laboratory testing or biopsies.

Inflammatory dermatological conditions such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis (AD), lichen planus (LP), and contact dermatitis frequently cause vaginal pruritus and should be included in the differential for acute and chronic vulvovaginal itching due to their intermittent, relapsing, and remitting nature. Psoriasis is a chronic cause of itch, often accompanying well-demarcated, erythematous red plaques limited to the labia majora, and it is frequently misdiagnosed as candida. In atopic dermatitis, the presence of poorly defined erythematous plaques and excoriations, alongside a history of similar conditions, can assist in diagnosis.

### British society for rheumatology guideline on management of adult and juvenile onset Sjögren disease [^111EoaFK]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

In people with Sjögren disease (SD) who have sicca (dryness) symptoms outside the eyes and mouth, what is the most clinically effective topical treatment?

- **Topical treatments for vaginal dryness**: Vaginal dryness is a common symptom in SD. One study recorded self-reported vaginal dryness in 53% of individuals with SD compared with 28% of controls (P = 0.005). Despite this, there are no published studies specifically addressing the treatment of vaginal dryness in SD.

	- A Cochrane review of topical oestrogens for vaginal atrophy in post-menopausal women included 30 RCTs (6235 women) and found low to moderate quality evidence of benefits versus placebo. There was no difference in efficacy between the various intravaginal preparations. Topical oestrogen use is considered safe and no association was found between vaginal oestrogen use and multiple health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, cancers, and hip fracture, in a cohort of nearly 900 women participating in the Nurses' Health Study — a large population-based cohort involving over 50,000 individuals studied over 18 years of follow-up. However, topical oestrogens are not recommended for use in children or adolescents.

	- Non-hormonal vaginal moisturizers have been shown to provide effective symptomatic relief of vaginal dryness in normal post-menopausal women and are routinely recommended in guidelines. They are available over the counter. Two studies found vaginal hyaluronic acid (HA) to be as effective as vaginal estriol in post-menopausal women (not SD) for the treatment of vaginal dryness and associated symptoms of itching, burning, and dyspareunia.

### Scratching the surface: A comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^111GzTY2]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

For fungal and parasitic infections, medications tend to reduce itch quite rapidly. Metronidazole is commonly used for bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis, while fungal infections are often treated with oral fluconazole. For bacterial vulvar infections, antibiotics are prescribed based on the identified pathogen.

Very rarely, long-term management of vulvar itching in postmenopausal women may involve low-dose estradiol, administered orally or via transdermal application, following the failure of localized topical treatments. This therapy is not frequently preferred because the safety of long-term low-dose hormone therapy is inferior to that of localized treatments.

In rare cases, botox injections and spinal blocks have been used as treatment options for neuropathic itch, including vulvovaginal pruritus, by modulating nerve activity and reducing hypersensitization. Additionally, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation, a neuromodulation technique commonly used for chronic pain, has shown potential for managing intractable neuropathic itch. This approach targets the DRG, which plays a critical role in transmitting itch signals, and can be applied as a treatment for localized vulvovaginal itch.

- **Nonpharmaceutical therapies**: Nonpharmaceutical methods can also mitigate symptoms of vulvovaginal pruritus. Tub and sitz baths can soothe symptoms by hydrating the vulvar area, but water should not be too hot. In inflammatory conditions, applying bland emollients such as petroleum jelly can help retain moisture and protect the skin. Cold compresses may alleviate severe itch.

### Scratching the surface: A comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^113FzSk9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

The evaluation of patients presenting with vulvovaginal pruritus begins with a thorough history and physical examination. Important aspects of the history include the onset, duration, severity, and timing of symptoms; aggravating and relieving factors; and associated symptoms. The location of the itch should be well defined and confirmed by the provider. Questions such as "Is the itching on the inside, outside, or both?" may help characterize the itch as vaginal, vulvar, or vulvovaginal.

An extensive survey of potential environmental exposures, such as sea, lake, pool, or hot tub water or plants, may be undertaken. Irritant contacts with potential allergens, such as scented products, soaps, douches, noncotton or dyed fabrics, or absorbent products such as diapers or menstrual products, should be screened. Inquiries about pubic hair management practices are important, as well as collecting information about sexual contacts, particularly recent or new partners, and STI history.

If symptoms are associated with onset after female-male sexual intercourse, an allergy to latex or human seminal plasma could be considered. Nonsexual contact history should also be assessed; the physician may inquire if close contacts have recently had similar symptoms. Hygiene practices and history of bowel and bladder control should be assessed, particularly in children, the elderly, and patients with disabilities. Medications that can affect hormonal levels, such as contraceptives or estrogen modulators, and are associated with pruritus, should also be considered.

### Vaginitis in nonpregnant patients: ACOG practice bulletin, number 215 [^113dmELK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Vaginitis is defined as inflammation or infection of the vagina and is characterized by a spectrum of symptoms, including vulvovaginal itching, burning, irritation, dyspareunia, a "fishy" vaginal odor, and abnormal vaginal discharge. These vaginal symptoms are among the most frequent reasons for patient visits to obstetrician-gynecologists and may have significant consequences in terms of discomfort and pain, days lost from school or work, sexual functioning, and self-image. Distinguishing vaginal from vulvar symptoms is crucial to direct evaluation and treatment accurately.

The purpose of this document is to provide updated, evidence-based guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of the common causes of vaginitis in nonpregnant patients. Information on the treatment of vaginitis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is available elsewhere. Guidelines are subject to change.

### Vaginal symptoms in postmenopausal women: Self-reported severity, natural history, and risk factors [^114je3k2]. Menopause (2009). Low credibility.

This study aimed to examine factors other than estrogen deficiency influencing the development and persistence of vaginal dryness, itching, and painful sexual intercourse after menopause.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from a 2-year, population-based cohort of 1,017 postmenopausal women aged 55 to 75 years. Vaginal symptoms were assessed by interviewer-administered questionnaire, and vaginal swabs were performed to assess vaginal pH and microbial flora at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify characteristics associated with symptoms.

- **Results**: Half of the women (n = 471) reported problematic vaginal dryness, a third (n = 316) reported itching, and 40% of sexually active women (n = 166) reported painful intercourse at baseline. Of women not taking estrogen, half of those reporting baseline symptoms were symptomatic after 24 months. Vaginal dryness was associated with younger age (odds ratio [OR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69–0.94, per 5-year increase), nonwhite race (e.g. African American, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, or American Indian [OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.04–2.27]), diabetes (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.07–2.12), lower 36-item Short-Form Health Survey physical functioning scores (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85–0.97, per 10-point increase), lower body mass index (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.71–0.93, per 5 kg/m increase), recent sexual activity (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.08–1.21), and vaginal colonization with enterococci (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.04–1.51). Vaginal itching was also associated with lower physical functioning scores: OR, 0.86.

### Clindamycin phosphate [^117BE7Fv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2% contains ingredients that may cause burning and irritation of the eyes. In the event of accidental contact, rinse the eye with copious amounts of cool tap water.

Use of clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2% may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms in the vagina. In clinical studies involving 600 non-pregnant women treated for 3 days, Candida albicans was detected, either symptomatically or by culture, in 8.8% of patients. Vaginitis was recorded in 9% of these patients. In studies involving 1,325 non-pregnant women treated for 7 days, Candida albicans was detected in 10.5% of patients, with vaginitis recorded in 10.7% of the cases. Among 180 pregnant women treated for 7 days, Candida albicans was detected in 13.3% of patients, with vaginitis recorded in 7.2%. The term "Candida albicans" here includes vaginal moniliasis and moniliasis (body as a whole), whereas "vaginitis" includes vulvovaginal disorder, vulvovaginitis, vaginal discharge, trichomonal vaginitis, and vaginitis.

- **Information for the patient**: The patient should be instructed not to engage in vaginal intercourse or use other vaginal products (such as tampons or douches) during treatment with this product. Additionally, they should be advised that this cream contains mineral oil that may weaken latex or rubber products such as condoms or vaginal contraceptive diaphragms.

### Scratching the surface: A comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^111r2RiP]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

The terms "vulvitis", "vaginitis", and "vulvovaginitis" are sometimes used interchangeably to describe inflammation in the lower genital tract; similarly, the literature also often uses vulvar pruritus, vaginal pruritus, and vulvovaginal pruritus interchangeably. Therefore, it is important to clarify the meaning of these terms. The vulva is the general external genitalia, while the vagina refers to the internal canal, and "vulvovaginal pruritus" is a broader term encompassing both the vulvar and vaginal regions. Clearly distinguishing these terms is crucial to accurately identify the tissues involved in pruritic processes and narrow down potential causes.

Pruritus, or itching, is an unpleasant sensation temporarily relieved by scratching or rubbing the affected area. Unlike pain, itching is characterized by a "need to scratch", providing relief. This symptom is common in dermatological conditions and differs from irritation, which encompasses broader discomfort not necessarily alleviated by scratching. Pain, involving burning or aching sensations, is distinct from itching and is not relieved through scratching. "Vulvitis", "vaginitis", and "vulvovaginitis" are terms that describe inflammation of the ascribed tissues. These terms should not be used to describe pruritus that is not associated with inflammation.

Vulvovaginal pruritus can be defined as acute or chronic, distinguished by occurring for less than or more than six weeks, respectively. Acute vulvovaginal pruritus may become chronic depending on the cause and access to effective treatment.

Inflammatory Causes

Vaginal itching can often arise from inflammatory dermatological conditions, with atopic dermatitis (AD) and irritant and allergic contact dermatitis among the most common causes of vulvar itch. AD affecting the vulva, also known as vulvar eczema, is a genetic disorder that compromises the skin barrier and causes itching with resulting rash formation. Contact dermatitis results from external irritants or allergens. Common irritants and allergens include feminine hygiene products, a warm and moist environment, fragrances, preservatives, and topical treatments that trigger allergic reactions.

Other inflammatory causes include genital psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus (LSC), lichen sclerosus (LS), and lichen planus (LP). In genital psoriasis, immune-mediated inflammation leads to the overproduction of skin cells, causing scaling, redness, and itching. LSC is an eczematic disorder where an underlying skin condition or systemic disease leads to an intense, prolonged itch-scratch cycle and ultimate thickening of the skin. The typical LS lesions are hypopigmented, pruritic areas surrounding the vaginal introitus and anus. LP is a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the skin and mucosal surfaces and can lead to itching, scarring, and atrophy of the vulvar skin. Though less common, seborrheic dermatitis, plasma cell vulvitis, and Fox–Fordyce disease can also cause vulvar itching. Seborrheic dermatitis affects sebum-rich areas and can cause erythematous plaques on the vulva with severe pruritus. Plasma cell vulvitis is a rare condition associated with plasma cell infiltration.

### Allergic vulvovaginitis [^115kCi4p]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2000). Low credibility.

The reader of this review will learn about the different clinical forms of allergic vulvovaginitis. This specific and important chapter has not been previously summarized and described in the medical literature. Vaginal mucosa can show an allergic response similar to the nose, eyes, lungs, and skin. Physicians should familiarize themselves with this manifestation to make a proper diagnosis and evaluation of this condition.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE searches were undertaken since 1966 for citations of any kind of allergic vulvovaginitis. Relevant reviews and articles identified in this process were surveyed for additional and earlier citations. Textbooks of medicine, gynecology, dermatology, and infectious diseases have also been consulted. Old medical textbooks and journals of allergy and internal medicine were recovered from the Division of History of the Medicine of the Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Federal Medical College), Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

- **Conclusions**: A wide variety of allergens can provoke allergic reactions in the female genital tract. The immunology of the vagina, the influence of hormones, the menstrual cycle, and psychological factors are highlighted in this review. A possibility of vaginal hyperreactivity is proposed. Adequate management provides important relief of symptoms in most cases.

### Genital malodor in women: A modern reappraisal [^111aU1i5]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Genital malodor is a common and distressing complaint that prompts many women to visit their physicians. Although vaginal infections, primarily bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis, remain the most common and easily diagnosed causes, approximately one-third of women who present with malodor have no identifiable cause. Despite extensive data on managing vaginal discharge, the management of genital odor beyond common vaginal infections is poorly studied. This gap presents a frustrating scenario for both patients and physicians.

Often, patients resort to home remedies and over-the-counter preparations. These solutions may provide short-term relief for some women but almost never address the underlying cause and can sometimes exacerbate symptoms. In this review, we attempt to consolidate the known and documented causes of genital malodor, including non-vaginal causes, and provide case studies that will help clinicians understand the possible settings for the various causes. We also offer an algorithm for managing this symptom beyond the realm of vaginal infections.

### Host-vaginal microbiota interactions in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis [^114wuNHM]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

The cause of bacterial vaginosis, the most common cause of vaginal discharge in women, remains controversial. We recently published an updated conceptual model on bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis, focusing on the roles of Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia as early colonizers and Atopobium vaginae and other bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria (BVAB) as secondary colonizers in this infection. In this article, we extend the description of our model to include a discussion on the role of host-vaginal microbiota interactions in bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis.

- **Recent findings**: Although G. vaginalis and P. bivia are highly abundant in women with bacterial vaginosis, neither induce a robust inflammatory response from vaginal epithelial cells. These early colonizers may be evading the immune system while establishing the bacterial vaginosis biofilm. Secondary colonizers, including A. vaginae, Sneathia spp., and potentially other BVAB, are more potent stimulators of the host-immune response to bacterial vaginosis and likely contribute to its signs and symptoms as well as its adverse outcomes.

- **Summary**: Elucidating the cause of bacterial vaginosis has important implications for diagnosis and treatment. Our bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis model provides a framework for key elements that should be considered when designing and testing novel bacterial vaginosis diagnostics and therapeutics.
