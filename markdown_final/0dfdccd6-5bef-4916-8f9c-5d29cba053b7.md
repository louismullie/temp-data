## Question

How to start eating again after intestine surgery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to resume eating after intestinal surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle of early feeding within ERAS. Then, I should verify procedure-specific timing and exceptions. Next, I will examine diet progression strategies and tolerance-based advancement. After that, I need to check nutritional targets and supplementation. I will then review special populations and emergency surgery nuances. Finally, I should confirm monitoring, red flags, and patient education elements that align with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: modern perioperative care favors early resumption of oral intake after intestinal surgery, moving away from waiting for flatus or bowel movements, because early feeding is safe and associated with faster return of GI function and shorter length of stay without increasing complications like anastomotic leak or pneumonia, provided we individualize to tolerance and surgical context [^116EXMwB] [^1158MgM6] [^111xxLEq].

> Wait, let me verify the timing for elective colorectal surgery specifically; I initially thought "within 24 hours" might be too broad, but the ASCRS/SAGES 2023 guideline explicitly recommends offering a regular diet within 24 hours after elective colorectal surgery, supported by moderate-quality evidence and a Cochrane review showing about a 2-day reduction in length of stay with early feeding, without excess complications [^116EXMwB] [^111GPRCS] [^1158MgM6].

> Hold on, I should verify whether this extends to upper GI and bariatric contexts; evidence suggests early oral intake is feasible and safe after major upper GI surgery, including randomized data showing no increase in major complications with normal food from postoperative day 1, and bariatric-specific guidance supports early clear liquids with progression to full liquids or pureed/soft solids by postoperative day 1, emphasizing protein targets and supervised progression [^112F5sZD] [^111V9Z4K] [^115hANXV].

> I need to ensure I account for exceptions; in malnourished patients or when oral intake cannot be adequately resumed within about 7 days, ESPEN recommends initiating enteral or parenteral nutrition without delay, and in emergency surgery, early feeding is still encouraged as soon as tolerated, but timing must be individualized based on hemodynamic stability, anastomotic integrity, and ileus risk, with TPN reserved for nonfunctioning gut beyond roughly 7 days after accounting for preoperative starvation [^112vE6Ug] [^111p9rRb] [^115bbo89].

> Next, I should review diet progression; let me think about a practical, tolerance-based approach: start with small sips of clear liquids within hours if awake and stable, advance to full liquids or pureed textures within 24–48 hours depending on procedure and tolerance, and then to soft solids as tolerated, avoiding abrupt progression and tailoring to symptoms like nausea, bloating, or pain; this aligns with ERAS principles and bariatric protocols that limit clear liquids to no more than 48 hours due to nutritional inadequacy [^112M2APQ] [^115hANXV] [^115u8RhB].

> I should double-check the role of "sham feeding"; chewing sugar-free gum for at least 10 minutes three to four times daily modestly accelerates return of bowel function and may reduce length of stay, so I will incorporate this as an adjunct when patients can safely chew, while acknowledging the evidence quality and that it complements rather than replaces actual feeding [^114yUd9s] [^117CvnZU].

> Let me consider nutritional targets; protein intake of about 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day is reasonable in the perioperative window, and if oral intake is insufficient, oral nutritional supplements should be added to bridge the gap; in bariatric patients, minimum protein targets of 60 g/day with up to 1.5 g/kg ideal weight/day are standard, and fluids should be advanced to roughly 48–64 oz/day while avoiding drinking with meals to mitigate dumping risk [^115W26Xk] [^115hANXV] [^115zD7rz].

> But wait, what about special populations; for IBD, I should confirm that early normal food or enteral nutrition is generally acceptable postoperatively, with preoperative exclusive enteral nutrition considered for malnourished Crohn's patients to optimize status and reduce complications; for older adults, I need to ensure careful aspiration risk assessment and slower advancement if tolerance is limited; for neonates and infants after intestinal surgery, early enteral feeding is supported, with breast milk preferred and continuous feeds often better tolerated, with sodium monitoring and mucous fistula refeeding considered in selected cases [^115XHkox] [^1154eFwh] [^116qySb3] [^1135mqFr].

> I will now examine monitoring and red flags; I should confirm that we advance based on tolerance rather than waiting for flatus or stool, but pause and reassess if there is intractable vomiting, severe abdominal distension, escalating pain, or concern for anastomotic leak; risk factors for diet failure include longer operative times and certain anastomotic configurations, so I need to keep surgical factors in mind and escalate to imaging or surgical evaluation if alarm features arise [^113ryops] [^115HhGsQ].

> Hold on, I should verify patient education elements that improve adherence; patients often report that knowing eating is a discharge criterion motivates early intake despite nausea, and structured education on goals, textures, and symptoms improves compliance with supplements and diet progression; preoperative counseling on early feeding expectations and postoperative reinforcement by dietitians or nurses are practical steps to support success [^116Q1P4P] [^116aaQyg] [^112gAg1N].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency: for most elective intestinal surgeries within ERAS, offer clear liquids within hours if stable, advance to full liquids or soft solids within 24–48 hours as tolerated, target protein 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day with supplements if needed, use gum chewing to facilitate motility, and individualize for malnutrition, emergency context, or high-risk anatomy; this approach is consistent with contemporary guidelines and meta-analyses showing faster GI recovery and shorter length of stay without excess complications when early feeding is implemented thoughtfully [^116EXMwB] [^1158MgM6] [^111xxLEq].

---

Start eating within 24 hours after intestinal surgery when tolerated, beginning with **clear liquids** and advancing to **regular diet** as tolerated [^116EXMwB] [^111GPRCS]. Early feeding is safe, reduces postoperative ileus, and shortens hospital stay without increasing complications [^1158MgM6] [^116cY92R]. If nausea or vomiting occurs, pause and restart slowly; if oral intake is inadequate after 7 days, consider enteral or parenteral nutrition [^112vE6Ug] [^114aWMnD]. Follow your surgeon's guidance and listen to your body.

---

## Timing of resumption of oral intake

- **Early feeding**: Start clear liquids within 24 hours post-surgery if tolerated; early feeding is safe, reduces ileus, and shortens stay [^116EXMwB] [^1158MgM6].

- **Traditional approach**: Waiting for flatus or stool is outdated; early feeding does not increase complications [^115HhGsQ] [^1158MgM6].

- **Individualized timing**: Adapt to tolerance, surgery type, and comorbidities; delay if concerns (e.g. anastomotic leak) [^113EHP8s] [^111p9rRb].

---

## Recommended dietary progression

| **Stage** | **Diet type** | **Timing** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Stage 1 | Clear liquids | Within 24 hours post-surgery | Water, broth, clear juices, gelatin |
| Stage 2 | Full liquids | Day 2–3 if clear liquids tolerated | Milk, yogurt, protein shakes, cream soups |
| Stage 3 | Soft foods | Day 4–7 if full liquids tolerated | Scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes, soft fruits, cooked vegetables |
| Stage 4 | Regular diet | After 7 days if soft foods tolerated | Normal diet, avoiding excessive fiber initially |

---

## Nutritional considerations

- **Protein intake**: Aim for 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day to support healing and prevent muscle loss [^115W26Xk].

- **Caloric intake**: Gradually increase to meet energy needs; supplements if oral intake is insufficient [^114j9nwf].

- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate fluid intake to prevent dehydration and support recovery [^115hANXV].

---

## Potential complications and how to manage them

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Common; pause intake, restart slowly, and use antiemetics as needed [^117JhRCV].

- **Diarrhea or constipation**: Adjust diet, ensure hydration, and consult your healthcare team [^115zD7rz].

- **Anastomotic leak**: Rare but serious; report severe pain, fever, or unusual symptoms immediately [^notfound].

---

## Role of early enteral nutrition in recovery

Early enteral nutrition **enhances recovery** by promoting gut motility, reducing ileus, and shortening hospital stay [^1158MgM6] [^111xxLEq]. It also **lowers complications**, with no increase in anastomotic leaks or infections compared to delayed feeding [^116EXMwB] [^112F5sZD].

---

## Special considerations

- **Malnutrition**: Provide nutritional support if oral intake is inadequate after 7 days [^112vE6Ug] [^114aWMnD].

- **Short bowel syndrome**: Requires specialized dietary planning and monitoring [^113Xc3Bx].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Tailor diet to age, comorbidities, and surgery type [^113EHP8s] [^111p9rRb].

---

## Patient education and support

Education should explain the benefits of early feeding and provide clear dietary progression instructions, and **support** should include dietitians, nurses, and surgeons to guide recovery [^111GPRCS] [^115XSmBm].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Start early**: Begin clear liquids within 24 hours if tolerated [^113EHP8s].

- **Progress slowly**: Advance diet based on tolerance [^116pw5q1].

- **Monitor closely**: Watch for complications and adjust as needed [^114j9nwf].

- **Seek support**: Use healthcare team and education resources [^116Q1P4P].

---

Starting to eat after intestinal surgery should begin **within 24 hours** with clear liquids, progressing slowly to a regular diet as tolerated. Early feeding is safe, supports recovery, and reduces complications [^116EXMwB] [^1158MgM6].

### Level of ERAS understanding affects practitioners' practice and perception of early postoperative resumption of oral intake: a nationwide survey [^113eiVNt]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Postoperative resumption of oral intake is highly variable among gastrointestinal, hepato-pancreato-biliary and non-abdominal surgery. Indeed, after abdominal and intestinal surgery, due to the disruption of normal bowel motility, postoperative ileus may occur. For this reason, the timing of postoperative oral intake has long been debated. Traditional management usually includes remaining fasting until bowel sound or passage of flatus or stool, which are clinical parameters used to confirm resolution of ileus, and then commencing on clear fluids typically 2 to 5 days postoperation and finally progressing to a solid diet as tolerated. However, these old-school parameters are dispensable evidence of resumed bowel function and an early oral diet has been shown to be safe at 4 h after surgery in patients with nondiverted colorectal anastomosis. It seems that gastrointestinal surgery is associated with a higher risk of postoperative ileus, so multimodal preventive strategies should be adopted to facilitate the recovery of gastrointestinal function if delayed gastric emptying or ileus occurs after surgery, including the use of nasogastric tubes prophylactically and remedially. Moreover, different surgical methods may have different levels of risk, such as gastrointestinal surgery. Esophagojejunostomy is probably a more vulnerable reconstruction than distal or subtotal gastric resection, so patients undergoing the former may need a longer period of postoperative fasting. Therefore, for gastrointestinal and hepato-pancreato-biliary surgeries, almost all ERAS programs recommend that patients should be allowed to resume a normal diet (may through enteric feeding tubes if needed)after surgery without restrictions according to their tolerance, even though none of them mention a specific number of hours or days postoperatively. To further explore early intake after surgery, more large-scale high-quality studies are needed. Our results confirm this clinical need.

Patients should be offered a regular diet within 24 h after elective colorectal surgery. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B

A 2019 Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated 17 RCTs that compared early feeding (i.e. within 24 h of surgery) versus "later commencement" after lower gastrointestinal surgery. In this review, early feeding was associated with a two-day decrease in length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference 1.95, 95% CI 0.91–2.99). However, perioperative management strategies varied significantly within the included trials and the mean length of stay in the control group ranged from 6 to 24 days. Furthermore, the risk of complications such as anastomotic leak, wound infection, pneumonia, and mortality were not affected by early feeding. Even symptoms of nausea and vomiting were not significantly higher in the early feeding group in this review. Early enteral feeding is associated with faster return of gastrointestinal function and with shorter time to flatus and first bowel movement. While there is heterogeneity between trials, the overall body of evidence supports the benefits of early feeding.

### Level of ERAS understanding affects practitioners' practice and perception of early postoperative resumption of oral intake: a nationwide survey [^113EHP8s]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Traditionally, postoperative oral intake is gradually introduced following the resumption of bowel sounds and the passage of flatus or stool, which is mainly due to the fear that early oral intake can prolong paralytic ileus. However, a growing body of evidence has suggested these fears are ungrounded, and it has been widely accepted that any delay in the resumption of a normal oral diet after major surgery is associated with increased rates of surgical site infection and delayed recovery. As it is safe and beneficial to patients, the concept of early postoperative oral intake has been increasingly incorporated into enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols. ERAS clinical pathways have been developed with the goal of improving the quality of perioperative care, minimizing the loss of functional capacity and enhancing the recovery process. The ERAS program initially became well established for colorectal surgery and has been further expanded, promoting rapid functional recovery after abdominal and non-abdominal surgeries such as gastrointestinal surgery, pancreatoduodenectomy, liver surgery, lung surgery, breast surgery, total hip/knee replacement, lumbar spinal fusion, cardiac surgery and gynecological surgeries.

Almost all these ERAS programs suggest re-establishing oral feeding as early as possible after surgery. Recently, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) nutrition guidelines have recommended that in general, oral nutritional intake should be continued after surgery without interruption and that oral intake including clear liquids should be initiated within hours after surgery in most patients. (Evidence level: I, Recommendation grade: A). However, considering the original bowel function state and the impact of surgery is variable among patients with different conditions, the guidelines also noted that oral intake should be adapted according to individual tolerance and to the type of surgery carried out, with special caution taken for elderly patients. It deserves due attention that unlike the "2–4–6–8 rule" as a universally accepted standard of preoperative fasting, when to commence postoperative oral intake is vague and confusing.

On the other hand, despite the clinical benefits of early resumption of oral intake, its implementation in clinical practice has been relatively "delayed". Possible reasons include a lack of convincing data, a low-level understanding of ERAS, and limitations in institutional experience and systems. Therefore, in an effort to identify difficulties in the implementation of early postoperative oral intake programs, we carried out a nationwide survey to determine clinical practices and attitudes toward the postoperative resumption of oral intake among all clinical practitioners along with their level of understanding of ERAS.

### Is an early resumption of a regular diet after laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass safe? [^114himX5]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Morbid obesity is a major public health burden in developed countries. The only effective long-term treatment for severe obesity is bariatric surgery. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is the second most performed bariatric surgery worldwide and the most performed in Switzerland with 80% of cases in 2020. LRYGB includes the creation of a small gastric pouch of 25 to 50 mL with a gastrojejunal anastomosis. The food bolus distending this proximal anastomosis may be a source of concern. On the other hand, enteral feeding has been proven to promote mucosal growth, increase gastrointestinal immunity, and decrease mucosal permeability. Early postoperative normal feeding after upper gastrointestinal (UGI) surgery causes a dilemma, namely a rapid return to a normal diet to promote patient recovery but slow enough to allow anastomotic healing.

Early feeding has been proven to be safe after small bowel resection, lower gastrointestinal surgery, and gastric cancer surgery. For bariatric surgery, there is a lack of consensus regarding the postoperative regimen composition. The European guidelines for bariatric surgery recommend a texture progression specific to the surgical procedure and to the bariatric center's usual practice. On the other hand, the US guidelines propose a return to normal food intake initiated between 4 and 6 weeks after surgery. In practice, it results in a liquid diet and then possibly to a pureed diet during the entire period. However, in the current context of fast-track surgery, there is a growing interest in early normal food intake after abdominal surgery, allowing for a shorter hospital stay and even for outpatient surgery. The timing to introduce a normal diet is a matter of concern as high-quality research evidence is scarce. A strict diet may impede patient quality of life, patient compliance, and it may also induce nutritional deficiencies. Patient quality of life and satisfaction are significant aspects of the postoperative period, which are increasingly studied. Patients prioritize quality-of-life items much more often than healthcare professionals. Bariatric surgeons might be too strict with their postoperative diet recommendations. The aim of the study was to investigate the safety of introducing a normal textured diet 1 week after LRGYB.

### Patient experiences of perioperative nutrition within an enhanced recovery after surgery programme for colorectal surgery: a qualitative study [^116Q1P4P]. Colorectal Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Discharge

Participants were keen to be discharged as early as possible. Returning home was considered an important step in recovery, and individuals understood that resuming diet was a discharge criterion. Despite lack of appetite and challenges such as nausea and vomiting, the prospect of returning home acted as a strong motivator for participants to begin eating postoperatively.

I'm gonna try a bit again today… obviously I've got to eat my food before I can go home… if I don't eat then I won't be allowed to go home…

Participants considered that going home would also enable return of their appetite to its original 'normal' state. Individuals were keen to pursue a sense of normality, and therefore were eager to engage in recovery activities to promote an earlier return home. The concept of normality associated with discharge was perceived as a facilitator for postoperative food consumption. However, some individuals were concerned about possible lifestyle changes when returning home (slowing down activity, altering diet), and were apprehensive about establishing a new sense of normality.

… I was told… when I go home and I'm able to eat again, I can eat or drink anything I want… hopefully I'll go back to how I was eating and drinking before.

### Perioperative nutritional assessment and management of patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery [^116cY92R]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Recent postoperative data show that it is better to immediately feed the patient orally after surgery to avoid malnutrition. Administering oral food as early as possible is a key intervention of the ERAS program. Evidence suggests that the early start of oral fluid intake, if feasible from the first postoperative day, can shorten hospitalization, as well as reducing postoperative complications such as ileus. Intravenous nutritional assistance is recommended only for patients who have moderate or severe malnutrition, or who are at risk of malnutrition (not expected to be able to consume food in the next 7 days), or whose ability to swallow has decreased by 60% for more than 10 days.

To help the moderately malnourished patient, brief nutritional support (7–10 days) is necessary. In more severe malnutrition, nutritional support is necessary for longer periods and should be combined with resistance exercises. Pre- and postoperative nutritional support with parenteral nutrition has been shown to reduce morbidity only in people with severe malnutrition, so it is recommended.

Early enteral feeding is associated with faster return of GI function and with shorter time to flatus and first bowel movement. Although there is heterogeneity between trials, the overall body of evidence supports the benefits of early feeding.

### Core outcome set for clinical studies of postoperative ileus after intestinal surgery [^115Z3JbH]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative ileus is a common and distressing complication after intestinal surgery. It presents clinically as impairment of intestinal motility, characterized by abdominal pain, vomiting, and delayed recovery of defaecatory function. For patients, this increases the risk of serious complications, such as pneumonia, venous thromboembolic events, and malnutrition. For healthcare systems, it leads to a substantial economic burden associated with increased medical, nursing, dietitian, and laboratory costs. Accordingly, postoperative ileus is now recognized as a research priority by expert and public stakeholder groups.

Numerous clinical interventions have been evaluated in efforts to prevent postoperative ileus, but few have led to meaningful patient benefit. A key challenge for researchers is the absence of a standardized and agreed framework to describe the effectiveness of new interventions in clinical studies. Common outcomes include the time taken until first passage of flatus/stool, time until tolerance of oral diet, and the return of bowel sounds. It remains unclear, however, whether these are sufficiently relevant to patients and healthcare professionals when evaluating new treatments and implementing them in clinical practice.

A solution to this problem is the development of an agreed core outcome set developed through patient–clinician consensus. Core outcome sets provide a minimum set of outcomes that should be reported in all studies of a defined clinical condition and are supported by the Core Outcome Measures in Effective Trials (COMET) Initiative. The present report describes the international development and final content of an agreed core outcome set for postoperative ileus relevant to patients undergoing intestinal surgery.

Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Bariatric surgery postoperative diet progression and caloric targets — patients are advanced to a pureed diet (stage 3) approximately 2 weeks after surgery, continue stage 3 for another week and then advance to soft foods (stage 4), and after 1 or 2 weeks on soft foods can progress to all solids as tolerated (stage 5), generally 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. Typical daily caloric intake the first week after surgery is 400 kcal/ day and progresses to 600 to 800 kcal/day by weeks 3 to 4. Several months after surgery, patients should consume 1,200 to 1,500 kcal/day, with most patients consuming approximately 1,500 to 1,800 kcal/day, 6 months postoperatively and long-term. Typical patients should also avoid drinking liquids with meals, before or after eating solid food. If patients do not progress through these stages due to nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, careful evaluation of nutrition should be undertaken, and the surgeon should consider investigating potential causes (e.g., early anastomotic ulcer, stricture, and mechanical obstruction).

### Randomized clinical trial of the impact of early enteral feeding on postoperative ileus and recovery [^113AYfr9]. The British Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative convalescence is mainly determined by the extent and duration of postoperative ileus. This randomized clinical trial evaluated the effects of early oral feeding on functional gastrointestinal recovery and quality of life.

Methods

One hundred and twenty-eight patients undergoing elective open colorectal or abdominal vascular surgery participated in the trial. Of these, 67 were randomized to a conventional return to diet, and 61 to a regimen allowing resumption of an oral diet as soon as tolerated (free diet group).

Results

Reinsertion of a nasogastric tube was necessary in 20 per cent of the free diet group and 10 per cent of the conventional group (P = 0.213). The complication rate was similar for both groups, as was return of gastrointestinal function. A normal diet was tolerated after a median of 2 days in the free diet group compared with 5 days in the conventional group (P < 0.001). Quality of life scores were similar in both groups.

Conclusion

Early resumption of oral intake does not diminish the duration of postoperative ileus or lead to a significantly increased rate of nasogastric tube reinsertion. Tolerance of oral diet is not influenced by gastrointestinal functional recovery. As there is no reason to withhold oral intake following open colorectal or abdominal vascular surgery, postoperative management should include early resumption of diet.

### Is an early resumption of a regular diet after laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass safe? [^114YhNd9]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This retrospective study compared the short-term outcomes of different postoperative nutritional recommendations. A return to a normal diet 1 week after LRYGB did not increase the rate of postoperative complications or unplanned consultations at 90 days.

Timing of normal feeding after upper gastrointestinal surgery is a subject of uncertainty. In oncological situations, after esophagectomy and gastrectomy, several studies assessed the safety of early pureed oral feeding. Hur et al. included 58 patients with total and subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Patients were randomized between the early feeding group with a pureed diet on postoperative day 3 (POD) and a control group with a pureed diet on postoperative day 6, and no difference in postoperative morbidity or reoperation rates was observed. Six randomized studies were included by Liu et al. in a meta-analysis and confirmed the safety of early oral feeding, defined as feeding initiated before the first flatus was passed, after gastric cancer. There was no difference in terms of postoperative complications, tolerability of oral feeding, and readmission rate. For esophagectomy, a randomized trial from Sun et al. assessed the complications rates in patients after a McKeown minimally invasive esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Patients were randomized between the ones who received soft solid food on the first postoperative day (POD) or on POD 7. One hundred and forty patients were enrolled in each group. There was no difference in cardiac, respiratory, or gastrointestinal complications (25% in the early feeding group versus 27.9% in the late feeding group). Quality of life was improved in the early feeding group. Even in cervical anastomoses, early feeding does not seem to put reconstruction at risk.

6. Perioperative nutritional care

A number of randomized trials on the subject of early feeding (defined as having oral intake of fluids or food within the first 24 h after surgery) have been performed in gynecologic oncology. Effects include accelerated return of bowel activity, reduced length of stay, with no evidence of higher complication rates related to wound healing, anastomotic leaks, or pulmonary complications. A randomized study in patients with ovarian cancer showed a significantly lower rate of complications for patients receiving early feeding. However, complication rates were not different between groups when the analysis was limited to a smaller cohort of patients undergoing intestinal resections. It is important to note that early feeding is associated with a higher rate of nausea, but not vomiting, abdominal distension, or nasogastric tube use. Patient satisfaction with control of vomiting in one series was over 90% with early feeding despite a higher incidence of nausea in the enhanced recovery group.

6.1. Summary and recommendation

A regular diet within the first 24 h after gynecologic/oncology surgery is recommended.

6.2. Evidence level

High.

6.3. Recommendation grade

Strong.

### Care after colonic operation – is it evidence-based? Results from a multinational survey in Europe and the United States [^1148SgxN]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Despite clinical evidence showing that steps can be taken perioperatively to enhance postoperative recovery and decrease morbidity in colonic operation patients, there is no comprehensive information on how widespread such practices are, or the combination of such steps into effective multimodal rehabilitation (fast-track) colonic surgery programs to decrease hospital stay. This survey investigated clinical practice around colonic operations across Europe and the United States.

Methods

The survey was conducted in 295 hospitals in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United States. Details of perioperative care and postoperative recovery were recorded for 1,082 patients who had undergone elective colonic operations and who were discharged (or died) over a 2-week period (United States: up to 4 weeks).

Results

Preoperative bowel clearance was used in > 85% of patients. A nasogastric tube was left in situ postoperatively in 40% versus 66% of patients in the United States and Europe, respectively, and was removed about 3 days postoperatively. It took 3 to 4 days until 50% of the patients first tolerated liquids and 4 to 5 days until 50% of patients were eating and having a bowel movement. Postoperative ileus was found to persist for over 5 days in approximately 45% of patients. Mean length of postoperative hospital stay was over 10 days in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, and 7 days in the United States, compared with 2 to 5 days reported in trials of fast-track colonic surgery programs.

Conclusions

Strategies that can contribute to improved recovery and reduced complications after colonic operations do not appear to be applied optimally in clinical practice across Europe and the United States. These findings indicate a potential for major improvements in outcomes and reduction of costs if peri- and postoperative care can be adjusted to be in line with published evidence.

### Patient experiences of perioperative nutrition within an enhanced recovery after surgery programme for colorectal surgery: a qualitative study [^113X4Veu]. Colorectal Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Postoperative diet

Many participants were aware of the guidance to eat normally as soon as possible, and several individuals tolerated food when it was first offered postoperatively. Individuals generally were content with the notion of rapid resumption of diet and were pleased to be responsible for this aspect of their recovery. However, some reported reduced appetite due to vomiting or intense nausea, or the fear of these occurring. This limited participants' willingness to resume diet, as individuals were distressed at the thought of vomiting again or wanted to rest the digestive system. Some participants also considered that reduced appetite and food intake were understandable whilst in hospital, due to their lower activity levels compared with when they were at home.

… when I've been sick, I feel I want to give my stomach a rest… once I've been sick I will tend to say… "Well, I won't have any more food now for a while".

Additionally, placement of a stoma caused difficulties for some participants. Individuals found it challenging to accept such an extreme bodily alteration, particularly as this appeared to cause substantial changes in their perception of food: food was now viewed as a burden. Participants found the idea of adjusting their normal activity and food intake to accommodate the stoma challenging. Individuals were unclear which foods would be best tolerated and which might aggravate stoma output or cause blockage. One individual reported attempts to reduce food intake in an effort to decrease how frequently the stoma bag would require emptying.

… everything that goes in my mouth I can see coming out and that's quite off‐putting… I think subconsciously I'm probably holding back more on what I'm eating because I know ultimately in a few hours I'm gonna have to open that up and get rid of it…

Staff were considered helpful in assisting individuals and providing access to food. They were perceived as approachable; consequently, individuals felt confident in asking for food and advice. Participants were grateful for the staff's caring attitude, and felt reassured that they were receiving high quality service.

You can always ask them for a sandwich… whatever day, time of the day and night it is and they will get it for you.

Participants were also generally impressed with the choice of food available, although there was some concern that the choice compromised the food quality.

… there are far too many things on the menu… they should do a few things much better…

### The effect of diets delivered into the gastrointestinal tract on gut motility after colorectal surgery-a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111xxLEq]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Despite best practice guidelines, feeding methods after colorectal surgery vary due to the difficulties translating evidence into practice. The aim was to determine the effectiveness of diets delivered into the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) on gut motility following colorectal surgery.

Subjects/Methods

EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science and PubMed were systematically searched. Randomised controlled trials investigating effectiveness of a diet on gut motility after colorectal surgeries were included. Outcomes included postoperative ileus, length of stay, mortality, nausea and vomiting.

Results

A total of 756 potential studies were identified; of these, 10 trials reporting on 1237 unique patients were included. There is evidence that early feeding reduces time (days) to first flatus (mean difference (MD):-0.64; 95% CI:-0.84 to -0.44) and bowel movements (MD:-0.64; 95% CI:-1.01 to -0.26), when compared to traditional postoperative fasting. Introducing solids versus the progression of fluids to solids had no effect on time (days) to first flatus (MD:0.13; 95% CI:-1.99 to 1.74) or bowel movement (MD:0.20; 95% CI:-0.50 to 0.98). Complete nutrition compared to hypocaloric nutrition had no effect on time to first flatus (MD:-0.60; 95% CI:-1.66 to 0.46) or bowel movement (MD:-0.20; 95% CI:-1.59 to 1.19), whereas coffee and diet compared to water and diet significantly decreased time (days) to first bowel movement (MD:-0.60; 95% CI:-0.97 to -0.19) but had no effect on time to first flatus (MD:-0.20; 95% CI:-0.57 to 0.09).

Conclusions

Any form of early postoperative diet provided into the GIT early after colorectal surgery is likely to stimulate gut motility, resulting in earlier return of bowel function and shorter length of stay.

Question 10.4

When should total parenteral nutrition be started in a patient with postoperative ileus?

Recommendation: Total parenteral nutrition should usually be given when the patient has had a non‐functioning gut for over 7 days. This should include the period of preoperative starvation. A formal nutritional assessment of the patient is essential.

Level of evidence: II

Grade of recommendation: B

Consensus: 100% (SA 77.8, A 22.2%)

Malnutrition and weight loss are associated with higher risks of surgical complications. Whilst total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may deliver a patient's metabolic needs it brings its own complications and trials do not show any benefit from starting TPN early. It is essential, however, to consider the duration of preoperative starvation and the likely timing of resumed gut function. In many cases where there has been a prolonged degree of preoperative starvation, for example due to an impending obstruction, the duration of starvation may be much longer than simply the time from operation to resumption of normal gut function. A formal assessment of the patient's nutritional status is essential. It is preferable to give nutritional supplementation enterally rather than by TPN as this is cheaper and, in some trials, has been associated with lower risks of infection. Parenteral nutrition may be given to supplement inadequate enteral nutrition. It is not recommended to start TPN unless it is likely to be needed for a full 7 days.

### Is an early resumption of a regular diet after laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass safe? [^116R7A1j]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

For LRYGB, the safety of early oral intakes was studied by Bevilacqua et al. In their retrospective study, they included 244 patients who underwent a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and LRYGB. A change in their postoperative diet protocol was implemented with a full liquid diet on POD 0 as compared to the previous POD 1 in their previous protocol. There was no difference in postoperative complications between the 2 groups. The length of hospital stay was shorter in the early feeding group (36.2 h versus 31 h, p < 0.001). Early oral intake did not increase the rate of complications and it was assumed to be safe in bariatric surgery.

Evidence for the safety of diet texture progression after the early postoperative period is rare and lacks consensus with authors proposing a pureed diet period from 14 days to 2 months postoperatively. Several postoperative protocols have been proposed, most of them as part of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program. The ERAS guidelines for bariatric surgery do not report any texture progression timeline after surgery. A pureed diet is frequently put forward by bariatric surgeons for a period that they decide to establish with no clear evidence. That is why our practice changed progressively over time between 2015 and 2020. We compared 3 different recommendations and their impact on patient outcomes. With more than a hundred patients in each group, we reported similar complications rates at 90 days, comparable with international benchmarks of 9% for any complications at 30 days and 5% for severe complications. Severe complications rates (Clavien-Dindo > grade 3a) and mortality were also comparable between the 3 groups. There was no primary leakage from the gastrojejunal anastomosis that might suggest any pressure from the food bolus. A slightly higher readmission rate in the short pureed diet group (6.3%) compared to the other groups (4 and 4.7% in groups 1 and 2 respectively) was found. However, this difference was not statistically significant and could be explained by a reduced length of stay in the short pureed diet group. Our findings support an early postoperative feeding and a pureed diet for no longer than 1 week, given the lack of increased morbidity and mortality at 90 days.

### Allowing normal food at will after major upper gastrointestinal surgery does not increase morbidity: a randomized multicenter trial [^112F5sZD]. Annals of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this trial was to investigate whether a routine of allowing normal food at will increases morbidity after major upper gastrointestinal (GI) surgery.

Summary Background Data

Nil-by-mouth with enteral tube feeding is widely practiced for several days after major upper GI surgery. After other abdominal operations, normal food at will has been shown to be safe and to improve gut function.

Methods

Patients were randomly assigned to a routine of nil-by-mouth and enteral tube feeding by needle-catheter jejunostomy (ETF group) or normal food at will from the first day after major upper GI surgery. Primary end point was rate of major complications and death. Secondary outcomes were minor complications and adverse events, bowel function, and length of stay. All patients were invited to a follow-up at 8 weeks after discharge from the hospital.

Results

Four hundred fifty-three patients who underwent major open upper GI surgery in 5 centers were enrolled between 2001 and 2006. Four hundred forty-seven patients were correctly randomized. Of 227 patients 76 (33.5%) had major complications in the ETF group compared with 62 (28.2%) of 220 patients allowed normal food at will (P = 0.26, 95% CI for the difference in rate from -3.3 to 13.9). In the ETF group, 36 (15.9%) patients were reoperated compared with 29 (13.2%) in the group allowed normal food at will (P = 0.50) and 30-day mortality was 10 (4.4%) of 227 and 11 (5.0%) of 220 patients, respectively (P = 0.83). Time to resumed bowel function was significantly in favor of allowing normal food at will (P = 0.01), as were the total number of major complications, length of stay, and rate of postdischarge complications.

Conclusions

Allowing patients to eat normal food at will from the first day after major upper GI surgery does not increase morbidity compared with traditional care with nil-by-mouth and enteral feeding.

### Perioperative nutritional assessment and management of patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery [^114aWMnD]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Perioperative nutritional support

Perioperative nutritional support is defined as the delivery of nutrition either orally, enterally (EN) or parenterally (PN). Oral administration can be via diet and/or oral nutritional supplements (ONS). The perioperative delivery of ONS, EN and PN has a beneficial impact on postoperative recovery, as supported patients have significantly fewer complications and a shorter hospital stay; therefore, it can decrease morbidity and mortality and lower healthcare costs. Thus, the nutritional status of all patients should be optimized before selective surgery as, if treated appropriately, their postoperative results may be better.

The main features of perioperative care incorporate the nutritional factor into patient management, the avoidance of long periods of preoperative fasting, the post-surgical restart of oral feeding as early as possible, and the early mobilization to facilitate protein synthesis and muscle function.

In 2009, ASPEN and ESPEN developed guidelines for an etiology-based approach to the diagnosis of adult malnutrition in clinical settings (Fig. 2). Any patient found to be at risk of malnutrition should undergo a diagnostic evaluation, including the determination of phenotypic (non-voluntary weight loss, low BMI, low muscle mass) and causative (decreased intake, disease burden/inflammation) factors.

Figure 2
Guidelines developed by ASPEN and ESPEN to diagnose adult malnutrition in clinical settings

The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Society was founded as an international network of experts implementing the evidence-based multimodal ERAS protocol, to provide postoperative guidelines for malnutrition prevention.

According to ESPEN Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, perioperative nutritional support therapy is indicated: (a) in malnourished patients or those who are at dietary risk; (b) if it is anticipated that the patient will be unable to eat for more than 5 days; and (c) if the patient has low oral intake and is not expected to be able to maintain more than 50% of the recommended intake for more than 7 days.

### A study on the effect of nutrition education based on the goal attainment theory on oral nutritional supplementation after colorectal cancer surgery [^116aaQyg]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

A nutrition promotion approach based on the Goal Attainment Theory

Nutrition education based on goal attainment theory includes four steps: interactive assessment, goal attainment plan, implementation measures, and evaluation of effectiveness. After understanding the patient's disease, education level, body mass index, nutrition risk score, and nutrition support pathway through medical records, the nutrition education nurse communicated with the patient and family members at the bedside to understand their degree of mastery of nutrition-related knowledge (cognition of ONS, dietary principles), comprehension, personal eating habits and tastes, appetite status, whether there is nausea and vomiting and other physical discomfort or weight loss, assess the patient's existence problems, formulate health education plans on demand for patients' different age characteristics, cognitive status, preferred nutrition education methods, etc. and select suitable enteral nutrition preparations and brewing methods according to patients' favorite tastes and intestinal adaptations. They instructed patients to use multimedia to watch the nutrition science video made and recorded by nutrition specialist nurses after reviewing literature. The video was reviewed by doctors, nurse managers, and dietitians, and the science video introduced the physiological functions of the stomach and intestines, the effects of surgery on the body, the risks and consequences of malnutrition, the principles and methods of the five-step treatment of nutritional support, the common misconceptions about the diet of tumor patients, the principles and precautions of postoperative diet, what the high-quality high-protein foods are, the dietary precautions for stoma patients, the advantages of oral nutritional supplementation therapy, the method and precautions of ONS brewing, and the indicators of nutritional monitoring in easy-to-understand language. They helped patients and family members understand the importance of nutritional risk assessment and monitoring of nutritional indicators, helped patients and family members gradually develop correct eating habits and dietary principles, the method and frequency of ONS supplementation, and were able to adhere to ONS treatment, with additional ONS supplementation of 400–600 kcal per day in addition to diet. Specialized nurses supervise the patients' eating, the administration of oral nutritional supplements, and follow up on the patients' nutritional indicators for effect evaluation. Patients' dietary types and reasons for substandard caloric intake of ONS were analyzed, and those with abdominal pain and bloating discomfort during enteral nutrition were assessed for enteral nutrition intolerance using the enteral nutrition tolerance scale, while patients were encouraged to elaborate on individual tolerance of nutritional preparations and coping methods; the attainment interactive nursing measures were revised and adjusted, and the process of attainment interaction was re-entered to reinforce nutrition education; the nursing intervention was terminated for those who met the standard. Before discharge, patients or their families joined the "nutrition education group" medical care and patient communication group through QQ and promptly interacted with doctors and clinical nutrition nurses in the "nutrition education group" when they encountered problems. Patients were encouraged to improve their self-monitoring ability, do daily weight monitoring, learn to calculate the amount of calories and protein intake of food and the energy intake of ONS, and record it on the ONS implementation table.

### Early enteral nutrition within 24h of colorectal surgery versus later commencement of feeding for postoperative complications [^114MHrLZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The role of early postoperative enteral nutrition after gastrointestinal surgery is controversial. Traditional management consist of 'nil by mouth', where patients receive fluids followed by solids when tolerated. Although several trials have implicated lower incidence of septic complications and faster wound healing upon early enteral feeding, other trials have shown opposite results. The immediate advantage of caloric intake could be a faster recovery with fewer complications, to be evaluated systematically.

Objectives

To evaluate whether early commencement of postoperative enteral nutrition compared to traditional management (no nutritional supply) is associated with fewer complications in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PUBMED, EMBASE, and LILACS from 1979 (first RCT published) to March 2006. We manually scanned the references from the relevant articles, and consulted primary authors for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCT's) comparing early commencement of feeding (within 24 hours) with no feeding in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery. Early enteral nutrition is defined as all oral intakes (i.e. registered oral intake, supplemented oral feeding) and any kind of tube feeding (gastric, duodenal or jejunal) containing caloric content. No feeding is traditional management, defined as none caloric oral intake or any kind of tube feeding before bowel function. The definition 'no nutrition' includes non caloric placebo and water.

Data Collection and Analysis

The three authors independently assessed the identified trials, and extracted the relevant data using a specifically developed data extraction sheet. Primary end points of interest were: Wound infections and intraabdominal abscesses, postoperative complications such as acute myocardial infarction, postoperative thrombosis or pneumonia, anastomotic leakages, mortality, length of hospital stay, and significant adverse effects. We combined data to estimate the common relative risk of postoperative complications, and calculated the associated 95% confidence intervals. For analysis, we used fixed effects model (risk ratios to summarise the treatment effect) whenever feasible. The treatment effect on length of stay was estimated using effect size (presented as mean ± SD). Some outcomes were not analysed but presented in a descriptive way. We used a random effects model to estimate overall risk ratio and effect size.

Main Results

We identified thirteen randomised controlled trials, with a total of 1173 patients, all undergoing gastrointestinal surgery. Individual clinical complications failed to reach statistical significance, but the direction of effect indicates that earlier feeding may reduce the risk of post surgical complications. Mortality was the only outcome showing a significant benefit, but not necessarily associated with early commencement of feeding, as the reported cause of death was anastomotic leakage, reoperation, and acute myocardial infarction.

Authors' Conclusions

Although non-significant results, there is no obvious advantage in keeping patients 'nil by mouth' following gastrointestinal surgery, and this review support the notion on early commencement of enteral feeding.

### What influences emergency general surgeons' treatment preferences for patients requiring nutritional support? A discrete choice experiment [^112jidpn]. Colorectal Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Emergency general surgery (EGS) patients may be malnourished or can become so during their hospital admission. Malnutrition is associated with poor surgical outcomes. It can be considered a modifiable risk factor if appropriate and adequate nutritional support is initiated.

Previous work has shown that there are several approaches used by surgeons to identify malnourished EGS patients, and these patients may benefit from nutritional support. Guidelines exist regarding initiation and timing of nutritional support, but they lack consistency and focus on the elective setting. The mantra that oral intake is preferred to enteral tube feeding, which is preferred to parenteral nutrition (PN), prevails. Nutritional support is recommended for malnourished patients or those at risk of malnutrition within 5 days of admission according to the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), although no information is given regarding timing pre‐ or post‐surgery. The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) recommend nutritional support in patients who will be unable to eat for > 5 days perioperatively or those who cannot maintain > 50% recommended intake for > 7 days. PN can be initiated as soon as possible if there is a contraindication for enteral tube feeding, such as in intestinal obstruction. The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) recognise that starting PN preoperatively in EGS patients is unlikely to be possible and so shortening the postoperative interval of PN can be considered, but only if its duration is likely to be longer than 7 days. Additionally, ESPEN and ASPEN recommend the initiation of 'early enteral nutrition' (within 24–48 h) in critically unwell patients, although it could be delayed for 1 week if not high risk. These differences in guidelines may contribute to the lack of consensus in provision of nutritional support regarding timing, preferred route of administration and total energy targets worldwide.

On recognising that a patient may be malnourished, surgeons may then refer the patient to a nutritional support team or dietitian for further assessment with a view to starting nutritional support. However, it is unknown what drives surgeons' decision making to start nutritional support, and to what extent factors such as surgeon seniority or experience of intestinal failure (IF) influence the decision making process.

### Early oral versus "traditional" postoperative feeding in gynecologic oncology patients undergoing intestinal resection: a randomized controlled trial [^112L8RwX]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A randomized controlled trial was performed to assess the outcome of early oral postoperative feeding (EOF) compared with traditional oral feeding (TOF) in gynecologic oncology patients undergoing laparotomy with associated intestinal resection.

Methods

Patients aged 18–75 years, undergoing elective laparotomy, and with preoperative diagnosis of gynecologic malignancy, were eligible. Exclusion criteria included infectious conditions, intestinal obstruction, severe malnutrition, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score ≥ 4, and postoperative stay in the intensive care unit lasting > 24 h. Patients allocated to EOF received liquid diet in the first postoperative day and then regular diet. Patients received traditional feeding scheme until resolution of postoperative ileus to start liquid diet. The primary end-point of the trial was length of hospital stay.

Results

Between January 1st, 2007 and March 15th, 2008, 40 patients were randomized to receive either EOF or TOF. Hospital stay in patients who received EOF (n = 18) was 6.9 days versus 9.1 days in the TOF group (n = 22) (P = 0.022). Requirements for analgesic and antiemetic drugs, intensity of pain, intestinal function recovery, mean levels of postoperative satisfaction, postoperative complications, and quality-of-life scores did not differ between the two groups.

Conclusion

Early resumption of oral intake is feasible and safe in gynecologic oncology patients undergoing intestinal resection as part of a planned surgical procedure. Moreover, significant reduction in length of hospital stay was demonstrated.

### Prospective, randomized, controlled trial between a pathway of controlled rehabilitation with early ambulation and diet and traditional postoperative care after laparotomy and intestinal resection [^114YJrv2]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2003). Low credibility.

Introduction

In an era of dwindling hospital resources and increasing medical costs, safe reduction in postoperative stay has become a major focus to optimize utilization of healthcare resources. Although several protocols have been reported to reduce postoperative stay, no Level I evidence exists for their use in routine clinical practice.

Methods

Sixty-four patients undergoing laparotomy and intestinal or rectal resection were randomly assigned to a pathway of controlled rehabilitation with early ambulation and diet or to traditional postoperative care. Time to discharge from hospital, complication and readmission rates, pain level, quality of life, and patient satisfaction scores were determined at the time of discharge and at 10 and 30 days after surgery. Subgroups were defined to evaluate those who derived the optimal benefit from the protocol.

Results

Pathway patients spent less total time in the hospital after surgery (5.4 vs. 7.1 days; P = 0.02) and less time in the hospital during the primary admission than traditional patients. Patients younger than 70 years old had greater benefits than the overall study group (5 vs. 7.1 days; P = 0.01). Patients treated by surgeons with the most experience with the pathway spent significantly less time in the hospital than did those whose surgeons were less experienced with the pathway (P = 0.01). There was no difference between pathway and traditional patients for readmission or complication rates, pain score, quality of life after surgery, or overall satisfaction with the hospital stay.

Conclusions

Patients scheduled for a laparotomy and major intestinal or rectal resection are suitable for management by a pathway of controlled rehabilitation with early ambulation and diet. Pathway patients have a shorter hospital stay, with no adverse effect on patient satisfaction, pain scores, or complication rates. Patients younger than 70 years of age derive the optimal benefit, and increased surgeon experience improves outcome.

### A protocol for rehabilitating the bypassed limb prior to reversal of jejunoileal bypass [^114jLJWw]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

We recommend progressive refeeding of the atrophic limb in five steps (Fig. 1). We believe that early enteral infusion of 5% glucose is safe for the extremely atrophic mucosa and is useful to test the patency of the loop after jejunostomy placement. The transition to an isocaloric formula was successful in both cases. The enteral flow rate should be gradually increased (10–20 ml/h/day) according to individual digestive tolerance. Nutrition, together with mechanical stimuli, allows to regain the integrity of the bowel after several months. The enteral absorption recovery was evident after JIB reversal in both patients who regained and stabilized their weight and corrected their micronutrient deficiencies. The two patients reported a progressive increase in their abdominal girth, although this could not be documented by objective measurements. This observation illustrates intestinal adaptation despite the extremely long mucosal inactivity.

Exclusion of the atrophic limb also affects pancreatic enzyme action resulting in steatorrhea (see Patient 1). In this case, semi-elemental formula, containing peptides and medium-chain triglycerides, should be tested. Moreover, hydration of the atrophic limb must be adapted to prevent digestive transit disorders.

In summary, this progressive refeeding protocol of the excluded limb via feeding enterostomy prior to surgery is an essential component for successful JIB reversal.

### Short bowel syndrome [^113Xc3Bx]. World Journal of Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

The short bowel syndrome is a symptom complex that occurs in adults who have less than 200 cm of jejunum-ileum remaining after intestinal resection. Similar symptoms are observed in infants and children following massive bowel resection or congenital anomalies and in individuals with longer segments of intestine with severe mucosal disease. Initial care should focus on a thorough excision of nonviable bowel, an exact measurement of the remaining viable bowel, placing all intestine in continuity at the initial or subsequent operation, and controlling initial food intake. With time, adaptation of the remnant intestine occurs, and absorptive function may be maximized by enhancing the enteral diet and minimizing parenteral nutrition. Growth factors and specialized nutrients may also enhance this process. Intestinal transplantation should be considered in selected individuals with the short bowel syndrome who fail intestinal rehabilitation protocols.

### Impact of varied feeding protocols on gastrointestinal function recovery in the early postoperative period following repeat cesarean section: a randomized controlled trial [^117KDgjn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, on the basis of early fluid intake in all three groups, experimental group A and B (pureed diet intake after 6 h, regular diet after passing flatus) both showed the recovery time of postoperative bowel sound, the first exhaust time and the first defecation time were shorter than that of the control group (pureed diet intake after first flatus, regular diet after defecation). Post-operative ileus is a common and troublesome issue following abdominal surgery, few effective therapies for it exist, most current preventative strategies are non-specific and act by limiting opiate use and avoiding fluid overload, therefore, our study also focused on whether early eating and drinking increased intestinal burden and adverse reactions, and the results showed that it did not, there was no significant differences were observed between the experimental groups and the control group concerning nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, or intestinal obstruction. This lack of significant difference may be attributed to the notion that the resumption of food intake does not hinge on the inevitability of flatus and defecation. Small bowel function typically recovers within 12 ~ 24 h postoperatively, allowing patients to tolerate oral feeding without experiencing abdominal pain, distension, or vomiting. These indicators collectively signify the restoration of gastrointestinal function. Therefore, our study provides evidence that the two early feeding protocols following repeat cesarean delivery is both safe and effective. We did not observe an increase in gastrointestinal adverse events but also actively promotes the recovery of gastrointestinal function. This result is similar to a recent meta-analysis.

### Factors associated with diet failure after colon cancer surgery [^113ryops]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the introduction of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS), early diet after surgery has been emphasized and clinical outcomes have improved, though vomiting has been reported frequently. We defined diet failure based on clinical manifestation and images after colon cancer surgery and attempted to analyze underlying risk factors by comparing the early diet group with the conventional diet group.

Methods

All consecutive patients underwent colectomy with curative intent at a single institution between August 2015 and July 2017. The early diet group was started on soft diet on the second day after surgery, while the conventional group started the same after flatulence. The primary outcome was the difference in the incidence of diet failure between the two groups. Secondary outcomes were analyzed to determine risk factors for diet failure and readmission due to ileus.

Results

Overall, 293 patients were included in the conventional diet group and 231 in the early diet group. There were no significant differences between the two groups, except for shorter hospital stays in the early diet group (median 8 days, p < 0.001). A total of 46 patients (early diet, n = 20; conventional diet, n = 26, p = 1.000) had diet failure. Multivariate analysis showed that operation time (odds ratio [OR] 1.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33–2.32) and side-to-side anastomosis compared with the end-to-end method (OR 4.41, 95% CI 2.10–9.24) were independent risk factors for diet failure. Sixteen patients were readmitted due to ileus that occurred within 2 months after surgical operation. Diet resumption time was not a risk factor for both diet failure and ileus.

Conclusions

Early diet resumption does not increase diet failure and can reduce hospital stay. Anastomosis and operation time may be related to diet failure. Our study suggests that evaluation of surgical factors is important for postoperative recovery, and well-designed follow-up studies are needed.

Oral nutritional supplementation in malnourished patients — Oral nutritional supplementation is recommended in malnourished patients before elective colorectal surgery (weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B). In malnourished patients planning elective GI surgery, supplementation targeting a protein intake of 1.2 to 1.5 g/kg/d for a period of 1 to 2 weeks has been associated with reduced postoperative complications. The efficacy of immunonutrition remains controversial, although meta-analyses have demonstrated reduced complications, infectious complications, and shortened LOS with preoperative immunonutrition, while other studies have reported conflicting results depending on malnourishment status, industry support, and control type.

### Dietary excess regulates absorption and surface of gut epithelium through intestinal PPAR α [^1138GnDV]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Mucosa thickening is a hallmark of intestinal adaptations that follow intestinal resection. It is, at the molecular level, a poorly understood process that includes bowel lengthening, growth of villi, and induction of transporter expression. The PPARα-driven mechanism of villus growth could explain why fatty acids such as palmitate or linoleate are the most effective dietary therapy that promotes mucosa re-growth after bowel resection, a process that can be further potentiated by feeding prostaglandins. Fatty acids and eicosanoids are strong inducers of PPARα. Conversely, disruption of PPARα and fatty acid oxidation is found in celiac disease, a condition characterized by shortened villi and malabsorption.

Hepatic steatosis and increased adiposity are major risk factors for the development of metabolic syndrome. PPARα ablation in the liver and adipose tissue facilitates fat accumulation in these tissues by reducing levels of fatty acid oxidation. Unexpectedly, Ppara deletion in the intestine lowers fat uptake in the liver and fat. Intestinal lipid droplet formation and trafficking regulated by PPARα, therefore, represent important rate-limiting steps in systemic lipid metabolism. Inhibition of this process moderates the excursions of plasma triglycerides after a lipid-rich meal. If pharmacological inhibition of PPARα or lipid droplet formation could be limited to intestines, this would serve as an option for reducing fat absorption and hyperlipidaemia, but also total caloric uptake. As a whole, the remarkable gut plasticity that permits gut and villi to be shrunk or enlarged is, therefore, an asset as a reversible alternative to gastric bypass surgery, or other interventions that aim at reducing body weight gain and obesity-related complications.

### Early versus delayed oral feeding after major gynaecologic surgery [^115zpFU2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated and expanded version of the original Cochrane review, first published in 2014. Postoperative oral intake is traditionally withheld after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery until the return of bowel function. The concern is that early oral intake will result in vomiting and severe paralytic ileus, with subsequent aspiration pneumonia, wound dehiscence, and anastomotic leakage. However, clinical studies suggest that there may be benefits from early postoperative oral intake. Currently, gynaecologic surgery can be performed through various routes: open abdominal, vaginal, laparoscopic, robotic, or a combination. In this version, we included women undergoing major gynaecologic surgery through all of these routes, either alone or in combination.

Objectives

To assess the effects of early versus delayed (traditional) initiation of oral intake of food and fluids after major gynaecologic surgery.

Search Methods

On 13 June 2023, we searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the citation lists of relevant publications, and two trial registries. We also contacted experts in the field for any additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effect of early versus delayed initiation of oral intake of food and fluids after major gynaecologic surgery, performed by abdominal, vaginal, laparoscopic, and robotic approaches. Early feeding was defined as oral intake of fluids or food within 24 hours post-surgery, regardless of the return of bowel function. Delayed feeding was defined as oral intake after 24 hours post-surgery, and only after signs of postoperative ileus resolution. Primary outcomes were: postoperative ileus, nausea, vomiting, cramping, abdominal pain, bloating, abdominal distension, need for postoperative nasogastric tube, time to the presence of bowel sounds, time to the first passage of flatus, time to the first passage of stool, time to the start of a regular diet, and length of postoperative hospital stay. Secondary outcomes were: infectious complications, wound complications, deep venous thrombosis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, satisfaction, and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted the data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous data. We examined continuous data using the mean difference (MD) and a 95% CI. We tested for heterogeneity between the results of different studies using a forest plot of the meta-analysis, the statistical tests of homogeneity of 2 x 2 tables, and the I² value. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE methods.

Main Results

We included seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs), randomising 902 women. We are uncertain whether early feeding compared to delayed feeding has an effect on postoperative ileus (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.16; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 418 women; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether early feeding affects nausea or vomiting, or both (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.33; I² = 67%; random-effects model; 6 studies, 742 women; very low-certainty evidence); nausea (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.51 to 3.03; I² = 74%; 3 studies, 453 women; low-certainty evidence); vomiting (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.32; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 559 women; low-certainty evidence), abdominal distension (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.31; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 559 women; low-certainty evidence); need for postoperative nasogastric tube placement (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.55; 3 studies, 453 women; low-certainty evidence); or time to the presence of bowel sounds (MD -0.20 days, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.06; I² = 71%; random-effects model; 3 studies, 477 women; low-certainty evidence). There is probably no difference between the two feeding protocols for the onset of flatus (MD -0.11 days, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.02; I² = 9%; 5 studies, 702 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Early feeding probably results in a slight reduction in the time to the first passage of stool (MD -0.18 days, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.04; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 507 women; moderate-certainty evidence), and may lead to a slightly sooner resumption of a solid diet (MD -1.10 days, 95% CI -1.79 to -0.41; I² = 97%; random-effects model; 3 studies, 420 women; low-certainty evidence). Hospital stay may be slightly shorter in the early feeding group (MD -0.66 days, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.15; I² = 77%; random-effects model; 5 studies, 603 women; low-certainty evidence). The effect of the two feeding protocols on febrile morbidity is uncertain (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.22; I² = 47%; 3 studies, 453 women; low-certainty evidence). However, infectious complications are probably less common in women with early feeding (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.73; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 183 women; moderate-certainty evidence). There may be no difference between the two feeding protocols for wound complications (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.35; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 474 women; low-certainty evidence), or pneumonia (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.73; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 434 women; low-certainty evidence). Two studies measured participant satisfaction and quality of life. One study found satisfaction was probably higher in the early feeding group, while the other study found no difference. Neither study found a significant difference between the groups for quality of life (P > 0.05).

Authors' Conclusions

Despite some uncertainty, there is no evidence to indicate harmful effects of early feeding following major gynaecologic surgery, measured as postoperative ileus, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal distension. The potential benefits of early feeding include a slightly faster initiation of bowel movements, a slightly sooner resumption of a solid diet, a slightly shorter hospital stay, a lower rate of infectious complications, and a higher level of satisfaction.

### Early postoperative progression to solid foods is safe after roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^115pPYCG]. Obesity Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Even though admission time is reduced with the implementation of various enhanced recovery protocols, many clinics still instruct patients after weight loss surgery to maintain a fluid or minced-food diet for at least 2 weeks postoperatively. We reasoned that with adequate preoperative instructions, including adequate chewing of all foods, early progression to solid foods would not increase the risk of (gastro)enterostomy leakage.

Methods

In December 2010, a new dietary protocol was implemented for all patients undergoing a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, allowing progression to solid foods from 12 h postprocedure onwards. All patients received thorough preoperative eating instructions and eating awareness counselling from a qualified dietician and psychologist. A retrospective study was performed of 936 patients who underwent a primary or redo laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between January 2011 and June 2014 in our hospital. All 30-day complications, readmissions and reoperations were noted.

Results

No 30-day loss to follow-up occurred. Overall 30-day complication rate was 9.4%, with gastrointestinal leakage occurring in only 0.6%. A low threshold for readmission was maintained due to the short mean admission time of 1.87 days. Readmission rate was 4.8% — mainly for observation of postoperative pain — and 1.8% of our patients required reoperation within 30 days. Mortality was 0.1%. Our results are comparable to results published by other Dutch centres advocating conventional diets, showing no increase in leakage or other complications.

Conclusions

We conclude that early progression to solid foods after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery is a feasible alternative as no increase in complications is observed.

Preadmission Nutrition and Bowel Preparation

3. Clear liquids may be continued up to 2 hours before general anesthesia. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A.

Drinking clear fluids up to 2 hours before induction of anesthesia, according to data from multiple RCTs, is safe and improves patients' sense of well-being. – The same RCTs have also reported that ingesting clear liquids within 2 to 4 hours of surgery versus > 4 hours is associated with smaller gastric volumes and higher gastric pH at the time of surgery. The current practice guidelines of both the ASA and the European Society of Anesthesiology support this recommendation. –

4. Carbohydrate loading should be encouraged before surgery in patients without diabetese. Grade of recommendation: weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B.

The use of carbohydrate-rich beverages should be encouraged to attenuate insulin resistance induced by surgery and starvation. – The focus is not on avoiding glycogen depletion but rather on converting the patient from a fasting state to a fed state to impact insulin resistance. A 2014 Cochrane review of 27 international trials, including 1976 patients undergoing elective operations, concluded that carbohydrate loading was associated with a 0.3-day reduction in length of hospital stay compared with placebo or fasting (95% CI, 0.56–0.0) but no difference was found in overall perioperative complications. Of note, most beverages consumed in these studies contained complex carbohydrates (eg, maltodextrin) as opposed to the monosaccharides (eg, fructose) or disaccharides (eg, sucrose) found in fruit juice or sports drinks. Another meta-analysis of 21 randomized studies including 1685 patients showed no overall difference in LOS; however, the subgroup of patients undergoing major abdominal surgery had a shorter LOS associated with carbohydrate loading (mean difference –1.08 d; 95% CI, –1.87 to –0.29; p = 0.007). Another meta-analysis including 43 RCTs with 3110 elective surgery patients found that high-dose carbohydrate loading (≥ 45 g) was associated with a reduced length of hospital stay compared to fasting (–1.7 d; 95% CI, –3.2 to –0.1) or placebo/water (–1.4 d; 95% CI, –2.7 to –0.1; p < 0.05), but there were no differences in complication rates or other secondary end points. This recommendation applies to patients without diabetes because patients with diabetes were not included in the trials.

### Early enteral nutrition within 24 hours of lower gastrointestinal surgery versus later commencement for length of hospital stay and postoperative complications [^1158MgM6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an update of the review last published in 2011. It focuses on early postoperative enteral nutrition after lower gastrointestinal surgery. Traditional management consisted of 'nil by mouth', where patients receive fluids followed by solids after bowel function has returned. Although several trials have reported lower incidence of infectious complications and faster wound healing upon early feeding, other trials have shown no effect. The immediate advantage of energy intake (carbohydrates, protein or fat) could enhance recovery with fewer complications, and this warrants a systematic evaluation.

Objectives

To evaluate whether early commencement of postoperative enteral nutrition (within 24 hours), oral intake and any kind of tube feeding (gastric, duodenal or jejunal), compared with traditional management (delayed nutritional supply) is associated with a shorter length of hospital stay (LoS), fewer complications, mortality and adverse events in patients undergoing lower gastrointestinal surgery (distal to the ligament of Treitz).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library 2017, issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to 15 November 2017), Ovid Embase (1974 to 15 November 2017). We also searched for ongoing trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (15 November 2017). We handsearched reference lists of identified studies and previous systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing early commencement of enteral nutrition (within 24 hours) with no feeding in adult participants undergoing lower gastrointestinal surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study quality using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool tailored to this review and extracted data. Data analyses were conducted according to the Cochrane recommendations. We rated the quality of evidence according to GRADE. Primary outcomes were LoS and postoperative complications (wound infections, intraabdominal abscesses, anastomotic dehiscence, pneumonia). Secondary outcomes were: mortality, adverse events (nausea, vomiting), and quality of life (QoL). LoS was estimated using mean difference (MD (presented as mean ± SD). For other outcomes we estimated the common risk ratio (RR) and calculated the associated 95% confidence intervals. For analysis, we used an inverse-variance random-effects model for the primary outcome (LoS) and Mantel-Haenszel random-effects models for the secondary outcomes. We also performed Trial Sequential Analyses (TSA).

Main Results

We identified 17 RCTs with 1437 participants undergoing lower gastrointestinal surgery. Most studies were at high or unclear risk of bias in two or more domains. Six studies were judged as having low risk of selection bias for random sequence generation and insufficient details were provided for judgement on allocation concealment in all 17 studies. With regards to performance and deception bias; 14 studies reported no attempt to blind participants and blinding of personnel was not discussed either. Only one study was judged as low risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessor. With regards to incomplete outcome data, three studies were judged to be at high risk because they had more than 10% difference in missing data between groups. For selective reporting, nine studies were judged as unclear as protocols were not provided and eight studies had issues with either missing data or incomplete reporting of results.LOS was reported in 16 studies (1346 participants). The mean LoS ranged from four days to 16 days in the early feeding groups and from 6.6 days to 23.5 days in the control groups. Mean difference (MD) in LoS was 1.95 (95% CI, -2.99 to -0.91, P < 0.001) days shorter in the early feeding group. However, there was substantial heterogeneity between included studies (I 2 = 81, %, Chi 2 = 78.98, P < 0.00001), thus the overall quality of evidence for LoS is low. These results were confirmed by the TSA showing that the cumulative Z-curve crossed the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit. We found no differences in the incidence of postoperative complications: wound infection (12 studies, 1181 participants, RR 0.99, 95%CI 0.64 to 1.52, very low-quality evidence), intraabdominal abscesses (6 studies, 554 participants, RR 1.00, 95%CI 0.26 to 3.80, low-quality evidence), anastomotic leakage/dehiscence (13 studies, 1232 participants, RR 0.78, 95%CI 0.38 to 1.61, low-quality evidence; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 100), and pneumonia (10 studies, 954 participants, RR 0.88, 95%CI 0.32 to 2.42, low-quality evidence; NNTB = 333). Mortality was reported in 12 studies (1179 participants), and showed no between-group differences (RR = 0.56, 95%CI, 0.21 to 1.52, P = 0.26, I² = 0%, Chi 2 = 3.08, P = 0.96, low-quality evidence). The most commonly reported cause of death was anastomotic leakage, sepsis and acute myocardial infarction. Seven studies (613 participants) reported vomiting (RR 1.23, 95%CI, 0.96 to 1.58, P = 0.10, I² = 0%, Chi 2 = 4.98, P = 0.55, low-quality evidence; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 19), and two studies (118 participants) reported nausea (RR 0.95, 0.71 to 1.26, low-quality evidence). Four studies reported combined nausea and vomiting (RR 0.94, 95%CI 0.51 to 1.74, very low-quality evidence). One study reported QoL assessment; the scores did not differ between groups at 30 days after discharge on either QoL scale EORTC QLQ-C30 or EORTC QlQ-OV28 (very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This review suggests that early enteral feeding may lead to a reduced postoperative LoS, however cautious interpretation must be taken due to substantial heterogeneity and low-quality evidence. For all other outcomes (postoperative complications, mortality, adverse events, and QoL) the findings are inconclusive, and further trials are justified to enhance the understanding of early feeding for these. In this updated review, only a few additional studies have been included, and these were small and of poor quality. To improve the evidence, future trials should address quality issues and focus on clearly defining and measuring postoperative complications to allow for better comparison between studies. However due to the introduction of fast track protocols which already include an early feeding component, future trials may be challenging. A more feasible trial may be to investigate the effect of differing postoperative energy intake regimens on relevant outcomes.

### Sleep deprivation and starvation in hospitalised patients: how medical care can harm patients [^111tQoC4]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2016). Medium credibility.

Rethinking nutrition

Malnutrition affects as many as a third to a half of all hospitalised patients and can lead to chronic inflammatory processes, muscle breakdown and organ damage. Many patients are malnourished to begin with due to their illness and multiple comorbidities, which can be compounded by wound healing and disruptions in food intake following surgery. A study of US national administrative claims data showed that only 3% of adult hospital admissions include a diagnosis of malnutrition, suggesting that it remains under-recognised. Few patients receive nutritional consults despite evidence that malnutrition leads to longer length of stay, mortality and increased risk of other adverse events, such as falls. Another barrier is the notoriously poor-quality food served at hospitals, representing a highly processed food offering from inexpensive food suppliers. Hospitals have an opportunity to promote healthy foods and improve nutrition by serving better food. Some have taken the lead by serving local whole foods that are organic and achieve a broad range of nutritional goals.

In some cases, malnutrition can be stemmed by adopting standardised preoperative protocols. The American Society of Anesthesiologists recommends avoiding extended preoperative fasting and endorses clear liquids up to 2 h before surgery, but adoption of this practice has been slow. Limiting preoperative fasting is an essential component of Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) protocols, which aim to restore physiological function and facilitate recovery. The evidence shows that needless prolongation of fasting after gastrointestinal surgery actually increases the risk of infection and does not reduce the risk of complications such as anastomotic dehiscence. Other components of ERAS are summarised in the box 1. At our institution, implementing the comprehensive ERAS protocol has led to a significant reduction in postoperative complications, hospital length of stay and improved patient satisfaction.

### Patient education series: exploratory laparotomy [^116V9BM5]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Surgical options

Typically, if your surgeon is recommending an exploratory laparotomy, you have failed more conservative (non-operative) options. Conservative options may include a nasogastric tube (tube from the nose into the stomach) for a bowel obstruction, antibiotics for an infection, and blood if you are bleeding from a trauma. Sometimes the surgeon may offer an exploratory laparoscopy, which involves making a small incision (approximately 1 cm) and using a camera to examine the abdomen. In some cases, the surgeon may begin with a laparoscopy, but given the findings, must change to a laparotomy. If the surgeon changes to a laparotomy, this is to allow for the safest surgery possible.

Care after treatment

After an exploratory laparotomy, you may have a nasogastric tube or feeding tube depending on the reason for the surgery. You will likely not be able to eat right away; this is so your intestines can recover from the surgery. During the surgery, the surgeon has touched and moved your intestines. This, combined with anesthesia, can make the intestines slow down. Waiting until there is some bowel function (passing gas or having a bowel movement) ensures the intestines are moving and can tolerate food. Burping or belching after surgery means the intestines are not "awake" yet, and eating will increase the likelihood of becoming nauseous or starting to vomit. Once you are allowed to eat, the diet will begin with clear liquids and then increase to regular food as the surgeon sees fit.

You will have medication for pain control. During the surgery, the strength layer of the abdominal wall was cut and then put back together. This causes pain. The surgery team will have a variety of pain medications to help with different sources of pain. You will also have intravenous fluid in your intravenous line, and electrolytes will be replaced as needed to help you recover faster. You will be given a blood-thinning medication called heparin or enoxaparin to help prevent blood clots. This medication is injected into the skin multiple times a day.

You will be encouraged to move after surgery. This includes sitting on the end of the bed, walking, and sitting in a chair. Moving after surgery prevents complications, including pneumonia and ileus (slowing of the intestines).

Some of your existing medications will be held, and others will be started. This all depends on the type of medication you are on and what was done in the surgery. If you have diabetes, your blood glucose will be tested and insulin given if needed.

### Mechanism of metabolic advantages after bariatric surgery: it's all gastrointestinal factors versus it's all food restriction [^117QNVr4]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Figure 1
In the left panel, the normal GI anatomy is shown. In the right panel, the anatomy after RYGB is shown. The green arrow indicates the passage of nutrients from the gastric pouch directly to the distal part of the jejunum (through the alimentary limb). The blue arrow indicates the passage of gastric, pancreatic, and bile fluids to jejunum (through the secretory limb).

The observed remission of type 2 diabetes before any significant weight loss has taken place suggests that the operation itself, including rerouting of ingested food (bypassing significant parts of the small intestine) and digestive fluids, changes handling of nutrients. In support of this theory, the purely restrictive procedure of gastric banding, which gives rise to long-term metabolic advantages associated with weight loss, has no acute effect on postprandial glucose metabolism (or gut hormones). Rerouting of mainly undigested food from the stomach directly into the distal part of the small intestine (ileum) after RYGB (Fig. 1) directly stimulates nutrient-sensing enteroendocrine cells, with no stimulation in the bypassed proximal small intestine. In line with this, RYGB-induced changes in gut endocrinology with the potential to improve overeating and compromised glucose homeostasis include increased secretion of the incretin (insulinotropic) hormone glucagon-like peptide(GLP)-1 and the anorexic hormones peptide YY and oxyntomodulin from L cells (with a high density in the distal small intestine). In addition to the strong but strictly glucose-dependent insulinotropic effect of GLP-1, the hormone has also been shown to enhance important steps of insulin biosynthesis and gene transcription, upregulate genes for the cellular machinery involved in insulin secretion, stimulate β-cell proliferation, enhance the differentiation of new β-cells from pancreatic progenitor cells, reduce apoptosis of β-cells, inhibit pancreatic glucagon secretion, and reduce appetite and gastrointestinal motility. Observation of these powerful effects led to the development of GLP-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Fasting plasma GLP-1 levels have consistently been shown to be preserved after bariatric surgery, whereas postprandial secretion increases by several fold (∼20) after operations that entail rerouting of nutrients to the lower part of the small intestine (e.g. RYGB). In line with this, the incretin effect, i.e. the greater insulin secretion in response to an oral glucose stimulus compared with an isoglycemic intravenous glucose stimulus, was shown to increase (by approximately fivefold) in patients with type 2 diabetes 4 weeks after RYGB (no increase in incretin effect was observed in a group of matched patients obtaining weight loss via caloric restriction).

### Intermittent vs. continuous: a comparative narrative review of enteral and parenteral nutrition support strategies in the perioperative setting [^114GWH2U]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Enteral and parenteral nutrition are two primary methods of nutritional support in clinical settings. Their administration modes-continuous or intermittent-have garnered increasing attention in recent research. Continuous enteral and parenteral nutrition provide steady metabolic support over extended periods, particularly beneficial for critically ill patients or those with high nutritional demands. Conversely, intermittent feeding, delivered at scheduled intervals, simulates natural eating patterns and may offer advantages in gastrointestinal function and metabolic regulation. Recent studies indicate notable differences between continuous and intermittent feeding in perioperative patients, especially regarding metabolic control, gastrointestinal tolerance, immune function, and postoperative complications. Continuous feeding simplifies clinical management through stable nutrient delivery but may increase the risks of metabolic overload, liver dysfunction, and gastrointestinal intolerance. In contrast, intermittent feeding promotes recovery of gastrointestinal function and potentially reduces the risk of infections and other postoperative complications. This review aims to assess the clinical outcomes of continuous versus intermittent enteral and parenteral nutrition in perioperative patients, with a primary focus on gastrointestinal surgery populations (where gut-specific mechanisms are most critical). By evaluating these feeding strategies in terms of postoperative complications, recovery, metabolic regulation, and quality of life, we seek to provide evidence-based recommendations for optimizing perioperative nutritional care and improving patient outcomes.

### ASPEN definitions in pediatric intestinal failure [^1135mqFr]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Enteral support in pediatric intestinal failure — initiation and advancement: Enteral support may be initiated anytime after surgery, typically ranging from 5 days to 2 weeks, and continuous enteral nutrition (EN) is the preferred method over bolus administration; if possible, a combination of oral feedings and continuous EN is recommended. The rate at which EN is advanced should be individualized with consideration of volume/stoma/ostomy output, consistency of stool output, vomiting, and/or abdominal distension, and goal stool output should be limited to 40–50 mL/kg/day. Postsurgical feeding advancement protocols should be implemented, and recent studies have found that implementation of postoperative feeding guidelines reduce the risk of IF-associated liver disease; the working group encourages the use of institution-specific standardized feeding protocols in postsurgical neonates. For scope context, a PubMed search from January 1970 to March 2019 reviewed 107 articles, 12 included.

### Core outcome set for clinical studies of postoperative ileus after intestinal surgery [^116cqhhN]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Ethics and governance

Research ethics approval was confirmed by the University of Sheffield Ethics Committee on 27 September 2019. A collaborative steering committee was convened with representation from Asia, Australasia, Europe, and North America, and included medical, allied healthcare professional, and patient investigators. The study was registered with the COMET Initiative and the protocol was reported previously. An extended description of the methods and results is provided in Appendix S1. An abridged summary is reported here.

Scope and definitions

The scope of the core outcome set was defined according to the Core Outcome Set — Standards for Development recommendations. The health condition was postoperative ileus; the population was adult patients undergoing intestinal surgery for any indication; and the setting was clinical studies assessing the effectiveness of a clinical intervention to reduce ileus. Intestinal surgery was considered to represent any intra-abdominal procedure via any surgical approach on the intestinal tract with or without formation of a stoma.

Participants

Stakeholder representation was designed to reflect the multidisciplinary management of postoperative ileus as well as the challenge it presents on an international scale. Three key stakeholder panels were defined: patients with previous experience of intestinal surgery, allied healthcare professionals (including nurses and dietitians), and medical professionals (including abdominal surgeons and perioperative clinicians). Medical and allied healthcare professionals were considered as two separate panels throughout the study to ensure that potentially diverging perspectives were captured. During each phase of the study, participants were recruited via national and international organizations as well as through social media.

### Novel nutrition strategies to enhance recovery after surgery [^113j2CzR]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Surgery and traumatic injury set off a cascade of metabolic changes that are becoming better understood. Recently, strategies and protocols have been developed for optimizing outcomes, and this has yielded beneficial results. This brief review evaluates three specific nutrition or metabolic interventions in the postoperative setting that attempt to optimize outcomes. We limited this to three subspecialty areas including oncologic surgery, orthopedic surgery, and cardiac surgery. These agents included fish oils, factors to prevent dysbiosis, and resistance exercise and its role in enhancing protein update. Where these novel agents fit into the basic tenets of postoperative nutrition interventions does not change the narrative: deliver graduated early enteral feeding to attenuate the metabolic response to surgical stress, maintain the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier, use immune/metabolic modulation to enhance immune response while attenuating excessive inflammation, and support the microbiome.

### When is enteral nutrition indicated? [^113Zi7QE]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Enteral nutrition (EN) indications and perioperative use in oncology emphasize using EN when the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is functional, with specific cautions and timing. There is no confirmed effect of EN on stimulating tumor growth. If the gut is functional and no other contraindications exist, EN should be the first line of nutrition intervention, and for patients requiring nutrition support, EN is preferred; benefits of EN include reduced infection rates in some literature, ease of administration, and savings on associated costs. Routine use of EN during chemotherapy is not recommended. Malnourished patients with GI cancer are at high risk for morbidity, mortality, and decreased efficacy of treatment, and surgical cancer treatments often predispose a patient to malnutrition, especially when the GI tract is manipulated. ASPEN and the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) guidelines do encourage the use of nutrition support via the enteral route for moderately or severely malnourished patients in the 7–14 days leading up to surgery, and in both undernourished and well-nourished patients, nutrition support therapy should be initiated if anticipated oral intake will be insufficient for > 7 days following surgery. The enteral route is preferred when the GI tract is functional and there are no contraindications, and the detrimental consequences of withholding nutrition support to treat malnutrition far outweigh theoretical risks of tumor promotion.

### Early versus delayed (traditional) oral fluids and food for reducing complications after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery [^1117tqwt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Traditionally postoperative oral intake is withheld until the return of bowel function. There has been concern that early oral intake would result in vomiting and severe paralytic ileus with subsequent aspiration pneumonia, wound dehiscence, and anastomotic leakage. However, supporting scientific evidence for this traditional practice is lacking and there are potential benefits from early postoperative oral intake.

Objectives

To assess the effects of early versus delayed (traditional) initiation of oral intake of food and fluids after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery.

Search Strategy

We searched the Menstrual Disorders & Subfertility Group's Specialised Register of controlled trials, the electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and the citation lists of relevant publications in April 2007.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that compared the effect of early versus delayed initiation of oral intake of food and fluids after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery were considered. Early feeding was defined as having oral intake of fluids or food within the first 24 hours after surgery regardless of the presence or absence of the signs that indicate the return of bowel function and delayed feeding was defined after first 24 hours following surgery and only after clinical signs of resolution of postoperative ileus.

Data Collection and Analysis

Studies considered were assessed for methodological quality criteria for inclusion. For dichotomous data, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Continuous data were examined using weighted mean difference and 95% confidence interval. Heterogeneity between the results of different studies were examined by using the forest plot of a meta-analysis, the statistical tests of homogeneity of 2 x 2 tables and the I(2) value.

Main Results

Early commencement of oral fluids and food was associated with: increased nausea (one study, 195 patients; relative risk 1.79, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 2.71), shorter time to the presence of bowel sound (one study, 195 patients; weighted mean difference -0.5 day, 95% confidence interval -0.84 to -0.16), shorter time to first solid diet (two studies, 301 patients; weighted mean difference -1.47 day, 95% confidence interval -2.26 to -0.68), and a trend toward shorter hospital stay (two studies, 301 patients; weighted mean difference -0.73 day, 95% confidence interval -1.52 to 0.07). The shorter hospital stay with early feeding was also evident in the study that reported length of hospital stay in median (-2 days, 4.0 days in early feeding group and 6.0 days in traditional feeding group). There was no significant difference in postoperative ileus, vomiting, and abdominal distension, time to presence of flatus, time to the first passage of stool, postoperative nasogastric tube placement, febrile morbidity, wound complications, and pneumonia.

Authors' Conclusions

Early feeding after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery is safe however associated with the increased risk of nausea and a reduced length of hospital stay. Whether to adopt the early feeding approach should be individualised. Further studies should focus on the cost-effectiveness, patient's satisfaction, and other physiological changes.

### Patients' perspectives on dietary patterns and eating behaviors during weight regain after gastric bypass surgery [^116webSy]. Obesity Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Food- and Meal-Related Unpleasant Reactions

Challenges with food- and meal-related gastrointestinal reactions such as constipation, diarrhea, and nausea were burdensome. Participants highlighted foods rich in fat, sugar, and meat as particularly problematic.

I feel sick as soon as I eat a little, for example, cheese snacks or stuff myself with chips or something like that. Immediately, I feel sick, and I get diarrhea at once. (Participant 4)

Some participants experienced, as an only symptom, inexplicable fatigue that required bed rest after meals. They compared this with the symptoms in dumping syndrome (a reaction that may include feeling nauseous, tired, or dizzy when undigested food rapidly passes from the stomach pouch to the small intestine) and stated that this fatigue was different. Nevertheless, dumping was also a problem for participants, and they used strategies such as grazing, eating slowly, resting, or avoiding foods that caused discomfort. For some participants, dumping and early satiety were problematic phenomena in social situations as they caused worry about eating in front of others. These reactions could, in turn, harm participants' enjoyment of and relationship with food.

You want to enjoy food; I never enjoy any food. I feel sick when I look at food. I just, I hate food. (Participant 12)

To some extent, dumping syndrome could limit the intake of sweets. However, for several participants, cravings made them eat sweets regardless of dumping. In addition, the intensity of dumping diminished with time, and they learned what they could eat to avoid dumping.

And I knew I would get dumping, but I ate anyway. I had a hard time resisting because the craving was stronger. (Participant 6)

### Perioperative nutrition interventions for women with ovarian cancer [^112e5cZ7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Women with ovarian cancer have been shown to be at significant risk of malnutrition with incidence rates described as being between 28% to 67%. Nutrition interventions may improve clinical outcomes positively, nutritional status or quality of life measures in this patient group.

Objectives

This review was conducted to assess the effects of nutrition interventions during the perioperative period for women with ovarian cancer.

Search Methods

Electronic searches were conducted of the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2012, Issue 7), Medline (1946 to July week 4 2012), Embase (1980 to 2012 week 31), DARE (to 7th August 2012) AMED (1985 to April 2012), BNI (1992 to April 2012), CINAHL (to April 2012). We also searched trials databases, conference proceedings and related citation lists. Reference listings were handsearched. No restrictions were applied on language or date.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which women 18 years and over with any stage of ovarian cancer, including recurrent cancer, were in the perioperative phase of treatment and received any type of nutrition intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Titles and abstracts were screened by two review authors with study selection discussed by a team. Pairs of review authors worked independently on data collection and compared findings.

Main Results

A total of 4092 titles were screened and 14 full text reports reviewed; a single small study met the inclusion criteria. In the included RCT, 40 women (35 with ovarian cancer) had extensive elective surgery including bowel resection for treatment of gynaecological malignancy. Randomisation was made to either early oral feeding (oral fluids in the first 24 hours, solid foods on the following day) or to a 'traditional' feeding regimen where oral fluids and foods were delayed until there was evidence of bowel function. Most women in the early feeding group (14/18) were able to resume eating solid food one day after surgery. This resulted in a significantly shorter hospital stay with no increase in postoperative complications or change in quality of life measures in comparison with the women on the 'traditional' feeding regimen. The incidence of nausea and vomiting during the postoperative stay was similar in both groups and was noted in slightly more than half of the women. Overall survival was evaluated until 30 days following discharge from hospital; in this period, there was one death of a woman who had been in the 'traditional oral feeding' group, cause of death was not noted. We assessed risk of bias and found no high risk of bias was identified in the methodology and reporting of the included study, although there was an increased risk of bias due to the small size of the study in which not all of the women had ovarian cancer.

Authors' Conclusions

Although women with ovarian cancer have been shown to be at risk of malnutrition, there is a lack of evidence derived from RCTs evaluating the identification, assessment and treatment of malnutrition during the perioperative phase of treatment. There is evidence from one small study that some women with ovarian cancer undergoing surgery with associated bowel resection may safely commence oral fluids within 24 hours of surgery and solid foods on the following day. Further research is required, including a RCT, to generate guidance concerning the treatment of malnutrition in this patient group.

### Safety and feasibility of early drinking water after general anesthesia recovery in patients undergoing daytime surgery [^114Fud5t]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

According to the standard requirements of daily surgical anesthesia management, patients who have undergone general anesthesia are conventionally subjected to preoperative fasting and prohibited from drinking water. Patients who have not been drinking water for a long time have lost body fluids. Therefore, most patients have dry lips and parched mucous membranes upon awakening from general anesthesia. After surgery, patients experience considerable thirst, throat discomfort, emotional instability, and other similar discomfort, which significantly heightens their desire for water consumption.

Postoperative dietary management is one of the core components of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) management. Clinical research has provided evidence on the advantages and safety of reintroducing oral fluids after patients undergo general anesthesia. The early postoperative resumption of oral food and fluid intake can facilitate the recovery of intestinal motor function and accelerate the overall postoperative recovery of the body.

However, there is a notable scarcity of clinical studies focusing on early postoperative water intake. Notable discrepancies exist in terms of the timing of water consumption, the quantity of water intake, and the method of drinking water. Existing evidence suggests that patients in the early stages of recovery from general anesthesia can consume an appropriate amount of water. Both children and adults have reported the ability to drink water shortly after recovery from general anesthesia. Nevertheless, there is a considerable dearth of substantial research addressing the quantity and timing of water consumption after surgery. The feasibility of water consumption upon request and the consequences of excessive water intake remain uncertain. There is a clear need for multicenter, large-sample, and randomized controlled studies. Thus, we conducted a prospective randomized controlled study to explore the safety and feasibility of early PACU water consumption for patients recovering from general anesthesia and to provide practical insights for accelerating the clinical progress of rehabilitation surgery.

Enhanced recovery after colorectal surgery — sham feeding with chewing gum: Chewing sugar-free gum for ≥ 10 minutes 3 to 4 times per day after colorectal surgery is safe, results in small improvements in gastrointestinal (GI) recovery, and may be associated with a reduction in the length of hospital stay, with a stated grade of recommendation of strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1B. A Cochrane review of 81 relevant studies and > 9000 abdominal surgery patients found some evidence that gum chewing hastened return of bowel sounds, flatus, and bowel movements, with a small difference in hospital length of stay and no differences in complications or overall cost of care, although studies were generally of poor quality and not limited to adult patients; given limited risk and potential benefit, French enhanced recovery guidelines recommended gum chewing after surgery.

Nutrition and early oral feeding

Early oral feeding should be encouraged and promoted as soon as tolerated by patients (LoE C)

The close relationship between preoperative nutritional status and surgical outcomes has been extensively reported in elective surgery, where tailored nutritional and prehabilitation programs can be planned before the operation. Postoperative fasting has been demonstrated to be harmful in elective surgery with delayed recovery and increased complications. Oral feeding can be resumed early after surgery regardless of bowel canalization, whether removal of the nasogastric tube, PONV prophylaxis, near zero fluid balance, early mobilization, and pain control have been carried out according to enhanced recovery protocol. Patients undergoing emergency surgery often have an altered metabolic status, with dehydration and several derangements such as prolonged fasting, vomiting, impairment of GI function, and fluid loss related to the acute illness. The great condition's heterogeneity in emergency surgery patients makes quite impossible to standardize the timing of oral feeding recovery. However, studies carried out in patients with perforated peptic ulcer or obstructive colorectal cancer demonstrated both feasibility and safety of early oral feeding. Perioperative nutritional intervention should be therefore tailored to the patient's conditions adopting as the target the earliest possible recovery.

Urinary catheter removal

Urinary catheter should be removed as soon as possible when urinary output no longer needs to be monitored (LoE C)

Urinary output monitoring is a key element to assess patients' volemic status and to guide goal-directed fluid therapy. In emergency surgery patients, the urine output target should be 0.5 ml/Kg/h. Different policies about the timing of catheter removal have been proposed: immediately after surgery in a randomized study on perforated peptic ulcer patients, on postoperative day 1 or according to urinary output (> 1 ml/Kg/h). Regardless, the urinary catheter should be removed as early as possible after reaching the minimum urinary output target to facilitate mobilization and reduce infections.

Postoperative fluids

Postoperative intravenous fluids should be minimized and maintained until oral fluid intake is adequate (LoE C)

Fluid therapy should be targeted to restore the euvolemic status and to maintain adequate hydration and tissue perfusion until the oral intake can be restarted. As reported for operative management, fluid therapy can be harmful if too many or too few fluids are given. Following elective colorectal surgery i.v. fluids should be stopped on postoperative day one. Studies performed on emergency surgery patients did not report on timing to stop i.v fluids; however, infusions should be tailored to patient conditions, giving the minimum fluid amount to restore and maintain euvolemia and to obtain adequate perfusion.

### Patients' perspectives on dietary patterns and eating behaviors during weight regain after gastric bypass surgery [^115XSmBm]. Obesity Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

At the time I did not consider that there is still a lot of sugar and stuff [in sweets], so I didn't realize [that the body would adapt to increased intake of sugar]. Instead, I believed that now I would be getting a smaller stomach, and I would never again be able to eat this much. (Participant 13)

Some participants had not taken vitamin and mineral supplements for several years, causing additional challenges with deficiencies and related conditions such as osteoporosis.

According to the participants, the pre-surgical information, delivered mainly as group information, only focused on the surgical procedure and dietary recommendations in conjunction with the surgery. All but one had received some follow-up visits by nurses or dietitians during the first 2 years after the surgery, indicating some interdisciplinary follow-up. Post-surgical follow-ups in primary care were described as scarce and unsatisfactory. Some participants were offered follow-ups 5 and/or 10 years post-surgically at the surgical clinic. However, psychological support was perceived as non-existent and nutritional support insufficient, contributing to dietary challenges.

Maybe you [referring to herself] should also meet a counselor or psychologist because you still have a remaining [problematic] eating behavior like mine. I couldn't eat any proper meals because I got dumping, I took a small piece of bread or something all the time, little things. So, more control [nutritional- and psychological support], not just, 'Manage this on your own'. (Participant 8)

One participant expressed being satisfied with support from interdisciplinary healthcare professionals both pre- and post-surgically. Participant appreciated that the surgeon examined her stomach pouch after weight regain.

It [follow-up] has been good. They [healthcare professionals] gave good information. They make appointments at certain intervals to check if everything is working well. /… / It was great. I was satisfied. /… / They gave me all the examinations, x-rays, and everything. And he [the surgeon] said: 'Everything looks really good, nothing strange, 'the stomach' is as we made it'.

### Guidelines for perioperative care in elective abdominal and pelvic surgery at primary and secondary hospitals in low-middle-income countries (LMIC' s): enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) society recommendation [^111Wpx1B]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Early postoperative feeding

Patients have traditionally been kept fasting postoperatively until signs of return of bowel function. However, prolonged fasting is associated with increased risk of postoperative infectious complications and delayed recovery. A Cochrane review has shown that early oral feeding (fluids immediately after surgery and solids after 4 h), when combined with measures to reduce postoperative ileus, is associated with earlier return of bowel function, a shorter length of hospital stays and does not pose a higher risk of anastomotic leaks and other complications. Even with early feeding, oral intake seldom reaches the required energy or protein requirements. Oral nutritional supplements have been shown to be useful in both the well and under nourished patient.

The metabolic stress induced by surgery results in a depletion of immune modulators. The supplementation of oral feeds with immune modulators (immune-nutrition) is associated with a reduction in infective complications and a reduced length of stay. The ESPEN guidelines, based on multiple RCT's and meta-analysis, recommend that malnourished patients undergoing cancer surgery should at least receive postoperative immune-nutrition with arginine, omega 3 fatty acids and ribonucleotides. However, the quality of evidence remains low. The recommendation is graded as weak for primary and secondary hospitals in LMIC's and is not recommended.

Summary: Early oral feeding is recommended.

Early mobilization

Early mobilization is an essential component of perioperative care to improve patient recovery after surgery. The duration of mobilization (hours/day) is uncertain. The current recommendation is for the patient to sit out of bed for 30 min on day 0 and 6 h/day thereafter and to commence walking on day1. While there is evidence to show increased risk of complications (increased muscle loss, pulmonary and VTE) with prolonged bed rest, there is limited evidence on the benefits of a dedicated interventions to improve early mobilization. The duration of mobilization (hours/day) is uncertain. The current recommendation is 30 min on day 0 and 6 h/day thereafter. Patients and their families should be educated on these goals preoperatively.

Summary: Early mobilization is recommended.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^111nPRpb]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

5.4.1.1 Evidence for preoperative nutritional support

There are few prospective studies of preoperative nutrition and no prospective randomised trials with a non-nutrition control group. A meta-analysis of pre-surgical nutritional support in gastrointestinal surgery patients found that the provision of 500–1000 kcal of an immune enhancing oral nutritional supplement plus usual food significantly reduced post-surgical complications. A more recent systematic review of preoperative nutrition in Crohn's disease included 14 original studies, but only five prospective studies including one randomised trial. Five studies showed significantly reduced complications and infectious episodes in patients receiving preoperative nutritional therapy. Significant heterogeneity was reported between studies in terms of the nutritional supplement used and timing of nutrition. There is sufficient evidence to propose delaying surgery when possible to allow a multimodal approach to management including nutrition, steroid weaning and management of any abscesses.

The European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN) recommends preoperative nutritional support for 7–10 days in patients who are undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery and are mildly malnourished. A longer duration is recommended for severely malnourished patients even if it delays surgery. If oral nutritional supplements are not tolerated, then enteral nutrition should be considered and parenteral nutrition should only be used when nutritional targets cannot be delivered by the enteral route.

5.4.2 Preoperative serum albumin

Hypoalbuminaemia (albumin < 30 g/L), as a reflection of significant inflammation or secondary to malabsorption, is frequently associated with severe malnutrition although is not in itself a marker of nutritional status. This level of hypoalbuminaemia is associated with a higher risk of postoperative intra-abdominal sepsis. The evidence to support the use of intravenous albumin is weakand correction of hypoalbuminaemia hinges on treatment of underlying sepsis and control of inflammation. Nutritional support alone is very unlikely to restore low albumin levels to normal while sepsis and uncontrolled inflammation persist, but feeding is an important supportive measure.

### Review of the pathophysiology and management of postoperative ileus [^115HhGsQ]. World Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Investigations in the pathophysiology and treatment of postoperative ileus continue to evolve. Bowel rest is no longer a mandatory component of postoperative recovery. Tolerance of enteral nutrition and normalization of the abdominal examination are more accurate indications of the resolution of postoperative ileus than passage of flatus or first bowel movement. A multimodal "fast track" recovery approach incorporated into a clinical pathway provides a more rapid return of intestinal function and shortened hospital stay in patients undergoing major, uncomplicated gastrointestinal surgery.

### Early oral feeding within two hours for parturients compared with delayed oral feeding after cesarean section: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11173nRS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The current meta-analysis indicated that EOF within 2 h after CS has comparable safety with DOF, without increasing gastrointestinal morbidities (vomiting, nausea, abdominal distension and ileus) or other non-gastrointestinal postoperative complications (fever, wound infection, urinary tract infection, readmission). Even faster recovery of bowel function was observed in the patients oral intake within 2 h compared with DOF. These include a shorter time to the return of bowel movement, a shorter time to the passage of flatus and a shorter time to start a regular diet. Importantly, EOF was associated with reduced time to ambulation and removal of the catheter after CS. On the other hand, inconsistent findings were noted because the meta-analysis by Charoenkwan indicated that EOF significantly reduced the length of hospital stay, whereas in the present systematic review it was shown that EOF and DOF had no significant effect on the length of hospitalization.

In previous clinical practice, women after CS were prohibited from eating via the mouth until bowel activity resumed, despite they were feeling hungry. Anesthesiologists and obstetricians use this approach because of the fear of maternal harm from postoperative complications such as nausea, vomiting, asphyxia, and intestinal obstruction due to EOF; however, the veracity of this theory has been questioned in recent years. There are now many studies on the safety of EOF after CS. The timing of the early feeding regimes varied from immediately to 8 h after the operation. Almost all studies have shown that EOF does not increase postoperative complications. However, the optimal time for oral feeding after CS is unclear. A research group summarized a series of studies and composed standardized ERAS guidelines (parts 1–3) for preoperative and postoperative care in patients with CS. Oral intake of a regular diet within 2 h after CS was recommended. The Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP) committee recommended that oral intake of ice chips and/or water within 60 min postcaesarean admission to the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) and advance to a regular diet ideally within 4 h postcaesarean, as tolerated. In the present review, our results support EOF 2 h after CS.

### American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery: postoperative care pathway guidelines for roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^115hANXV]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) postoperative diet and nutrition — Water or a low-sugar clear liquid can be initiated on postoperative day zero once patients are fully awake. On postoperative day 1, full liquids or pureed/soft solids can be introduced or continued, with a minimal protein intake of 60 g/d and up to 1.5 g/ kg ideal body weight/d with liquid protein supplements recommended. After discharge, patients should follow an overall nutritional care plan supervised by a registered dietitian nutritionist, emphasizing adequate protein and hydration with at least 60 oz (1800 cc) of fluid daily, and dumping syndrome is minimized by eliminating simple carbohydrates.

Results

Participants

A total of 155 participants took part in round 1 of the Delphi survey (155 of 234, 66.3 per cent). After completing round 1, 123 of 155 (79.4 per cent) took part in round 2, and 112 of 123 (91.1 per cent) in round 3. There were 15 participants in the final consensus meeting, including five patients, two allied healthcare professionals (1 nurse and 1 dietitian), and eight medical professionals (Table 2).

Participant characteristics of Delphi and consensus meeting stages

Outcome longlisting

Seventy-three outcomes were identified from a systematic review of previous evidence which was refined by the steering committee to eliminate duplication (Fig. S1). Six unique outcomes were added from stakeholder focus groups and 12 by the steering committee, resulting in 75 unique outcomes used to populate round 1 of the Delphi process.

Delphi process

During round 1, a total of 75 outcomes were presented to participants and 13 reached the threshold to be considered at the consensus meeting. Eight unique outcomes were generated via free-text responses and were carried forward to round 2 (Box S1). During round 2, 70 outcomes (including those generated in the earlier round) were presented and nine reached the meeting threshold. The remaining 61 outcomes were re-presented during round 3 and one more reached the threshold. After consideration by the steering committee, six outcomes were considered to have 'borderline' consensus, and it was agreed to re-present these for a final decision at the meeting. The full Delphi results are shown in Tables S2 and S3.

### Early versus delayed oral fluids and food for reducing complications after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery [^117NNpt7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in 2007. Traditionally, after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery postoperative oral intake is withheld until the return of bowel function. There has been concern that early oral intake would result in vomiting and severe paralytic ileus with subsequent aspiration pneumonia, wound dehiscence, and anastomotic leakage. However, evidence-based clinical studies suggest that there may be benefits from early postoperative oral intake.

Objectives

To assess the effects of early versus delayed (traditional) initiation of oral intake of food and fluids after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery.

Search Methods

We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL), and the citation lists of relevant publications. The most recent search was conducted 1 April 2014. We also searched a registry for ongoing trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov) on 13 May 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible that compared the effect of early versus delayed initiation of oral intake of food and fluids after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery. Early feeding was defined as oral intake of fluids or food within 24 hours post-surgery regardless of the return of bowel function. Delayed feeding was defined as oral intake after 24 hours post-surgery and only after signs of postoperative ileus resolution.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors selected studies, assessed study quality and extracted the data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We examined continuous data using the mean difference (MD) and a 95% CI. We tested for heterogeneity between the results of different studies using a forest plot of the meta-analysis, the statistical tests of homogeneity of 2 x 2 tables and the I² value. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE methods.

Main Results

Rates of developing postoperative ileus were comparable between study groups (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.29, P = 0.14, 3 RCTs, 279 women, I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). When we considered the rates of nausea or vomiting or both, there was no evidence of a difference between the study groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.67, P = 0.90, 4 RCTs, 484 women, I² = 73%, moderate-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between the study groups in abdominal distension (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.47, 2 RCTs, 301 women, I² = 0%) or a need for postoperative nasogastric tube placement (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.80, 1 RCT, 195 women). Early feeding was associated with shorter time to the presence of bowel sound (MD -0.32 days, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.03, P = 0.03, 2 RCTs, 338 women, I² = 52%, moderate-quality evidence) and faster onset of flatus (MD -0.21 days, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.01, P = 0.04, 3 RCTs, 444 women, I² = 23%, moderate-quality evidence). In addition, women in the early feeding group resumed a solid diet sooner (MD -1.47 days, 95% CI -2.26 to -0.68, P = 0.0003, 2 RCTs, 301 women, I² = 92%, moderate-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in time to the first passage of stool between the two study groups (MD -0.25 days, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.09, P = 0.15, 2 RCTs, 249 women, I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). Hospital stay was shorter in the early feeding group (MD -0.92 days, 95% CI -1.53 to -0.31, P = 0.003, 4 RCTs, 484 women, I² = 68%, moderate-quality evidence). Infectious complications were less common in the early feeding group (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.73, P = 0.02, 2 RCTs, 183 women, I² = 0%, high-quality evidence). In one study, the satisfaction score was significantly higher in the early feeding group (MD 11.10, 95% CI 6.68 to 15.52, P < 0.00001, 143 women, moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Early postoperative feeding after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery for either benign or malignant conditions appeared to be safe without increased gastrointestinal morbidities or other postoperative complications. The benefits of this approach include faster recovery of bowel function, lower rates of infectious complications, shorter hospital stay, and higher satisfaction.

### Consensus guidelines for perioperative care in neonatal intestinal surgery: enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) society recommendations [^116qySb3]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Postoperative nutrition

Early feeding

There is high-quality evidence to support early enteral feeding in post-surgical neonates. Neonates that were fed early have a shorter LOS, and decreased SSIs with no increase in anastomotic leaks. Additionally, in very low birth weight infants, the early introduction of low volume feeds showed no increased incidence of NEC and a decreased incidence of sepsis. Although high-quality evidence supports this recommendation, variable clinical situations may require a delay in feeding so the recommendation was determined to be weak.

Breast milk as first nutrition

Breast milk is a resource-friendly feeding choice for term infants, with a high level of evidence for its benefits. In post-surgical patients, where feeding intolerances are common, breast milk is typically well tolerated and the presence of immunoglobulin, prebiotics, and growth factors improve intestinal adaptation. The protective effect of breast milk on the development and recurrence of NEC in preterm and low birth weight infants is well described. Breast milk consumption promotes development of beneficial fecal flora and suppresses growth of potential pathogenic organisms in term infants.

Urinary sodium monitoring

Infants with stomas commonly suffer from sodium depletion. Inadequate urine sodium concentration is associated with slower weight gain in infants undergoing intestinal surgery. Neonates with stomas should undergo urinary sodium level monitoring. Sodium supplementation to maintain urinary sodium > 30 mmol/L improves overall growth in surgical neonates. The low quality of evidence supports a case-by-case approach to sodium supplementation.

Mucous fistula refeeding

In neonates with stomas, mucous fistula refeeding can augment absorption of enteral nutrition required for healing and growth. Low to moderate quality studies of mucous fistula refeeding demonstrate improved weight gain, shorter duration of parenteral nutrition, decreased anastomotic leakage, and less cholestasis. Complications are rare; however, the risk of bowel perforation and death lends caution. The decision to proceed with mucous fistula feeding should include careful patient selection (term infants with a healthy mucous fistula and distal small bowel), ongoing monitoring, and nursing education.

Excluded items and weak evidence

In some instances, good quality data were not available (urinary catheter use) or data were conflicting (chlorhexidine vs. povidone iodine based skin preparation) preventing the development of recommendations.

Many recommendations within this guideline are supported by weak evidence. In some cases, supporting evidence is inferred from high-quality studies in other populations (preoperative antibiotics); in other cases, potential benefits were judged to outweigh harms (prevention of hypothermia). Finally, in some cases, weak evidence was bolstered by national standards (transfusions).

Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) diet progression — clear liquids begin immediately and the clear liquid phase should not last longer than 48 hours due to nutritional inadequacy; patients are instructed to sip liquids throughout the day, gradually increasing to 8+ oz per hour. During the full liquid diet, continue with low-calorie, noncarbonated clear liquids (48–64 oz/day), with post op day 2 through 7–14 days depending on the patient's condition. Protein targets follow ASMBS guidance of a minimum of 60 g of protein/d and up to 1.5 g/kg ideal weight/day. A soft food stage typically begins 2–3 weeks after surgery. In the regular texture stage, continue with 48–64 oz clear liquid daily, consume protein foods 2–3 or 3–4 times a day, and take bariatric multivitamin mineral supplement and calcium citrate as recommended.

### Optimal preoperative assessment of the geriatric surgical patient: a best practices guideline from the American college of surgeons national surgical quality improvement program and the American Geriatrics Society [^114xpNof]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2012). Medium credibility.

Preoperative interventions for malnutrition — ESPEN Recommendations outline to use nutritional support in patients with severe nutritional risk for 10–14 days prior to a major surgical operation even if the operation has to be delayed (Grade A), and to initiate nutritional support (by the enteral route if possible) without delay even in patients without obvious under-nutrition if it is anticipated that the patient will be unable to eat for more than 7 days perioperatively (Grade C) and in patients who cannot maintain oral intake above 60% of recommended intake for more than 10 days (Grade C). Consider combination with parenteral nutrition in patients in whom energy needs cannot be met (< 60% of caloric requirement) via the enteral route (Grade C), encourage patients who do not meet their energy needs from normal food to take oral nutritional supplements during the preoperative period (Grade C), and administer preoperative enteral nutrition preferably before admission to the hospital (Grade C). Preoperative parenteral nutrition is indicated in severely undernourished patients who cannot be adequately orally or enterally fed for 7–10 days preoperatively (Grade A). The enteral route is preferred except for the following contraindications: intestinal obstructions or ileus, severe shock, intestinal ischemia. Other recommendations include vitamin supplementation for alcohol-related malnourished patient: B12 and folate, thiamine.

Postoperative nutrition care of the metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) patient — most MBS protocols suggest a transition into different food textures, fluid, and protein recommendations, along with bariatric micronutrient supplementation. Currently, there is no evidence to support a specific protocol of post-MBS diet progressions [6]. The diet progression and recommendations should be modified according to the MBS procedure type and the patient's specific nutritional status [6,11,34,35]. In addition, nutrition education should include reading food labels to limit added sugars, fats and highly processed ingredients and distinguishing between protein supplements and meal replacements.

Ileus prevention — sham feeding with chewing gum after colorectal surgery: Sham feeding (ie, chewing gum for ≥ 10 min 3–4× daily) after colorectal surgery is safe, results in small improvements in GI recovery, and may be associated with a reduction in length of hospital stay. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. A meta-analysis of 18 randomized trials found shorter time to first flatus (WMD −8.81 h; 95% CI, −13.45 to −4.17), shorter time to first bowel movement (WMD −16.43 h; 95% CI, −22.68 to −10.19), and reduced LOS (WMD −0.89 d; 95% CI, −1.72 to −0.07), with postoperative ileus lower in the chewing gum arm (RR 0.41; 95% CI, 0.23–0.73). In another systematic review limited to 10 randomized "high quality" trials, chewing gum was associated with lower postoperative ileus (RR 0.55; 95% CI, 0.39–0.79) and faster time to first flatus (WMD −0.31 d; 95% CI, −0.36 to −0.26) and bowel movement (WMD −0.47; 95% CI, −0.60 to −0.34) but no difference in LOS; however, subgroup analysis within an ERP reported no longer significant decreases in time to flatus and LOS.

surgery to recovery is specifically designed to help patients heal more quickly, eat and move sooner, and optimally control pain. Studies show that this program helps patients feel better and recover more quickly. Participants are asked to follow the guidelines described within the ERAS handbook. This includes stopping smoking 4 weeks before surgery, eating optimally. getting some exercise, early return to diet after surgery, and getting out of bed and moving as soon as possible after surgery. The Surgery care team in Huntsville will review the Enhanced Recovery steps with participants before their surgery, during their hospital stay, and before they go home. The main steps involved in this care. pathway are pre-admission counselling, fluid and carbohydrate loading and early mobilization.

Participants will answer a questionnaire which will include questions regarding patient outcomes and complications after surgery. Data will be collected for 15–30 days after the surgery.

### Treatment… [^113Rf4JZ]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

Endoscopic mucosal resection Endoscopic mucosal resection is a procedure that uses an endoscope to remove carcinoma in situ and early-stage cancer from the lining of the digestive tract. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens and tools to remove tissue. Surgery Surgery is a common treatment for stomach cancer. The type of surgery depends on where the cancer is located. Gastrectomy Gastrectomy, the removal of part or all of the stomach, is the main surgery for stomach cancer: Subtotal gastrectomyis the removal of the part of the stomach that contains cancer, nearby lymph nodes, and parts of other tissues and organs near the tumor. The spleen may also be removed. Total gastrectomyis the removal of the entire stomach, nearby lymph nodes, and parts of the esophagus, small intestine, and other tissues near the tumor. The spleen may also be removed.

Then the surgeon attaches the esophagus to the small intestine so the patient can continue to eat and swallow. Endoluminal stent placement Endoluminal stent placement may be done when the tumor blocks the passage into or out of the stomach. In this procedure, the surgeon places a stent from the esophagus to the stomach or from the stomach to the small intestine to allow the patient to eat normally. Endoluminal laser therapy Endoluminal laser therapy is a procedure in which an endoscope with a laser attached is used as a knife to open a gastrointestinal blockage. Gastrojejunostomy Gastrojejunostomy is the removal of the part of the stomach with cancer that is blocking the opening into the small intestine. Then the surgeon connects the stomach to the jejunum to allow food and medicine to pass from the stomach into the small intestine.

A type of regional chemotherapy called hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, or hot chemotherapy, is being studied to treat stomach cancer and may be offered at certain treatment centers. After the surgeon has removed as much of the cancer as possible during surgery, a chemotherapy drug, such as mitomycin or cisplatin, is warmed and pumped directly into the peritoneal cavity through a thin tube for about 2 hours. The surgeon then drains the chemotherapy from the abdomen and rinses the abdomen before closing the incision.
