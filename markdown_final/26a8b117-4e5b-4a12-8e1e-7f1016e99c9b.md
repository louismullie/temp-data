## Question

Pancytopenia in bleeding

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage pancytopenia presenting with bleeding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and bleeding control. Then, I should verify the diagnosis and severity of pancytopenia. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and decide when to pursue bone marrow evaluation. After that, I need to outline targeted management by etiology, including transfusion thresholds and disease-specific therapies. Finally, I should address special populations, monitoring, and follow-up, while double-checking for pitfalls like pseudothrombocytopenia and drug-induced cytopenias.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: airway, breathing, and circulation, with rapid control of bleeding and early hematology involvement, because pancytopenia with active hemorrhage is a hematologic emergency that can deteriorate quickly; I need to ensure a CBC with differential, reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, and coagulation profile are obtained urgently, and that platelet transfusion is initiated promptly if the count is below critical thresholds or there is active bleeding, while remembering that severe anemia and thrombocytopenia synergize to worsen hemostasis and that RBC transfusion can improve platelet margination and clot formation under shear, so I should not delay RBC support when clinically indicated [^1152oXzi] [^114DaWY2] [^112ziAec].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic framework before jumping to conclusions: pancytopenia is defined as simultaneous reduction in at least two hematopoietic lineages, typically anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, and the bleeding phenotype in this context is most often driven by thrombocytopenia compounded by anemia and coagulopathy; I should confirm the counts against a repeat CBC to exclude spurious cytopenias and review the smear for dysplasia, blasts, schistocytes, or megaloblastic changes that would redirect the differential toward marrow failure, clonal disease, hemolysis, or nutritional etiologies [^113tHbyY] [^112HTVP5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology; I need to construct a prioritized differential that distinguishes marrow failure from destructive, infiltrative, nutritional, infectious, autoimmune, toxic, and inherited causes, because management diverges substantially: immune-mediated aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute leukemia, marrow infiltration, severe B12/folate deficiency, HIV, hepatitis-associated aplasia, parvovirus B19, leptospirosis, ehrlichiosis, SLE with myelofibrosis, drug-induced cytopenias, hypersplenism, and inherited marrow failure syndromes such as Fanconi anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, CAMT, and GATA2 deficiency should all be considered in parallel with the clinical context and exposure history [^112eN47q] [^114GSFgV] [^112JEyXB] [^113wVuXy] [^114Z8s52] [^114v3129].

> I should double-check the indications for bone marrow examination; in new-onset pancytopenia with bleeding, marrow evaluation is generally indicated to distinguish hypoplastic marrow failure from clonal or infiltrative processes, and I need to ensure cytogenetics, flow cytometry, and reticulin staining are obtained because these findings separate aplastic anemia from MDS, leukemia, and secondary fibrosis and guide therapy; if standard cytogenetics fail, microarray or FISH panels can substitute, and I must remember that dysplastic vacuolated precursors may reflect copper deficiency rather than MDS, so trace elements should be checked before labeling a clonal disorder [^113tHbyY] [^116Ce9EU] [^116rnwiH].

> Next, I should review transfusion thresholds and supportive care while I stabilize; for prophylaxis in stable patients without bleeding, a platelet threshold of less than 10 × 10⁹/L is acceptable, but with active bleeding, fever, sepsis, DIC, or invasive procedures, I should raise the threshold to 20–50 × 10⁹/L depending on risk and site of bleeding, and in AML with DIC-like coagulopathy even higher targets may be needed; RBC transfusion should follow general hemodynamic and symptomatic triggers, and I need to remember that despite prophylaxis, spontaneous bleeding remains common in severe thrombocytopenia, so I should not be falsely reassured by a number alone [^114DaWY2] [^115vTE2P] [^112C6vRb].

> Let me consider disease-specific therapy now; for severe aplastic anemia, I should confirm severity and proceed with either matched related donor HSCT in younger patients or immunosuppression with ATG plus cyclosporine in older or unsuitable candidates, and I need to anticipate transfusion dependence and infection prophylaxis during the aplastic phase; for MDS, I should risk-stratify and consider hypomethylating agents or supportive care; for AML, prompt oncologic therapy is essential, with attention to coagulopathy; for B12/folate deficiency, replacement produces rapid improvements in all lineages; for immune pancytopenia after chemotherapy or checkpoint inhibitors, corticosteroids may reverse cytopenias; for leptospirosis or ehrlichiosis, timely antimicrobial therapy can restore counts; and for hypersplenism from portal hypertension, I should coordinate endoscopic and hepatology-directed management rather than hematologic therapy alone [^112sHgpH] [^115es4QH] [^117QgMui] [^112JEyXB] [^1173suh1].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or pregnant; I need to ensure pediatric-specific thresholds are respected, where nonbleeding children with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia generally do not require platelet transfusion above 10 × 10⁹/L unless bleeding or procedures intervene, and in pregnancy with severe thrombocytopenia, maternal-fetal risks rise as counts fall below 50 × 10⁹/L, so individualized transfusion and delivery planning are critical; in older adults, I should maintain a lower threshold for admission and aggressive supportive care given blunted compensatory responses and higher bleeding risk [^113rvEjk] [^116zE7M3].

> I should confirm that I am not missing pseudothrombocytopenia; if the clinical picture and smear do not align, I must request a manual platelet count or use citrate-anticoagulated samples to avoid unnecessary transfusions, and I need to check for drug-induced cytopenias by reconciling all prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal exposures, including chemotherapy, ICIs, antiretrovirals, and other agents with marrow suppressive potential [^112HTVP5] [^113nSEWt] [^112oAY4w].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up; daily CBCs are reasonable during active bleeding or treatment initiation, with vigilant assessment for transfusion reactions and alloimmunization, and I should arrange expedited hematology follow-up within 24–72 hours for new thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia; if bone marrow is non-diagnostic or suspicion for clonal disease persists, somatic mutation testing can refine risk and distinguish CCUS from MDS, guiding surveillance and timing of therapy [^1164k7e4] [^115dLvs5].

> Let me reconsider the key principles to ensure coherence: pancytopenia with bleeding is a high-acuity presentation in which thrombocytopenia is the proximate driver of hemorrhage but anemia and coagulopathy amplify risk, so I should transfuse platelets proactively at higher thresholds when bleeding is present, pursue marrow evaluation early to define etiology, and tailor definitive therapy to the underlying disease while maintaining supportive care and infection prophylaxis; I need to ensure that I escalate transfusion targets in DIC, sepsis, and procedural contexts and that I do not anchor prematurely on a single diagnosis without integrating history, smear, marrow, and molecular data [^115vTE2P] [^114DaWY2] [^113tHbyY].

Pancytopenia with bleeding is a **medical emergency** [^112sHgpH] characterized by concurrent anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, with bleeding driven primarily by thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction [^114DaWY2]. The most common causes include **aplastic anemia** [^112eN47q], **myelodysplastic syndromes** [^114GSFgV], acute leukemias, and severe nutritional deficiencies (B12, folate) [^113tHbyY] [^115es4QH]; infections, drugs, and autoimmune diseases are also important [^1118b88D]. Immediate management focuses on **stabilizing the patient** with platelet transfusions, correcting anemia, and controlling bleeding [^115vTE2P]; urgent hematology consultation and bone marrow evaluation are essential to identify the cause and guide definitive therapy [^116Ce9EU]. Delay in diagnosis or treatment increases the risk of **life-threatening hemorrhage** and sepsis [^1152oXzi].

## Pathophysiology of bleeding in pancytopenia

Bleeding in pancytopenia is **multifactorial**, with thrombocytopenia as the primary driver [^114dhxRc]; additional contributors include anemia, coagulopathies, and platelet dysfunction [^112ziAec].

- **Thrombocytopenia**: Low platelet counts impair primary hemostasis, causing mucocutaneous bleeding, petechiae, ecchymoses, and spontaneous hemorrhage [^112JyWuG].

- **Anemia**: Reduced RBCs diminish oxygen delivery and impair platelet margination, worsening bleeding [^112ziAec].

- **Coagulopathies**: DIC, liver disease, or anticoagulant use can exacerbate bleeding [^1131J6p4].

- **Platelet dysfunction**: Qualitative defects (e.g. uremia, medications) further impair hemostasis [^114gGusv].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients with pancytopenia and bleeding typically present with:

- **Fatigue and pallor**: From anemia [^1118b88D].

- **Infections**: Due to leukopenia [^112eN47q].

- **Bleeding manifestations**: Petechiae, ecchymoses, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, menorrhagia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and rarely intracranial hemorrhage [^113kg9kP].

- **Easy bruising and mucosal bleeding**: Common with thrombocytopenia [^112JyWuG].

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **systematic approach** is essential to identify the cause and guide therapy:

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Confirms pancytopenia and severity [^116Ce9EU].

- **Peripheral blood smear**: Assesses morphology, dysplasia, blasts, and parasites [^116Ce9EU].

- **Bone marrow biopsy**: Determines marrow cellularity, dysplasia, infiltration, and blasts; essential for diagnosing aplastic anemia, MDS, and leukemia [^113tHbyY].

- **Laboratory tests**: B12, folate, iron studies, liver function, renal function, coagulation profile, viral serologies (HIV, hepatitis B/C), autoimmune panel [^1115xYym].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or CT for organomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or infiltrative disease [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Immediate supportive care

- **Platelet transfusion**: Maintain platelets > 10–20 × 10⁹/L; higher thresholds (> 50 × 10⁹/L) if active bleeding or invasive procedures [^115vTE2P].

- **RBC transfusion**: Correct anemia to improve oxygen delivery and hemostasis [^114Eakpo].

- **Bleeding control**: Local measures (pressure, topical agents), antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid), and reversal of anticoagulation as indicated [^114DaWY2].

- **Infection prophylaxis**: Antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals as indicated [^117EmiSX].

---

### Definitive therapy

Definitive therapy depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Aplastic anemia**: Immunosuppressive therapy (ATG + cyclosporine) or allogeneic stem cell transplantation [^112sHgpH].

- **MDS/Leukemia**: Chemotherapy, hypomethylating agents, or stem cell transplantation [^notfound].

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: B12/folate replacement [^115es4QH].

- **Autoimmune disorders**: Immunosuppressive therapy (steroids, IVIG, rituximab) [^117QgMui].

- **Infections**: Targeted antimicrobial therapy [^115VZtfJ].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies with the **cause**, severity, and response to therapy. Complications include **life-threatening hemorrhage** — especially intracranial [^112UtwWA] — recurrent infections from neutropenia, and progression to MDS/AML in marrow failure syndromes [^115VtHZe]. Early diagnosis and targeted therapy improve outcomes and reduce morbidity and mortality [^116BescR].

Pancytopenia with bleeding is a **high-risk clinical scenario** requiring rapid stabilization, urgent hematology input, and a structured diagnostic workup to identify and treat the cause.

### The differential diagnosis and bone marrow evaluation of new-onset pancytopenia [^113tHbyY]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

New-onset pancytopenia can be caused by a wide variety of etiologies, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. These etiologies range from congenital bone marrow failure to marrow space-occupying lesions, infection, and peripheral destruction, to name a few. Bone marrow examination, in addition to a detailed clinical history, is often required for an accurate diagnosis. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of many of the causes of new-onset pancytopenia in adults and children, with emphasis on bone marrow findings and recommendations of additional testing and clinical evaluation when needed, with the overall aim of aiding the pathologist's role as a consultant to the patient's treating physician.

### Severe folate-deficiency pancytopenia [^115es4QH]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Folate-deficiency anaemia occurs in about 4 per 100 000 people, although severe cases causing moderate pancytopenia are rarer. We present the case of a significant folate deficiency in a 50-year-old alcoholic with a background of mild liver impairment and recurrent nasal and rectal bleeding. Her blood tests showed profound macrocytic anaemia with haemoglobin 2.6 g/dl, leucopoenia with white cell count 3.2 × 10⁹/litre and thrombocytopenia with platelets 17 × 10⁹/litre. Serum folate was 0.8 ng/ml (normal 2.5–13.5 ng/ml) confirming severe deficiency. Despite these life-threatening results, the patient was stable, alert and was keen to avoid admission. Medical management of the anaemia included slow transfusion of red cells and one unit of platelets in view of haemorrhagic symptoms, two injections of vitamin B12 while awaiting assays and oral folic acid. A rapid improvement in the leucopoenia and thrombocytopenia resulted and no additional complications were encountered.

### How to manage ITP with life-threatening bleeding [^116qorcN]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

While immune thrombocytopenia often presents with mild bleeding manifestations or surprising findings of thrombocytopenia on routine complete blood counts in patients without symptoms, some patients can present with new thrombocytopenia and life-threatening bleeding. Emergent assessment and treatment are needed to prevent substantial morbidity and even mortality. These patients present to the emergency room with bleeding, and hematologists are subsequently consulted. Understanding the approach to making the diagnosis and excluding other life-threatening illnesses is essential, as is rapid initiation of treatment in the bleeding patient even when the diagnosis of immune- mediated thrombocytopenia is tentative. Using a case-based format, we review how to approach and treat patients presenting with new thrombocytopenia and bleeding.

### Aplastic anaemia [^112eN47q]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on aplastic anemia:

- **Definition**: AA is a rare hematopoietic stem cell disorder that results in pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of AA is largely immune-mediated, with autoreactive lymphocytes mediating the destruction of hematopoietic stem cells. This immune dysregulation leads to bone marrow failure and the cessation of new blood cell production.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of AA is estimated at 0.2–0.3 per 100,000 person-years in Europe.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for AA include exposure to specific medications, pesticides, and certain chemicals, as well as genetic predisposition and low socioeconomic status.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients may present with symptoms related to anemia, such as fatigue and pallor, bleeding tendencies due to thrombocytopenia, and increased susceptibility to infections due to neutropenia. A significant complication of AA is the risk of progression to myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukemia.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of AA can vary widely. Some patients may have mild symptoms that require little or no therapy, while others may present with life-threatening pancytopenia.

### You are what you eat: ophthalmological manifestations of severe B deficiency [^116aUj4t]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe B 12 vitamin deficiency due to diminished dietary intake is a known cause of severe pancytopenia with bleeding diathesis. The authors report a case with sudden-onset bilateral vision loss, severe pancytopenia and multiple organ failure secondary to B 12 vitamin deficiency in a patient with a strict vegetarian diet. On funduscopic examination the patient had multiple bilateral exuberant haemorrhages in all retinal layers. Five months after presentation, he had a complete visual recovery without ophthalmological intervention.

### Why does my patient have thrombocytopenia? [^113971re]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia, usually defined as a platelet count of less than 150,000/μL, is a common reason for a hematology consult in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. In most patients, the cause of the thrombocytopenia can be identified and treated. This article reviews the clinical approach to the patient with thrombocytopenia, the mechanisms that underlie it, and the laboratory tests available to investigate it. A practical approach to the investigation and management of thrombocytopenia in the clinical settings commonly encountered by the hematology consultant is then described.

### Reversible myelofibrosis secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus [^113wVuXy]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Pancytopenia due to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is rarely reported, and among those reported, it is mostly due to immunologically mediated cell destruction. Pancytopenia due to bone marrow fibrosis secondary to SLE is an extremely rare entity. Myelofibrosis secondary to SLE per se is reported only in 21 cases in the literature. Ours probably is the 22nd case report on SLE with myelofibrosis. Primary presentation of SLE with bleeding manifestation is also a rare phenomenon. Partial to complete regression of myelofibrosis is noted following treatment in secondary myelofibrosis caused by SLE. We report a case of a woman in her late 40s who presented to us with bleeding manifestations of petechial rash and menorrhagia, which on further evaluation showed pancytopenia due to myelofibrosis secondary to SLE. Our case underlines multiple features like primary bleeding manifestation and regression of myelofibrosis following treatment which is rarely reported in association with SLE.

### Immune pancytopenia after chemotherapy in a patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^117QgMui]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

During treatment for malignant lymphoma, cytopenia can develop for several reasons. In the treatment of cytopenia, various possibilities should be considered because inadequate treatment causes exacerbation of cytopenia and can lead to fatal conditions, such as infection and bleeding. Herein, we describe immune pancytopenia 3months after the last exposure to chemotherapy in a patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). She suffered from severe pancytopenia after two courses of rituximab and bendamustine therapy for a second relapse of DLBCL. Immune pancytopenia was diagnosed with bone marrow tests and the presence of autoantibodies; it promptly resolved after initiation of prednisolone therapy. Clinicians should be aware of immune cytopenia and monitor for it carefully, even if patients have already finished chemotherapy treatment.

### Unexplained chronic cytopenia: is it idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance or myelodysplastic syndrome [^112CnrUT]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Idiopathic cytopenia is a condition where there is a decrease in peripheral blood counts causing either anaemia, leucopoenia and thrombocytopaenia. Most cases of cytopenia reveal a cause on further workup. But very rarely, in some cases, a definitive cause could not be identified. Unexplained cytopenia becomes challenging and poses difficulty in diagnosis and management. Discriminating these groups of bone marrow failure disorders from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) becomes an important clinical question. We describe a case of a middle-aged Hispanic woman who presented with pancytopenia and on extensive workup did not reveal any specific cause. Her bone marrow examination revealed severely reduced megakaryocytes but with normal haemopoiesis of other lineages. Cytogenetics, flow cytometry, comprehensive next-generation whole genomic analysis did not reveal any abnormalities. She fit the criteria for idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance rather than MDS. She remained asymptomatic and her counts never improved with immunosuppressives or thrombopoietin mimetics.

### Management of uterine bleeding during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^111CxgGi]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is an effective treatment strategy for a variety of hematologic disorders, but patients are at risk for dysfunctional coagulation and abnormal bleeding. Gynecologists are often consulted before transplant for management of abnormal uterine bleeding, which may be particularly challenging in this context.

Case

A premenopausal woman with MonoMAC (a rare adult-onset immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by monocytopenia and Mycobacterium avium complex infections resulting from mutations in GATA2, a crucial gene in early hematopoiesis) presented with pancytopenia, evolving leukemia, and recent strokes, necessitating anticoagulation. During preparation for hematopoietic stem cell transplant, she experienced prolonged menorrhagia requiring transfusions. Surgical therapy was contraindicated, and medical management was successful only when combined with balloon tamponade.

Conclusion

Balloon tamponade may be a potentially life-saving adjunct to medical therapy for control of uterine hemorrhage before hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

### How to approach thrombocytopenia [^113h8nQU]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic finding with variable clinical expression. A low platelet count may be the initial manifestation of infections such as HIV and hepatitis C virus or it may reflect the activity of life-threatening disorders such as the thrombotic microangiopathies. A correct identification of the causes of thrombocytopenia is crucial for the appropriate management of these patients. In this review, we present a systematic evaluation of adults with thrombocytopenia. The approach is clearly different between outpatients, who are frequently asymptomatic and in whom we can sometimes indulge in sophisticated and relatively lengthy investigations, and the dramatic presentation of acute thrombocytopenia in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit, which requires immediate intervention and for which only a few diagnostic tests are available. A brief discussion of the most common etiologies seen in both settings is provided.

### Hematological response of pancytopenia to glucocorticoids in patients with sheehan's syndrome [^111GWErd]. Pituitary (2012). Low credibility.

Sheehan's syndrome presents with panhypopituitarism after childbirth, usually preceded by post partum hemorrhage. Hematological abnormalities like pancytopenia with hypocellular marrow in these patients are reported rarely. Though multiple hormone deficiencies may contribute to Pancytopenia in Sheehan's syndrome, complete recovery is observed after achieving eucortisolemic and euthyroid state. The predominant role of thyroxine or glucocorticoids in reversing pancytopenia in these patients has not been studied. We present the clinical, hormonal, hematological course and response to glucocorticoids in a patient of Sheehan's syndrome presenting with pancytopenia. Complete recovery of pancytopenia was observed after achieving eucortisolemic state thus concluding that gulcocorticoid replacement is sufficient to reverse pancytopenia in these patients.

### A coronavirus disease-2019 induced pancytopenia [^11652egD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

As the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) pandemic progresses, various hematologic complications have emerged, often centered around the hypercoagulable state. However, pancytopenia represents a rare but serious complication from SARS-CoV2 infection. While lymphopenia is a common finding, concomitant acute anemia and thrombocytopenia are not commonly reported. We describe a novel case of SARS-CoV2 pancytopenia in a 40-year-old male without active risk factors for cell line derangements but subsequent critical illness.

### How well do platelets prevent bleeding? [^114DaWY2]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Prophylactic platelet transfusions are used to reduce the risk of spontaneous bleeding in patients with treatment- or disease-related severe thrombocytopenia. A prophylactic platelet-transfusion threshold of < 10 × 10³/µL has been shown to be safe in stable hematology/oncology patients. A higher threshold and/or larger or more frequent platelet doses may be appropriate for patients with clinical features associated with an increased risk of bleeding such as high fevers, sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, anticoagulation therapy, or splenomegaly. Unique factors in the outpatient setting may support the use of a higher platelet-transfusion threshold and/or dose of platelets. A prophylactic platelet-transfusion strategy has been shown to be associated with a lower risk of bleeding compared with no prophylaxis in adult patients receiving chemotherapy but not for autologous transplant recipients. Despite the use of prophylactic platelet transfusions, a high incidence (50% to 70%) of spontaneous bleeding remains. Using a higher threshold or larger doses of platelets does not change this risk. New approaches to reduce the risk of spontaneous bleeding, including antifibrinolytic therapy, are currently under study.

### Hematologic emergencies: recognition and initial management [^1152oXzi]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Hematologic emergencies are bleeding or clotting disorders that are hereditary or acquired and must be treated emergently to avoid significant morbidity or mortality. Patients experiencing a hematologic emergency may present with spontaneous bleeding, jaundice, petechiae, or purpura. Initial diagnostic testing should include a complete blood count. Patients who have bleeding associated with a hereditary disorder should receive clotting factor replacement before diagnostic testing. Acute chest syndrome is an uncommon but serious complication of sickle cell disease. Hemolysis caused by autoimmune disorders or iatrogenic errors from blood product transfusions has a distinct clinical presentation and requires immediate action. Severe thrombocytopenia presenting as immune or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura should be differentiated and treated appropriately. Disseminated intravascular coagulation and trauma coagulopathy are sometimes confused with each other, but both can cause serious injury and require unique treatments. Primary care physicians should promptly recognize patients who require emergent referral to a hematologic specialist.

Current approaches to the treatment of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia

The response to significant CIT has not been codified in guidelines and there are few studies to describe the appropriate approach to CIT. Much depends upon the underlying goals of the treatment of the cancer patient; different levels of risk assessment need to be brought into play for those being treated for a cure compared to those being treated for palliation. Overall, it is reasonable when confronted with CIT first to assess the underlying need for chemotherapy and the goals of treatment for that particular patient. A clinical assessment of bleeding risk for patients is also important to undertake, especially if patients are receiving anticoagulant drugs or other therapies that might increase bleeding. What follows is the synthesis of the data and the author's personal experience over the past four decades:

- **If possible, treat any other underlying cause of thrombocytopenia**: stop antibiotics, treat infections, and control coagulopathy.

Hematologic adverse events

Clinical presentation and epidemiology

Although rare, hematologic irAEs have been described following ICI treatment and the literature includes case reports of hemolytic anemia, red cell aplasia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, myelodysplasia and hemophilia A. An active hematologic irAE also needs to be distinguished from transient changes in laboratory values that can occur during initiation of an immune response. Post treatment lymphcytosis, eosinophilia, neutrophilia and monocytosis can be observed and are not typically clinically significant though some reports suggest they may be prognostic. Persistent post treatment cytopenias or progressive cytopenias should be evaluated for autoimmune causes as well as with a peripheral smear, reticulocyte count and assessment for hemolysis. Causal attribution is complicated by the fact that malignant disease and its complications can also lead to cytopenias. Since the CTCAE definition of thrombocytopenia describes absolute platelet levels rather than an indication of changes in cell number, it is not a reliable tool for evaluating potentially life-threatening ICI-induced thrombocytopenia.

Diagnostic evaluation

Complete blood count (CBC) should be monitored at the start of immune therapy, at intervals during treatment, and periodically in long-term survivors who are no longer receiving treatment. Development of anemia should prompt evaluation for common causes such as GI bleeding, cancer-related anemia or cancer progression, or causative drugs, including a work up for hemolysis. If the source of anemia cannot be identified, bone marrow biopsy may be indicated to rule out red cell aplasia. Similarly, any patient who develops thrombocytopenia or neutropenia should be evaluated for potential causes including medication-related cell destruction or disease progression; in cases where an obvious cause cannot be identified, an autoimmune cause should be considered and investigated accordingly.

When to refer

In general, patients with unexplained cytopenias should be referred to hematology for evaluation.

### Assessing thrombocytopenia in the intensive care unit: the past, present, and future [^1151n1u4]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is common among patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms may contribute, including thrombin-mediated platelet activation, dilution, hemophagocytosis, extracellular histones, ADAMTS13 deficiency, and complement activation. From the clinical perspective, the development of thrombocytopenia in the ICU usually indicates serious organ system derangement and physiologic decompensation rather than a primary hematologic disorder. Thrombocytopenia is associated with bleeding, transfusion, and adverse clinical outcomes including death, though few deaths are directly attributable to bleeding. The assessment of thrombocytopenia begins by looking back to the patient's medical history and presenting illness. This past information, combined with careful observation of the platelet trajectory in the context of the patient's clinical course, offers clues to the diagnosis and prognosis. Management is primarily directed at the underlying disorder and transfusion of platelets to prevent or treat clinical bleeding. Optimal platelet transfusion strategies are not defined, and a conservative approach is recommended.

### Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis of myelodysplastic syndromes [^115tKvuF]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a group of underrecognized hematologic clonal malignancies with variable propensity for leukemic transformation that can present a diagnostic challenge because they lack hallmark symptoms. MDS can present with varying degrees of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, and at presentation can range from indolent to life threatening. The clinician should have a heightened level of suspicion when treating elderly patients and those with prior exposure to chemotherapy, radiation, and environmental toxins in the presence of unexplained cytopenias. Chronic anemia should not be considered a natural consequence of aging. Approximately 1 in 6 patients with unexplained anemia may have findings compatible with MDS, suggesting that MDS should be considered higher in the differential diagnosis. Primary care physicians are encouraged to conduct comprehensive evaluations to exclude non-MDS-related causes for persistent cytopenias. Patients with pancytopenia, bicytopenia, or any persistent and unexplained isolated cytopenia (and particularly unexplained macrocytic anemia) should be referred to a specialist to establish a diagnosis.

Acquired aplastic anemia (aAA) characterized by peripheral pancytopenia and bone marrow aplasia is a rare and serious disorder. Differential diagnosis includes constitutional bone marrow failure syndromes and myelodysplastic disorders. Autoimmune reaction to altered hematopoietic stem cells highlights the underlying mechanism. Matched related donor allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the ideal pediatric treatment; alternative approaches include immunosuppressive therapy and use of eltrombopag. Progression to clonal disorders can occur. Recently, alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation outcomes have significantly improved. Despite advances, aAA continues to be a challenge for hematologists.

The purpose of this article is to provide the reader with a firm knowledge of the major causes of thrombocytopenia and their treatments, and to form a broad differential diagnosis, so that it will be clearer when to consider a rare etiology. The various etiologies are presented by known disease entities, grouped by age, and described as they would occur and be considered in a realistic clinical setting. A brief categorization of causes of thrombocytopenia by mechanism, notably abnormal platelet production, platelet destruction, or sequestration, is included. With each disease process, the pathophysiology as it is currently known is described and discussed.

### CAMT-MPL: congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia caused by MPL mutations-heterogeneity of a monogenic disorder-a comprehensive analysis of 56 patients [^114v3129]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia caused by deleterious homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in MPL (CAMT-MPL) is a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome presenting as an isolated thrombocytopenia at birth progressing to pancytopenia due to exhaustion of hematopoietic progenitors. The analysis of samples and clinical data from a large cohort of 56 patients with CAMT-MPL resulted in a detailed description of the clinical picture and reliable genotype-phenotype correlations for this rare disease. We extended the spectrum of CAMT causing MPL mutations regarding number (17 novel mutations) and impact. Clinical courses showed great variability with respect to the severity of thrombocytopenia, the development of pancytopenia and the consequences from bleedings. The most severe clinical problems were (i) intracranial bleedings pre- and perinatally and the resulting long-term consequences, and (ii) the development of aplastic anemia in the later course of the disease. An important and new finding was that thrombocytopenia was not detected at birth in a quarter of the patients. The rate of non-hematological abnormalities in CAMT-MPL was higher than described so far. Most of the anomalies were related to the head region (brain anomalies, ocular and orbital anomalies) and consequences of intracranial bleedings. The present study demonstrates a higher variability of clinical courses than described so far and has important implications on diagnosis and therapy. The diagnosis CAMT-MPL has to be considered even for those patients who are inconspicuous in the first months of life or show somatic anomalies typical for other inherited bone marrow failure syndromes.

### Prediction of life-threatening and disabling bleeding in patients with AML receiving intensive induction chemotherapy [^1178uWff]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bleeding is a major cause of early morbidity and mortality in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated with intensive chemotherapy. Despite monitored, hospital-based treatment and standardized thresholds for prophylactic transfusions, cooperative group trials have reported Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 to 5 bleeding in 2% to 8% of AML patients. Prospective identification of patients at increased risk for high-grade bleeding could improve overall treatment outcomes through the development of focused preventive strategies.

Widely used predictive models have enabled the improved definition of overall induction fitness but do not predict cause-specific outcomes or justify specific strategies for risk mitigation. Bleeding represents a particular challenge due to the multifactorial and dynamic nature of risk. Various factors have been associated with the risk of high-grade bleeding, specifically in leukemia patients, including severe thrombocytopenia, reduced platelet function, abnormal coagulation parameters, hyperleukocytosis, older age, and female sex, but these were identified in mixed disease cohorts, including patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and other myeloid malignancies, or focused on bleeding in specific sites, such as the central nervous system (CNS). Risk factors for overall life-threatening and disabling bleeding events in newly diagnosed, non-APL AML patients receiving initial treatment with intensive chemotherapy have not been specifically studied.

We, therefore, used a consecutive cohort of adults with (non-APL) AML treated with intensive anthracycline-based chemotherapy to determine which pretreatment clinical, laboratory, and genetic factors were associated with the development of life-threatening and disabling (grade 4) bleeding according to the World Health Organization (WHO) bleeding assessment scale. In order to enable prospective identification of the subset of AML patients in whom enhanced monitoring and supportive care should be focused, we developed a grade 4 bleeding prediction score and tested it in an independent validation cohort.

### Impact of HLA alloimmunization on clinical outcomes of severe aplastic anemia treated with immunosuppressive therapy [^1126Aket]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immune aplastic anemia (iAA) presents as pancytopenia and a hypocellular marrow; the underlying etiology is immune dysregulation secondary to an autoimmune T-cell mediated destruction of hematopoietic and progenitor stem cells. Treatment depends on age, fitness, and donor availability, and includes hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or immunosuppressive therapy (IST).

Patients with severe AA (SAA) are often platelet-transfusion dependent until therapeutic intervention results in response; transfusion requirement can extend for months to years in those without a response. Older literature suggests that patients with AA may have higher risk of alloimmunization compared to those with hematologic malignancies, potentially due to the disease's underlying immune etiology. Traditionally, platelet transfusion is recommended to keep counts above 10 × 10³/μL with a higher minimum transfusion threshold in the case of bleeding, fevers, and/or during antithymocyte globulin (ATG) administration.

### Fever, pancytopenia, and elevated D-dimer in a 95-year-old woman with ehrlichiosis: a case report [^11276ccJ]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

This case provides an atypical, dramatic presentation of ehrlichiosis in a 95-year-old woman. Severe laboratory derangements were concerning, and her treatment course was notable for both pulmonary emboli and a gastrointestinal bleed. Nonetheless, she denied symptoms, and this reinforces the principle that older adults experience systemic illness differently than their younger counterparts. Our patient was independent in her activities of daily living and was able to be safely discharged home. The risk-benefit discussion behind choosing to place an IVC filter was guided by her baseline functional status, and device retrieval is anticipated to happen in the coming months. Overall, our case highlights a rare presentation of ehrlichiosis in a 95-year-old woman and emphasizes the need to remain vigilant for atypical presentations in geriatrics.

### Thrombocytopenia in cancer patients [^1173Koum]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a frequent complication of cancer and its treatment. The causes of thrombocytopenia in cancer patients can be diverse and multifactorial. Systemic chemotherapy is the most frequent cause of thrombocytopenia. The degree and duration thrombocytopenia depends upon whether the chemotherapeutic treatment is myeloablative, as used in stem cell transplants, or non-myeloablative, as typically used in solid non-hematologic malignancies. Additional causes of significant thrombocytopenia include tumor involvement of bone marrow and spleen; microangiopathic disorders such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic uremia syndrome. Lymphoproliferative malignancies can also be associated with secondary immune thrombocytopenia. Due to the broad differential diagnosis associated with cancer related thrombocytopenia, a careful diagnostic evaluation is indicated. The goal of treatment should be to maintain a safe platelet count to allow effective treatment of the underlying malignancy, prevent bleeding complications and to minimize the use of platelet product transfusion.

### CAMT-MPL: congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia caused by MPL mutations-heterogeneity of a monogenic disorder-a comprehensive analysis of 56 patients [^113kXYh3]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Although CAMT is regarded to be a preleukemic syndrome in most of the recent reviews, only weak evidence for this assumption exists. One single patient with CAMT and confirmed MPL mutation has been reported to develop a pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Increased accumulation of chromosomal aberrations, however, has been observed in our and previous studies. The exhaustion of hematopoietic stem cells due to MPL deficiency may be the reason for both, the acquisition of pre-leukemic cellular alterations due to increased hematopoietic stress, but also for early development of aplastic anemia leading to death or replacement of the hematopoietic system by means of HSCT, thereby preventing the development of overt leukemia. The debate about CAMT-MPL as a preleukemic syndrome therefore might be of less relevance.

Genotype-phenotype correlations in CAMT-MPL have led us to our concept of CAMT I and II groups: a complete loss of MPL function results in persistently low platelet counts and a fast progression into pancytopenia in CAMT I patients whereas a residual function of the receptor leads to a milder course with a transient increase of platelet counts in the first year of life in CAMT II patients.

The data from the present study allow for additional conclusions of clinical relevance

- the course of the disease is mainly determined by the type of mutation. The same MPL mutations lead to high similarities in the hematological courses of patients, even if they are from different families or different ethnical background (e.g. mild course in patients with c.391+5G > C).

- the time course of pancytopenia development for patients with same MPL mutations is more variable than the course of thrombocytopenia. This could be caused by accelerated exhaustion of hematopoietic progenitors due to frequent bleedings or infections in some patients.

- all patients with mutations leading to a complete loss of function (CAMT I) had a similar course with constantly severe thrombocytopenia. Platelet counts at birth and in the further course never exceed 50. and all of them showed a transition to pancytopenia. A complete MPL deficiency is probable in patients showing signs of aplastic anemia in the first months of life.

### Case report: COVID associated pancytopenia unmasking previously undiagnosed pernicious anemia [^114MKHXW]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

We are still in the process of investigating hematological alterations because of COVID-19. In the setting of COVID-induced pancytopenia it is important to cast a broad net of differentials to catch other risk factors. More studies are needed to determine whether this new virus presents notable differences in the mechanisms that produce pancytopenia with respect to others. But luckily, it appears that most patients with COVID-induced pancytopenia will recover marrow function as they recover from the COVID-19 syndrome with addressing of underlying risk factors.

Management of vascular events — bleeding in PV and ET advises to rule out other potential causes and treat coexisting causes as necessary, to withhold aspirin until bleeding is under control with consideration of appropriate cytoreductive therapy to optimize platelet counts while minimizing toxicities, and to obtain coagulation tests to evaluate for acquired VWS and/or other coagulopathies in patients undergoing high-risk surgical procedures or with elevated platelet count, splenomegaly, or unexplained bleeding. In unanticipated gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly with splenomegaly, portal hypertension, and gastric varices, special consultation for endoscopic evaluation with a hepatologist or a GI specialist is recommended.

### The frequency of bleeding complications in patients with haematological malignancy following the introduction of a stringent prophylactic platelet transfusion policy [^112C6vRb]. British Journal of Haematology (2002). Low credibility.

Indications for platelet transfusion remain controversial and are frequently based on arbitrary numerical criteria. In October 2000, we introduced a stringent prophylactic-platelet transfusion policy < 10 × 10⁹/l for stable patients and < 20 × 10⁹/l in the presence of major bleeding or additional risk factors. A trigger of < 50 × 10⁹/l was introduced for patients undergoing invasive procedures. A prospective analysis was performed measuring the frequency of minor and major bleeding events, morbidity, mortality and duration of pancytopenia. Blood product usage was assessed and health care savings measured. A total of 98 patients were evaluated on 2147 patient study days and 271 bleeding episodes were recorded. Major bleeding occurred on 1.39% (30/2147) of the study days when platelet counts were < 10 × 10⁹/l and 2.3% (50/2147) of the study days when platelet counts were 10–20 × 10⁹/l. In patients with platelets > 20 × 10⁹/l, there were 117 major bleeding episodes observed on 5.4% of the study days. In patients with no identified additional risk factors present, major haemorrhages were recorded in 0.51% (11/2147) of the study days in patients with platelet counts ≥ 10 × 10⁹/l. There was a 36% reduction in platelet units transfused compared with retrospective data when an arbitrary transfusion trigger of 20 × 10⁹/l was in place (P = < 0.02). Of note, a 16% reduction in red cell transfusions was recorded. These data confirm that the introduction of a transfusion trigger of < 10 × 10⁹/l in the absence of fresh bleeding and sepsis (> 38 degrees C) is safe and has a significant impact on overall hospital transfusion costs.

### Aplastic anaemia [^112sHgpH]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Aplastic anaemia is a rare haemopoietic stem-cell disorder that results in pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow. Although most cases are acquired, there are unusual inherited forms. The pathophysiology of acquired aplastic anaemia is immune mediated in most cases; autoreactive lymphocytes mediate the destruction of haemopoietic stem cells. Environmental exposures, such as to drugs, viruses, and toxins, are thought to trigger the aberrant immune response in some patients, but most cases are classified as idiopathic. Similarly to other autoimmune diseases, aplastic anaemia has a varied clinical course; some patients have mild symptoms that necessitate little or no therapy, whereas others present with life-threatening pancytopenia representing a medical emergency. Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and myelodysplastic syndrome commonly arise in patients with aplastic anaemia, showing a pathophysiological link between these disorders. Acquired aplastic anaemia can be effectively treated by allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation, immunosuppression (generally antithymocyte globulin and ciclosporin), and high-dose cyclophosphamide.

### Concurrent aortic valve replacement and splenectomy for Q-fever endocarditis with massive splenomegaly and pancytopenia [^116JY3qb]. JTCVS Techniques (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

C. burnetii is an obligate intracellular gram-negative bacteria and a rare but described source of endocarditis, with 1 review attributing an estimated 5% of worldwide endocarditis cases to this zoonotic bacteria. The same review estimated that splenomegaly is present in one-half of patients with Q-fever endocarditis. In cases of massive splenomegaly and endocarditis (of any microbial etiology), the traditional timing of operations is splenectomy followed by AVR, to prevent any reinfection of the newly implanted valve; however, there are several reports of performing AVR followed by splenectomy with satisfactory results. Concurrent splenectomy and AVR has been reported in a few clinical contexts — specifically, in cases of large splenic abscesses with hemodynamically significant endocarditisand cases of severe immune thrombocytopenia associated with severe AS. In our patient, severe pancytopenia coupled with concern for a splenic bleed and hemodynamically significant AR is what ultimately prompted us to perform the operations concurrently.

This case underscores how even the most complex of multiorgan endocarditis cases can be approached safely with proper preoperative planning and multidisciplinary care to achieve excellent clinical results. Further study is warranted on the short- and long-term outcomes of patients who undergo concurrent splenectomy and valvular cardiac surgery.

### Aplastic anemia: management of pediatric patients [^115NiSoq]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Aplastic anemia is a term describing the common findings of pancytopenia and marrow hypoplasia arising from a variety of disease states, including acquired aplastic anemia and a variety of congenital marrow failure states. The management of children with these disorders has been confounded by difficulties of diagnosis. The availability of molecular testing has assisted in partial resolution of this problem but has raised new issues, such as the potential of genetic predisposition and the management of asymptomatic individuals with molecular markers. Longitudinal data from large cohort studies and disease registries are providing a rational basis for making more informed treatment decisions for children with these disorders. In particular, the ability to subset patients more accurately has improved triage of treatments. Approaches to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT), using both conventional and alternative donors, are changing rapidly, and the long-term sequelae of newer approaches are not entirely clear. Improved diagnosis and longer survival have fostered an understanding of the multidisciplinary approach necessary to manage both the underlying problems and the significant sequelae of treatment in both acquired and congenital disease.

### Introduction to acquired and inherited bone marrow failure [^115VtHZe]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Acquired aplastic anemia and inherited bone marrow failure syndromes both present with pancytopenia and must be distinguished because they have differences in treatment decisions and continued monitoring requirements. Advances in the genetic interrogation of patient samples have led to identification of inherited germline diseases and appreciation that patients with inherited bone marrow failure disorders may be normal in appearance with few expected clinical clues. Somatic mutations in aplastic anemia may have prognostic value. Hematopoietic stem cells from inherited marrow failure diseases can correct the proliferative defect and may develop further somatic mutations that progress to myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia.

Disorders of hemostasis are an additional challenge in these patients but can be assessed and managed in a systematic fashion. Of particular importance to the emergency clinician are the iatrogenic causes of abnormal hemostasis.

### CAMT-MPL: congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia caused by MPL mutations-heterogeneity of a monogenic disorder-a comprehensive analysis of 56 patients [^116QH8e6]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

- missense mutations predicted to allow a residual function of the MPL receptor lead to a more variable course of CAMT. The most severe phenotypes, comparable to CAMT I (severe thrombocytopenia, early development of aplasia), were observed in patients with mutations p. Leu169His and p. Trp154Arg. Milder phenotypes (late detection of thrombocytopenia and delayed development of aplasia) were observed in patients with mutations p. Asp295Tyr and p. Pro394Ser and missense mutations affecting the intracytoplasmic domain.

- milder phenotypes with late development of aplastic anemia (respectively none during the period of record) have also been observed in patients with splice site mutations allowing for a residual normal splicing, namely c.391+5G > C and c.212+5G > A.

- patients with germ line MPL mutations and a late onset form of amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia or aplastic anemia (e.g. patients CAMT058, CAMT101, CAMT102 with moderate thrombocytopenia detected at the age of > 2 years) should be also regarded as CAMT-MPL. This includes the patients previously described as familial aplastic anemia.

- there may exist a small subgroup of CAMT II patients without development of pancytopenia. For patients with new mutations predicted to have minor impact on function or with mutations previously detected in patients with a mild course (namely c.391+5G > C, c.212+5G > A, or p. Pro275Thr) it might be appropriate to wait for first signs of bone marrow failure before proceeding to HSCT, especially if no appropriate family donor is available.

- type and localization of MPL mutations are not predictive for pre- and perinatal intracranial hemorrhages. There are no differences in the frequency and severity of these bleedings between patient groups CAMT I and CAMT II. The existence of a deleterious MPL mutation is a major risk factor for the occurrence of intracranial bleedings.

- structural and clinical non hematologic abnormalities in CAMT-MPL are not correlated with specific mutations.

- there is a small group of patients who present clinically as CAMT, but in whom a deleterious MPL mutation can only be detected in one allele. Possible explanations for the seeming inconsistency between genotype and phenotype include somatic mosaicism, deletions or changes in regulatory sequences that prevent the translation of a functional protein, or - rather unlikely especially in family cases - accidental coincidence.

### Case of leptospirosis causing pancytopenia [^112JEyXB]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Leptospirosis is caused by the spirochete genus Leptospira and is endemic within many tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Leptospirosis often poses a diagnostic challenge in areas where it is uncommon. It is described as a biphasic illness that begins after an average incubation period of 5–14 days. The acute, bacteraemic phase manifests with fever, myalgias, and headaches and lasts around 7–10 days. Other symptoms include a non-productive cough, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Conjunctival suffusion, marked by conjunctival redness, can help distinguish leptospirosis from other infectious illnesses. Immune-mediated organ damage and systemic complications usually begin more than 7 days from symptom onset.

The most common laboratory findings include mild transaminitis, neutrophilia and hyponatraemia, and abnormal urinalysis (microscopic haematuria, pyuria and proteinuria).LP is often prompted, given that severe headache is a common symptom. The LP may demonstrate an aseptic meningitis picture with a neutrophilic or lymphocytic pleocytosis, normal glucose and mild elevation in protein.

Thrombocytopenia is a well-documented haematological complication of infection. It is often mild and is often associated with renal failure and a poorer prognosis. It occurs in up to half of Leptospiral infections, with underlying pathophysiology still unknown. It is thought a combination of (1) disseminated intravascular activation (DIC), (2) platelet death induced by Leptospiral toxins, (3) decreased production of platelets by the bone marrow megakaryocytes, (4) platelet overactivation by bacterial components leading to platelet consumption and (5) platelet clearance mediated by platelet autoantibodies.

Pancytopenia is reported in only a number of cases as a haematological manifestation in Leptospiral infections, and the true incidence is unknown. A case series described in Israel reported pancytopenia in 28% of patients. More recent case reports do not corroborate this high incidence. The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, and may be several processes working in tandem or independently to affect the blood cell lineages. Bone marrow aspirates noted in previous case reports indicate that the cytopenias may arise from bone marrow suppression marked by significant cellular hypoplasia. Some authors suggest that the pancytopenia could be attributed to DIC, a toxin, or cytotoxin-mediated mechanism as a direct complication of leptospiral vasculitis or as a general phenomenon of septicaemia.

### Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes: the classic and the novel [^1115xYym]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

What may raise suspicion of myelodysplastic syndromes

MDS is suspected when there are appropriate clinical and laboratory findings, especially in the elderly. MDS symptoms are non-specific and range from none (asymptomatic) to weakness and fatigue. There may be cardiac complications, due to the common anemia (Table 1),5,6,13, and a decreased neutrophil count might be associated with recurrent infections. Patients may have epistaxis, gingival bleeding or easy bruising if their platelet count is low or if the platelets do not function normally.

Other causes of anemia or other cytopenias must be ruled out first. This requires taking a careful history to search for these etiologies. These may include nutritional deficiencies (folic acid and vitamin B12, especially in vegetarians), medications, alcohol and tobacco use, or viral infection. The patient's history may reveal prior exposure to radiation or chemotherapy, or a familial predisposition to hematologic disease.

Table 1.
Making the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes.

A thorough history can help to rule out conditions such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, aplastic anemia, and MPN that may mimic MDS clinically. Physical examination is usually non-specific and with no abnormal findings. For details, please see Table 1.

### Ocular manifestations of idiopathic aplastic anemia: retrospective study and literature review [^115ZLMWj]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Aplastic anemia (AA) is a bone marrow failure syndrome with an incidence of two per million in Western countries and 4–6 per million in Asia. AA commonly presents at between 15 and 25 years of age, with a second smaller peak after age 60 years. The pathophysiology involves immune-mediated destruction of hematopoietic stem cells causing pancytopenia and empty bone marrow. Potential factors related to bone marrow failure include viral infection, toxins, drug side effects, autoimmune diseases, and prior radiochemotherapy.–Exposure to the aforementioned factors together with diverse host genetic risk factors may account for different severity of cytopenia at presentation and diverse responsiveness to treatments such as immunosuppressive therapy. AA needs to be differentiated from aplastic crisis (transient cessation of bone marrow activity seen in sickle cell anemia, often triggered by parvovirus B19 infection and / or folic acid deficiency). Major concerns in AA include spontaneous severe bleeding and recurrent infections. Besides gingival or nasal bleeding, patients with AA may present with ocular hemorrhages. According to previous reports, AA patients with ocular findings appeared to have various degrees of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy syndrome with serious rheological shifts and hemorrhagic diathesis.–Occasionally, patients with these life-threatening hematological disorders can present initially to the ophthalmologist because this bone marrow failure syndrome can primarily manifest with ocular problems. Consequently, clinicians should be aware of the presence of the various ocular findings during physical inspection of AA patients. Herein, we analyzed single center data of patients diagnosed with idiopathic AA in Korea who were further examined for ocular manifestations seeking to relate the ocular and systemic findings. This is contrasted with a literature review and supplemented by a small collaborative case series outside Korea.

### Clonal hematopoietic mutations linked to platelet traits and the risk of thrombosis or bleeding [^114Z8s52]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

FANCA, FANCC

The proteins Fanconi anemia complementation group A and C (FANCA/C) are repair factors after DNA damage or apoptosis. Inherited mutations in either gene are seen in the disorder Fanconi anemia, where patients in 60–70% of the cases show a mutation in FANCA and in 15% a mutation in FANCC. Such patients suffer from progressive bone marrow failure, pancytopenia and predisposition to cancer. Knockout mouse studies revealed that FANCA is needed for normal megakaryopoiesis and platelet production. Megakaryocytes in the deficient mice were found to be in a senescent state.

In humans, heterozygous mutations of FANCA are observed in a proportion of patients with AML. However, carriers of such mutations do not seem to have a significant risk of developing cancer. On the other hand, FANCA deletion mutations, especially in combination with other germline mutations, might contribute to breast cancer susceptibility. The phenotype coupled to somatic mutations in FANCA and/or FANCC is probably linked to genomic instability caused by defective FANC proteins. How these somatic mutations contribute to CHIP-related CVD needs to be established.

GATA2

In immature hematopoietic stem cells, the transcription factor GATA-binding factor 2 (GATA2) is expressed earlier than GATA1, and becomes down-regulated upon differentiation. This has also been observed in Gata2 -knockout mice, revealing that GATA2 is required for hematopoietic stem cell and progenitor cell development. In humans, congenital GATA2 deficiency is accompanied by a hypocellular and dysplastic bone marrow, resulting in low platelet counts. Furthermore, germline deletion mutations in the GATA2 gene are associated with an increased predisposition to infection, AML, CMML or MDS.

On the other hand, a somatic mutation (L359V) in GATA2 has been identified in approximately 10% of patients in the progression phase of CML. This concerns a gain-of-function resulting in increased transcription factor activity, in contrast to gene deletion. Reports indicate that in approximately 50% of patients with any GATA2 mutation, the megakaryocyte development is abnormal. Unlike GATA1, GATA2 regulates platelet GPIIb rather than GPIb expression. Variants of GATA2 have also been associated with increased susceptibility for coronary artery disease, linking this gene to CHIP.

### New onset pancytopenia in adults: a review of underlying pathologies and their associated clinical and laboratory findings [^111M66xJ]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2014). Low credibility.

Abstract Pancytopenia is regularly encountered in hematology practice, yet there exist few published assessments of the frequencies of various etiologies, and these frequencies exhibit substantial geographic variation. We reviewed bone marrow specimens from pancytopenic adults to determine the most common etiologies and to identify associations with clinical and laboratory findings. Of 132 patients with no history of hematolymphoid neoplasia, no prior bone marrow study for pancytopenia and no recent cytotoxic chemotherapy, 64% had clonal hematopoietic disorders. Most common were myeloid processes: 26% of patients had acute myeloid leukemia, and 17% had myelodysplasia. Less common were lymphoid neoplasms such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (6%), hairy cell leukemia (5%) and precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (4%). Among non-clonal cases, the most common specific diagnoses were aplastic anemia (5%), megaloblastic anemia (2%) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related changes (2%). Clonal diagnoses were associated with more severe cytopenias than non-clonal cases. Circulating nucleated erythroid precursors, immature granulocytes and blasts were seen more frequently in clonal cases. Nearly two-thirds of cases of new onset pancytopenia in adults in our North American practice setting have a clonal etiology, with myeloid neoplasms being most common. Blood counts and peripheral smear findings can provide insights into the likelihood of a clonal etiology.

### Thrombocytopenia in the intensive care unit patient [^114dhxRc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

The many comorbidities in the severely ill patient also make thrombocytopenia very common (∼40%) in intensive care unit patients. The risk of bleeding is high with severe thrombocytopenia and is enhanced in intensive care patients with mild or moderately low platelet counts when additional factors are present that interfere with normal hemostatic mechanisms (eg, platelet function defects, hyperfibrinolysis, invasive procedures, or catheters). Even if not associated with bleeding, low platelet counts often influence patient management and may prompt physicians to withhold or delay necessary invasive interventions, reduce the intensity of anticoagulation, order prophylactic platelet transfusion, or change anticoagulants due to fear of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. One approach to identify potential causes of thrombocytopenia that require specific interventions is to consider the dynamics of platelet count changes. The relative decrease in platelet counts within the first 3 to 4 days after major surgery is informative about the magnitude of the trauma or blood loss, whereas the dynamic of the platelet count course thereafter shows whether or not the physiologic compensatory mechanisms are working. A slow and gradual fall in platelet counts developing over 5 to 7 days is more likely to be caused by consumptive coagulopathy or bone marrow failure, whereas any abrupt decrease (within 1–2 days) in platelet counts manifesting after an initial increase in platelet counts approximately 1 to 2 weeks after surgery strongly suggests immunologic causes, including heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, other drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia, and posttransfusion purpura.

### Management of thrombocytopenia in cancer [^113tvaDK]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common finding in cancer patients and can have different and/or multifactorial pathogenesis. While in solid tumors it occurs often as a consequence of chemotherapy treatment, it is frequently observed at diagnosis in patients with hematological malignancies being aggravated to a potentially life-threatening level during chemotherapy. Other associated conditions (infections, drugs, consumption coagulopathy etc.) can add to influence the degree of thrombocytopenia and the inherent risk of bleeding and they should be recognized and corrected to improve platelet count. Platelet transfusion remains the cornerstone of treatment, but its use should always be weighted taking into consideration the actual risk of bleeding to avoid inappropriate use and wasting of resources. While in hematological malignancies a threshold level of 10,000 platelets/μL is widely accepted as the minimal level prompting prophylactic platelet transfusion, this limit is less frequently observed in patients with solid tumors and platelet transfusions are usually administered for a few days, possibly at a higher platelet level. Alternative treatments for the latter patients including thrombopoietin-mimetic agents are increasingly used and found to be promising.

### RBCs regulate platelet function and hemostasis under shear conditions through biophysical and biochemical means [^112ziAec]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Red blood cells (RBCs) have been hypothesized to support hemostasis by facilitating platelet margination and releasing platelet-activating factors such as adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP). Significant knowledge gaps remain regarding how RBCs influence platelet function, especially in (patho)physiologically relevant hemodynamic conditions. Here, we present results showing how RBCs affect platelet function and hemostasis in conditions of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia and how the biochemical and biophysical properties of RBCs regulate platelet function at the blood and vessel wall interface and in the fluid phase under flow conditions. We found that RBCs promoted platelet deposition to collagen under flow conditions in moderate (50 × 10³/μL) but not severe (10 × 10³/μL) thrombocytopenia in vitro. Reduction in hematocrit by 45% increased bleeding in mice with hemolytic anemia. In contrast, bleeding diathesis was observed in mice with a 90% but not with a 60% reduction in platelet counts. RBC transfusion improved hemostasis by enhancing fibrin clot formation at the site of vascular injury in mice with severe pancytopenia induced by total body irradiation. Altering membrane deformability changed the ability of RBCs to promote shear-induced platelet aggregation. RBC-derived ADP contributed to platelet activation and aggregation in vitro under pathologically high shear stresses, as observed in patients supported by left ventricular assist devices. These findings demonstrate that RBCs support platelet function and hemostasis through multiple mechanisms, both at the blood and vessel wall interface and in the fluidic phase of circulation.

### Thrombosis, major bleeding, and mortality in 1079 patients with myelofibrosis: a matched population-based study [^114iEJAx]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Myelofibrosis (MF) is a Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by various degrees of bone marrow fibrosis, clonal proliferation of myeloid cells, and extramedullary hematopoiesis.MF occurs de novo (primary MF [PMF]) or secondary (secondary MF [SMF]) to polycythemia vera (PV; post-PV MF) or essential thrombocythemia (ET; post-ET MF). The clinical presentation of MF varies, ranging from asymptomatic, with only thrombocytosis as a sign of the disease in early-stage prefibrotic MF, to massive infiltration of bone marrow fibrosis in overt MF, with severe constitutional symptoms such as hepatosplenomegaly, fatigue, night sweats, and progressive pancytopenia. Thromboembolic events and bleeding are known complications in MF, but previous studies reporting on the frequency of thrombosis and bleeding have often been based on small cohorts, with populations of mixed MPN diagnoses, and seldom included controls. The aim of this nationwide study is to assess the frequency of arterial and venous events, major bleeding, all-cause stroke, and all-cause mortality (ACM) in PMF and SMF compared to matched controls. Secondly, we investigate whether the rates of the outcomes vary across the different therapies used in MF, and lastly, we seek to identify risk factors for thromboembolic events and major bleeding among patients with MF.

### An unusual presentation of portal vein thrombosis in a 2-year-old girl [^115y3TeH]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is the most common cause of extrahepatic portal vein obstruction in children. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and splenomegaly are the most common presenting features. PVT diagnosis is usually delayed in the absence of upper GI bleeding and many children undergo a hematologic work-up due to splenomegaly and signs of hypersplenism. Here, we present a case of a 2-year-old girl who had pancytopenia and splenomegaly. The hematologic work-up including a bone marrow aspirate was unrevealing and she was thought to have viral-induced bone marrow suppression and severe iron deficiency anemia. She presented 2 months later with hematemesis and abdominal CT angiography confirmed the diagnosis of PVT with portal cavernoma. Conclusion: PVT should be suspected in any child who presents with afebrile splenomegaly and signs of hypersplenism even in the absence of upper GI bleeding.

Patients with radioulnar synostosis with amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia 1 (RUSAT1) caused by HOXA11 mutation have a phenotype similar to RUSAT2, but evolution to bone marrow aplasia is less frequent and HSCT may not be required.

In rare cases, HSCT can be considered in IT other than CAMT, WAS and MECOM -associated syndrome when the patient has a severe bleeding diathesis and does not respond to any treatments. This was the case of 3 patients with bBSS, and one with thrombocytopenia with TARwho successfully received HSCT from HLA-identical siblings because they had life-threatening hemorrhages and had become refractory to platelet transfusions. In one subject with GPS and severe pancytopenia due to the development of myelofibrosis, HSCT corrected both the myelofibrosis and the platelet defect. Finally, HSCT in a young girl with GNE -related disorder (GNE -RD) and severe bleeding tendency resulted in a successful outcome.

### Practical management of the haemorrhagic complications of myeloproliferative neoplasms [^115CYbeC]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms can be associated with bleeding manifestations which can cause significant morbidities. Although haematologists are aware of the likelihood of this complication in the setting of myeloproliferative neoplasms, it may often be overlooked especially in patients with no extreme elevation of blood counts and those with myelofibrosis. Acquired von Willebrand syndrome and platelet dysfunction are the two common diagnoses to be considered in this regard. In this review article, we discuss the mechanisms for the development of these rare bleeding disorders, their diagnosis and practical management.

### Pregnancy in Fanconi anaemia with bone marrow failure: a case report and review of the literature [^116zE7M3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusion﻿s

The natural history of FA ends in lethal BMF. HSCT, using an adapted attenuated conditioning regimen, is the only curative treatment when BMF occurs. In the last decade, the conditioning has been reduced because of the toxic effect of alkylating agents, making a normal ovarian function recovery and a viable pregnancy possible. Our patient did not receive HSCT and decided to continue her pregnancy, although she had already developed BMF.

To our knowledge, there is no published data in relation to pregnancy in women with FA without HSCT. We relied on studies on women with aplastic anaemia (AA). AA is a pancytopenia associated with unexplained hypocellularity of the bone marrow. In literature there are many reports on pregnancy with AA, and this disorder is quite similar to our patient's. Data shows that patients presenting severe AA in early pregnancy should be offered termination because this may be followed by haematological improvement and because the poor maternal and fetal outcomes. Pregnant patients with thrombocytopenia are at high risk of miscarriages, placental abruption preeclampsia/eclampsia, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, fetal death, neonatal and maternal death. Two studies on AA in pregnancy reported that platelet count is the main risk factor for obstetrics and desease complications. Most authors agree that 50 × 10⁹/L is the cut-off for therapy in asymptomatic patients. Treatment is also required in patients with counts greater than 50 × 10⁹/L and bleeding complications as well as conditions associated with impaired haemostasis, such as fever. Our patient began her pregnancy with a platelet count of 27 × 10⁹/L and thrombocytopenia was aggravated during pregnancy. She received weekly platelet transfusions, although from the second trimester she became refractory. Refractoriness to platelet transfusion is a common condition in patients receiving frequent platelet transfusions. An on-going process of transfused platelet destruction has been reported in severe thrombocytopenia. Therefore, we decided to perform platelet transfusions only with platelet count less then 5 × 10⁹/L or with bleeding and/or fever. Moreover, due to bleeding tendency of the patient, we adopted prophylactic strategies such as a personalized self-monitoring of blood glucose scheme for the management of GDM. Intramuscular administrations were avoided.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^112HTVP5]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Platelets play an important role in hemostasis, as evidenced by the fact that defects in their number or function are associated with bleeding diatheses. In addition, the platelet count has important implications in the evaluation of patients with a variety of disorders. It is, therefore, extremely important for the treating physician to be able to rely on accurate estimations of the number of circulating platelets. For example, the severity of abnormalities of the platelet count guides decision-making on patients' treatment. Despite greatly improved efficiency and performance with the widespread availability of automated hematology analyzers in routine and specialized laboratories, there are still technical and biological variables that hamper their diagnostic accuracy. This review describes the most common and important conditions that are associated with inaccurate platelet counting resulting in spuriously low platelet counts.

### How I treat acquired aplastic anemia [^116BescR]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Survival in severe aplastic anemia (SAA) has markedly improved in the past 4 decades because of advances in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, immunosuppressive biologics and drugs, and supportive care. However, management of SAA patients remains challenging, both acutely in addressing the immediate consequences of pancytopenia and in the long term because of the disease's natural history and the consequences of therapy. Recent insights into pathophysiology have practical implications. We review key aspects of differential diagnosis, considerations in the choice of first- and second-line therapies, and the management of patients after immunosuppression, based on both a critical review of the recent literature and our large personal and research protocol experience of bone marrow failure in the Hematology Branch of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

Consider using a higher transfusion threshold (such as ≥ 20×10⁹/L) in patients with active bleeding, as determined by clinical factors, including the degree of hemorrhage, site of hemorrhage, and responsiveness to platelet transfusion.

### Case of leptospirosis causing pancytopenia [^1173KFcE]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

The definitive diagnosis of leptospirosis can be made by isolating Leptospira from clinical specimens or, more commonly, looking for at least a fourfold rise in microscopic agglutination test titre in the convalescent-phase sera compared with the acute-phase sera, taken at least 2 weeks apart. In addition, a single Leptospira microagglutination tire greater than or equal to 400 supported by a positive ELISA IgM result can be diagnostic of a leptospirosal infection.PCR serves as suggestive laboratory evidence and is becoming increasingly available, bearing the advantage of earlier positivity compared with serologyand is valuable in guiding timely diagnosis in those with a clinical suspicion of leptospirosis. However, Leptospira DNA (in blood, urine or CSF) is only present during the acute/bacteremic phase of the illness.

There are over 200 Leptospiral serovars, of which 30 are considered to be clinically significant. This is the first described case of pancytopenia caused by L. interrogans serovar Hardjo. The actual serovar may not be clinically relevant, typically due to the delay in confirmatory testing and if clinical suspicion of leptospirosis is high, empiric treatment should begin before diagnosis.

Infection prevention should be aimed at avoiding direct contact with Leptospires and implementing thorough washing after potential exposure. Counselling regarding occupational exposure risk should be addressed. It is advised to wear adequate personal protective equipment (glasses, masks, gloves, boots) when in high-risk environments and to work within well-ventilated areas. It is also important to minimise environmental contamination, such as exposure of soils to floodwaters and reducing surrounding rubbish, which attracts rodents.

This case highlights pancytopenia as a rare manifestation of Leptospirosis and the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion in the setting of occupational exposure, even in non-endemic regions. Additionally, it showcases the reversibility of pancytopenia when treated appropriately.

Learning points

Pancytopenia is an atypical and rare haematological manifestation of leptospirosis.
There are a large number of aetiologies to consider when patients present with fever and pancytopenia. Clinicians are required to undertake in-depth interviews, in order to generate an appropriate differential diagnosis.
Although rare, leptospirosis should be considered on the differential list in those patients with pancytopenia and fever who have the appropriate environmental exposure

### Late diagnosis of severe colchicine intoxication [^113zqQpo]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

A 4-year-old Turkish girl was referred to our hospital with the findings of encephalopathy and pancytopenia. She had a history of severe abdominal cramps and gastrointestinal bleeding. A confused state, muscle pain and weakness, erythema-bullous and erythema-nodosum-like skin lesions, and alopecia were observed at her hospitalization. All of these symptoms resolved on follow-up. On laboratory investigation severe thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, mild anemia, a moderate increase in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were detected. After reevaluating her medical history, it was learned that she had accidentally taken 1.3 to 1.5 mg/kg of colchicine 3 to 4 days before her first hospitalization. The possibility of misdiagnosis of colchicine intoxication should be borne in mind, and pediatricians must be aware of its toxic effects, especially in areas where patients with familial Mediterranean fever are present.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: management of oral complications of immunotherapy [^11334TLi]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). High credibility.

Dental procedures during immunotherapy — The risk of neutropenia and pancytopenia during cancer immunotherapy, particularly with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), is relatively low but clinically significant, affecting ~ 0.1–1% of patients; thrombocytopenia was reported in 1.7–4.9% of patients treated with ICI. It is advised to assess the complete blood count prior to dental treatment and to assess the patient's risk for infection or bleeding, and if a patient is neutropenic, elective treatment may need to be postponed. For urgent dental needs, the protocols used to prevent the hematogenous spread of infection from the oral flora may be applicable, in particular, the American Heart Association (AHA) protocol to prevent infective endocarditis; likewise, if a patient is thrombocytopenic, topical hemostatic agents and blood product transfusion may be needed prior to and following the dental procedure.

### Perioperative management of the patient with hematologic disorders [^116GsRGW]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Bleeding at the time of surgery has the potential to become a serious complication. Careful patient assessment and review of history are of the utmost importance if this situation is to be avoided on the operating table. Unfortunately, many patients, particularly younger individuals with little to no previous exposure to surgery, are unaware of underlying bleeding disorders that they may have. Understanding the basic pathophysiology and management of these conditions becomes critical for the treating surgeon. For patients who have known conditions, close interconsultation with the treating hematologists and careful observation of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative established protocols reduces the risk of complications for patients and makes the possibility of success a reality for these individuals.

### Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia: a retrospective clinical analysis of 20 patients [^116wb8Px]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT) is a rare bone marrow failure syndrome characterised by isolated thrombocytopenia because of ineffective megakaryocytopoiesis at birth. In the last 10 years, we collected data from 20 patients diagnosed with CAMT based on a severe thrombocytopenia since birth and absent or markedly decreased numbers of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. Fanconi's anaemia and thrombocytopenia absent radii syndrome were ruled out for all patients. We retrospectively compared the clinical courses, laboratory findings and treatment outcome. Development of pancytopenia was observed in 14 of the patients, only one patient presented with an isolated thrombocytopenia over a period of over 14 years. One boy died from bleeding complications. We defined two groups of patients according to the course of platelet counts during the first year of life, which also differed in the course of development of pancytopenia. Physical anomalies in addition to haematopoiesis were found in a number of patients: two children presented with cardiac defects, six with growth abnormalities, and four with retardation of psychomotor development. Fifteen patients were treated with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, four of whom died of transplantation-related events.

### Role of red blood cells in clinically relevant bleeding tendencies and complications [^114Eakpo]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

In acute settings, the patient blood management program focuses on the avoidance of unnecessary blood transfusions. The highest RBC transfusion targets have been advocated for patients having cardiovascular disease, especially in acute forms, ischemia, and massive bleeds. The program wisely urges the prevention of anemia, but, if prevention has not occurred, transfusions provide an acute solution. In addition, these acute blood transfusion guidelines lack specific guidance on inherited bleeding disorders, which carry a permanent risk for bleeds at low factor levels. Therein, the conservative RBC transfusion limits do not necessarily apply, and the correction of coagulation factor levels alone is not enough, as hemostasis relies on synergistic actions of several mechanisms.

To sum up, in clinics, whatever the nature of the bleeding disorder, early primary hemostasis impairment by reduced RBC numbers and the presence of anemia are to be avoided if possible. The cause of anemia needs to be clarified and managed accordingly, with iron deficiency most often being the hematological background. The active evaluation of RBCs and implementation of specific laboratory diagnosis for anemia should be considered a priority rather than an afterthought in the follow-up of patients with hemostasis and thrombosis issues. To close the circle, this review continues to further discuss what clinicians can learn from basic science and some of the latest observations that can be translated into patient management, whenever possible.

### Prediction of life-threatening and disabling bleeding in patients with AML receiving intensive induction chemotherapy [^116EJYhB]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

The results of this study provide a pretreatment tool to identify patients at high risk for grade 4 bleeding. Although treatment of AML should begin promptly, initiation of induction chemotherapy must be balanced with delay to optimize organ function, manage coagulopathy, and improve overall condition in order to minimize treatment-related complications. Several strategies could be employed to mitigate the risk of grade 4 bleeding in patients with a high bleeding score, including preinduction correction of DIC-related laboratory coagulopathy, reduction of proliferative disease, and stringent clinical and laboratory monitoring. Even for patients with bona fide DIC, there are limited data to support evidence-based guidelines for supportive hemostatic strategies. Moreover, the typical prophylactic platelet transfusion threshold of < 10 × 10⁹/L might not be effective in AML patients with DIC-like coagulopathy. Consensus recommendations for DIC management have prioritized platelet transfusions and replacement of coagulation factors with fresh-frozen plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate. These recommendations could also be considered for the high-risk subset of AML patients with a DIC-related coagulopathy as defined in this study to maintain a platelet count of > 20 to 30 × 10⁹/L in patients without bleeding and a higher threshold of > 50 × 10⁹/L in high-risk patients with concurrent bleeding events. However, AML-specific thresholds may be unique given the multifactorial contributions to thrombocytopenia, including disease-related marrow dysfunction, treatment-related myelosuppression, infections, sepsis, and coagulation abnormalities following anthracycline-based intensive induction chemotherapy. Patients with proliferative AML are also at increased risk for DIC-related coagulopathy arising from high levels of procoagulants triggering the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Consequently, cytoreduction with hydroxyurea prior to initiating induction chemotherapy may normalize the activated coagulation pathway and improve the safety of treatment in this high-risk population. Altogether, patients at high risk for grade 4 bleeding need careful clinical and laboratory monitoring after treatment initiation, with emphasis on early diagnosis and interventions to minimize bleeding complications. These risk-adapted preventive management strategies should preferably be studied in a prospective clinical trial.

In conclusion, we developed and independently validated a novel and simple tool which identifies AML patients with a clinical phenotype of DIC-like coagulopathy who are at high risk of grade 4 bleeding. Prospective studies are needed in which these patients might be considered for assertive supportive care aimed at reversing the coagulopathy and reducing proliferative disease in order to decrease the incidence of life-threatening bleeding events and reduce the risk of early mortality during induction treatment.

### How I manage patients with unexplained cytopenia [^115dLvs5]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The term "unexplained cytopenia" is used to describe a condition characterized by peripheral blood cytopenia that cannot be attributed to identifiable causes using conventional tests or to any concomitant diseases. Unexplained cytopenia requires clinical attention and further investigation to identify individuals at risk of developing a hematologic neoplasm. The available evidence suggests that somatic mutation analysis may effectively complement the diagnostic workup and clinical management of unexplained cytopenia. Indeed, the presence or absence of somatic mutation(s) in myeloid genes shows high positive and negative predictive values for myeloid neoplasms (MNs). Mutation analysis is also crucial for identifying patients with clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS), a condition at increased risk of developing a MN. Recently, clinical/molecular prognostic models have been developed, providing valuable tools for the personalization of clinical and molecular surveillance. Most patients with CCUS show mild cytopenia and do not require therapeutic intervention. Currently, there is no treatment approved for CCUS, and transfusion therapy is the sole therapeutic option for patients with severe symptomatic cytopenia. However, this field has been emerging as a domain of active clinical investigation. This article presents 4 case studies of patients with unexplained cytopenia, which hematologists may encounter in their clinical practice.

### Introduction to a review series on the treatment of thrombocytopenic disorders: something old, something new [^114gGusv]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

The importance of the more primitive hemostatic mechanism stands out in the natural experiments represented by those clinical disorders in which thrombocytopenia is a sufficient cause of bleeding, despite an intact coagulation system. Quite surprisingly, contrary to what is expected, there are clinical situations accompanied by a reduced number of platelets in which thrombosis is also a major factor of morbidity or mortality, posing dramatic management dilemmas (see, for example, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia). Conversely, thrombocytosis may be accompanied by a hemorrhagic tendency as in essential thrombocythemia, whose first denomination was 'hemorrhagic thrombocythemia'. Finally, as detailed in Balduini's review, in a significant proportion of cases with inherited thrombocytopenias an associated impaired platelet function may further aggravate the bleeding tendency. Even worse, in rarer cases, the genetic lesions have impacts beyond thrombopoiesis and thrombocytopenia is just one component of more complex syndromic forms or may herald the future development of hematologic malignancies or bone marrow aplasia or fibrosis, raising ethical dilemmas on how to best inform patients on their condition.

Figure 1 depicts the many inherited and acquired causes that can lead to thrombocytopenia and the main pathogenic mechanisms involved. It is quite evident that a precise diagnosis is essential not only for directing prognosis and treatment, but also for excluding any underlying or associated disorder requiring prompt identification. As Balduini mentions in his review, the prevalence of inherited thrombocytopenias is reported to be as high as more than two cases per 100.000 persons, an order of magnitude similar to that of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Nevertheless, only a very tiny proportion of patients is diagnosed with inherited thrombocytopenias at major hematology centers, thus highlighting the under-diagnosis of this pathology. No prevalence data are available for drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia, but its diagnosis is very difficult without a high index of suspicion and underdiagnosis is anticipated also for this condition. Indeed, even in expert centers, several cases of isolated thrombocytopenia are initially misdiagnosed as ITP with potentially dangerous consequences.

As previously reported, CS patients can present with fever and abdominal pain due to recurrent cholangitis, fatigue and ecchymosis due to hypersplenism, gastrointestinal bleeding due to varices, and non-specific digestive symptoms such as anorexia and abdominal distention. The most common initial symptoms in CS patients in our cohort were non-specific abdominal distention followed by fever, abdominal pain, variceal bleeding, and fatigue. Although three out of the eight patients initially presenting with abdominal distention did not seek immediate medical advice, which might have delayed the diagnosis of CS, there was no significant difference in diagnostic delay between patients with different initial symptoms.

Similarly, the laboratory findings in CS patients were not discriminative. Leukopenia, thrombopenia, and pancytopenia were associated with longer diagnostic delay. However, this was likely to be due to patients with longer diagnostic delay being more likely to have hypersplenism. Other laboratory abnormalities including increased ALT and bilirubin, decreased albumin, and prolonged PT were not associated with diagnostic delay. Interestingly, autoantibodies were positive in four (25%) of our CS patients, which has not previously been reported. Although the presence of these autoantibodies in AIH and PBC is well established, these autoantibodies are not reported to be associated with CS, which might therefore mislead the diagnosis. Indeed, these positive autoantibody results did lead to, or at least contribute to, the initial misdiagnosis of two CS patients. It is important to be aware of the co-existence of autoantibodies and CS, since immunosuppressive therapy might lead to clinical exacerbation of CS.

### Practical management of the haemorrhagic complications of myeloproliferative neoplasms [^114dGziN]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Myeloproliferative neoplasms can be associated with bleeding manifestations which can cause significant morbidities. Although haematologists are aware of the likelihood of this complication in the setting of myeloproliferative neoplasms, it may often be overlooked especially in patients with no extreme elevation of blood counts and those with myelofibrosis. Acquired von Willebrand syndrome and platelet dysfunction are the two common diagnoses to be considered in this regard. In this review article, we discuss the mechanisms for the development of these rare bleeding disorders, their diagnosis and practical management.

### Bone marrow failure: a child is not just a small adult (but an adult can have a childhood disease) [^114PAuKP]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Aplastic anemia may be inherited or acquired. The distinction between these lies not in the age of the patient, but in the clinical and laboratory diagnoses. Adult hematologists must consider adult presentations of the inherited disorders, in order to avoid incorrect management of their patients. Physicians for adult patients must also realize that children with inherited disorders now survive to transition into their care. The major inherited bone marrow failure syndromes associated with development of pancytopenia include Fanconi anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia. The ages at presentation are highly variable, but often include individuals of adult age who have previously undiagnosed Fanconi anemia or dyskeratosis congenita. Many of the genes responsible for these disorders have been identified (12 Fanconi anemia genes, 3 dyskeratosis congenita genes, and 1 each for Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia). A high index of suspicion and specific testing of children or adults with what appears to be acquired aplastic anemia may identify inherited disorders. Correct classification of patients with aplastic anemia of any age is mandatory for their appropriate management.

### Pancytopenia resulting from hemophagocytosis in malaria [^115bLrmD]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Pancytopenia in an acutely ill child is commonly a result of bone marrow suppression. Rarely pancytopenia is a manifestation of inappropriate macrophage activation associated with hemophagocytosis. Viral infections account for most cases of secondary hemophagocytosis. We report a case of malaria-associated hemophagocytosis in a child from an endemic area. Systemic parasitic infections should be included in the differential diagnosis of pancytopenia and infection-associated hemophagocytosis. In this rare subgroup of hemophagocytosis, malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum is the most common parasitic infection

Initial evaluation — Clinical history should include the timing, severity, and tempo of abnormal cytopenias; prior infections or bleeding episodes; and number of transfusions, and cytopenias are defined as values lower than standard laboratory hematologic levels. In addition to establishing current blood and reticulocyte counts, clinicians need a peripheral blood smear evaluation to determine the degree of dysplasia. Bone marrow aspiration with Prussian blue stain for iron and a biopsy are needed, and cytogenetics for bone marrow samples should be obtained; if standard cytogenetics with 20 or more metaphases cannot be obtained, chromosome microarray analysis (CMA)/ chromosome genomic array testing (CGAT) or MDS-related FISH panel should be performed, and if karyotype is normal, the CMA should be considered; however, CMAs detect both somatic and germline or constitutional changes. Bone marrow biopsy staining for reticulin is recommended, increased reticulin fibers in the marrow at diagnosis are seen in approximately 5% to 10% of MDS cases, and MDS with fibrosis is considered a distinct subtype of MDS in the 2022 WHO classification. Because MDS are relatively indolent disorders, blood count stability is used to distinguish MDS from evolving AML, and other possible causes of cytopenias require careful evaluation.

### When is enteral nutrition indicated? [^116gLJ5d]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Enteral access risks and nasal-jejunal tube (NJT) placement after allo-HSCT — There may be an increased risk of local bleeding related to low platelet count that must be considered with tube placement. When NJTs were placed at the start of induction conditioning for 14 allo-HSCT patients, one had epistaxis in the nare with the tube and one in the opposite nare. Main NJ feeding issues were forceful vomiting and displacement; it was recommended that scheduled antiemetics be provided, and to place NJTs and initiate feeds on day +1 following induction treatment prior to possible pancytopenia and mucositis.

### Myelodysplastic syndromes [^114GSFgV]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on myelodysplastic syndrome:

- **Definition**: MDS is a group of clonal marrow stem-cell disorder characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, leading to blood cytopenias.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of MDS involves the abnormal development and maturation of blood cells in the bone marrow. This is driven by genetic mutations and epigenetic changes that lead to clonal expansion of abnormal hematopoietic stem cells.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of MDS in the US is estimated at approximately 4 per 100,000.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for MDS include older age, male gender, and prior exposures to toxins such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
- **Disease course**: The clinical manifestations of MDS are primarily related to the resulting cytopenias and include symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and pallor due to anemia; increased susceptibility to infections due to neutropenia; and bleeding or bruising due to thrombocytopenia. There is also an increased risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Patients with lower-risk MDS have a median survival of approximately 3–10 years, whereas patients with higher-risk disease have a median survival of < 3 years.

### Successful treatment of marrow failure after CARTs for myeloma by the infusion of cryopreserved stem cells [^111uMgTk]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Medium credibility.

1

Chimeric antigen receptor transduced T cell (CART) therapy has demonstrated clinical activity in multiple malignant tumors. 1 In 2017, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved CD19‐targeted CART cells (CARTs) as a salvage treatment for recurrent and/or refractory patients with B cell malignancies. 2, 3 In recent years, several CART clinical trials for multiple myeloma (MM) conducted worldwide have shown good clinical response, with target antigens including BCMA, CD19, and others. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 In addition to the clinical efficacy of CART therapy, it is important to pay attention to the possible adverse reactions, to reduce the severe, irreversible treatment‐related mortality and to ensure that toxicity is managed well. Prolonged pancytopenia should also be a focus beyond unique acute cytokine release syndrome (CRS). 1 Such complications may bring the risk of fatal infection and bleeding, and could increase the hospital stay and economic burden of patients. Here, we report one patient with relapsed and refractory MM who developed bone marrow failure and severely prolonged pancytopenia after receiving sequential CD19‐ and BCMA‐specific CARTs. His hematopoiesis was successfully restored by the infusion of cryopreserved autologous stem cells.

### Case of leptospirosis causing pancytopenia [^115VZtfJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

We present the case of a young female landscaper who presented to an Australian tertiary hospital with persistent fevers and new pancytopenia. Extensive initial workup for her presenting illness did not identify a cause; however, a detailed history of her occupation revealed she worked heavily with soil on farms that had domestic livestock in addition to rodents. Hence, further serological testing for leptospirosis was performed, revealing a diagnosis of infection with Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjo. Treatment covering leptospirosis was commenced, and she improved clinically, and her cell counts returned to normal. Pancytopenia is a rare manifestation of leptospirosis and has only been reported in a handful of case studies. We highlight that leptospirosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis in those with fever, and new pancytopaenia, particularly in patients with relevant risk factors for exposure.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^113samqC]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical aspects

PTCP is not associated with an increased risk of bleeding, thrombotic events or other relevant clinical complications: no clinical manifestation of disease occurred after up to 10 years (average 4.7 years) of follow-up of 112 PTCP cases, suggesting that they do not need to be followed up with any kind of specific clinical or laboratory monitoring. However, in a retrospective case-control study of 104 PTCP and 208 control subjects, not well balanced in terms of prevalence of neoplastic diseases which were twice as common among the PTCP cases, the mortality rate at a median of 208 days of follow-up was significantly higher at multivariate analysis among PTCP subjects.

PTCP has been described in healthy subjects but also in patients with a vast variety of pathological conditions, including neoplastic, inflammatory, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases. In general, it appears that the association of PTCP with the aforementioned heterogeneous disorders is casual and explicable by the need of affected patients to be repeatedly monitored by laboratory tests, including blood cell counts, thus increasing the chances of detecting this rare condition. However, a specific association with autoimmune disorders was highlighted in a study of 192 patients with PTCP, suggesting that the condition can be assimilated to polyautoimmunity syndromes, but this association was not documented in other reports. One report described a high percentage (35%) of PTCP among patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, representing a relevant confounding factor for monitoring the effects of cytotoxic treatment in these patients.

### Rifaximin reduces markers of inflammation and bacterial 16S rRNA in Zambian adults with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis: a randomized control trial [^112BkWxC]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

The only fibrotic marker measured in patients in the clinical trial was HA which was not affected by rifaximin. We think that the duration of rifaximin was too short to have any impact on HA, and by the time these patients present to hospital with variceal bleeding fibrosis is well established and likely to be irreversible. HA is an important molecule which is associated with hepatic fibrosis in HSS. In an animal model of cirrhosis, fibronectin, another fibrotic marker, reduced after intestinal decontamination with rifaximin. It is not clear whether this could translate to humans but our data suggest not in the short term.

The pancytopenia in our patients is consistent with hypersplenism. There was profound thrombocytopenia in both groups but patients did not present with bleeding during follow-up although Arthur and others have described platelet counts of 100 × 10⁹/L or less as being associated with upper digestive bleeding even in asymptomatic HSS patients.

There were no major adverse events associated with rifaximin during the 42-day follow-up period which is in agreement with what others have said about the safety of rifaximin. The reason for the low variceal rebleeding rate during the 42-day follow-up could be due to adherence to propranolol as confirmed by good beta blockade at the end of 42-day period in both groups compared with baseline. This probably reflects the importance of beta blockers in preventing variceal bleeding in schistosoma-related portal hypertension.

It is a limitation of this study that it was an open-label clinical trial, which is prone to bias, although the laboratory personnel were blinded. Confirmation of compliance to rifaximin in these patients was not possible as rifaximin blood levels could not be measured. The effect of BT on clinical endpoints may also have been underestimated in this clinical trial because the patients were stable and seen as outpatients. They did not have acute variceal bleeds on recruitment and would be predicted to have lower rebleeding rates on follow-up.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: myelodysplastic syndromes, version 2.2025 [^1119SZT9]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes — RUNX1 familial platelet disorder and related risks — Lesions within the RUNX1 gene have been identified as one cause of a relatively rare autosomal-dominant familial platelet disorder that predisposes these patients to myeloid malignancies. In affected families with the RUNX1 lesions, the incidence of MDS/AML is high, ranging from 20% to 60% in which the median age of onset is 33 years. This familial platelet disorder is characterized by the presence of thrombocytopenia and a tendency for mild-to-moderate bleeding generally presents from childhood, although some affected individuals may not display these clinical characteristics; different types of genetic lesions in RUNX1 account for variable phenotypes between families. Cryptic genetic lesions in RUNX1 have been reported in some patients with Fanconi anemia and MDS/AML, and identification of Fanconi anemia is clinically important because it is associated with chromosomal fragility that results in variability of disease response to HMAs.

### Supportive care in severe and very severe aplastic anemia [^117EmiSX]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Optimal management of aplastic anemia (AA) is not confined to immediate diagnosis, early decision making and timely initiation of major treatment strategies (immunosuppression or SCT) but also involves supportive treatment as a crucial part of patient care. Patients are threatened by complications of cytopenia. Here, we summarize current recommendations for prevention and early treatment of fungal, bacterial and viral infections, transfusion strategy and iron chelation and assess the evidence basis. In fact, many recommendations for patients with AA are not based on randomized studies in AA itself, but they are deduced from other conditions with similar severity of cytopenia. Prevention and treatment of complications like hemorrhage, bacterial and fungal infections and of secondary events like alloimmunization to blood products and iron overload have a significant impact on the prognosis of AA patients and need to be carefully observed in daily practice. More controlled studies on supportive care should be performed in this rare disease.

### Management of the refractory aplastic anemia patient: what are the options? [^114yxciW]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Refractory aplastic anemia (AA) is defined as a lack of response to first-line immunosuppressive therapy (IST) with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporin and is manifested as persistence of severe cytopenias at 6 months after IST. Although supportive care is critical for AA patients, it is of paramount importance for refractory disease in view of the longer duration of pancytopenia and susceptibility to life-threatening infections due to IST. Improvements in supportive care have largely contributed to better outcome over the past 2 decades, with 5-year overall survival reaching 57% during 2002 to 2008 for patients with AA unresponsive to initial IST. Exclusion of hypocellular myelodysplastic syndrome and constitutional BM failure masquerading as apparent idiopathic AA should be done in conjunction with centers of excellence. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is indicated if refractory AA patients are fit and have a suitably matched donor, either a sibling (> 40–50 years) or unrelated donor. Patients lacking a fully matched donor should be considered for a second course of antithymocyte globulin plus cyclosporin, although response in the refractory setting is only ∼30% to 35%. Response may also occur with alemtuzumab or the thrombopoietin mimetic eltrombopag in refractory AA. The emerging data for alternate donor (cord or haploidentical) transplantation in AA has provided additional therapeutic choices to consider in refractory disease.

### Coagulation abnormalities in critically ill patients [^1131J6p4]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Many critically ill patients develop hemostatic abnormalities, ranging from isolated thrombocytopenia or prolonged global clotting tests to complex defects, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation. There are many causes for a deranged coagulation in critically ill patients and each of these underlying disorders may require specific therapeutic or supportive management. In recent years, new insights into the pathogenesis and clinical management of many coagulation defects in critically ill patients have been accumulated and this knowledge is helpful in determining the optimal diagnostic and therapeutic strategy.

0. 17 × 10³/μL; hemoglobin level, 7 g/dL with mean corpuscular volume of 103 fL; and platelet count, 116 × 10³/μL. Peripheral blood smear showed occasional pseudo Pelger-Huet cells and rare teardrop cells.

Histopathologic examination of bone marrow aspirate revealed a normocellular marrow and dyserythropoiesis with vacuolized and dysplastic erythroid precursors, left-shifted granulocytic maturation with vacuolized granulocytic precursors, ring sideroblasts, and no increase in blasts. Cytogenetic studies from the bone marrow did not reveal any abnormalities. Histopathologic examination of bone marrow aspirate from patient. Check serum trace element levels, including iron, copper, and zinc Obtain periodic outpatient complete blood cell counts and treat with supportive transfusions as clinically indicated. Hematologic manifestations of copper deficiency include normocytic or macrocytic anemia and neutropenia. 7 Copper is a cofactor in multiple ferroxidases, several of which are involved in hematopoiesis via iron storage, oxidation, and transport.

2, 7 Thus, many of the hematologic consequences of copper deficiency are linked to iron homeostasis. Bone marrow histopathology can show ringed sideroblasts, hypocellular marrow, and vacuolized erythroid and granulocytic precursors. 7 Such dysplastic changes may be interpreted as manifestations of MDS; however, the diagnosis of MDS requires persistent cytopenias in addition to at least 1.
