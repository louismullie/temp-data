## Question

Comprehensive mental health soap note for a 22 year old with ADHD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a comprehensive mental health SOAP note for a 22-year-old with ADHD, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the SOAP structure and how to apply it to adult ADHD. Then, I should verify DSM-5 diagnostic criteria and adult-specific thresholds. Next, I will review subjective history elements, including collateral data and developmental onset. After that, I need to check objective findings, rating scales, and when to use neuropsychological testing. Then, I will formulate the assessment with ICD-10 coding and comorbidity screening. Finally, I will outline the plan, including pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments, monitoring, and transition considerations, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the SOAP framework and its applicability to adult ADHD documentation; the SOAP format organizes clinical reasoning into Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, and structured templates improve documentation quality and consistency, which is particularly helpful for chronic conditions like ADHD that require longitudinal tracking and coordination across settings [^113jwcEH].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic foundation is correct; for adults, DSM-5 requires at least five current symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity, symptoms present before age 12, impairment in two or more settings, and not better explained by another condition, and I should double-check that I am not inadvertently applying the pediatric threshold of six symptoms to this 22-year-old adult patient [^116XBR6j] [^116eDU9x].

> Wait, let me verify the age-of-onset criterion; DSM-5 extended onset to before age 12, so I should confirm early manifestations from collateral sources if the patient's recall is limited, and I should also remember that adult-onset ADHD is not recognized in DSM-5, so I must carefully exclude mimics if symptoms seem to begin after age 12 [^116XBR6j] [^112yZyRB].

> Next, I should review the subjective history; I will document chief complaints, a detailed developmental history with corroboration from parents or school records, academic and occupational functioning, social and relationship impacts, sleep, substance use, and psychiatric review of systems, and I need to check that I am capturing functional impairment across settings because DSM-5 requires evidence of impairment in more than one major domain [^112yZyRB].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of collateral information; adult patients often underreport symptoms, so obtaining childhood records, parent or sibling input, and prior school reports strengthens diagnostic validity and helps establish onset before age 12, and I should document consent for collateral contacts and the specific sources used [^112vbtZS].

> I will now examine objective data; I should administer validated adult ADHD rating scales such as the ASRS v1.1 screener and follow-up diagnostic tools, and I need to check whether neuropsychological testing is indicated — testing does not replace clinical diagnosis but can help when collateral is limited, malingering is suspected, or comorbidities cloud the picture [^113T4wAe] [^1167Notq].

> Let me think about the mental status exam; I should document attention, impulsivity, internal restlessness, mood, anxiety, and any psychotic features, and I need to ensure I screen for substance use and suicidality given elevated risks in young adults with ADHD and the potential for substances to mimic or exacerbate symptoms [^1135Lwjy].

> I should confirm the diagnostic formulation; if criteria are met, I will assign ICD-10-CM F90.x with the appropriate presentation specifier and explicitly document the evidence supporting each DSM-5 criterion, including onset before age 12, cross-setting impairment, and exclusion of alternative explanations, and I will also screen systematically for common comorbidities such as anxiety, depression, substance use, sleep disorders, and learning disorders that can alter treatment sequencing and response [^113ou6kL] [^1135Lwjy].

> But wait, what if symptoms are subthreshold or better accounted for by another condition; I need to consider differential diagnoses including mood and anxiety disorders, substance-induced symptoms, sleep apnea, and trauma-related disorders, and if full criteria are not met, I should avoid labeling ADHD and instead address functional impairments with appropriate psychosocial interventions while monitoring for evolution of symptoms over time [^112yZyRB] [^117Fz1YH].

> Next, I should review the treatment plan; first-line pharmacotherapy for adults with ADHD is stimulant medication, and I need to ensure cardiovascular screening, review substance use risk, and discuss diversion mitigation strategies such as observed dosing and safe storage, especially in young adults with a history of misuse risk [^1119zEet] [^1115kWgZ].

> I need to check nonpharmacologic components; cognitive-behavioral therapy adapted for adult ADHD, organizational skills training, and academic or workplace accommodations are essential parts of care, and I should coordinate with schools or employers as appropriate while respecting confidentiality and patient preferences [^1119zEet].

> Let me verify the monitoring protocol; measurement-informed care using standardized scales every 1–3 months, tracking both symptoms and functional outcomes, supports titration and shared decision-making, and I should document dose adjustments, adverse effects, adherence, and functional gains or barriers at each visit [^notfound].

> I should double-check comorbidity management; if anxiety or depression are present and more impairing, I may prioritize treatment of the comorbid condition first, and I need to plan for integrated care with mental health clinicians when complexity exceeds primary care scope or when specialized psychotherapy is indicated [^115HD69i] [^114NbZJT].

> Hold on, I should verify transition considerations; although the AAP guideline formally addresses patients up to age 18, its chronic care and medical home principles apply as patients move into adult services, and I should ensure continuity of records, medication management, and linkage to adult providers to prevent care gaps during this high-risk period [^116jUPyw] [^115DwRje].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan is documented clearly; I will provide a written management plan summarizing the diagnosis, current functional goals, medication details, behavioral strategies, school or work accommodations, monitoring schedule, and emergency contingencies, and I will share this with the patient and, with consent, relevant collaterals to support coordinated care [^111vBXp2].

A 22-year-old with ADHD presents with **persistent inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity** [^111RLS1t] since childhood, causing significant academic, occupational, and social impairment [^112yZyRB]. The diagnosis is supported by **DSM-5 criteria** [^1112LXQ4], with symptoms present before age 12 and across multiple settings [^112G1R1R]. Comorbid anxiety and sleep disturbances are common and should be screened and managed [^111CWbYi]. Treatment includes stimulant medication with careful monitoring for side effects and misuse [^1119zEet], combined with CBT and organizational coaching [^1119zEet]; regular follow-up and measurement-informed care are essential to track symptoms, function, and adherence [^113Kgdz7].

---

## Subjective

- **Chief complaint**: "I can't focus, I'm always restless, and I keep forgetting things — it's ruining my school and job performance".

- **History of present illness**: Lifelong symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity [^116jUPyw]; difficulty sustaining attention, frequent careless mistakes, poor organization, procrastination, restlessness, difficulty waiting, and interrupting others. Symptoms persist across settings and cause significant academic, occupational, and social impairment [^112yZyRB].

- **Past psychiatric history**: No prior psychiatric treatment or diagnosis.

- **Medical history**: No significant medical conditions.

- **Family history**: Father and brother have ADHD; mother has anxiety.

- **Social history**: College student; part-time job; lives with roommates; denies substance use.

- **Developmental history**: Symptoms present before age 12; childhood reports of fidgeting, difficulty staying seated, and poor focus [^112G1R1R].

---

## Objective

On examination, the patient is **alert and cooperative**, with a **stable mood and congruent affect**. Speech is normal in rate and fluency; thought processes are logical and coherent, with no evidence of psychosis or suicidal ideation. Attention is markedly impaired on serial sevens and digit span; impulse control is reduced, with difficulty inhibiting responses. The ASRS v1.1 is positive for adult ADHD, and the Vanderbilt scale shows severe inattention and moderate hyperactivity/impulsivity.

---

## Assessment

Diagnosis is **attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation (F90.2)** per DSM-5 [^113ou6kL], with symptoms present before age 12, persistent across settings, and causing significant impairment [^112yZyRB]. Comorbidities include anxiety and sleep disturbances, and the differential includes anxiety disorders, mood disorders, substance use, and learning disorders [^111CWbYi].

---

## Plan

- **Pharmacologic treatment**: Initiate stimulant (methylphenidate or amphetamine) as first-line therapy [^1119zEet]; monitor for side effects, misuse, and adherence [^1115kWgZ].

- **Non-pharmacologic treatment**: CBT for ADHD, organizational skills training, and academic accommodations (extended time, note-taking assistance) [^114EXwqx].

- **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up every 3 months with symptom scales (ASRS, Vanderbilt) and functional assessments; measurement-informed care to guide adjustments [^113Kgdz7].

- **Patient education**: Explain ADHD as a neurodevelopmental disorder, discuss treatment risks/benefits, and provide written resources [^111RLS1t].

- **Referrals**: Psychology for CBT; sleep evaluation if symptoms persist [^115pr2YH].

---

This 22-year-old with ADHD requires a **multimodal approach** — stimulant medication plus CBT and accommodations — with regular monitoring to reduce impairment and improve function [^111RLS1t].

AAP Task Force on Mental Health integration — The guideline states its purpose is to support primary care providers in developing alliances with families, preventing and identifying mental health conditions early, and collaborating with mental health clinicians. It notes that diagnosis and management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and youth are particularly challenging in primary care because limited payment and the recommended procedures require more time, including coordination with schools and continuous, coordinated care. The document adds that relegating mental health conditions exclusively to mental health clinicians is not a viable solution due to limited access, that access to psychologists for further cognitive assessment may be limited by education-system availability and third-party payer restrictions, and that cultural differences in ADHD diagnosis and treatment are important, may be more prominent because of family and teacher perceptions, and are beyond the scope of the guideline to detail.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, AAP 2019 guidelines recommend to diagnose ADHD according to the DSM-5 criteria, including documentation of symptoms and impairment in ≥ 1 major setting (social, academic, or occupational), relying on information drawn primarily from reports from parents or guardians, teachers, other school personnel, and mental health clinicians involved in the patient's care. Rule out any alternative cause.

ADHD guideline — Action statement 1 (evaluation in children and adolescents) states that the primary care clinician should initiate an evaluation for ADHD for any child 4 through 18 years of age who presents with academic or behavioral problems and symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity (quality of evidence B/strong recommendation). Aggregate evidence quality is B, with benefits noting that systematic identification by primary care clinicians will likely decrease undiagnosed and untreated ADHD in children, and harms/risks/costs including potential inappropriate labeling, missed alternative conditions, and treatments that will not benefit them. The benefits-harms assessment states that the high prevalence and limited mental health resources require primary care pediatricians to play a significant role; treatments have good evidence of efficacy and lack of treatment risks impaired outcomes; exclusions are none; role of patient preferences is that success depends on patient and family preference; intentional vagueness delineates limits between primary care and subspecialty management; and strength is a strong recommendation. The basis notes ADHD occurs in approximately 8% of children and youth and that appropriate diagnosis can be provided for preschool-aged children (4–5 years of age) and adolescents.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) — coexisting conditions assessment and referral: A variety of other behavioral, developmental, and physical conditions can coexist in children who are evaluated for ADHD, including learning problems, language disorder, disruptive behavior, anxiety, mood disorders, tic disorders, seizures, developmental coordination disorder, or sleep disorders. Given this likelihood, primary care clinicians should conduct assessments that determine or at least identify the risk of coexisting conditions, and the primary care clinician might benefit from additional support and guidance or might need to refer a child with ADHD and coexisting conditions to subspecialists for assessment and management; the subspecialists could include child psychiatrists, developmental-behavioral pediatricians, neurodevelopmental disability physicians, child neurologists, or child or school psychologists. The AAP has developed algorithms and a toolkit for assessing and treating (or comanaging) common developmental disorders and mental health concerns in children. Aggregate evidence quality is B with strength stated as strong recommendation; benefits note that identifying coexisting conditions is important for developing the most appropriate treatment plan, harms/risks/costs note that the major risk is misdiagnosing the conditions and providing inappropriate care, and the benefits-harms assessment states there is a preponderance of benefit over harm.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) — action statement 4: chronic care model and medical home management: The primary care clinician should recognize ADHD as a chronic condition and, therefore, consider children and adolescents with ADHD as children and youth with special health care needs, and management of children and youth with special health care needs should follow the principles of the chronic care model and the medical home (quality of evidence B/strong recommendation). Aggregate evidence quality is B with strength stated as strong recommendation; benefits specify that the recommendation describes the coordinated services most appropriate for managing the condition, harms/risks/costs note that providing the services might be more costly, and the role of patient preferences highlights that family preference in how these services are provided is an important consideration. This recommendation is based on evidence that ADHD continues to cause symptoms and dysfunction over long periods of time and that available treatments address symptoms and function but are usually not curative; the medical home model has been accepted as the preferred standard of care, and an important process in ongoing care is bidirectional communication with teachers and other school and mental health clinicians as well as with parents and patients.

Key action statement (KAS) 7: comorbid conditions in ADHD — "The PCC, if trained or experienced in diagnosing comorbid conditions, may initiate treatment of such conditions or make a referral to an appropriate subspecialist for treatment". "After detecting possible comorbid conditions, if the PCC is not trained or experienced in making the diagnosis or initiating treatment, the patient should be referred to an appropriate subspecialist to make the diagnosis and initiate treatment (Table 10). (Grade C: recommendation.)" The guideline notes, "For example, treatment of ADHD may lead to improvement in coexisting aggression and/or oppositional defiant, depressive, or anxiety symptoms", yet "Sometimes, however, the comorbid condition may require treatment in addition to the ADHD treatment". Support and referral pathways are specified: "If the PCC is confident of his or her ability to diagnose and treat certain comorbid conditions, the PCC may do so", and "The PCC may benefit from additional consultative support and guidance from a mental health subspecialist or may need to refer a child with ADHD and comorbid conditions, such as severe mood or anxiety disorders, to subspecialists for assessment and management", with examples that "The subspecialists could include child and adolescent psychiatrists, clinical child psychologists, developmental-behavioral pediatricians, neurodevelopmental disability physicians, child neurologists, or child- or school-based evaluation teams".

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) primary care capacity and co-management notes that some PCCs may lack training, experience, or resources to diagnose and treat children and adolescents with ADHD, especially when severity or comorbid conditions increase complexity, and in these situations, comanagement with specialty clinicians is recommended; the SDBP is developing a guideline to aid these complex cases. It is also important for PCCs to be aware of health disparities and social determinants and strive to provide culturally appropriate care; the accompanying PoCA provides supplemental implementation support, including use of standardized rating scales to diagnose ADHD, assessing for comorbid conditions, documenting diagnostic and treatment procedures, monitoring treatment and outcomes, and providing families with written management plans.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) guideline scope and updates — the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guideline addresses the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD in children from age 4 years to their 18th birthday. For this document, preschool-aged refers to children from age 4 years to the sixth birthday. Pediatricians and other primary care clinicians may continue to provide care after 18 years of age, but care beyond this age was not studied for this guideline. Since 2011 the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), was released; the new research and DSM-5 do not support dramatic changes, so this guideline includes only incremental updates and adds a key action statement about the diagnosis and treatment of coexisting or comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) outlines that ADHD is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders of childhood affecting academic achievement, well-being, and social interactions, and situates this update within prior AAP guidance, which first provided evaluation and diagnosis recommendations in 2000 with treatment recommendations in 2001, and a 2011 revision that included a process of care algorithm (PoCA). Since the release of the 2011 guideline and the revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to the fifth edition, the current revision makes only incremental updates, adds a key action statement related to diagnosis and treatment of comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD, and updates the PoCA to assist in implementing the recommendations. The guideline also notes identification of numerous systemic barriers to adoption and a companion article in the Supplemental Information addressing systemic barriers and presenting recommendations to address those barriers, with this article supporting the recommendations of the clinical practice guideline and PoCA.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder evaluation and diagnosis: a practical approach in office practice [^1178Zog5]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is the most common neurobehavioral disorder of childhood, with most children maintaining symptoms of ADHD as adolescents and as adults. It is among the most common chronic conditions that primary care pediatricians see. Progress in brain imaging, genetics, neuropsychology, and molecular biology of ADHD reveals complex interactions between neurologic mechanisms, genetics, and environmental influences. Core behaviors seen in children with ADHD include hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention. The DSM-IV standard for diagnosis emphasized the importance of documenting that these behaviors occur at school and in the home, the chronicity of symptoms, and the connection between the behaviors and impairments in educational achievement or social development. The complex nature of this disorder is indicated by the observation that children and adolescents with ADHD have associated conditions, such as learning disorders, anxiety, oppositional behaviors, and depression. The AAP practice guideline on the evaluation and diagnosis of school-aged children with ADHD provides primary care pediatricians with a scientific foundation for assessing children with behavior and learning problems. Attention to accurate documentation of behaviors, coexisting learning disorders and mental health conditions, and the development of office practices that support the diagnostic process will ensure that children receive an appropriate and comprehensive assessment.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^116ecRc4]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) guideline conclusions state that evidence is clear with regard to the legitimacy of the diagnosis of ADHD and the appropriate diagnostic criteria and procedures required to establish a diagnosis, identify comorbid conditions, and effectively treat with both psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions. The steps required to sustain appropriate treatments and achieve successful long-term outcomes remain challenging, however. As noted, this clinical practice guideline is supported by 2 accompanying documents available in the Supplemental Information: the process of care algorithm (PoCA) and the article on systemic barriers to the care of children and adolescents with ADHD. Full implementation of the guideline's key action statements (KASs), the PoCA, and the recommendations to address barriers to care may require changes in office procedures and the identification of community resources. The page lists development of standardized and documented tools to help primary care providers identify comorbid conditions; development of effective electronic and Web-based systems to help gather information to diagnose and monitor children and adolescents with ADHD; improvements to systems for communicating with schools, mental health professionals, and other community agencies to provide effective collaborative care; development of more objective measures of performance to more objectively monitor aspects of severity, disability, or impairment; assessment of long-term outcomes for children in whom ADHD was first diagnosed at preschool ages; and identification and implementation of ideas to address the barriers that hamper the implementation of these guidelines and the PoCA.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115fgAZ5]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is 1 of the most common neurobehavioral disorders of childhood and can profoundly affect children's academic achievement, well-being, and social interactions. The American Academy of Pediatrics first published clinical recommendations for evaluation and diagnosis of pediatric ADHD in 2000; recommendations for treatment followed in 2001. The guidelines were revised in 2011 and published with an accompanying process of care algorithm (PoCA) providing discrete and manageable steps by which clinicians could fulfill the clinical guideline's recommendations. Since the release of the 2011 guideline, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has been revised to the fifth edition, and new ADHD-related research has been published. These publications do not support dramatic changes to the previous recommendations. Therefore, only incremental updates have been made in this guideline revision, including the addition of a key action statement related to diagnosis and treatment of comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD. The accompanying process of care algorithm has also been updated to assist in implementing the guideline recommendations. Throughout the process of revising the guideline and algorithm, numerous systemic barriers were identified that restrict and/or hamper pediatric clinicians' ability to adopt their recommendations. Therefore, the subcommittee created a companion article (available in the Supplemental Information) on systemic barriers to the care of children and adolescents with ADHD, which identifies the major systemic-level barriers and presents recommendations to address those barriers; in this article, we support the recommendations of the clinical practice guideline and accompanying process of care algorithm.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) chronic care management — KAS 4 states that ADHD is a chronic condition; therefore, the PCC should manage children and adolescents with ADHD in the same manner that they would children and youth with special health care needs, following the principles of the chronic care model and the medical home (Table 5), and this is a Grade B: strong recommendation. The rationale provided is that for many individuals, ADHD causes symptoms and dysfunction over long periods of time, even into adulthood, and that available treatments address symptoms and function but are usually not curative.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents — diagnostic evaluation (KAS 1–3) states the pediatrician or other primary care clinician (PCC) should initiate an evaluation for any child or adolescent age 4 years to the 18th birthday with academic or behavioral problems and symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity; to diagnose ADHD, the PCC should determine that DSM-5 criteria have been met with impairment in more than 1 major setting and should also rule out any alternative cause; the evaluation should include a process to at least screen for comorbid emotional, behavioral, developmental, and physical conditions. These carry a Grade B, strong recommendation rating.

Conclusions

The co-occurrence of ADHD and ASD is common, and the presence of both conditions exacerbates difficulties above those experienced by either condition alone. The identification and assessment of ADHD and ASD is complex due to shared aetiologies, overlapping symptoms and shared characteristics. The intervention and management of both conditions is complicated by the core features of both disorders and by co-occurring neurodevelopmental and mental health conditions. These may have a significant impact on engagement, effectiveness and outcomes of both pharmacological and psychological interventions. Neurodevelopmental conditions are often missed in children and adults, especially when they present with high rates of comorbidity that healthcare practitioners are more readily able to recognise, e.g. anxiety and depression. This is further complicated by the change in symptom presentation as young people grow up, with reported decline in hyperactive/impulsive symptoms in ADHD and improved social communication in ASD. These 'improvements' however may be offset by the development of additional mental health problems and associated impairments that persist into adulthood.

Hence, UKAP hosted a meeting of experts in ADHD and ASD from a range of disciplines with the aim of reaching a consensus regarding the most appropriate methods of identifying and assessing co-occurring ADHD and ASD. We further sought to agree the most effective interventions and treatments for ADHD and ASD in children and adults. The consensus recommendations for practice are summarised in Tables 1, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 10.

Barriers to achieving positive outcomes exist within the clinical, social, and educational spheres. These include poor access to care; lack of training for healthcare staff, teachers and allied professionals; inadequate knowledge about female presentation; lack of care coordination and poor inter-agency working; high rates of comorbidity and functional problems that limit the individual's ability to engage effectively with a service; inability of the individual to advocate for themselves; stigma (even within the family); need for age-appropriate psychoeducational initiatives; poor coping strategies and substance misuse issues which may significantly impact on an individual's ability to engage with a service and/or in specific interventions. Unfortunately, some barriers are a result of rigid adherence to the same clinical plan that has been in effect over many years without modifications being made in line with the developments in presentation and needs of the child or adult. A willingness to make changes to accommodate the varied needs of individuals with co-occurring ADHD and ASD over the years will help to eradicate the barriers.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^115HniC7]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Experts in the fields of ADHD and ASD convened in December 2017 in London, UK, for a meeting hosted by the United Kingdom ADHD Partnership (UKAP;). The attendees represented a multidisciplinary group of prescribing and non-prescribing clinical and academic experts with extensive experience working with individuals with ADHD and ASD (covering the fields of psychiatry, paediatrics, general practice, clinical psychology, social work, speech and language therapy, psychotherapy and clinical academic research). We were also fortunate to have representation from the field of education. The meeting included presentations summarising research on the topic. Following the presentations, attendees separated into three sub-groups. Each group was tasked to produce a framework of guidance with specific regards to:
Identification and assessment of children and adults with both ADHD and ASD
Interventions and treatments for children with both ADHD and ASD
Intervention and treatments for adults with both ADHD and ASD

The discussions during the breakout sessions were facilitated by group leaders and summarised by note-takers. The methodological orientation that underpinned the focus of the discussion groups was phenomenological, drawing on the empirical research base and their clinical experience. The sub-group leaders then presented their conclusions to all the meeting attendees for another round of discussion and debate until consensus was agreed.

The entire meeting was audio recorded and later transcribed (sub-group discussions were recorded by note-takers). The medical writer consolidated the meeting transcription, electronic slide presentations and breakout session notes into a draft manuscript. It was then revised by the lead author following further consultation with some authors and other expert colleagues who had been unavailable to attend the consensus meeting. The final draft was then circulated again to all authors to review and to agree the final consensus. The consensus reflects the views of the authors based on their practical experience and published research and provides a unified approach for working with children and adults with co-occurring ADHD and ASD.

### Clinical recommendations in current practice guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in adults [^113ABjvw]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder in which approximately two thirds of patients experience impairment in adulthood. Although some adults with ADHD were diagnosed as children, many are first diagnosed as adults. This poses particular challenges given the limited familiarity with ADHD of many adult mental health services. As a result, several organizations, including the Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the National Institutes of Health, and the British Association for Psychopharmacology, have developed practice guidelines for the assessment and treatment of adults with ADHD. This article reviews those guidelines in order to examine current best practices in adult ADHD. There is considerable agreement among these guidelines, which should be a critical part of moving from emerging knowledge to patient care, although both empirical evaluation and ongoing updates as new knowledge emerges will be important for their future development.

Diagnostic issues were focused on 5 areas: ADHD prevalence in the general US population aged 21 years or younger and among patients presenting to pediatricians' or family physicians' offices; co-occurring mental disorders with 1 or more specified conditions; functional impairments across domains; whether behavior rating scales remain the standard of care; and the prevalence and diagnostic accuracy of abnormal findings on selected medical screening tests. Treatment issues were focused on 3 areas.

Identification and assessment

A summary of the consensus reached regarding the identification and assessment of ADHD and ASD when this presents as a comorbid diagnosis is presented in Table 1.

Table 1
Practice Recommendations for children and adults with comorbid ADHD and ASD: identification and assessment

When conducting an assessment for either disorder or when considering the possibility of both co-occurring, it is essential to apply a multifaceted assessment approach that may include the use of standardised and semi-standardised measures. As ADHD and ASD are both complex neurodevelopmental conditions, a comprehensive assessment should include background information (including developmental, clinical and family history, and a current mental state examination), rating scales, a clinical diagnostic interview (including a detailed assessment of symptoms and examples of impairment and, if required, a risk assessment), observational data and an assessment of intellectual ability. Collectively, the information gained from this approach will guide the diagnostic decision. No single point of evaluation or instrument should be conclusive in making a diagnostic decision.

The high rate of co-occurrence between ADHD and ASD means that both conditions should be considered when one of the conditions is present; ASD may confer greater risk for co-existing ADHD where the prevalence of the dual diagnoses appears to be somewhat higher. Indeed, young children presenting with an initial diagnosis of ASD should be continually monitored through development for ADHD, particularly given that the average age of diagnosis for the two conditions is discrepant.

Some individuals with ADHD find their symptoms substantially improve in young adulthood; others continue to sustain symptoms that cause impairment well into middle to late adulthood. In adolescence, people with ASD and/or intellectual disability may experience small improvements in their social functioning, but gains can be limited, and their difficulties and/or impairments persist across the lifespan. Symptoms associated with 'mild' ASD may not be recognised (or not prioritised) in children with challenging behaviours associated with severe ADHD; however, this may change with priorities reversing in young adulthood when ADHD symptoms may start to remit for many young people. For this reason, a comprehensive assessment needs to be conducted that obtains detailed information about the person's functioning spanning many years. It is important to get this right, as a neurodevelopmental diagnosis has the potential to help and guide understanding and necessary support.

### Young adults with ADHD: an analysis of their service needs on transfer to adult services [^115DwRje]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify the ongoing service needs of young people with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Design

A case note review of all children aged 14 and over with a diagnosis of ADHD seen in a paediatric neurodisability clinic.

Participants

139 young people aged 14 years and over on 1 September 2007 with a diagnosis of ADHD were identified from ADHD service user databases at a centre in Sheffield, UK.

Results

102 young people were on medication for ADHD and just over 50% had well controlled ADHD. 71% had at least one co-morbid condition. 46 patients had had intervention from child and adolescent mental health services and 17% had offended. 37% were likely to need transition to adult mental health services as soon as they left paediatric services and 36% would benefit from the expertise of a clinical nurse specialist, either to support a general practitioner (GP) or adult mental health professionals.

Conclusions

The recent National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines highlight the need to provide transition services for young people with ADHD who have continuing impairment. The need for services for adults with ADHD is also recognised. The study confirms and refines the nature of this need in the local population. Young people with mental health problems in addition to their ADHD will need support from adult mental health services. However, a significant group of young adults are likely to be managed well by specialist nurses working with GPs in a primary care setting or adult mental health.

### Diagnosing and treating adult ADHD and comorbid conditions [^115HD69i]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Many adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were never diagnosed as children. The impairment caused by untreated ADHD can complicate, or even lead to, other psychiatric conditions. Accurate diagnosis and efficacious treatment of ADHD in adults, which may include pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions, is vital to improve their functioning. When a patient has ADHD and a co-occurring condition, the clinician should usually treat the most impairing condition first.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbidity screening — KAS 3 directs that, in the evaluation of a child or adolescent for ADHD, the PCC should include a process to at least screen for comorbid conditions, including emotional or behavioral conditions (eg, anxiety, depression, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorders, substance use), developmental conditions (eg, learning and language disorders, autism spectrum disorders), and physical conditions (eg, tics, sleep apnea), with a Grade B: strong recommendation. The table classifies aggregate evidence quality as Grade B and strength as Strong recommendation, noting benefits that identifying comorbid conditions is important in developing the most appropriate treatment plan, risks that the major risk is misdiagnosing the comorbid condition(s) and providing inappropriate care, and an assessment that there is a preponderance of benefits over harm. The page also states that the majority of both boys and girls with ADHD also meet diagnostic criteria for another mental disorder and that in some cases, the presence of a comorbid condition will alter the treatment of ADHD.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115Wtwrf]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Process of care algorithm (PoCA) and systems barriers — the guideline is supported by 2 accompanying documents, including a PoCA and an article on systemic barriers to care. In this revised guideline and accompanying PoCA, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment are a continuous process, and the PoCA provides recommendations for implementing the guideline steps, although there is less evidence for the PoCA than for the guidelines; the section on evaluating and treating comorbidities has also been expanded. There are many system-level barriers that hamper adoption, and the procedures recommended in this guideline necessitate spending more time, developing a care management system with school and other community stakeholders, and providing continuous, coordinated care. There is some evidence that African American and Latino children are less likely to have ADHD diagnosed and are less likely to be treated for ADHD, and special attention should be given to these populations when assessing comorbidities and when treating ADHD symptoms. Given the nationwide problem of limited access to mental health clinicians, pediatricians and other PCCs are increasingly called on to provide services, and the AAP holds that primary care pediatricians should be prepared to diagnose and manage mild-to-moderate ADHD, anxiety, depression, and problematic substance use, as well as co-manage patients who have more severe conditions with mental health professionals.

School programming and supports for students with ADHD — Children and adolescents with ADHD may be eligible for services as part of a 504 Rehabilitation Act Plan (504 plan) or special education IEP under the "other health impairment" designation in the Individuals with Disability Education Act (IDEA), and there are essentially 2 categories of school-based services for students with ADHD: the first category includes interventions that are intended to help the student independently meet age-appropriate academic and behavioral expectations, with examples including daily report cards, training interventions, point systems, and academic remediation of skills; the second category is intended to provide changes in the student's program and these services are referred to as "accommodations" and include extended time to complete tests and assignments, reduced homework demands, the ability to keep study materials in class, and provision of the teacher's notes to the student, but in the absence of such interventions, long-term accommodations may lead to reduced expectations and can lead to the need for accommodations to be maintained throughout the student's education; additionally, encouraging strong family-school partnerships helps the ADHD management process and addressing social determinants of health is essential to these partnerships, and psychosocial treatments that include coordinating efforts at school and home may enhance the effects.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^111RLS1t]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; also known as hyperkinetic disorder) is a common neurodevelopmental condition that affects children and adults worldwide. ADHD has a predominantly genetic aetiology that involves common and rare genetic variants. Some environmental correlates of the disorder have been discovered but causation has been difficult to establish. The heterogeneity of the condition is evident in the diverse presentation of symptoms and levels of impairment, the numerous co-occurring mental and physical conditions, the various domains of neurocognitive impairment, and extensive minor structural and functional brain differences. The diagnosis of ADHD is reliable and valid when evaluated with standard diagnostic criteria. Curative treatments for ADHD do not exist but evidence-based treatments substantially reduce symptoms and/or functional impairment. Medications are effective for core symptoms and are usually well tolerated. Some non-pharmacological treatments are valuable, especially for improving adaptive functioning. Clinical and neurobiological research is ongoing and could lead to the creation of personalized diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for this disorder.

### Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): does new research support old concepts? [^113WgmkV]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the evidence for and against the classification of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as a valid disease entity, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), criteria.

Data Sources

Sources included but were not limited to published literature on ADHD accessed via PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/).

Study Selection

Peer-reviewed research, review articles, consensus statements, "white papers", and proceedings of professional meetings were used.

Data Extraction

Focused on evidence base and scientific validity of conclusions.

Data Synthesis

Evidence for a genetic or neuroanatomic cause of ADHD is insufficient. Experimental work shows that executive function deficits do not explain ADHD. The psychometric properties of widely used ADHD rating scales do not meet standards expected for disease identification.

Conclusions

ADHD is unlikely to exist as an identifiable disease. Inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity are symptoms of many underlying treatable medical, emotional, and psychosocial conditions affecting children.

### Challenges in diagnosing adults with ADHD [^115TiGVX]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) listed in the DSMIV- TR were developed for children, and few are suitable for diagnosing adult patients. Problem areas in the criteria include symptom descriptions, diagnostic threshold cutoff, gender bias, and age at onset.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of adults with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^112vbtZS]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Although some areas of adult ADHD knowledge remain unclear, there isa strong sense of how to proceed with diagnosis using current DSM-IV criteria as a guide. Thorough clinical interview, aided by the use of rating scales for current symptoms and collateral information about childhood from parents or siblings, forms the backbone of the assessment. The poor psychosocial outcomes of patients with ADHD. often a consequence of unrecognized, untreated disorder manifestation, also can serve as a diagnostic indicator. Diagnostic and symptom assessment scales also can be a significant helpin diagnosing and establishing the symptoms of ADHD in adults. It is important to remember that according to DSM-IV, the cardinal criteria for making the diagnosis are the presence of sufficient current symptoms and impairment in two realms (home, school/work, and social interactions). Accordingly, adult ADHD remains a clinical diagnosis, and the clinician-administered interview remains the cornerstone of diagnostic evaluation.

### Use of a computerized decision aid for ADHD diagnosis: a randomized controlled trial [^114Y8T3N]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if implementing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis and treatment guidelines in a clinical decision support system would result in better care, including higher rates of adherence to clinical care guidelines.

Methods

We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial in which we compared diagnosis and management of ADHD in 6- to 12-year-olds after implementation of a computer decision support system in 4 practices.

Results

Eighty-four charts were reviewed. In the control group, the use of structured diagnostic assessments dropped from 50% in the baseline period to 38% in the intervention period. In the intervention group, however, it rose from 60% to 81%. This difference was statistically significant, even after controlling for age, gender, and race (odds ratio of structured diagnostic assessment in intervention group versus control group = 8.0, 95% confidence interval 1.6–40.6). Significant differences were also seen in the number of ADHD core symptoms noted at the time of diagnosis. Our study was not powered to detect changes in care and management, but the percent of patients who had documented medication adjustments, mental health referrals, and visits to mental health specialists were higher in the intervention group than the control.

Conclusions

The introduction of a clinical decision support module resulted in higher quality of care with respect to ADHD diagnosis including a prospect for higher quality of ADHD management in children. Future work will examine how to further develop the ADHD module and add support for other chronic conditions.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) epidemiology and comorbidity in children and adolescents — In a national survey, 8.4% of children 2 to 17 years of age currently had ADHD, representing 5.4 million children; among those with current ADHD, almost two-thirds were taking medication, approximately half had received behavioral treatment in the past year, and nearly one quarter had received neither type of treatment of ADHD. The median age of diagnosis was 7 years, with approximately one-third diagnosed before 6 years of age, and more than half were first diagnosed by a PCC, often a pediatrician. Boys are more than twice as likely as girls to receive a diagnosis; as individuals with ADHD enter adolescence, their overt hyperactive and impulsive symptoms tend to decline, whereas their inattentive symptoms tend to persist. Learning and language problems are common comorbid conditions, the majority of both boys and girls meet diagnostic criteria for another mental disorder, boys are more likely to exhibit externalizing conditions like oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, and girls with ADHD are more likely than boys to have a comorbid internalizing condition like anxiety or depression. Although there is a greater risk of receiving a diagnosis of ADHD for children who are the youngest in their class, for most children, retention is not beneficial.

### Demand and capacity in an ADHD team: reducing the wait times for an ADHD assessment to 12 weeks [^111FoKtN]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Background

ADHD is one of the syndromes defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). In the DSM-5, it is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with a persistent behavioural pattern of severe inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity. The behaviours must be uncharacteristic for the developmental age of the child, be manifest in different settings (eg, at home and at school), have started before the age of 12, be present for at least 6 months and interfere with social and academic performance.

Based on the narrower criteria of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10), hyperkinetic disorder is estimated to occur in about 1%–2% of children and young people in the UK. Using the broader criteria of DSM-IV, ADHD is thought to affect about 3%–9% of school-age children and young people in the UK. Recent follow-up studies of children with ADHD show that the condition persists from childhood to adolescence in 50%–80% of cases and into adulthood in 35%–65% of cases. In a 16-year follow-up study, psychosocial, educational and neuropsychological functional impairments were found when compared with those without ADHD. This suggests many children and young people being diagnosed with moderate-to-servere ADHD will require ongoing treatment from ADHD services and into adulthood.

In the UK, guidance into ADHD: diagnosis and managementhighlighted that in cases of persistent behavioural and/or attention problems with moderate-to-severe impairment, the child or young person should be referred to a specialist ADHD provision (eg, CAMHS) for assessment by a specialist psychiatrist, paediatrician or other appropriately qualified healthcare professional with training and expertise in the diagnosis of ADHD.

An ADHD assessment includes a full clinical and psychosocial assessment of the person including a full developmental and psychiatric history; observer reports and assessment of the person's mental state. The guidelines stipulate that additional observations (eg, at school) are useful when there is doubt about symptoms. To make a diagnosis of ADHD, children and young people should be presenting with symptoms that meet the diagnostic criteria in DSM-5or ICD-10(hyperkinetic disorder); cause at least moderate psychological, social and/or educational or occupational impairment and be pervasive, occurring in two or more important settings including social, familial, educational and/or occupational settings. Early identification is important to improve outcomes for a child's educational and social development.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^1138YNdt]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

ASAM/AAAP stimulant use disorder — Assessment and treatment planning for adolescents and young adults emphasizes seeking additional sources of collateral information beyond family members — such as teachers, guidance counselors, coaches, and roommates — with patient permission, and notes for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that diagnosis requires symptoms to present prior to age 12, even if the diagnosis is made later; the CGC noted that building trust with adolescent and young adult patients and conducting careful clinical interviews are the preferred approaches to determine whether adolescents and young adults are misusing stimulants, and evidence has shown that when clinicians provide assurance of confidentiality, adolescents and young adults are more likely to disclose substance use and other sensitive information; clinicians should pay particular attention to signs or symptoms of ADHD and eating disorders.

Comprehensive assessment for stimulant use disorder — after urgent issues are addressed, patients "should receive, or be referred to an addiction treatment provider for, a comprehensive assessment that includes diagnostic investigation, StUD-focused history and physical examination, mental status examination, and full biopsychosocial assessment". Assessment "should be based on accepted criteria, such as that outlined in the current version of the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) — which is the Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) at the time of publication of this Guideline", and "The DSM classifies substance use disorders (including StUD) as mild, moderate, or severe based on how many of 11 criteria are met: mild StUD meets 2 to 3 criteria, moderate StUD meets 4 to 5 criteria, and severe StUD meets 6 or more criteria". A StUD-focused history and physical examination includes "a detailed history of the patient's past and current substance use and SUDs and an assessment of non-acute signs and symptoms of stimulant use, including complications", and "A mental status exam should identify concerns such as psychosis, cognitive impairment, and risk of harm to self or others". A full biopsychosocial assessment "is critical to identify the broad range of biomedical, psychiatric, and psychosocial challenges", may need to address co-occurring conditions — "such as eating disorders, cognitive impairment, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)" — and, if identified, "the patient should be assessed — or referred for assessment — by an appropriately qualified clinician"; it "should include age of onset of substance use, family history of SUD-related issues, ongoing risks related to substance use and SUD-related behaviors, treatment history and outcomes, psychosocial functioning, and factors in the patient's recovery environment that may impact their treatment and recovery support needs".

### Editorial: can we accurately screen for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder? Moving to a dimensional, multistep process to support youth development [^111Gz1GF]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Mental health concerns are a major source of health-related burden worldwide, including shortened life spans as a result of accidental injury, suicide, and secondary health complications. 1 Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is emblematic in that it can be a serious concern in and of itself as well as an early-emerging risk factor for a variety of other serious physical and mental health outcomes. 2 While there remains a need for more effective treatment, especially for core ADHD symptoms, 3 many of the long-term negative outcomes associated with ADHD can be at least partially mitigated with early intervention. 4,5 Thus, cost-effective, accurate screening is a critical need for the field of child and adolescent psychiatry. The systematic review and meta-analysis of available ADHD screening tools by Mulraney et al. 6 reflects an enormous effort to summarize the overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of available screening measures. The results highlight both what we can and, critically, what we cannot yet achieve with current tools and suggest paths forward.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^11524h9e]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 5% of children and adolescents and 2.5% of adults worldwide. Throughout an individual's lifetime, ADHD can increase the risk of other psychiatric disorders, educational and occupational failure, accidents, criminality, social disability and addictions. No single risk factor is necessary or sufficient to cause ADHD. In most cases ADHD arises from several genetic and environmental risk factors that each have a small individual effect and act together to increase susceptibility. The multifactorial causation of ADHD is consistent with the heterogeneity of the disorder, which is shown by its extensive psychiatric co-morbidity, its multiple domains of neurocognitive impairment and the wide range of structural and functional brain anomalies associated with it. The diagnosis of ADHD is reliable and valid when evaluated with standard criteria for psychiatric disorders. Rating scales and clinical interviews facilitate diagnosis and aid screening. The expression of symptoms varies as a function of patient developmental stage and social and academic contexts. Although there are no curative treatments for ADHD, evidenced-based treatments can markedly reduce its symptoms and associated impairments. For example, medications are efficacious and normally well tolerated, and various non-pharmacological approaches are also valuable. Ongoing clinical and neurobiological research holds the promise of advancing diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to ADHD.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^1157Hrqy]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

For both conditions, uneven cognitive profiles are commonly seen which may complicate the determination of an individual's general intellectual abilities (i.e. the Full Scale IQ). In such cases, it is more informative to focus on the four individual intellectual sub-scales or indices that summarise the person's verbal abilities, performance abilities, working memory and processing speed. The inclusion of an intellectual assessment is particularly useful for both young people in school/further education and adults as it provides information about the individual's cognitive strengths and weaknesses, which in turn informs goals for treatment by indicating specific areas of cognitive weakness that can then be targeted with appropriate interventions in educational settings.

Neuropsychological testing is neither necessary nor sufficient for a diagnosis of ADHD; however, tests that assess executive dysfunction are helpful in determining deficits in higher order processing skills such as task switching, perseveration, planning, sequencing and organising information. Some have been specifically developed for use with an ADHD population and focus on assessing attention, impulsivity and vigilance in children and adults, e.g. Go-No-Go tasks, Stop tasks and continuous performance tests. Those most commonly used in clinical practice include the Conners' Continuous Performance Test, third edition (CPT 3 [age 8+]) and the QbTest. These tests are not specific markers of ADHD, but they augment clinical decision-making by providing useful information regarding a person's cognitive functioning. The assessor should be mindful of the limitations of formal tests and test environments raised above.

Outcome of the assessment

The outcome of the assessment should include a diagnostic formulation as well as an aetiological formulation that includes protective, predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors that inform a comprehensive care plan which considers of the needs of the individual and how these may be met across settings. This might include suggested pharmacological and/or psychological interventions to manage co-occurring difficulties such as anxiety or low mood, to minimise presenting risks, difficulties in social communication and behaviour and improve cognitive skills, study skills and social skills. For children and young people at school or in further education, a comprehensive formulation of current strengths and difficulties could be shared with educational establishments and other professionals involved in their care, should the young person consent. A comprehensive clinical assessment report should be copied to the patient and referrer. See Table 3 for a summary of suggested content.

hyperactivity disorder/hyperactivity disorder

ADHD is a childhood onset, neurodevelopmental disorder with genetic and environmental origins characterised by pervasive behavioural symptoms of hyperactivity, inattentiveness and impulsivity that have been present for at least 6 months and adversely impact on daily functioning and development. ADHD is highly prevalent. Research combining data from multiple sources and analysed using meta-regression reported a worldwide-pooled estimate of 5.29–7.2% in children, 2.5% in adults and between 2.8% in older adulthood. Symptoms must persist across the lifespan, although the relative balance and the specific manifestations of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive characteristics vary across individuals, and may change over the course of development, e.g. in particular hyperactive-impulsive symptoms commonly reduce with age.

The diagnostic criteria for ADHD are presented in DSM-5 and the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 11th edition beta, (ICD-11). Whilst the basic symptom criteria did not change from the revision of DSM-IV, DSM-5 increased the typical age of onset to age 12 (previously age 7). The definition of ADHD was expanded to more accurately characterise the experience of adults, and the number of symptoms was relaxed for adults (> 17 years) who are now required to have five or more symptoms that have persisted for at least 6 months in the inattention and/or hyperactive-impulsive domains. For a diagnosis made in childhood, the number of symptoms remained as 6, respectively. Symptoms must be pervasive and interfere with or reduce the quality of social, academic and occupational functioning. They must not be better explained by other conditions, such as intellectual disability. The change in nomenclature from 'subtypes' in DSM-IV to 'presentations' in DSM-5 reflects increasing evidence that symptoms are often fluid within individuals across their lifespan rather than stable traits. The 'presentation' represents the person's current symptomatology which may change over time: For example, in ADHD, inattentiveness may be relatively stable across development, but hyperactivity and impulsiveness often wane with age. Also, importantly, ASD is no longer an exclusion criterion, which is a fundamental change from DSM-IV and this, together with other comorbid conditions, should be noted. The advance preview of ICD-11 was published in June 2018, and this no longer refers to ADHD as hyperkinetic disorder. Other than that, it appears to be essentially similar to DSM-5.

Differentiating ADHD from other clinical disorders is often the most difficult part of making an ADHD diagnosis in adults. Psychiatric comorbidities are also described and discussed as potential impact factors upon not only diagnosing ADHD but also treatment of adult ADHD. Especially in those adults with psychiatric comorbidities, treatments need to be multimodal and include both pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions.

### ADHD in DSM-5: a field trial in a large, representative sample of 18-to 19-year-old adults [^115Vqakc]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by pervasive and persistent symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, affecting individuals across the life cycle (Matte et al.). Research and clinical data have documented that a significant proportion of children affected by the disorder continues to present ADHD symptoms and associated impairment during adulthood (Faraone et al; Barkley; Das et al.). The two most comprehensive estimates of ADHD prevalence in adults suggest prevalence rates between 2.5% and 3.4% (Fayyad et al; Simon et al.).

The diagnostic criteria for ADHD were not tested in adults in the field trials for DSM-IV (Matte et al.), and ADHD was not among the disorders assessed in DSM-5 field trials in adults (Batstra & Frances). The DSM-5 criteria for ADHD kept the bidimensional structure of ADHD and the same list of symptoms, but proposed modifications that might impact on the ADHD diagnostic definition for adults, including: (a) a reduction in the number of required symptoms (cut-off point) in both ADHD dimensions (inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity) from six to five in adults; (b) raising the age at onset from 7 to 12 years, and removing the requirement of impairment from this criterion; and (c) the addition of new clinical examples for symptoms. DSM-5 also proposed modifications that are relevant for all age ranges, such as defining pervasiveness as the presence of several ADHD symptoms (instead of impairment) in two or more settings, and the removal of autism/pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) as a specific exclusion (for a more comprehensive discussion on the rationale for these modifications, see Matte et al.). These proposed changes in ADHD diagnostic criteria raised major concerns about potentially negative consequences, such as inflating prevalence rates of the disorder, overdiagnosis and overtreatment (Regier et al.).

### Initiative to improve quality of paediatric ward-round documentation by application of' SOAP' format [^113jwcEH]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Background

Electronic medical records use standardised templates, which guide specific entries. As compilation of records on blank sheets permits individual preferences for compilation, it risks selective and deficient entries.

Ward-round notes in our hospital, like most healthcare facilities in India, are maintained on paper. Hospital case files are composed of several paper sheets which are assembled in a uniform order throughout the hospital. Some of these sheets carry preprinted templates and some are blank, but each sheet is assigned and labelled for a specific purpose. Our hospital is accredited under the National Accreditation Board for Hospital certification, and case records are regularly subject to detailed audits which assess adherence towards exhaustive record-keeping practices including date and time of the notes, regularity, legibility, patient medication details, investigation details, nursing records, pain score, etc. These audits, however, do not reflect evaluation of the content within the notes, whose inconsistency and selective filling were our prime concern.

Rationale

Recognising our need to structure our notes, we explored the methodology used by Dolan et al, i.e. structuring of the records incorporating the subjective, objective, assessment and planning (SOAP) template. The SOAP acronym is a derivative of problem-oriented medical record practice, which warrants that clinical records be structured around the patient's problems and updated in detail on a daily basis.SOAP prototype provides the cognitive framework for clinical reasoning while serving as a reminder for specific aspects of clinical information. A progress note under this format reflected essential parameters of ongoing patient progress and treatment information. We inferred from the available literature that structuring our notes will improve information recorded and thereby quality of documentation.

It was felt that SOAP format was suited to our system for two reasons. First, it served our requirement to balance out the neglected clinical parameters and save us from the implementation of exhaustive notes which could prove labour and time intensive for a busy system like ours. Second, its simple design circumvented the need for detailed department specific proforma, which would have required multiple approvals as well as institution-wide reforms around creation of distinct case files for different departments.

Aim

Our Specific, measurable, applicable, realistic and timely (SMART) aim was to improve the quality of documentation in ward-round notes, for paediatric inpatients aged between 1 month and 15 years, by application of the SOAP template to at least 80% of the eligible notes by 6 months. Eligible notes constituted two out of all the ward-round notes written during 24 hours of an inpatient stay.

AHRQ research questions for ADHD diagnosis and treatment — The subcommittee developed research questions for an evidence-based review sponsored by 1 of the Evidence-based Practice Centers of the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ); these questions assessed 4 diagnostic areas and 3 treatment areas on the basis of research published in 2011 through 2016, guided by key clinical questions for children and adolescents 4 to 18 years of age. Diagnostic questions addressed the comparative diagnostic accuracy of approaches usable in primary care or by specialists among children younger than 7 years of age; the comparative diagnostic accuracy of EEG, imaging, or executive function approaches among individuals aged 7 to their 18th birthday; the adverse effects associated with being labeled correctly or incorrectly as having ADHD; and whether more formal neuropsychological, imaging, or genetic tests improve the diagnostic process. Treatment questions addressed the comparative safety and effectiveness of pharmacologic and/or nonpharmacologic treatments of ADHD; the risk of diversion of pharmacologic treatment; and the comparative safety and effectiveness of different monitoring strategies to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment or changes in ADHD status.

### Screening for adult ADHD [^111GZ6UC]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review paper aims to update readers on the importance of screening for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults and to provide a primer on how best to screen and diagnose this condition in an efficient and reliable manner.

Recent Findings

The ASRS Screening Scale was updated in 2017 to reflect the changes made to identify ADHD based on the DSM-5 criteria and to reflect our understanding that adult ADHD is characterized by executive functioning deficits that are not explicitly reflected in the DSM-5 criteria. The use of the ASRS Screening Scale improves the clinician's ability to rapidly identify adult patients who require a comprehensive evaluation to diagnose ADHD and/or other comorbid psychiatric conditions. The scale has been validated for use in both the general population and in the ADHD specialty treatment population, which supports its use by both general clinicians and mental health clinicians. Identification of adult ADHD is critical due to the profound personal, familial, and societal costs associated with this condition.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^113Murjt]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ADHD — children with inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity at a problem level: Teachers, parents, and child health professionals typically encounter children who demonstrate behaviors relating to activity level, impulsivity, and inattention but who do not fully meet DSM-5 criteria. When assessing these children, diagnostic criteria should be closely reviewed, which may require obtaining more information from other settings and sources, and also consider that these symptoms may suggest other problems that mimic ADHD. Behavioral interventions, such as PTBM, are often beneficial for children with hyperactive/impulsive behaviors who do not meet full diagnostic criteria for ADHD, and these programs do not require a specific diagnosis to be beneficial to the family. The DSM-PC was published in 1996 and has not been revised to be compatible with the DSM-5; therefore, the DSM-PC cannot be used as a definitive source for diagnostic codes related to ADHD and comorbid conditions, although it can be used conceptually as a resource for behavioral concerns.

### A guide to the treatment of adults with ADHD [^111vGb2F]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

While child and adolescent physicians are familiar with the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperac-tivity disorder (ADHD), many adult physicians have had little experience with the disorder. It is difficult to develop clinical skills in the management of residual adult manifestations of developmental disorders without clinical experience with their presentation in childhood. Adult patients are increasingly seeking treatment for the symptoms of ADHD, and physicians need practice guidelines. Adult ADHD often presents differently from childhood ADHD. Because adult ADHD can be comorbid with other disorders and has symptoms similar to those of other disorders, it is important to understand differential diagnoses. Physicians should work with patients to provide feedback about their symptoms, to educate them about ADHD, and to set treatment goals. Treatment for ADHD in adults should include a medication trial, restructuring of the patient's environment to make it more compatible with the symptoms of ADHD, and ongoing supportive management to address any residual impairment and to facilitate functional and developmental improvements.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^116eDU9x]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ADHD — adolescents (Age 12 Years to the 18th Birthday): Obtaining teacher reports for adolescents is often more challenging than for younger children, and clinicians need to try to obtain information from at least 2 teachers or other sources, such as coaches, school guidance counselors, or leaders of community activities in which the adolescent participates. For the evaluation to be successful, it is essential that adolescents agree with and participate in the evaluation, and variability in ratings is to be expected. Adolescents' reports of their own behaviors often differ from other observers because they tend to minimize their own problematic behaviors. To meet DSM-5 criteria, adolescents must have some reported or documented manifestations of inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity before age 12; therefore, clinicians must establish manifestations before age 12 and strongly consider whether a mimicking or comorbid condition, such as substance use, depression, and/or anxiety, is present. Risks that increase during adolescence include mood and anxiety disorders, risky sexual behaviors, intentional self-harm and suicidal behaviors, and clinicians should also be aware that adolescents are at greater risk for substance use than younger children; certain substances, such as marijuana, can have effects that mimic ADHD, and adolescent patients may also attempt to obtain stimulant medication to enhance performance (ie, academic, athletic, etc) by feigning symptoms. Trauma experiences, posttraumatic stress disorder, and toxic stress are additional comorbidities and risk factors of concern.

### Evidence-based guidelines for management of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in adolescents in transition to adult services and in adults: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^111WAv4F]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an established diagnosis in children, associated with a large body of evidence on the benefits of treatment. Adolescents with ADHD are now leaving children's services often with no readily identifiable adult service to support them, which presents problems as local pharmacy regulations often preclude the prescription of stimulant drugs by general practitioners (GPs). In addition, adults with ADHD symptoms are now starting to present to primary care and psychiatry services requesting assessment and treatment. For these reasons, the British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) thought it timely to hold a consensus conference to review the body of evidence on childhood ADHD and the growing literature on ADHD in older age groups. Much of this initial guidance on managing ADHD in adolescents in transition and in adults is based on expert opinion derived from childhood evidence. We hope that, by the time these guidelines are updated, much evidence will be available to address the many directions for future research that are detailed here.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^111q1sDi]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 5% of the population worldwide is reported to have a diagnosis of hyperactivity disorder/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a disorder often associated with co-occurring conditions that can complicate identification and treatment; autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is among those conditions that are commonly found to co-exist with those diagnosed with ADHD at a reported rate (obtained by meta-analysis) of 21%.

There are established guidelines regarding the identification and treatment of ADHD and ASD as independent conditions. Indeed, this comorbidity was not formally recognised diagnostically until the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5); hence, awareness and understanding of them as co-occurring conditions is less established. This has led to uncertainty among healthcare practitioners when working with children, young people and adults who present with both ADHD and ASD. It is further complicated by the expansion of the concept of ASD in recent years, which means that (although ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder) many people in the spectrum are intellectually and emotionally able and their 'impairment' primarily relates to stigmatisation within society (for instance, in being excluded unnecessarily from employment). Nevertheless, mental health needs may arise from co-existing conditions (such as anxiety and ADHD). This consensus therefore included the needs of those who are functionally impaired as well as those who are more broadly considered 'neurodiverse'.

Special circumstances: Adolescents highlight that obtaining teacher reports might be more challenging because many adolescents have multiple teachers, parents may have less opportunity to observe behaviors, adolescents' self-reports often minimize problems, and adolescents are less likely to exhibit overt hyperactive behavior; clinicians need to try to obtain (with agreement from the adolescent) information from at least 2 teachers and other sources, establish younger manifestations, and strongly consider substance use, depression, and anxiety as alternative or co-occurring diagnoses, noting that adolescents with ADHD are at greater risk of substance abuse and that risks of mood/anxiety disorders and risky sexual behaviors increase during adolescence.

### Measurement informed care in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^113Kgdz7]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Measurement-informed care is a cornerstone of evidence-based practice and shared decision-making. A structured diagnostic interview specific to ADHD provides a globally agreed-on standard of evaluation. These interviews are accessible in the public domain in multiple languages and are helpful to clinicians new to the diagnosis of ADHD. Broad-based rating scales looking at multiple domains of psychopathology are critical to assuring recognition of comorbid diagnoses, which might otherwise be missed, differential diagnoses, and identification of the most prominent or treatable diagnosis. Recent innovations in computerized adaptive testing have improved the efficiency and accuracy of diagnostic screening. Rating scales specific to ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders establish the severity of the disorder and response to intervention. Age- and gender-normed symptom rating scales for ADHD capture clinically salient differences between what is normative in different demographic groups. An evaluation of functional impairment in ADHD has been critical to understanding the patient's perspective of the presenting problem. Best practice care for ADHD treatment goes beyond improvement to well-defined standards for both symptom and functional remission. Studies of executive function, emotional regulation, mind-wandering, and sluggish cognitive tempo have led to a richer understanding of the breadth and depth of associated deficits commonly experienced by ADHD patients.

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the athlete: an American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement [^114cnC8y]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

ADHD diagnostic considerations for team physicians — age of onset, masking, and evaluation: The DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for ADHD state that symptoms are present before age 7, and there is no adult onset/acquired ADHD, though compensatory efforts in childhood and adolescence may push symptoms below threshold with symptoms thus emerging after childhood when compensation efforts are reduced or unavailable. Therefore, Team Physicians may be called upon to care for athletes with ADHD at a variety of levels (ie, youth, college, and beyond), and the Team Physician should be aware of resources for evaluation of ADHD in their institution or community; often, ADHD is diagnosed on the basis of positive medication response and not a comprehensive evaluation, and Team Physicians should understand that the core symptoms may often be perceived by others as laziness, lack of personal responsibility, or oppositional behavior.

### Implementing the American Academy of Pediatrics attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder diagnostic guidelines in primary care settings [^113yNfX4]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the feasibility of the San Diego Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Project (SANDAP) protocol, a pediatric community-initiated quality improvement effort to foster implementation of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnostic guidelines, and to identify any additional barriers to providing evidence-based ADHD evaluative care.

Methods

Seven research-naïve primary care offices in the San Diego area were recruited to participate. Offices were trained in the SANDAP protocol, which included 1) physician education, 2) a standardized assessment packet for parents and teachers, 3) an ADHD coordinator to assist in collection and collation of the assessment packet components, 4) educational materials for clinicians, parents, and teachers, in the form of handouts and a website, and 5) flowcharts delineating local paths for referral to medical subspecialists, mental health practitioners, and school-based professionals. The assessment packet included the parent and teacher versions of the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scales. In this study, we chose a conservative interpretation of the AAP ADHD guidelines for diagnosing ADHD, requiring that a child met criteria for ADHD on both the parent and teacher rating scales. A mixed-method analytic strategy was used to address feasibility and barriers, including quantitative surveys with parents and teachers and qualitative debriefing sessions conducted an average of 3 times per year with pediatricians and office staff members.

Results

Between December 2000 and April 2003, 159 children were consecutively enrolled for evaluation of school and/or behavioral problems. Clinically, only 44% of the children met criteria for ADHD on both the parent and teacher scales, and 73.5% of those children were categorized as having the combined subtype. More than 40% of the subjects demonstrated discrepant results on the Vanderbilt scales, with only the parent or teacher endorsing sufficient symptoms to meet the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. Other mental health and learning problems were common in the sample; 58.5% of subjects met screening criteria for oppositional defiant disorder/conduct disorder, 32.7% met screening criteria for anxiety/depression, and approximately one-third had an active individualized education program in place or had received an individualized education program in the past. On evaluation, the SANDAP protocol was acceptable and feasible for all stakeholders. However, additional barriers to implementing the AAP ADHD guidelines were identified, including 1) limited information in the guidelines regarding the use of specific ADHD rating scales, the evaluation and treatment of children with discrepant and/or negative results, and the indications for psychologic evaluation of learning problems, 2) families' need for education regarding ADHD and support, 3) characteristics of physical health and mental health plans that limited care for children with ADHD, and 4) limited knowledge and use of potential community resources.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that children presenting for evaluation of possible ADHD in primary care offices have complex clinical characteristics. Providers need mechanisms for implementing the ADHD diagnostic guidelines that address the physician education and delivery system design aspects of care that were developed in the SANDAP protocol. Additional barriers were also identified. Careful attention to these factors will be necessary to ensure the sustained provision of quality care for children with ADHD in primary care settings.

### The World Health Organization adult attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder self-report screening scale for DSM-5 [^113T4wAe]. JAMA Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Recognition that adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is common, seriously impairing, and usually undiagnosed has led to the development of adult ADHD screening scales for use in community, workplace, and primary care settings. However, these scales are all calibrated to DSM-IV criteria, which are narrower than the recently developed DSM-5 criteria.

Objectives

To update for DSM-5 criteria and improve the operating characteristics of the widely used World Health Organization Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) for screening.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Probability subsamples of participants in 2 general population surveys (2001–2003 household survey [n = 119] and 2004–2005 managed care subscriber survey [n = 218]) who completed the full 29-question self-report ASRS, with both subsamples over-sampling ASRS-screened positives, were blindly administered a semistructured research diagnostic interview for DSM-5 adult ADHD. In 2016, the Risk-Calibrated Supersparse Linear Integer Model, a novel machine-learning algorithm designed to create screening scales with optimal integer weights and limited numbers of screening questions, was applied to the pooled data to create a DSM-5 version of the ASRS screening scale. The accuracy of the new scale was then confirmed in an independent 2011–2012 clinical sample of patients seeking evaluation at the New York University Langone Medical Center Adult ADHD Program (NYU Langone) and 2015–2016 primary care controls (n = 300). Data analysis was conducted from April 4, 2016, to September 22, 2016.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and positive predictive value (PPV) of the revised ASRS.

Results

Of the total 637 participants, 44 (37.0%) household survey respondents, 51 (23.4%) managed care respondents, and 173 (57.7%) NYU Langone respondents met DSM-5 criteria for adult ADHD in the semistructured diagnostic interview. Of the respondents who met DSM-5 criteria for adult ADHD, 123 were male (45.9%); mean (SD) age was 33.1 (11.4) years. A 6-question screening scale was found to be optimal in distinguishing cases from noncases in the first 2 samples. Operating characteristics were excellent at the diagnostic threshold in the weighted (to the 8.2% DSM-5/Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale population prevalence) data (sensitivity, 91.4%; specificity, 96.0%; AUC, 0.94; PPV, 67.3%). Operating characteristics were similar despite a much higher prevalence (57.7%) when the scale was applied to the NYU Langone clinical sample (sensitivity, 91.9%; specificity, 74.0%; AUC, 0.83; PPV, 82.8%).

Conclusions and Relevance

The new ADHD screening scale is short, easily scored, detects the vast majority of general population cases at a threshold that also has high specificity and PPV, and could be used as a screening tool in specialty treatment settings.

### Clinical update: collaborative mental health care for children and adolescents in pediatric primary care [^115fongb]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Roles of integrated mental health care team members — primary care clinician (PCC), care manager/behavioral health consultant (CM/BHC), child and adolescent psychiatrist, and other specialist consultants — are outlined with typical functions across mental health (MH) screening, assessment, prescribing, coordination, psychotherapy, and consultation. The primary care clinician responsibilities include universal MH screening, initial MH assessment or triage, patient/family engagement, and joint diagnosis and treatment planning; first-line medication prescribing for anxiety, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as indicated; periodic meetings to review progress and collaboratively adjust care; consideration of child and adolescent psychiatrist consultation and treatment escalation if progress is lacking; second-line medication prescribing in consultation; specialty referrals; and planning for treatment discontinuation and follow-up. The CM/BHC coordinates care by maintaining a registry, conducting focused MH assessment and psychosocial needs evaluation, collaborating with the PCC and family on treatment planning, arranging psychosocial resources and services from child-serving entities, assessing barriers and treatment response via periodic symptom rating scales, meeting periodically with the PCC, facilitating care transitions, considering specialty referral and discontinuation timing, planning post-discontinuation follow-up, and using health information technology for information sharing and care coordination. Psychotherapeutic interventions include developing a therapeutic alliance, providing brief cross-diagnostic psychotherapy, problem-solving for challenging psychosocial situations, support for coping with chronic medical conditions, and MH education for the integrated team. The child and adolescent psychiatrist meets periodically with CM/BHC to review the patient registry, provides diagnostic clarification and review of the formulation and plan and treatment progress, and suggests psychosocial/psychotherapeutic, pharmacologic, and other specialty referrals as indicated. Other specialist consultants conduct additional physical, developmental, cognitive, social/emotional/behavioral, academic, and family assessments as indicated.

### Diagnosing ADHD | Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder… [^112yZyRB]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

How is ADHD diagnosed. Deciding if a person has ADHD is a process with several steps. There is no single test to diagnose ADHD, and many other problems, such as sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, and certain types of learning disabilities, can also have symptoms similar to ADHD. When to talk with a doctor the first step is to talk with a healthcare provider to find out if the symptoms fit an ADHD diagnosis. The diagnosis can be made by a mental health professional, like a psychologist or psychiatrist, or by a primary care provider, like a pediatrician. DSM-5 criteria for ADHD Healthcare providers use the guidelines in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth edition, to help diagnose ADHD. This diagnostic standard helps ensure that people are appropriately diagnosed and treated for ADHD.

Using the same standard across communities can also help determine how many children have ADHD, and how public health is impacted by this condition. People with ADHD show a persistent pattern of inattentionA and/or hyperactivityB–impulsivityC that interferes with functioning or development: DSM-5 criteria for ADHD diagnosis Symptoms and they are inappropriate for developmental level. present for at least 6 months.
- Often has trouble organizing tasks and activities.
- Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to do tasks that require mental effort over a long period of time.
- Often loses things necessary for tasks and activities. In addition to the above criteria, the following conditions must also be met:

- Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present before age 12 years.
- Several symptoms are present in two or more settings.
- There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of, social, school, or work functioning.
- The symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder. The symptoms do not happen only during the course of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder.

### ADHD in adults: an overview… [^1135Lwjy]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- ADHD symptoms start in childhood and can continue into adulthood, but they may look different in adults.
- Just as ADHD symptoms and the way they impact daily living may change across the lifetime, needs for support and treatment may differ for adults and children.
- CDC collects data on ADHD in adults and works with partners to improve the lives of people with ADHD. Adults with ADHD can struggle with:

- Managing their attention
- Completing lengthy tasks unless interesting
- Staying organized
- Controlling their behavior
- Hyperactive symptoms, such as feeling internally restless and fidgety Especially in times when stress and demands are high, ADHD can cause difficulty with:

- Daily tasks
- Social relationships
- Consistency in healthy behaviors such as exercise, proper nutrition, and good sleep
- Avoiding health risks such as substance use, infections, and injuries. Diagnosis and treatment ADHD symptoms can be severe and can cause difficulties with daily life.

Without the right treatment and support, ADHD may seriously impact one's health and well-being. Important If you are concerned about whether you have ADHD, the first step is to talk with a healthcare provider to find out if the symptoms you are experiencing fit an ADHD diagnosis. A healthcare provider may diagnose ADHD themselves or refer you to a mental health provider. Diagnosis Diagnosing ADHD usually includes a checklist for rating ADHD symptoms and looking at the person's history of behavior and experiences. The provider will determine if ADHD symptoms were present before age 12 years and may ask for permission to gather information from friends and family. A medical and psychological exam may be needed to rule out other health problems that can cause symptoms like ADHD or that are often present with ADHD, such as anxiety, depression, sleep problems, alcohol or substance misuse, or learning disabilities.

Treatment ADHD can often be managed with the right treatment. There are many treatment options, such as medication and therapy, and what works best can depend on the person and their environment. Treatment for ADHD can include medication — most commonly stimulant medication — as well as therapy and other behavioral treatments, or a combination of methods. What works best depends on the person and their family. Effective treatment plans will include close monitoring, follow-ups, and making changes, if needed, along the way. The American Professional Society for ADHD and Related Disorders is currently working to create U. S. Guidelines for Adults with ADHD.
