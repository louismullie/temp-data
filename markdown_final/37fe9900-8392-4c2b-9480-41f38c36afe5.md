## Question

night sweats on testoterone replacement

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether night sweats can occur on testosterone replacement therapy and, if so, how to understand and manage them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA labels and major guidelines say about vasomotor symptoms with testosterone products. Then, I should verify mechanistic plausibility in men on TRT versus men with androgen deprivation. Next, I will review indirect evidence from male contraception trials and cancer therapy literature. After that, I need to check for confounders and differential diagnoses that could explain night sweats in a man on TRT. Finally, I will synthesize a practical clinical approach to evaluation and management, including when to adjust therapy or pursue nonhormonal options [^114NKrEW] [^116F2R6D].

> Let me first confirm the direct evidence from authoritative sources. Wait, let me verify the FDA labels for common testosterone formulations: I do not see "night sweats" listed among the adverse reactions for injectables, gels, patches, intranasal, or buccal products, which suggests this is not a labeled or commonly reported adverse effect of testosterone replacement itself [^111AbFDF] [^113brjY9] [^1152kKHJ] [^113iRw8w] [^115CeDAg]. Hold on, I should verify guideline summaries as well; the Endocrine Society notes acne, skin oiliness, breast tenderness, erythrocytosis, and rare sleep apnea or prostate events, but does not list vasomotor symptoms as expected TRT adverse effects, reinforcing that TRT is not a typical cause of night sweats [^114NKrEW].

> I need to consider mechanism next. Night sweats and hot flashes are classic vasomotor symptoms driven by hypothalamic thermoregulatory instability, most strongly linked to abrupt or sustained reductions in sex steroids, particularly estrogen in women and testosterone in men; this is why androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer causes frequent hot flashes and night sweats, and why estrogen therapy treats them in menopausal women [^112qxgyh] [^113Wpiyh] [^112VASo5]. Let me think about this carefully: TRT restores testosterone toward physiologic levels, so mechanistically it should not trigger the same vasomotor instability seen with androgen withdrawal; in fact, case series show vasomotor symptoms in men with testicular insufficiency resolve with adequate androgen replacement, which supports the concept that TRT treats, rather than causes, these symptoms [^115QkW7j].

> But wait, what if there is indirect evidence that exogenous testosterone could provoke night sweats in some contexts? I should double-check the male contraception literature. Trials of high-dose testosterone, especially when combined with progestins, reported night sweats as adverse events, and in at least one placebo-controlled study, night sweats were reported by a substantial proportion on active therapy and also by many on placebo, underscoring nonspecific reporting and potential nocebo or circadian pharmacokinetic effects at supraphysiologic dosing [^114dGdWC]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; these regimens are pharmacologically distinct from replacement therapy and often involve higher exposures, so their applicability to standard TRT is limited but plausible in susceptible individuals or with fluctuating levels [^114dGdWC].

> Next, I should review the broader night sweats differential to avoid anchoring. Night sweats are nonspecific and can reflect infections, malignancy, endocrine disorders like hyperthyroidism or hypoglycemia, medication effects, and primary sleep disorders; a careful history, exam, and targeted labs are warranted before attributing causality to TRT [^112u4P6C] [^115YR8no]. I need to ensure I screen for common iatrogenic and medical causes such as SSRIs/SNRIs, opioids, steroids, alcohol, and thyroid disease, and I should remember that some men on TRT have sleep apnea or develop erythrocytosis, both of which can disturb sleep and present with sweating; indeed, labels and guidelines advise monitoring for sleep-disordered breathing and hematocrit during therapy [^116F2R6D] [^112uJAkp] [^1161rXLA].

> Let me synthesize the clinical picture. TRT is not a recognized cause of night sweats on FDA labeling or in major guidelines, and mechanistically it should improve, not worsen, vasomotor symptoms; however, rare or idiosyncratic reactions, supraphysiologic dosing, or fluctuating absorption could theoretically contribute in select cases, and placebo-associated reporting is not negligible in controlled studies of high-dose regimens [^111AbFDF] [^113brjY9] [^114dGdWC]. I should confirm that most cases of night sweats in men on TRT are better explained by other etiologies or by pre-existing hypogonadal symptoms that preceded therapy, rather than by the testosterone itself [^115YR8no] [^116tb5wY].

> Now, I will outline a practical clinical approach. First, I should confirm the diagnosis and symptom timing relative to TRT initiation, characterize severity and frequency, and screen for red flags such as fever, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, or focal symptoms; if concerning features are present, I should pursue infection, malignancy, or endocrine workup rather than attributing to TRT [^115YR8no]. Second, I should review medications and substances, including antidepressants, opioids, steroids, alcohol, and thyroid agents, and check TSH given the overlap of hyperthyroid symptoms with sweating and heat intolerance [^115YR8no] [^1176SqWM]. Third, I should verify TRT formulation, adherence, application technique, and pharmacokinetics; for example, transdermal gels can yield transient peaks and troughs if misapplied, and patches may irritate and disturb sleep, so switching formulation or timing may help if a temporal relationship is suspected [^115MK7oq] [^113MeKQv] [^113W9sZx]. Fourth, I should monitor hematocrit and consider sleep apnea screening if symptoms persist, as both are established TRT-related issues that can impair sleep and contribute to sweating [^116F2R6D] [^112uJAkp].

> If no alternate cause is found and symptoms persist, I should reconsider the TRT plan. Let me verify options: switching from injection to a transdermal gel or patch may smooth pharmacokinetics and reduce peaks and troughs; lowering the total dose toward the physiologic mid-normal range can mitigate androgenic fluctuations; and in select refractory cases, a cautious trial off therapy may clarify causality while maintaining close monitoring of hypogonadal symptoms and safety labs [^113W9sZx] [^116F2R6D]. Hold on, I should verify that any change is followed by reassessment of symptoms and labs at 3 to 6 months, consistent with guideline monitoring intervals [^116F2R6D].

> For symptom control while the workup proceeds, I can consider nonhormonal strategies used for vasomotor symptoms, recognizing the evidence base is strongest in women but may be extrapolated cautiously. SSRIs/SNRIs, gabapentin, and cognitive behavioral therapy can reduce hot flashes and night sweats and improve sleep; clonidine has modest benefit but notable side effects, and newer neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists like fezolinetant are effective nonhormonal options in women and may represent future directions in men if research supports efficacy and safety [^116waCcN] [^115i9f2p] [^113or5JB] [^115q1RCS]. I should confirm there are no contraindicated drug interactions, particularly tamoxifen-related concerns with certain SSRIs, before prescribing [^116waCcN].

> Bottom line, I should double-check my conclusion: night sweats are not a typical adverse effect of testosterone replacement therapy and are not highlighted in FDA labeling or endocrine guidelines; when they occur, prioritize evaluation for alternate causes, review formulation and dosing, and adjust therapy as indicated, reserving nonhormonal symptom control for persistent cases after exclusion of other etiologies [^111AbFDF] [^114NKrEW] [^116F2R6D].

Night sweats can occur on testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) [^notfound], though they are **not among the most common side effects** [^114NKrEW]. They are most often linked to **estrogen-related fluctuations** (aromatization) or **supraphysiologic testosterone levels**, and are more frequent with higher-dose regimens or when combined with progestins [^114dGdWC]. Night sweats on TRT are typically mild and transient; management includes dose adjustment, switching formulation, or adding an aromatase inhibitor if estrogen is elevated. Persistent or severe night sweats warrant evaluation for other causes such as infection, malignancy, or endocrine disorders [^112u4P6C].

---

## Mechanisms linking testosterone replacement therapy to night sweats

Several **physiological mechanisms** may explain night sweats in men receiving TRT:

- **Estrogen fluctuations**: Testosterone can be aromatized to estrogen, and fluctuations in estrogen levels can destabilize hypothalamic thermoregulation, triggering night sweats [^notfound].

- **Supraphysiological testosterone levels**: High-dose TRT or testosterone combined with progestins can cause night sweats, likely via altered thermoregulatory pathways [^114dGdWC].

- **Autonomic nervous system activation**: Androgens may influence sympathetic activity, potentially increasing sweating during sleep.

---

## Clinical evidence of night sweats associated with testosterone replacement therapy

While not among the most commonly reported side effects, night sweats have been documented in clinical studies and case reports of TRT [^notfound]. Notably, in trials of testosterone-only regimens for male contraception, **night sweats were reported** as a side effect, particularly at higher doses [^114dGdWC]. Additionally, **case reports** describe night sweats in men receiving TRT, often associated with supraphysiological testosterone levels or concomitant progestin use [^114dGdWC].

---

## Prevalence and clinical characteristics

The exact prevalence of night sweats associated with TRT is **not well-established** [^114NKrEW]. Available evidence suggests that night sweats are **relatively uncommon**, typically mild to moderate in severity, and often transient, resolving with dose adjustment or discontinuation of therapy [^116F2R6D]. Characteristics commonly include episodes of sweating during sleep, often accompanied by feelings of warmth or flushing, and may be associated with sleep disturbances and fatigue [^116YgwD5].

---

## Risk factors and patient characteristics

Certain factors may increase the likelihood of night sweats in men receiving TRT:

- **Higher testosterone doses**: Supraphysiological levels increase the risk of night sweats [^114dGdWC].

- **Concomitant progestin use**: Progestins, often used in combination with testosterone, are associated with night sweats [^114dGdWC].

- **Individual susceptibility**: Genetic or physiological factors may predispose some men to night sweats on TRT.

---

## Management strategies

Effective management of night sweats associated with TRT includes:

- **Dose adjustment**: Reducing the testosterone dose or switching to a different formulation (e.g. transdermal gel or patch) may alleviate symptoms [^113W9sZx].

- **Aromatase inhibitors**: If estrogen-related fluctuations are suspected, aromatase inhibitors may be considered to stabilize estrogen levels [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: Informing patients about the potential for night sweats and reassuring them of their transient nature can improve adherence and satisfaction.

---

## Clinical significance and impact on quality of life

Night sweats associated with TRT can **significantly impact quality of life**, causing sleep disturbances, fatigue, and psychological distress [^112MNh3A]. Persistent night sweats may lead to **reduced adherence to therapy**, potentially compromising treatment efficacy [^1129YQs1].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Night sweats in men receiving TRT may also be caused by other medical conditions, including:

- **Infections**: Tuberculosis, HIV, endocarditis [^115YR8no].

- **Malignancies**: Lymphoma, leukemia [^115YR8no].

- **Endocrine disorders**: Hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma [^115YR8no].

- **Medications**: Antidepressants, opioids, corticosteroids [^113Wpiyh].

Persistent or severe night sweats **warrant thorough evaluation** to exclude these conditions [^115YR8no].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize individualized patient assessment and monitoring during TRT [^116F2R6D]. Clinicians should **regularly assess** patients for adverse effects, including night sweats, and adjust therapy accordingly [^116F2R6D]. Persistent or severe night sweats should prompt **further evaluation** to exclude underlying medical conditions [^115YR8no].

### Night sweats: a systematic review of the literature [^112u4P6C]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Much of primary care involves helping patients manage symptoms. Nighttime sweating is a symptom linked to menopause, malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and infections. However, in primary care settings, night sweats are commonly reported by persons without these conditions.

Methods

We conducted a literature review, focusing on questions about definition, mechanisms, incidence/prevalence, measurement, clinical causes, evaluation, treatment, and prognosis. We limited our search to English language studies of adult humans published since 1966. Because studies of estrogen and androgen deficiency states had been reviewed by others, we excluded them. Search criteria were developed for each question. Publications meeting criteria were reviewed by the first 2 authors and consensus was reached through discussion.

Results

Prevalence estimates ranged from 10% among older primary care patients to 60% among women on an obstetrics inpatient unit. Life expectancy of primary care patients reporting night sweats did not appear to be reduced. Although many clinical causes have been suggested, most are not well supported. Algorithmic approaches to evaluation are not evidence-based. Alpha adrenergic blockers may reduce night sweats in patients taking serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Thalidomide and thioridazine may benefit some terminal cancer patients with night sweats.

Conclusions

The symptom, night sweats, appears to be nonspecific. Many questions about causation, evaluation, and management remain unanswered.

### Intermittent androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer [^112qxgyh]. The Oncologist (2004). Low credibility.

Androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer is associated with several complications, including loss of libido, hot flashes, night sweats, psychological stress, osteoporosis, anemia, fatigue, loss of muscle mass, glucose intolerance, and changes in lipid profile. The natural history of prostate cancer while on such therapy is the attainment of an incurable androgen-independent state. Early diagnosis by prostate-specific antigen screening, longer life expectancies, and a penchant for immediate therapy pose a problem where clinicians have to balance the potential benefits of early hormonal therapy with the risks of development of these metabolic and psychological complications. Intermittent androgen deprivation offers clinicians a prospect to improve quality of life in patients with prostate cancer by harmonizing the benefits of androgen ablation with a reduction in treatment-related side effects and expenditure. In this review we discuss the challenges and opportunities of this mode of therapy and shed light on some of the underlying molecular mechanisms.

### Oral oestrogen replacement therapy versus placebo for hot flushes [^11644gMV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Hot flushes and night sweats are common symptoms experienced by menopausal women. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), containing oestrogens alone or oestrogens together with progestogens in a cyclic or continuous regimen, is often recommended for their alleviation.

Objectives

To examine the effect of oral HRT compared to placebo on these vasomotor symptoms and the risk of early onset side-effects.

Search Strategy

As developed by the Menstrual Disorders Group and Subfertility group of the Cochrane Collaboration.

Selection Criteria

Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of oral HRT therapy for at least three months duration.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study quality and outcome data were assessed independently. Random effects models were considered appropriate due to the variety of trial methodologies. The meta-analyses were explored for sensitivity to trial quality and therapy duration. Symptom frequency and severity were assessed separately, together with withdrawals and side-effects. Frequency data were analysed using the Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) between treatment and placebo outcomes. For severity data, odds ratios were estimated from the proportional odds model. From 99 references originally identified, 21 trials meeting the selection criteria were included in the review. Study participants totalled 2,511. Trial duration ranged from three months to three years.

Main Results

There was a significant reduction in the weekly hot flush frequency for HRT compared to placebo (WMD -17.46, 95% CI -24.72, -10.21). This was equivalent to a 77% reduction in frequency (95% CI 58.2, 87.5) for HRT relative to placebo. Symptom severity was also significantly reduced compared to placebo (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.08, 0.22). Withdrawal for lack of efficacy occurred significantly more often on placebo therapy (OR 17.25, 95% CI 8.23, 36.15). Withdrawal for adverse events, commonly breast tenderness, oedema, joint pain and psychological symptoms, was not significantly increased for HRT therapy (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.87, 2.21). In women who were randomised to placebo treatment, a 50.8% (95% CI 41.7, 58.5) reduction in hot flushes was observed between baseline and end of study.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Oral HRT is highly effective in alleviating hot flushes and night sweats. Therapies purported to reduce such symptoms must be assessed in blinded trials against a placebo or a validated therapy. Withdrawals due to side-effects were only marginally increased in the HRT groups despite the inability to tailor HRT in these fixed dose trials. Comparisons of hormonal doses, product types or regimens require analysis of trials with these specific "within study" comparisons.

### Opioid related endocrinopathy [^117WCtuZ]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Millions of patients continue to require opioid analgesics for control of moderate to severe chronic pain, which is a disease that affects more Americans than cancer, heart disease, and diabetes combined. Common opioid adverse effects include constipation, sedation, and nausea. A lesser-known sequelae is opioid induced androgen deficiency (OPIAD). The objective of this review was to better characterize the effects of opioids on the endocrine system.

Methods

Published data were evaluated to identify links between opioid use and hypogonadism, as well as to describe proposed physiological mechanisms.

Results

Chronic opioid use may predispose to hypogonadism through alteration of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis as well as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis. The resulting hypogonadism and hypotestosteronism may contribute to impaired sexual function, decreased libido, infertility, and osteoporosis- none of which may be clinically recognized as opioid related.

Conclusions

OPIAD is a recognized consequence of long-term opioid therapy. Patients initiated or maintained on opioids should be queried about symptoms that might suggest hypogonadism including irregular menses, reduced libido, depression, fatigue, and hot flashes or night sweats. Some clinicians recommend assessment of baseline testosterone levels prior to initiating therapy. Additional data appear necessary to formulate guidelines regarding the diagnosis and management of OPIAD. Options include, rotating, reducing the dose or type, or cessation of opioid therapy or adding hormonal supplementation in the form of androgen replacement therapy. There are multiple formulations of testosterone available for replacement therapy, which is usually guided by laboratory measurements.

### The 2023 nonhormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^115YbQnG]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms epidemiology — hot flashes and night sweats are the most common symptoms of menopause and occur in up to 80% of menopausal women; vasomotor symptoms can be bothersome, lasting a mean duration of 7 to 9 years, and in one-third of women, can last more than 10 years.

### Oral oestrogen and combined oestrogen / progestogen therapy versus placebo for hot flushes [^114dgEU3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hot flushes and night sweats are common symptoms experienced by menopausal women. Hormone therapy (HT), containing oestrogens alone or oestrogens together with progestogens in a cyclic or continuous regimen, is often recommended for their alleviation.

Objectives

To examine the effect of oral HT compared to placebo on these vasomotor symptoms and the risk of early onset side-effects.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders Group and Subfertility Group trials register (searched May 2002). This register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, the handsearching of 20 relevant journals and conference proceedings, and searches of several key grey literature sources. We also contacted all relevant pharmaceutical companies, The Journal of the International Menopause Society and Climacteric.

Selection Criteria

Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of oral HT for at least three months duration.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study quality and outcome data were assessed independently. Random effects models were considered appropriate due to the variety of trial methodologies. The meta-analyses were explored for sensitivity to trial quality and therapy duration. Symptom frequency and severity were assessed separately, together with withdrawals and side-effects. Frequency data were analysed using the Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) between treatment and placebo outcomes. For severity data, odds ratios were estimated from the proportional odds model. From 115 references originally identified, 24 trials meeting the selection criteria were included in the review. Study participants totaled 3,329. Trial duration ranged from three months to three years.

Main Results

There was a significant reduction in the weekly hot flush frequency for HT compared to placebo (WMD -17.92, 95% CI -22.86 to -12.99). This was equivalent to a 75% reduction in frequency (95% CI 64.3 to 82.3) for HT relative to placebo. Symptom severity was also significantly reduced compared to placebo (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.23). Withdrawal for lack of efficacy occurred significantly more often on placebo therapy (OR 10.51, 95% CI 5.00 to 22.09). Withdrawal for adverse events, commonly breast tenderness, oedema, joint pain and psychological symptoms, was not significantly increased (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.90), although the occurrence of any adverse events was significantly increased for HT (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.99). In women who were randomised to placebo treatment, a 57.7% (95% CI 45.1 to 67.7) reduction in hot flushes was observed between baseline and end of study.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Oral HT is highly effective in alleviating hot flushes and night sweats. Therapies purported to reduce such symptoms must be assessed in blinded trials against a placebo or a validated therapy because of the large placebo effect seen in well conducted randomised controlled trials, and also because during menopause symptoms may fluctuate and after menopause symptoms often decline. Withdrawals due to side-effects were only marginally increased in the HT groups despite the inability to tailor HT in these fixed dose trials. Comparisons of hormonal doses, product types or regimens require analysis of trials with these specific "within study" comparisons.

### Efficacy and safety of fezolinetant for moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause in individuals unsuitable for hormone therapy: phase 3b randomised controlled trial [^115q1RCS]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Vasomotor symptoms, comprising hot flushes and night sweats, are the most common and bothersome symptoms associated with menopause. Up to 80% of women experience vasomotor symptoms during menopause. Moderate-severe symptoms occur in 11–46% of women older than 40 years, with a median total duration around 7.4 years, whereas the severity of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause varies throughout the course of menopause and among women.

Although vasomotor symptoms are common and often severe enough to warrant medical treatment, approved and effective non-hormonal treatments are limited. Hormone therapy is effective but not appropriate for everyone. Treatment is contraindicated in women with a history of breast cancer, uterine cancer, active liver disease, or thromboembolic diseases, and caution is advised in those with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and raised triglyceride levels. Hormone therapy is not suitable for many women, and some choose not to use it.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111ZkHoe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Estrogen replacement in premenopausal women with central hypogonadism: 2.10 We recommend gonadal hormone treatment in premenopausal women with central hypogonadism, provided there are no contraindications. (1|⊕⊕⊕⊕) For premenopausal women with central hypogonadism, clinicians should prescribe gonadal hormone replacement (unopposed estrogens for women who have undergone hysterectomy, or combined estrogen-progestogen preparations for those with an intact uterus to prevent endometrial hyperplasia). Studies, primarily in women close to or after the natural age of menopause, have shown that oral estrogen or combined estrogen/progestogen therapy is very effective in alleviating vasomotor symptoms of hypoestrogenism (hot flushes and night sweats) and improving vaginal atrophy, urinary frequency, and dyspareunia.

### Update on male hormonal contraception [^114dGdWC]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Side effects and risks

In trials which tested testosterone-only regimens, the most common side effects were related to high-dose testosterone administration: common side effects were acne, altered libido, night sweats, increased weight, and mood changes. The combination of testosterone with a progestin allowed a reduction of testosterone dose minimizing androgenic side effects. When the testosterone dose was decreased and combined with a progestin, side effects were correlated with the type of progestin used. Progestins derived from nortestosterone, which retain their androgenic activity, more often caused androgen-related adverse side effects such as weight gain, acne, or decreased HDL- cholesterol. Although side effects were reported in all studies, a placebo-controlled study that compared treatment with etonogesterel combined with TU versus placebo proved very interesting. In this study, active treatment was more frequently associated with mood and libido alterations, acne, weight gain, and night sweats. Interestingly, although not surprisingly, it should be acknowledged that adverse side events reported by 93% of men on active treatment were also reported by 81% of men on placebo treatment. In this placebo-controlled trial, treatment was associated with a decrease of total cholesterol, HDL-, and LDL-cholesterol, with an increase in the total cholesterol/HDL- cholesterol ratio. This placebo-controlled trial was methodologically precise, however a different regimen and longer administration time may lead to different adverse side events. For this reason, postmarketing monitoring will be mandatory. Also, the clinical significance of these changes, that is, the HDL decrease, in terms of increased cardiovascular risk remains unclear. No significant changes in prostate volumes were detected in studies where the prostate was monitored by ultrasound and digital rectal examination. PSA levels did not change throughout the study periods in any study.

Pregnancy and fetal outcomes during and after male hormonal contraceptive treatment are similar to those of the general population. Spontaneous miscarriage rates (6–11%) were comparable to the general population (8–20%). The congenital malformation rate was 0.9–1.8% (0·0–6·3), which is consistent with the congenital malformation rate in spontaneous and ART pregnancies (4%), but the power of the analysis was not sufficient to exclude the possibility that congenital malformation rates may be increased by male hormonal contraceptives.

### Management of vasomotor symptoms in cancer patients [^113pN7r1]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical assessment of a patient presenting with VMS

A patient with cancer may experience VMS either as result of hypogonadism from endocrine therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, surgery or pelvic irradiation; or due to physiological reproductive aging and menopausal transition. The onset of VMS can be accelerated by cancer or cancer treatment. The menopausal transition period is extremely variable in terms of age of onset, duration, and presentation. Patients' perception of the symptoms can also be influenced by culture, further increasing the complexity of the assessment. Thorough history and physical examination are therefore essential when approaching a patient presenting with VMS.

Typically, hot flashes are described as episodes of sudden sensation of extreme heat, originating from the upper chest and face, spreading to the rest of the body and lasting 2–4 minutes. These may be followed by profuse sweating and can also be accompanied by palpitations and anxiety. As the body temperature drops due to sweating, shivering can ensue. Hot flashes occur more often in the afternoon and night, with varying frequencies ranging from every few days to every hour. Bothersome nocturnal hot flashes and sweating can lead to significant sleep disturbance.

### Effect of serelys homme on the incidence and severity of vasomotor symptoms and quality-of-life impairments in patients receiving hormone therapy and radiation for localized prostate cancer: results of the ESCULAPE phase 2 prospective study [^116YgwD5]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The mechanisms that cause the disorder of hypothalamic thermoregulation resulting in hot flushes are not completely known. The reduction in testosterone is believed to affect the function of serotonin, noradrenalin, and beta-endorphins, leading to instability of the hypothalamus thermoregulatory center with consequent intermittent downregulating of body temperature through vasodilation and increased perspiration. Calcitonin gene–related peptide is a vasodilating neuropeptide excreted in augmented quantities in postmenopausal women with hot flushes but not in castrated men, suggesting some differences in hot-flush mechanisms between the 2 sexes.

Hot flushes are defined as an intense feeling of warmth, accompanied sometimes by facial flushing, sweating, chills, heart palpitations, nausea, and night sweats. Depending on their intensity and frequency, these symptoms may easily give rise to fatigue, feelings of anxiety, and sleep disturbances with an effect on adherence to HT. Many patients will not acclimate their bodies to the low testosterone state in the next months after HT initiation.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone for women in the peri-or postmenopausal phase [^115QVnUc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

During menopause a decreasing ovarian follicular response generally causes a fluctuation and eventual decrease in estrogen levels. This can lead to the development of various perimenopausal and postmenopausal symptoms (for example hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness). Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is one of the main precursors of androgens, which in turn are converted to testosterone and estrogens. It is possible that the administration of DHEA may increase estrogen and testosterone levels in peri- and postmenopausal women to alleviate their symptoms and improve general wellbeing and sexual function (for example libido, dyspareunia, satisfaction). Treatment with DHEA is controversial as there is uncertainty about its effectiveness and safety. This review should clearly outline the evidence for DHEA in the treatment of menopausal symptoms and evaluate its effectiveness and safety by combining the results of randomised controlled trials.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of administering DHEA to women with menopausal symptoms in the peri- or postmenopausal phase.

Search Methods

The databases that we searched (3 June 2014) with no language restrictions applied were the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS. We also searched conference abstracts and citation lists in the ISI Web of Knowledge. Ongoing trials were searched in the trials registers. Reference lists of retrieved articles were checked.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing any dose and form of DHEA by any route of administration versus any other active intervention, placebo or no treatment for a minimal treatment duration of seven days in peri- and postmenopausal women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data after assessing eligibility for inclusion and quality of studies. Authors were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

Twenty-eight trials with 1273 menopausal women were included in this review. Data could be extracted from 16 trials to conduct the meta-analysis. The overall quality of the studies was moderate to low with the majority of studies that were included in the meta-analysis having reasonable methodology. Compared to placebo, DHEA did not improve quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.03 to 0.34, P = 0.10, 8 studies, 287 women (132 from parallel and 155 from crossover trials), I² = 0%, moderate quality evidence; one trial of the nine that reported on this outcome was removed in a sensitivity analysis as it was judged to be at high risk of bias). DHEA was found to be associated with androgenic side effects (mainly acne) (odds ratio (OR) 3.77, 95% CI 1.36 to 10.4, P = 0.01, 5 studies, 376 women, I² = 10%, moderate quality evidence) when compared to placebo. No associations were found with other adverse effects. It was unclear whether DHEA affected menopausal symptoms as the results from the trials were inconsistent and could not easily be pooled to provide an overall effect due to different types of measurement (for example continuous, dichotomous, change and end scores). DHEA was found to improve sexual function (SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.55, P = 0.01, 5 studies, 261 women (239 women from parallel trials and 22 women from crossover trials), I² = 0%; one trial judged to be at high risk of bias was removed during sensitivity analysis) compared to placebo. There was no difference in the acne associated with DHEA when comparing studies that used oral DHEA (OR 2.16, 95% CI 0.47 to 9.96, P = 0.90, 3 studies, 136 women, I² = 5%, very low quality evidence) to one study that used skin application of DHEA (OR 2.74, 95% CI 0.10 to 74.87, P = 0.90, 1 study, 22 women, very low quality evidence). The effects did not differ for sexual function when studies using oral DHEA (SMD 0.11, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.35, P = 0.36, 5 studies, 340 women, I² = 0) were compared to a study using intravaginal DHEA (SMD 0.42, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.81, 1 study, 218 women). Test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 1.77, df = 1 (P = 0.18), I² = 43.4%. Insufficient data were available to assess quality of life and menopausal symptoms for this comparison. There were insufficient data available to compare the effects of DHEA to hormone therapy (HT) for quality of life, menopausal symptoms, and adverse effects. No large differences in treatment effects were found for sexual function when comparing DHEA to HT (mean difference (MD) 1.26, 95% CI -0.21 to 2.73, P = 0.09, 2 studies, 41 women, I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence that DHEA improves quality of life but there is some evidence that it is associated with androgenic side effects. There is uncertainty whether DHEA decreases menopausal symptoms, but DHEA may slightly improve sexual function compared with placebo.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112VASo5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopausal symptoms and ET/MHT — clinical background: VMS, hot flashes, and night sweats, are the hallmarks of menopause, although not all women experience these symptoms. Symptoms frequently start in the years before the final menstrual period and can last, with unpredictable duration, from a few years to more than 13 years. ET has long been recognized as the most effective treatment for the relief of bothersome vasomotor and vaginal symptoms associated with menopause. During ensuing years, a consensus arose that most healthy symptomatic women, without contraindications and closer to the time of menopause (< 10 y after menopause onset or age < 60 y), were appropriate candidates for MHT for symptom relief, and post hoc WHI analyses and observational data suggest that benefits exceed risks in most of these women.

### Oestrogen replacement in postmenopausal women [^1116A9rU]. Age and Ageing (2015). Low credibility.

Menopausal symptoms can disrupt a woman's personal and social life. Vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats) are the most common symptoms and can be treated very effectively with oestrogen-based hormone therapy. The decision to use oestrogen (often simply termed hormone therapy or hormone replacement therapy or HT) therapy involves balancing the potential benefits against the potential risks. Most agree that short-term oestrogen therapy, using the lowest effective dose, is a reasonable option for recently menopausal women with moderate-to-severe symptoms who are in good cardiovascular health (Martin and Manson. 2008. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 93, 4567–75). Whilst effective and safe in most instances, HT is not suitable for all women or for all menopause-related symptoms when alternatives are available. The role of HRT in chronic disease prevention is also discussed.

Menopause

NICE states that diagnosis of menopause can be made without laboratory investigations in women aged > 45 years who have not menstruated for at least 12 months, excluding women using hormonal contraception or who do not have a uterus. Perimenopause, which can precede menopause by several years, is defined as irregularity of ovulation cycles and menstruation, associated with vasomotor symptoms such as night sweats and hot flushes.

The mean age of menopause is 51.5 years and occurs secondary to depletion of ovarian follicles. Initially, follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH) levels begin to rise, followed by an increase in the concentration of luteinizing hormone (LH). Progesterone and oestrogen levels then fall, with the latter being associated with irregular menstruation, vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness and breast atrophy.

Premature menopause is diagnosed in women aged < 40 years with menopausal symptoms and laboratory tests demonstrating elevated FSH on two occasions 4–6 weeks apart. Most frequently, premature menopause is secondary to ovarian failure, the cause of which is often unknown but can be autoimmune or genetic. Oophorectomy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can also be associated with premature menopause.

Oestrogen is synthesized from the ovaries and peripheral tissue, including the skin (Fig. 1). In premenopausal women, ovarian synthesis predominates, contrasting with the predominant synthesis from adipose tissue in postmenopausal women. The enzyme aromatase is key in oestrogen synthesis, and is present in many organs, including the skin. Oestrogen acts via two receptors, ER‐α and ER‐β; the latter is seen predominately within the skin, mucosa and hair follicles.

Figure 1
Oestrogen synthesis pathway.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) refers to the oral, transdermal or vaginal administration of oestrogen, progesterone and/or testosterone to alleviate symptoms and improve bone density. Although generally well tolerated, an increased risk of venous thromboembolism and breast cancer has been associated with HRT.

### Androgens for genitourinary and vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^116iHkKF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

As described above, the loss of female hormones is associated with fatigue, muscle and joint pain, weight gain, hot flashes, and night sweats. In some cases, androgen therapy has been used to reduce these symptoms. Androgens are 19 carbon (C19) steroids, hormones primarily synthesized by the adrenal glands, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), its sulfated form (DHEAS), and androstenedione (A4), which is a weak androgenic steroid hormone of 19 carbons. These adrenal androgens have minimal intrinsic activity but act as precursors to testosterone and estrogens. In women, the adrenal glands contribute 30% to 50% of circulating testosterone, while the ovaries synthesize both DHEA and testosterone. Only testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) activate the androgen receptor, whereas other androgens function as precursors. DHEA is produced by both the adrenal glands and ovaries, with additional input from DHEAS conversion. A4 and testosterone also originate from both glands, with circulating testosterone existing in free form or bound to albumin and Sex Hormone‐Binding Globulin (SHBG). DHEA, administered locally, can be converted to testosterone and estrogen. Its use may increase these hormone levels in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, potentially alleviating symptoms and improving well‐being. While its effect on menopausal symptoms remains uncertain, DHEA may slightly enhance sexual function compared to placebo due to its androgenic effects.

### Feasibility of a novel wearable thermal device for management of bothersome hot flashes in patients with prostate cancer [^115q55MH]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer affects approximately 1 in 8 men and is the most common cancer in men in the US. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the primary systemic therapy used to treat prostate cancer, and up to half of patients are exposed to ADT during the course of their treatment. Although ADT is highly effective for mitigating prostate cancer growth, it is associated with numerous negative side effects, including hot flashes.

Hot flashes and night sweats are vasomotor symptoms that are characterized by a sudden sensation of intense heat, usually accompanied by cutaneous vasodilation and sweating. Hot flashes can be accompanied by heart palpitations and feelings of anxiety or panic and are sometimes followed by chills. Hot flashes have been reported by 80% or more of prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT, and hot flashes may continue even after stopping ADT, particularly among patients without testosterone recovery despite treatment cessation. Hot flashes resulting from ADT contribute to physical and mental distress and are associated with increased sleep disturbance, diminished cognitive function, and lower quality of life. Approximately 27% of prostate cancer patients report that hot flashes are the most troublesome side effect of ADT, and some individuals discontinue ADT due to severe and debilitating hot flashes. Despite the negative impact of hot flashes, current strategies for treatment in prostate cancer patients are limited by variable efficacy and unacceptable side effects.

There is an unmet need for effective and well-tolerated hot flash management strategies that improve both prostate cancer survivorship and the subjective patient experience. Digital technology offers a novel opportunity to address gaps in symptom management. A novel wrist-worn thermal device (Embr Wave®, Embr Labs, Boston, MA) applies low-intensity dynamic cooling to the inside of the wrist and may aid in management of hot flashes in prostate cancer survivors. In peri- and post-menopausal women with bothersome hot flashes, use of the thermal device improved subjective measures of hot flash interference, thermal comfort, and hot flash control. This prospective, single-arm, study evaluated the feasibility of the thermal device for management of bothersome hot flashes in prostate cancer survivors.

### Managing menopausal symptoms: common questions and answers [^116waCcN]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Menopausal symptoms are widespread and significantly impact quality of life. Common symptoms of menopause are vasomotor (i.e., hot flashes and night sweats) and genitourinary (e.g., vulvovaginal irritation and dryness, dyspareunia, urinary problems), although women may also experience changes in sexual function, mood, and sleep. Estrogen-containing hormone therapy is effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms. Nonhormonal medications for vasomotor symptoms include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and gabapentin. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should not be administered to women taking tamoxifen. Cognitive behavior therapy and clinical hypnosis are effective for short-term reduction of vasomotor symptoms and associated sleep disturbances, but data are lacking to support the effectiveness of other nonpharmacologic treatments such as herbal or botanicalsupplements, exercise, and acupuncture. Hormone-free vaginal moisturizers are noninferior to estrogen-based therapies for treating genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Other treatment options for vaginal dryness and dyspareunia associated with menopause include ospemifene and intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone. Management of menopausal symptoms should involve shared decision-making that is informed by the best available evidence and individual risks and preferences.

### Testosterone undecanoate (Aveed) [^1138AMA9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Advise patients of the following:

17.1 Risks of Serious Pulmonary Oil Microembolism (POME) and Anaphylaxis

Serious POME reactions, involving cough, urge to cough, shortness of breath, sweating, throat tightening, chest pain, dizziness, and syncope, have been reported to occur during or immediately after the injection of intramuscular testosterone undecanoate. The majority of these events lasted a few minutes and resolved with supportive measures; however, some lasted up to several hours and some required emergency care and/or hospitalization.
Episodes of anaphylaxis, including life-threatening reactions, have also been reported to occur following the injection of intramuscular testosterone undecanoate.
Both serious POME reactions and anaphylaxis can occur after any injection of testosterone undecanoate during the course of therapy, including after the first dose.
Advise the patient to read the AVEED REMS information sheet titled "What You Need to Know About AVEED Treatment: A Patient Guide".
Instruct patients to remain at the healthcare setting for 30 minutes after each AVEED injection.

17.2 Men with Known or Suspected Carcinoma of the Prostate or Breast

Men with known or suspected prostate or breast cancer should not use AVEED [see Contraindications (4)].

17.3 Potential Adverse Reactions to Androgens

Patients should be informed that treatment with androgens may lead to adverse reactions which include:

Changes in urinary habits, such as increased urination at night, trouble starting the urine stream, passing urine many times during the day, having an urge to go the bathroom right away, having a urine accident, or being unable to pass urine or weak urine flow
Breathing disturbances, including those associated with sleep or excessive daytime sleepiness
Too frequent or persistent erections of the penis
Nausea, vomiting, changes in skin color, or ankle swelling
Venous thromboembolism, the signs and symptoms of which may include lower limb pain, edema, or erythema; dyspnea; or chest pain.
Increased blood pressure that can increase cardiovascular risk over time

### Management of perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms [^1139iWPf]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Most women worldwide experience menopausal symptoms during the menopause transition or postmenopause. Vasomotor symptoms are most pronounced during the first four to seven years but can persist for more than a decade, and genitourinary symptoms tend to be progressive. Although the hallmark symptoms are hot flashes, night sweats, disrupted sleep, and genitourinary discomfort, other common symptoms and conditions are mood fluctuations, cognitive changes, low sexual desire, bone loss, increase in abdominal fat, and adverse changes in metabolic health. These symptoms and signs can occur in any combination or sequence, and the link to menopause may even be elusive. Estrogen based hormonal therapies are the most effective treatments for many of the symptoms and, in the absence of contraindications to treatment, have a generally favorable benefit:risk ratio for women below age 60 and within 10 years of the onset of menopause. Non-hormonal treatment options are also available. Although a symptom driven treatment approach with individualized decision making can improve health and quality of life for midlife women, menopausal symptoms remain substantially undertreated by healthcare providers.

### Menopausal hormone therapy use among active duty service women [^1148VCx2]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

The mean age of menopause, defined as cessation of menses for 12 months, is 51.4 years, occurring in 90% of women between the ages of 45 and 56. However, the menopause transition, the interval of time characterized by waning estrogen levels and changes in menstrual cycles, can start an average of 4 years prior to the last menstrual period. Approximately 80% of women experience vasomotor symptoms (VMS), including hot flashes and night sweats, during the menopause transition, with a median duration of 7 years. Black women are reported to experience higher rates of hot flashes compared to White women.VMS are often poorly tolerated and may be associated with poor sleep quality, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and decreased quality of life. Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) is the most effective treatment for reducing VMS and is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved as first-line therapy for alleviating moderate to severe VMS.HT typically consists of an estrogen alone (ET) (in people without a uterus) or an estrogen in combination with a progestogen (EPT) (in people with a uterus).ET can be prescribed as oral, transdermal, or transvaginal formulations, and EPT can be prescribed as oral or as a combination transdermal patch. In addition to the treatment of VMS, HT is also FDA-approved for the prevention of bone loss, premature hypoestrogenism, and genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM).

### Night sweats and elevated follicle-stimulating hormone levels while taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [^1177Wwbt]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed to women with depression and anxiety disorders. Although night sweats are a reported adverse effect, some women have relief of vasomotor symptoms during perimenopausal period while taking them. The relationships between SSRIs, thermoregulation, gonadotropins, and estrogen and their connection to fertility remain unclear.

Case

A reproductive-aged woman, seeking treatment for infertility, experienced night sweats and elevated follicle-stimulating hormone levels while taking SSRIs for treatment of depression.

Conclusion

Many women of reproductive age are taking SSRIs, but the affect of SSRIs on normal reproductive function is unknown and further research in this area is needed.

5 Menopause and Hormone Replacement in

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may effectively relieve symptoms of menopause (hot flashes, night sweats, etc.) caused by declining ovarian reserve; these can be distressing to patients and greatly affect quality of life. HRT typically combines estrogen and progesterone to mimic ovarian hormones and is approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA). Systemic HRT can be administered via oral, vaginal, or transdermal route, each with a distinct risk/benefit profile. While early randomized controlled data relayed an increased risk of ischemic stroke among menopausal patients using HRT, contemporary studies suggest this risk is principally in older women (> 60 years) initiating HRT 10 years+ following the onset of menopause. With respect to venous thrombosis, the seminal Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial documented a twofold increased incidence with HRT; the highest risk was within the first year of use and with higher doses. More recent studies have shown a lower risk of venous thromboembolic events with transdermal estrogen formulations than with oral treatments.

### Managing menopause after cancer [^115wWLmZ]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Globally, 9 million women are diagnosed with cancer each year. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, followed by colorectal cancer in high-income countries and cervical cancer in low-income countries. Survival from cancer is improving and more women are experiencing long-term effects of cancer treatment, such as premature ovarian insufficiency or early menopause. Managing menopausal symptoms after cancer can be challenging, and more severe than at natural menopause. Menopausal symptoms can extend beyond hot flushes and night sweats (vasomotor symptoms). Treatment-induced symptoms might include sexual dysfunction and impairment of sleep, mood, and quality of life. In the long term, premature ovarian insufficiency might increase the risk of chronic conditions such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Diagnosing menopause after cancer can be challenging as menopausal symptoms can overlap with other common symptoms in patients with cancer, such as fatigue and sexual dysfunction. Menopausal hormone therapy is an effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and seems to be safe for many patients with cancer. When hormone therapy is contraindicated or avoided, emerging evidence supports the efficacy of non-pharmacological and non-hormonal treatments, although most evidence is based on women older than 50 years with breast cancer. Vaginal oestrogen seems safe for most patients with genitourinary symptoms, but there are few non-hormonal options. Many patients have inadequate centralised care for managing menopausal symptoms after cancer treatment, and more information is needed about cost-effective and patient-focused models of care for this growing population.

### The prognostic implications of night sweats in two cohorts of older patients [^115Hqx19]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

When asked, a significant number of patients report having experienced night sweats. Those who do are more likely to report decreased physical health, mental health, and quality of life. In most cases the cause of night sweats is unknown. We therefore do not know how much to worry about patients with this symptom. The present study examined associations between night sweats and mortality.

Methods

We used logistic regression and proportional hazards analyses to investigate potential predictors of mortality, including night sweats reported at baseline, among 2 different cohorts of people older than 65 years of age (n = 682 and n = 852) who were followed for an average of 7.3 and 7.5 years, respectively.

Results

Patients who reported night sweats were not more likely to die or to die sooner than those who did not report night sweats after controlling for age, sex, body mass index, education, and income. This held true as well for patients who reported more severe night sweats among the cohort in which the severity of night sweats was quantified.

Conclusions

Patients who report night sweats on a primary care health history questionnaire do not seem, on average, to be at increased risk for mortality.

### The many menopauses: searching the cognitive research literature for menopause types [^116fEiEB]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

The many menopauses

Spontaneous menopause

Spontaneous menopause (often referred to as "natural menopause") is diagnosed retrospectively after a year has elapsed since a woman's last menstrual period (LMP). The majority of women experience menopause between 45 and 55 years of age. Before the cessation of menses, women enter the menopausal transition (perimenopause); cycle lengths become variable as hormone levels begin to fluctuate and gradually fall. With fewer follicles maturing in the aging ovaries, levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) become elevated due to disinhibition, although 17β-estradiol (E₂) levels become highly variable. On average, the perimenopausal period lasts about 4 years. After the LMP, both E₂ and progesterone remain circulating at very low levels (2–35 pg/mL and 0–0.8 ng/mL, respectively), although high FSH levels stabilize. Postmenopausal women also produce low but stable quantities of androgens such as testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), dehydroandrosterone (DHA), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHAS). In most postmenopausal women, reduction in ovarian hormones is associated with the emergence of physiological symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, sleep problems, mood changes, and vaginal dryness.

### SLCO1B1 genetic variation and hormone therapy in menopausal women [^115VQPeS]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In this exploratory study, the common rs4149056 genetic variant in SLCO1B1 was associated with levels of sulfated estrogens in recently, naturally menopausal women randomized to either oCEE or tE₂. The variant was also associated with the magnitude of reduction in night sweats in women randomized to active treatment, particularly those using tE₂. Understanding genetic variants that may influence individual plasma concentrations of estrogens in postmenopausal women on MHT may allow individualized MHT, avoiding the lengthy trial-and-error process currently used to identify an effective dose, formulation, or route of administration for symptom relief. This may ultimately contribute to better management of menopausal symptoms, improved quality of life, and potential mitigation of cardiovascular risk in menopausal women. -

### Menopause [^116M6Lgb]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopause is an inevitable component of ageing and encompasses the loss of ovarian reproductive function, either occurring spontaneously or secondary to other conditions. It is not yet possible to accurately predict the onset of menopause, especially early menopause, to give women improved control of their fertility. The decline in ovarian oestrogen production at menopause can cause physical symptoms that may be debilitating, including hot flushes and night sweats, urogenital atrophy, sexual dysfunction, mood changes, bone loss, and metabolic changes that predispose to cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The individual experience of the menopause transition varies widely. Important influential factors include the age at which menopause occurs, personal health and wellbeing, and each woman's environment and culture. Management options range from lifestyle assessment and intervention through to hormonal and non-hormonal pharmacotherapy, each of which has specific benefits and risks. Decisions about therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women depend on symptomatology, health status, immediate and long-term health risks, personal life expectations, and the availability and cost of therapies. More effective and safe therapies for the management of menopausal symptoms need to be developed, particularly for women who have absolute contraindications to hormone therapy.

### Treatment satisfaction, unmet needs, and new treatment expectations for vasomotor symptoms due to menopause: women's and physicians' opinions [^111KJUAY]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Across all individual MS-TSQ items, physicians reported higher levels of satisfaction for HTs than for non-HTs or OTC therapies. Specifically, the percentage of physicians who responded with "extremely satisfied" or "satisfied" to the "overall satisfaction" question ranged from 88.3% to 91.0% for HTs, 34.4% to 61.5% for non-HTs, and 24.5% to 36.0% for OTC therapies. Detailed results for individual MS-TSQ items for physicians can be found in Supplemental Digital Content Tables S4, S5, and S6.

Unmet needs

The most commonly reported VMS treatment need among women and physicians was improvement of hot flashes and night sweats. Women most often reported "lack of effectiveness" (41.1%) and "lack of improvement in quality of life" (26.7%) as features of current treatments that do not meet their expectations, while physicians reported "long-term safety concerns" (56.5%), "lack of effectiveness", and "not covered by insurance" (both 44.0%) as not meeting their expectations (Fig. 2).

### Fezolinetant treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause: effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in two phase 3 studies (SKYLIGHT 1 and 2) [^114iP4mj]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) affect most women who are experiencing menopause and are mainly characterized by hot flashes and/or night sweats. In fact, hot flash prevalences of up to 80% have been reported in epidemiological studies. Women with VMS are known to require a significantly higher number of menopause-related physician visits and severe symptoms are associated with adverse work outcomes and increased impairment while at work.

A number of studies have demonstrated that menopausal hormone therapy (HT) can effectively relieve VMS and improve quality of life. - As such, several clinical guidelines consider HT as the first-line pharmacological option for treating VMS. - However, a recent global survey involving 25,161 women found that more than half of the participants were averse to HT, even when they were eligible for treatment. Worries about side effects, the long-term risks of treatment, and the presence of risk factors in the family were among the reasons for not wanting to take HT. Therefore, there is a gap in clinical care and a practical need to identify other pharmacological agents for use in the VMS population that are effective and have high treatment acceptance rates.

### Treatment satisfaction, unmet needs, and new treatment expectations for vasomotor symptoms due to menopause: women's and physicians' opinions [^115wKAXM]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes collected for participants were unmet needs with current available VMS treatments, willingness to use new VMS treatments, and expectations for new VMS treatments.

Unmet needs with available VMS treatments

Unmet needs with current available VMS treatments were assessed to elucidate the perceived impact of current treatments on symptom improvement, benefits of current treatments, risks of current treatments, and women's and physicians' involvement in treatment decision-making.

Survey participants rated symptom improvement based on the extent to which current VMS treatments improved hot flashes, night sweats, sleep, mood, sexual desire, work, concentration, disruption in daily activities, and quality of life on a 5-point Likert scale (not at all, a little, somewhat, quite a bit, very much).

Perceived benefits of current treatments were rated based on treatment features that met women's and physicians' expectations based on their self-report, including improvement of hot flashes and night sweats, improvement in quality of life, no short-term side effects, minor side effects that required minimal treatment, limited or no long-term safety concerns, convenience of mode of administration, treatment frequency, insurance coverage, low out-of-pocket costs, and an "other" category.

Expectations of new treatments

Expectations of new VMS treatments were assessed based on "women's and physicians" expectations for whether a new treatment was better at reducing frequency of hot flashes and night sweats, was better at reducing severity of hot flashes and night sweats, would improve sleep quality, would reduce the impact of hot flashes and night sweats on work, would improve mood disruptions, would improve sex drive, and would improve general quality of life. Expectations also included how the treatment would be delivered (ie, pill, patch, ring, or topical formulation), how often it would be administered (ie, once daily or less than once daily), if it would have no/fewer interactions with other drugs, if it would lower risk of short-term side effects, if it would have limited/no long-term safety concerns, if it would be covered by insurance/lower cost, and an "other" category.

### Global cross-sectional survey of women with vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause: prevalence and quality of life burden [^115PDUNF]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

The average number of VMS (hot flashes and/or night sweats) experienced by women in this survey (4.6, 3.8, and 3.0 times/d in Europe, the US, and Japan, respectively) is relatively low compared with regulatory interventional studies where the criteria are usually a minimum of 7 moderate-to-severe VMS/24 hours. This difference in frequency must be considered when interpreting the results. Overall, night sweats and hot flashes were reported as moderately bothersome. However, women who suffered from both hot flashes and night sweats reported that combination of both symptoms was more bothersome than either of these symptoms alone. Women in Japan reported a lower level of bother and fewer moderate-to-severe VMS versus those in Europe or the US. This finding is consistent with other studies, such as SWAN, where Japanese women were least likely to describe VMS as bothersome. Across the regions, night sweats and hot flashes had a greater impact on daily activities than on working activities. However, the perceived impact of these symptoms was low. Other studies have previously shown an increase in work days lost in women with untreated VMS.

The majority of respondents across all regions had never received HT and were HT-averse. Given that women with controlled VMS were excluded from completing the full questionnaire, this finding is not surprising, as women successfully taking HT with no residual VMS would be ineligible for the full questionnaire, and thus respondents may be more likely to be those who were HT-averse. The main reason for not taking HT was belief that menopausal symptoms would pass without pharmacological intervention (reported by ≥ 52% of participants in any country/region). In comparison, worries about side effects and concern about long-term risks and risk factors in the family were cited by fewer participants. However, many women made lifestyle changes or tried over-the-counter medications to manage symptoms. Usage of HT has significantly reduced in the US and in most European countries since publication of the Women's Health Initiative study results raised questions about the long-term safety of this treatment. - HT is, however, recognized by international clinical practice guidelines as the most effective treatment for VMS in symptomatic women < 60 years of age/within 10 years of menopause.-

### Androgens for genitourinary and vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^112SuqJC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Menopause is a natural process in a woman's life, typically occurring between the ages of 45 and 55 years (average: 51 years). It is marked by the cessation of menstrual cycles, indicating the end of the woman's reproductive years. Postmenopause is defined as the absence of menstrual periods for a consecutive period of at least 12 months. Around and after menopause (perimenopause and postmenopause, respectively), the decline in estrogen and progesterone production by the ovaries is often followed by various symptoms, including fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and weight gain, as well as vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms. These symptoms can significantly impact daily functioning and contribute to emotional distress, which can lead to a decline in quality of life and overall well‐being.

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) are characterized by a subjective sensation of heat, often linked to vasodilation, sweating, a subsequent drop in body temperature, and a temporary increase in heart rate. These episodes are known as 'hot flashes' (or 'hot flushes') and can last from seconds to minutes, with varying intensity and frequency. On average, women experience 4 to 5 hot flushes daily around the time of menopause, but some women may have up to 20. Intense nighttime hot flashes can disrupt sleep. The prevalence of moderate‐to‐severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS) among postmenopausal women aged 40 to 65 years is reported to be high, affecting 40% of women in Europe (with prevalence ranging from 31% in France to 52% in Italy), followed by the US at 34% and Japan at 16%.

ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline Focused Update — adverse effects and bone health with extended AI therapy: Persistent treatment-related adverse events with AI therapy include estrogen-deprivation symptoms such as hot flashes/night sweats, arthralgias/myalgias, and sexual dysfunction, which can harm quality of life and are associated with higher rates of nonadherence. Bone health is a particular concern; multiple trials reported significant differences in new-onset osteoporosis or bone fracture with extended AI duration, and in absolute terms the excess fracture risk nearly approximates the diminished recurrence risk in low- or average-risk patients. Interventions such as bone density monitoring and bone-modifying therapy may reduce osteoporosis or fracture, yet higher rates of fractures and osteoporosis were observed despite such resources being widely available.

What are the possible side effects of testosterone replacement therapy?

Inform your doctor immediately if any of the following symptoms appear while using Striant®.

Liver problems. Tell your doctor if:
Your skin or white part of your eyes turns yellow (jaundice).
Your urine turns dark.
Your bowel movements (stool) turns light in color.
You don't feel like eating for several days or longer.
You feel sick to your stomach (nausea).
You have lower abdominal pain (stomach).
Problems urinating. Tell your doctor if you develop problems urinating while using Striant®. Older patients who use testosterone replacement therapies may have an increased chance of developing prostate enlargement or prostate cancer.
Extra fluid in the body (edema). Edema can be dangerous if you have heart, kidney or liver problems. Tell your doctor if your ankles and legs swell or if you put on weight quickly.
Breathing problems, including a sleep problem called "sleep apnea". Sleep apnea is when you stop breathing for short times while you are sleeping. This happens more in patients who are overweight or who have lung disease. Tell your doctor if you have breathing problems or if you or your partner notice changes in your breathing when you are sleeping.
Penile erections that are painful, that occur too frequently, or that last for too long a duration.
Breast enlargement - which sometimes does not go away.
Emotional changes - such as depression.

### Neurokinin 3 receptor antagonism as a novel treatment for menopausal hot flushes: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113or5JB]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The menopause occurs when an insufficient number of ovarian follicles remain to sustain circulating oestrogen concentrations. Consequently, menstruation ceases, fertility is lost, and in most women a cluster of symptoms become prominent, which impact physical, psychosocial, sexual, and overall wellbeing. Symptoms can be long lasting (median 7·4 years), and most women report that vasomotor symptoms (termed hot flushes or flashes or night sweats) are the most bothersome of all, with at least 10% of women reporting them as intolerable. An effective treatment is hormone replacement therapy as this artificially restores circulating oestrogen. However, hormone replacement therapy and in particular combined hormone replacement therapy is not without risk, and is contraindicated in many women due to the long-term safety concerns, including an increased risk of breastand ovariancancers, thromboembolism, and stroke. Other treatments including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, gabapentin, tibolone, and cognitive behavioural therapyhave been shown to have some efficacy but can cause side-effects. Herbal remedies, such as black cohosh and red clover might provide some relief but efficacy is variable between trials. It is estimated that a novel treatment for menopausal flushes could currently benefit 10 million women in the UK alone, and therefore a better understanding of the aetiology of such flushes and an associated targeted therapeutic is required.

### Survey of patient experience and management of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause from the patientsLikeMe community [^113xTCvj]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to describe menopause and treatment experiences of women with vasomotor symptoms due to menopause in the United States.

Methods

A cross-sectional survey was administered to women 40–65 years of age recruited from PatientsLikeMe, a dedicated online platform for patients.

Results

A total of 196 women (mean age 55.7 years; 81.2% White) completed the survey and were included in the analyses. The majority (87.2%) reported experiencing bothersome symptoms; 54.3% (100/184) had daytime hot flashes, and 59.2% (109/184) had nighttime sweats and hot flashes, up to 5 times per day on average. Mean postmenopause duration was 10.8 years. Although most (68.5%, 126/184) reported having vasomotor symptoms for less than 5 years, some (14.1%, 26/184) had symptoms for more than a decade. Only 35.2% (69/196) were treated for their symptoms; the most frequently reported prescription treatment was hormone therapy (58%; 40/69), which was administered for less than 3 years in most cases (67.5%, 27/40). Although women were generally satisfied with their interactions with healthcare providers, 23.0% reported inadequate support. Sleep, personal relationships, and physical, emotional, and mental well-being were the most affected by vasomotor symptoms. Healthcare professionals with training in women's health were the most valued resource for dealing with the symptoms associated with menopause.

Conclusions

Not all women with symptoms were treated. In those whose concerns were addressed by providers, a reluctance to pursue treatment was still observed. A need persists to ensure that this population has the resources and support needed to effectively manage symptoms.

### Degarelix (Firmagon) [^116ytaqz]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

FIRMAGON was studied in a randomized, open-label trial in which patients with prostate cancer were randomized to receive FIRMAGON (subcutaneous) or leuprolide (intramuscular) monthly for 12 months [see Clinical Studies (14)].

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) during FIRMAGON therapy are injection site reactions (e.g., pain, erythema, swelling or induration), hot flashes, and increases in serum levels of transaminases and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT). The majority of the adverse reactions were Grade 1 or 2, with Grade 3/4 adverse reaction incidences of 1% or less.

Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 5% of patients treated with FIRMAGON (subcutaneous) 240 mg starting dose and then 80 mg maintenance dose once every 28 days or who were treated with 7.5 mg of leuprolide (intramuscular) every 28 days are shown in Table 2.

The following adverse reactions occurred in 1 to < 5% of patients treated with FIRMAGON:

Body as a whole: Asthenia, fatigue, fever, night sweats
Digestive system: Nausea
Nervous system: Dizziness, headache, insomnia

The following adverse reactions, not already listed, occurred in ≥ 1% of patients treated in any study with FIRMAGON:

Reproductive System: Erectile dysfunction, testicular atrophy
Endocrine Disorders: Gynecomastia
General: Hyperhidrosis
Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea

Injection Site Reactions

The most frequently reported adverse reactions at the injection sites were pain (28%), erythema (17%), swelling (6%), induration (4%) and nodule (3%). These adverse reactions were mostly transient, of mild to moderate intensity, occurred primarily with the starting dose and led to few discontinuations (< 1%). Grade 3 injection site reactions occurred in 2% or less of patients receiving FIRMAGON.

Hepatic Laboratory Abnormalities

Hepatic laboratory abnormalities were primarily Grade 1 or 2 and were generally reversible. Grade 3 hepatic laboratory abnormalities occurred in less than 1% of patients.

### Bioidentical hormones for women with vasomotor symptoms [^1152kigv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Various hormone therapies (HT) are available to treat menopausal vasomotor symptoms. Bioidentical hormones are chemically identical to those produced by the human body, and several types are well-tested and available on prescription. Many women have opted for bioidentical hormone therapy (BHT) on the assumption that it is safer than other forms of HT. We evaluated the evidence.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of bioidentical hormones compared to placebo or non-bioidentical hormones for the relief of vasomotor symptoms.

Search Methods

In July 2015 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase, Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS), registers of ongoing trials and the reference lists of articles retrieved.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing bioidentical hormone therapy (BHT) versus placebo or non-bioidentical hormones.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. Our primary outcome was vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats). We evaluated the overall quality of the evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria (GRADE).

Main Results

We included 23 RCTs (5779 participants). Most studies (20/23) included only women with moderate to severe hot flushes. All studies compared unopposed 17 beta-estradiol (beta-estradiol) versus placebo or conjugated equine estrogens (CEE). None of the studies reported night sweats as a separate outcome. BHT patch versus placebo Frequency of hot flushesFour RCTs reported data suitable for analysis. There were fewer hot flushes in the BHT group, with a moderate to large effect size (SMD -0.68, 95% CI -0.83 to -0.53, four RCTs, 793 women, I(2) = 67%, low quality evidence). There was moderate heterogeneity, but a consistent direction of effect. Seven RCTs reported data unsuitable for analysis; all reported a benefit in the intervention group. Symptom intensityTwo RCTs reported analysable data. Measured on a 0–100 visual analogue scale (VAS), hot flush intensity was lower in the BHT group (MD -19.94 points, 95% CI -24.86 to -15.02, two RCTs, 393 women, I(2) = 54%, low quality evidence). There was moderate heterogeneity, but a consistent direction of effect. Adverse effectsAdverse events (such as headache, vaginal bleeding, breast tenderness and skin reactions) were more common in the intervention group (odds ratio (OR) 2.14, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.54, 9 RCTs, 1822 women, I(2) = 73%, low quality evidence). There was moderate heterogeneity, but a consistent direction of effect. In one study, five women in the intervention group developed endometrial hyperplasia. BHT gel versus placebo Hot flush frequencyThree RCTs reported this outcome, but the data were unsuitable for analysis. All reported a benefit in the BHT group. Adverse effectsAdverse events were more common in the BHT group (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.83, 3 RCTs, 1086 women, I(2) = 0%, moderate quality evidence). Oral BHT versus placebo Hot flush frequencyTwo studies reported analysable data. There were fewer hot flushes in the BHT group, with a moderate to large effect size (SMD -0.80, 95% CI -1.03 to -0.57, two RCTs, 356 women, I(2) = 14%, low quality evidence). Adverse effectsThere was no evidence of a difference between the groups (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.96, 3 RCTs, 433 women, I(2) = 0%, low quality evidence). Topical BHT emulsion versus placebo Hot flush frequencyOne study with data unsuitable for analysis reported a benefit in the intervention group. Adverse effectsThere was no evidence of a difference between the groups (OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.66, one RCT, 200 women, low quality evidence). Intranasal BHT versus placebo Hot flush frequencyOnly one study reported analysable data. There were fewer hot flushes per day in the BHT group (MD -3.04 95% CI -4.05 to -2.03, one study, 458 women, moderate quality evidence) Adverse effectsAdverse events (such as headache, breast tenderness, arthralgia and nausea) were more common in the intervention group (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.03, one RCT, 458 women, moderate quality evidence). Subgroup analysesSubgroup analyses by dose of BHT suggested that higher doses of BHT may be associated with more effectiveness but also higher risk of adverse effects. BHT patch versus 0.625 mg CEETwo RCTs reported this comparison, but the data were unsuitable for analysis. Hot flush frequencyBoth RCTs reported no evidence of a difference between the groups. Adverse effectsFindings were inconsistent. In one comparison (0.1 mg BHT versus CEE), breast pain and vaginal bleeding were more frequent in the BHT group. Oral BHT versus 0.625 mg CEE Hot flush frequencyOne study with data unsuitable for analysis reported no evidence of a difference between the groups. Adverse effectsThere was no evidence of a difference between the groups (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.87, one RCT, 103 women, very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There was low to moderate quality evidence that BHT in various forms and doses is more effective than placebo for treating moderate to severe menopausal hot flushes. There was low to moderate quality evidence of higher rates of adverse effects such as headache, vaginal bleeding, breast tenderness and skin reactions in the BHT group. There was some evidence to suggest that higher doses of BHT are associated with greater effectiveness but also with higher risk of adverse effects. Although all the included studies used unopposed estrogen, it is recommended best practice to use progestogen therapy in women with a uterus taking estrogen in order to avoid endometrial hyperplasia, regardless of the source of the estrogen. No data are yet available about the safety of BHT with regard to long-term outcomes such as heart attack, stroke and breast cancer. There was no good evidence of a difference in effectiveness between BHT and CEE, and findings with regard to adverse effects were inconsistent. The quality of the evidence was too low to reach any firm conclusions. The main limitations in the quality of the evidence were study risk of bias (mainly due to poor reporting of methods), imprecision and lack of data suitable for analysis.

### The relationship of longitudinal change in reproductive hormones and vasomotor symptoms during the menopausal transition [^116QEMdw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Context

The relationship of reproductive hormones to vasomotor symptoms (VMS) has been incompletely explored, although an increase in such symptoms at midlife and their reduction with hormone therapy suggest a strong and direct relationship. Vasomotor symptoms are reported by 65–76% of women traversing the menopausal transition and are a primary reason for medical intervention during this life stage.

Objective

The purpose of this report was to relate longitudinal serum concentrations of the reproductive hormones estradiol (E2), FSH, testosterone (T), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and SHBG and the free hormone indices free E2 index (FEI) and free T index (FTI) with the occurrence of VMS in women traversing the menopausal transition.

Design and Setting

The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation is a multisite, longitudinal, cohort study of the menopausal transition being conducted in community-based groups of women.

Participants and Main Outcome Measures

At baseline, 3302 menstruating women who belonged to one of five ethnic/racial groups were recruited and followed up with annual visits. Frequencies of symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats) for the prior 2 wk and measures of other covariates as well as potentially confounding variables were self-reported in the annual interview. Serum was obtained annually, on d 2–5 of a spontaneous cycle in cycling women or within 90 d of the anniversary of the baseline study visit in noncycling women and assayed for FSH, E2, T, SHBG, and DHEAS. FTI and FEI were calculated. This analysis incorporated available longitudinal data from 3293 women, excluding information collected at or after first report of hormone therapy use or hysterectomy. Data were analyzed using longitudinal marginal logistic regression models and a partial proportional odds model.

Results

After adjusting for age, body mass index, and other related covariates, VMS prevalence increased with higher (log)FSH concentrations, and the increase was greater when blood was drawn more than 5 d after menses began. FSH concentrations were positively associated with the frequency of either hot flashes or night sweats, and higher FSH concentrations were associated with greater odds of reporting more frequent symptoms. Vasomotor symptom prevalence decreased with higher (log)E2, (sqrt)SHBG, and (log)FEI but only when these hormone values were modeled independently of (log)FSH values and the specimens were obtained outside the d 2–5 window. When modeled simultaneously with (log)FSH, (log)E2, (sqrt)SHBG, and (log)FEI were no longer significantly associated with symptom prevalence. (Cubic root)T and (sqrt)DHEAS concentrations and (log)FTI were not associated with the prevalence of VMS.

Conclusions

Annual serum FSH concentrations, but not E2, T, DHEAS, FTI, or FEI when collectively modeled longitudinally, are associated with both the prevalence and frequency of VMS in women at midlife.

### Effects of oral versus transdermal menopausal hormone treatments on self-reported sleep domains and their association with vasomotor symptoms in recently menopausal women enrolled in the kronos early estrogen prevention study (KEEPS) [^112LUdHB]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

Post hoc VMS subgroup analysis

At baseline, 226 women reported having moderate to severe night sweats, and 279 women (some overlap with those having moderate to severe night sweats) reported having moderate to severe hot flashes. In these respective subgroups of women, there were significant and positive correlations of changes in the global PSQI score, with changes in severity of night sweats (rₛ = 0.181, P = 0.002) and with changes in severity of hot flashes (rₛ = 0.207, P = 0.002; Table 3). In contrast to the results obtained on the overall set of participants, improvement in sleep latency in these women with moderate/severe symptoms correlated significantly with reduced severity of hot flashes (rₛ = 0.137, P = 0.022) and night sweats (rₛ = 0.147, P = 0.028); in addition, sleep duration correlated more strongly with reduced severity of hot flashes (rₛ = 0.239, P < 0.001) and night sweats (rₛ = 0.169, P = 0.011). In models adjusting for HT, the association between average changes in VMS and the average change in PSQI global score remained significant in both VMS subgroups (both P < 0.001). In contrast, the association of treatment with average change in PSQI global score was attenuated and no longer significant in both subgroups after adjustment for the average change in the corresponding VMS (P = 0.525 and 0.128 from partial tests of treatment effects in the subgroup with baseline hot flashes and with baseline night flashes, respectively).

### Effects of oral versus transdermal menopausal hormone treatments on self-reported sleep domains and their association with vasomotor symptoms in recently menopausal women enrolled in the kronos early estrogen prevention study (KEEPS) [^1151CGX8]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

Association with VMS

A total of 662 women providing responses of VMS severity during the course of treatment were retained in the corresponding treatment comparisons. As reported previously for the entire KEEPS cohort, the average severity scores of hot flashes and night sweats were significantly reduced by both HT formulations when compared with PBO (P < 0.001 for both), with no difference between the o-CEE and t-E2 groups (P = 0.343 and P = 0.919, respectively; Table 2). For the 646 participants for whom both PSQI and VMS data were available, there were positive associations between the average change in global PSQI score and the average changes in severity of hot flashes (rₛ = 0.170, P < 0.001) and night sweats (rₛ = 0.177, P < 0.001; Table 3). Among the correlations assessed between changes in the individual sleep domain scores and changes in scores for hot flashes, all domains except sleep latency and sleep efficiency correlated positively with change in severity. In addition to the domains of sleep latency and sleep efficiency, the domain of sleep duration also did not correlate with changes in night sweats.

TABLE 3
Correlation (rₛ) of average change in PSQI scores with average change in VMS scores

In multivariable analysis to examine the effect of treatment on change in sleep quality while controlling for changes in VMS, the difference in average improvement in PSQI global score between treatments, though attenuated, remained significant after adjustment for average improvement in each symptom (P = 0.020 adjusting for changes in hot flashes; P = 0.004 adjusting for changes in night sweats). Controlling for the effects of treatment, the associations between the change in each VMS and change in sleep remained significant as well (P = 0.002 for hot flashes and P = 0.029 for night sweats).

Patients with chronic illness and low testosterone concentrations — treatment individualization: Many chronic disorders are associated with an increased risk of low testosterone concentrations and related symptoms, but the paucity of randomized controlled trial data on efficacy or safety precludes a general recommendation for testosterone therapy in these conditions. Clinicians must individualize the decision to treat or not to treat based on the severity of symptoms, the degree of testosterone deficiency, confounding effects of the comorbid illness, patient preferences, and the uncertainty of the risks and benefits of therapy.

### Management of vasomotor symptoms in cancer patients [^114vCSm3]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

While the cause of VMS can be seemingly apparent in a patient receiving cancer treatment with the foreseeable side effects, it is important for clinicians to be mindful of the differential diagnoses that may exist (Table 2). Fortunately, many of these conditions can be excluded based on history and clinical findings. Among the medical conditions that can cause flashing, discriminating clinical features include onset, duration, associated symptoms, and triggers. Of note, hot flashes that occur with menopause or hypogonadism in cancer patients can present as "wet" flashes (ie, associated with sweating), while flashings mediated by vasoactive substances occur as a result of smooth muscle dilatation and are typically "dry" flashes (ie, not associated with sweating).

Table 2.
Causes of flashing and sweating disorders.

Determination of severity of hot flashes is another key step in clinical assessment. There is no standardized method of defining severity in the clinical setting. Measurement tools, such as the Kupperman Menopausal Index, the Greene Climacteric Scale, and the Menopausal Rating Scale, have been developed to quantify the severity of climacteric symptoms. These tools encompass a broad range of menopausal symptoms and rely largely on patients' self-reporting. Specific to hot flashes, options include the 7-day Daily Hot Flash Diary that uses a 4-category severity scale (mild, moderate, severe, and very severe) and the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale, both of which have been used in the research of VMS in patients with cancer. A different standard is used for drug approval in the pharmaceutical industry — the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines severity of VMS as mild (sensation of heat without sweating), moderate (sensation of heat with sweating, able to continue activity), and severe (sensation of heat with sweating, causing cessation of activity). This stratification of severity is relatively simple and probably the most practical in the real-world setting.

### Effect of the neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist fezolinetant on patient-reported outcomes in postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms: results of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-ranging study (VESTA) [^115ehN34]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this phase 2b, dose-ranging study, treatment with fezolinetant not only reduced the frequency and severity of VMS on the previously reported primary endpoints, it resulted in higher responder rates and improvements in PROs in a population of postmenopausal women with a considerable baseline burden of moderate/severe VMS. Across all fezolinetant dose groups, more than 80% of the participants experienced a reduction in moderate or severe VMS of ≥ 50%, and more than half of the women achieved a ≥ 90% reduction. These reductions in VMS were accompanied by improvements in PROs (MENQoL, HFRDIS, and GCS), with marked changes from baseline observed at the first measurement time point; improvements were maintained throughout the 12-week treatment period. Consistent with the reported efficacy of fezolinetant to reduce the frequency and severity of VMS (ie, the occurrence of hot flashes and/or night sweats), this manuscript reflects notable improvements in PRO measure domains that have a strong association with VMS, including the MENQoL vasomotor function domain, HFRDIS total score, and GCS VMS score. Improvements on the MENQoL and HFRDIS exceeded previously published MID/CID values for all fezolinetant groups and placebo.

Clinical Scenario

A 51-year-old postmenopausal third-grade teacher requests help for her hot flashes. She finds them especially troubling as she stands in front of her class and starts sweating. Although one student offers her tissues, others make fun of her — disrupting the class. Her sleep is interrupted several times a night. She refuses to use any form of estrogen because her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 60 years. Perhaps alternative therapies can help her.

17.3 Potential Adverse Reactions with Androgens

Patients should be informed that treatment with androgens may lead to adverse reactions which include:

Changes in urinary habits such as increased urination at night, trouble starting the urine stream, passing urine many times during the day, having an urge to go to the bathroom right away, having a urine accident, being unable to pass urine and weak urine flow.
Breathing disturbances, including those associated with sleep, or excessive daytime sleepiness.
Too frequent or persistent erections of the penis.
Nausea, vomiting, changes in skin color, or ankle swelling.

17.4 Patients Should Be Advised of the Following Instructions for Use

Read the Medication Guide before starting testosterone gel, 1.62% therapy and to reread it each time the prescription is renewed.
Testosterone gel, 1.62% should be applied and used appropriately to maximize the benefits and to minimize the risk of secondary exposure in children and women.
Keep testosterone gel, 1.62% out of the reach of children.
Testosterone gel, 1.62% is an alcohol based product and is flammable; therefore avoid fire, flame or smoking until the gel has dried.
It is important to adhere to all recommended monitoring.
Report any changes in their state of health, such as changes in urinary habits, breathing, sleep, and mood.
Testosterone Gel, 1.62% is prescribed to meet the patient's specific needs; therefore, the patient should never share testosterone gel, 1.62% with anyone. Wait 2 hours before swimming or washing following application of testosterone gel, 1.62%. This will ensure that the greatest amount of testosterone gel, 1.62% is absorbed into their system.

At each visit, women responded to 2 questions that asked separately how often they experienced hot flashes and night sweats in the past 2 weeks (response options: not at all, 1–5 days, 6–8 days, 9–13 days, and every day). Hot flashes or night sweats were considered collectively as VMS, categorized as none (neither hot flashes nor night sweats in the prior 2 weeks), 1 to 5 days/2 weeks (either or both hot flashes or night sweats 1–5 days/2 weeks), and ≥ 6 days/2 weeks (either or both hot flashes or night sweats ≥ 6 days/2 weeks). In addition to baseline VMS, the proportion of attended visits (before a CVD event or the censoring time) in which the woman reported frequent VMS (≥ 6 days/2 weeks) over the follow‐up were considered in separate models.

### Safety of fezolinetant for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause: a randomized controlled trial [^112MNh3A]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Worldwide, most women aged 40–64 years old experience vasomotor symptoms (eg, hot flushes, night sweats) associated with menopause. Moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms are reported by 34% of postmenopausal individuals in the United States, 40% in Europe, and 16% in Japan; 9.6% of Latin Americanand 11.4% of Australianwomen report severe or bothersome vasomotor symptoms. Vasomotor symptoms can also have substantial effects on quality of life by affecting sleep, mood, and cognitive functioning and contributing to social impairment, work-related difficulties, anxiety, and fatigue. –

Menopausal hormone therapy is an effective choice for vasomotor symptoms but is not appropriate for everyone. Fezolinetant, in development for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause, is a nonhormonal, selective neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist that blocks neurokinin B binding on the kisspeptin/neurokinin B/dynorphin neurons in the hypothalamus to moderate neuronal activity in the thermoregulatory center. – Phase 2 studies demonstrated a reduction in vasomotor symptom frequency and severity after fezolinetant treatment, with improvements in health-related quality of life. Results from two replicate double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies (SKYLIGHT [Study to Find Out if Fezolinetant Helps Reduce Moderate to Severe Hot Flashes in Women Going Through Menopause] 1 [NCT04003155] and SKYLIGHT 2 [NCT04003142]) showed that fezolinetant 30 and 45 mg met statistical significance in reducing vasomotor symptom frequency and severity at weeks 4 and 12 compared with placebo, with reduction persisting over 52 weeks. Over the 12-week double-blind period, there was a low incidence of individual treatment-emergent adverse events, and few serious treatment-emergent adverse events were noted with fezolinetant treatment. SKYLIGHT 4 (Study to Find Out How Safe Long-term Treatment With Fezolinetant is in Women With Hot Flashes Going Through Menopause) was conducted to provide 52-week, placebo-controlled safety data in a large cohort, with a focus on endometrial safety.

### Clinical review: why is androgen replacement in males controversial? [^11757dfP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Symptoms and signs consistent with androgen deficiency and low testosterone levels are recognized frequently in clinical practice. Recent population-based epidemiological studies indicate that low testosterone levels in men are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The clinician must be able to counsel patients to help them determine whether testosterone replacement therapy is appropriate for them.

Evidence Acquisition

The authors have conducted a literature search in PubMed, and we have reviewed references in the multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses that have been published on this topic.

Evidence Synthesis

We have attempted to provide the reader with an appreciation of the evidence that can be used to support the diagnosis of androgen deficiency, the efficacy of treatment, the potential risks of treatment, the therapeutic options, and the recommendations for monitoring treatment.

Conclusions

We think that published clinical experience justifies testosterone replacement therapy in males who have not initiated puberty by age 14 and in males with low testosterone levels due to classical diseases of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The benefit:risk ratio is less certain in older men and in those with chronic diseases associated with low testosterone levels. The decision to treat in this setting is much more controversial because there are few large clinical trials that have demonstrated efficacy and no large clinical trials that have determined potential risks of increasing the incidence of clinical prostate cancers or cardiovascular events. We provide a critical review of the evidence that supports treatment and potential risks and ways to reduce the risks if the physician and patient elect testosterone replacement.

17.4 Patients Should be Advised of these Application Instructions

The pump should be primed by depressing it 3 times prior to its first use. No priming is needed with subsequent uses of that pump.
AXIRON should NOT be applied to the scrotum, penis, abdomen, shoulders or upper arms.
With testosterone doses greater than 60 mg, which require two applications of AXIRON to the same axilla, the product should be allowed to dry after the first application before the second is applied.
AXIRON should be applied once daily at approximately the same time each day. AXIRON should be applied to clean, dry skin.
Patients may use an antiperspirant or deodorant spray before applying AXIRON. If patients use a stick or roll-on antiperspirant or deodorant, then it should be applied prior to application of AXIRON to avoid contamination of the stick or roll-on product.
Avoid swimming or washing the application site until two hours following application of AXIRON [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Avoid splashing in the eyes. In case of contact with eyes, flush thoroughly with water. If irritation persists, seek medical advice.

### Diagnosing night sweats [^115YR8no]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Night sweats are a common outpatient complaint, yet literature on the subject is scarce. Tuberculosis and lymphoma are diseases in which night sweats are a dominant symptom, but these are infrequently found to be the cause of night sweats in modern practice. While these diseases remain important diagnostic considerations in patients with night sweats, other diagnoses to consider include human immunodeficiency virus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia, and several less common diseases. Antihypertensives, antipyretics, other medications, and drugs of abuse such as alcohol and heroin may cause night sweats. Serious causes of night sweats can be excluded with a thorough history, physical examination, and directed laboratory and radiographic studies. If a history and physical do not reveal a possible diagnosis, physicians should consider a purified protein derivative, complete blood count, human immunodeficiency virus test, thyroid-stimulating hormone test, erythrocyte sedimentation rate evaluation, chest radiograph, and possibly chest and abdominal computed tomographic scans and bone marrow biopsy.

At baseline and at each annual follow-up visit, women completed a questionnaire that included a symptom checklist. The symptom checklist was worded as follows: "Below is a list of common problems which affect us from time to time in our daily lives. Thinking back over the past two weeks, please circle the number corresponding to how often you experienced any of the following". Participants rated the frequency of hot flashes and the frequency of night sweats in the past 2 weeks using response choices of never, 1 to 5 days, 6 to 8 days, 9 to 13 days, or daily. For each visit, we classified women who had hot flashes or night sweats or both hot flashes and night sweats as having VMS. For this study, we classified VMS as frequent if they occurred for 6 or more days in the past 2 weeks and not frequent if they occurred for fewer than 6 days (or not at all) in the past 2 weeks.

### Acupuncture in the real world: evaluating a 15-year NADA auricular acupuncture service for breast cancer survivors experiencing hot flushes and night sweats as a consequence of adjuvant hormonal therapies [^113EQXvo]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS) are a consequence of adjuvant hormonal treatments (tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors) for breast cancer, of which there were 55,000 new cases annually in the UK from 2015–2017. They have been reported by up to 84% of women taking tamoxifen, with 60% reporting symptoms as severe. Previous opinion held that these symptoms alleviate with time; however, recent research reports that prevalence may remain static for the duration of adjuvant hormonal treatment and continue for 5 years after treatment ends.

A common symptom of natural menopause, hot flushes are described as sudden sensations of heat, often accompanied by sweating, reddening of the skin, and sometimes by palpitations. They are associated with impaired quality of life, poor sleep, and negative mood, with night sweats associated with a greater risk of minor depression, fatigue and mood changes.

Cancer treatment induced HFNS are reported as more severe, frequent, and longer-lasting than those of natural menopause. HFNS have a wider implication for cancer survival, as treatment side effects are cited as a key reason for low adherence to endocrine therapy, with consequent impact on survival.

The main treatment for menopausal symptoms, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), is contraindicated for use with women with breast cancer, as are progestogens. Non-hormonal pharmacological treatments most likely to be offered for HFNS management include selective serotonin (and norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs), especially venlafaxine, as well as gabapentin and clonidine. Due to concerns about the inhibitory effects of SSRIs and SRNIs on tamoxifen, paroxetine and fluoxetine are not recommended for women taking tamoxifen. However, some women who are prescribed these medications do not find them helpful, whilst others find the mild to moderate beneficial effects are outweighed by their adverse effects. Furthermore, many women do not want to take medications in addition to their adjuvant hormonal therapy and seek non-pharmacological options.

### A phase 2b, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-ranging study of the neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist fezolinetant for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^1122A7Xn]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Efficacy

Coprimary endpoints were mean change in the frequency of moderate/severe VMS from baseline to week 4; mean change in the frequency of moderate/severe VMS from baseline to week 12; mean change in the severity of moderate/severe VMS from baseline to week 4; and mean change in the severity of moderate/severe VMS from baseline to week 12.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included mean changes and percent reductions in VMS frequency and severity from baseline to each study week and the proportion of participants achieving a 50% reduction in moderate/severe VMS over time. Additional secondary endpoints included analyzing VMS outcomes for mild, moderate, and severe VMS; patient-reported outcomes; hot flash scores; and alternative definitions of response, which will be reported separately.

Participants recorded their VMS at least twice daily (morning and evening). Mild VMS were defined as sensations of heat without sweating or noting damp sheets or clothing upon awakening. Moderate VMS were defined as sensations of heat with sweating but being able to continue activities or waking from sleep because of feeling hot. Severe VMS were defined as feelings of intense heat with sweating that disrupts activities or, for night sweats, feelings of being so hot as to require action (eg, remove layers of clothing, open a window).

Data from VMS recordings collected during the 35-day screening period were used to determine participant eligibility on the basis of VMS frequency and severity. Study baseline values were calculated based on mean VMS frequency and severity recorded over the last seven consecutive calendar days with nonmissing data before day 1 of the treatment period. As a consequence, the baseline could be less than the required 50 moderate/severe VMS per week study entry criterion, since eligibility could have been established anytime during the 35-day screening period.

VMS frequency was counted by the number of moderate or severe VMS in a 24-hour period. The moderate/severe VMS severity per day was determined by the following calculation: [(number of moderate VMS × 2) + (number of severe VMS × 3)]/(number of moderate + number of severe VMS). For participants with no moderate or severe VMS, the severity was calculated as 0; weekly average severity was calculated as the mean of daily severity scores over seven days.

The research hotspots, in addition to the symptoms such as pain and vasodilatory symptoms, which are also focused on QOL and electroacupuncture, are major highlights of the treatment.

Over 70% of advanced cancer patients experience moderate to severe pain, adding to the current opioid crisis and highlighting the need for nonpharmacological treatments. An evidence-based guideline strongly recommends acupuncture for arthralgia-induced pain, especially in patients receiving aromatase inhibitors. A network meta-analysis of 17 RCTs involving 1516 participants ranked acupuncture as the top intervention for improving pain intensity, showing acupuncture plays a great role in pain management. Apart from this, multiple RCTs suggested acupuncture can reduce CINV, despite its limited role in prevention. Importantly, acupuncture can also alleviate vasomotor symptoms like hot flushes and night sweats, which are prevalent in 65% of postmenopausal BC patients. As the number of survivors increases, addressing these symptoms becomes crucial. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), often used for hot flashes, is controversial in BC patients. Clinical studies have shown that acupuncture is effective in relieving hot flashes without elevating estradiol levels or inducing cancer recurrence. The underlying mechanism of acupuncture, possibly by increasing in endorphin levels and reducing the level of the potent vasodilator calcitonin gene-related peptide continues to be a focus. Moreover, acupuncture seems to significantly improve night sweats in BC survivors. Measuring treatment effects on QOL is crucial, particularly for BC patients undergoing therapies such as anthracyclines (ANT), which often have significant side effects. Acupuncture is effective in the secondary prevention of myelosuppression during chemotherapy, and QOL improves in women during treatment.

Electroacupuncture, which combines electrostimulation and traditional acupuncture needling, cannot only improve treatment efficiency but also be a targeted route of drug delivery. Preliminary findings suggest electroacupuncture can promote paclitaxel accumulation by altering the microvasculature and microenvironment of mouse BC tumors. In addition, electroacupuncture significantly induced apoptosis in the tumors. Mechanistic analyses have shown that electroacupuncture has been shown to directly decrease triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumor growth by inhibiting proteins involved in tumor angiogenesis and extracellular matrix, suppressing triple-negative BC-induced inflammation, and upregulating nerve growth factor receptors. Therefore, future studies should focus on how acupuncture plays various roles in a more targeted way during each stage of BC.

### Association of menopausal vasomotor symptom severity with sleep and work impairments: a US survey [^111QCCtA]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Although daytime hot flashes may directly affect work productivity, responses to our survey questions suggest that VMS-related sleep impairments also affect next-day functioning. This finding is consistent with that of previous reports that sleep impairments in general - and VMS-related sleep impairments specificallyare associated with impaired functioning at work. Strategies are needed to improve sleep quality among women with VMS and support employees who are affected by VMS.

One potential strategy is use of pharmacologic treatment to ameliorate VMS. Our survey did not assess the effect of VMS treatment on sleep or work productivity; however, studies of a wide range of hormone and nonhormone treatments for VMS report that effective therapies produced at least partial improvements in sleep. - Pinkerton et alconcluded that treatment for VMS producing a reduction of at least five hot flashes per day or a reduction of 1.0 point in VMS severity would lead to a clinically meaningful improvement in sleep on the Sleep Problems Index II, with particular improvements in sleep disturbance and sleep adequacy. Although available treatments for VMS may provide sleep benefits, as well as symptom relief, about 50% of those with moderate VMS and about 61% of those with severe VMS in our study reported that they had never received treatment for VMS. Concerns about long-term safety of hormone therapy and moderate efficacy of available nonhormone treatment for VMS may be contributing to low usage rates of these therapies. - Therefore, new therapies that are safe and effective in reducing hot flashes and night sweats could be beneficial in improving sleep quality among women with VMS.

### Effects of NT-814, a dual neurokinin 1 and 3 receptor antagonist, on vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women: a placebo-controlled, randomized trial [^111mc8Jc]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2
Most common adverse events (reported in ≥ 10% of participants in any treatment group)

After the start of treatment, improvements in all efficacy parameters; frequency (Fig. 2 A), severity (Fig. 2 B), severity score (Fig. 2 C), and frequency of waking due to night sweats (Fig. 2 D) were observed in all groups (including the placebo group). Reductions were greater in week 2 of treatment than in week 1. Mean reduction from baseline at week 2 in moderate/severe hot flash frequency was 37% in the placebo group and in the 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg NT-814 was, respectively, 24% (P = 0.048 compared to placebo), 59% (P = 0.155), 84% (P < 0.001), and 66% (P = 0.022). Mean reduction in waking due to night sweats was 20% (P = 0.059), 55% (P = 0.135), 81% (P < 0.001), and 63% (P = 0.031) in the NT-814 groups and 32% in the placebo group. Mean improvements were greatest in the 150 mg and 300 mg NT-814 groups and smallest in the placebo and 50 mg NT-814 groups (Table 3). The 95% CIs for the mean differences showed a good separation between the two higher NT-814 doses and placebo. The changes in severity score mirrored those of the improvements in hot flash frequency, and the average severity was improved compared to placebo in participants treated with 150 mg NT-814 but not with the other doses (Table 2).

### Effects of NT-814, a dual neurokinin 1 and 3 receptor antagonist, on vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women: a placebo-controlled, randomized trial [^114aZNXk]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives:

To evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of NT-814, a dual neurokinin 1,3 antagonist, in postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes).

Methods:

We completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in three US clinical research units in 76 postmenopausal women with moderate/severe hot flashes. Participants were randomized to 14 days of once-daily NT-814 or placebo within each of four sequential dose cohorts; 50, 100, 150, and 300 mg. Participants completed diaries of hot flash frequency and severity and waking due to night sweats before (baseline) and during treatment.

Results:

All prespecified efficacy parameters (24-h hot flash frequency and severity, frequency of waking due to night sweats) decreased in all groups (including placebo). Mean reduction from baseline at week 2 in moderate/severe hot flash frequency was 37% in the placebo group and, respectively, 24% (P = 0.048 vs placebo), 59% (P = 0.155), 84% (P < 0.001) and 66% (P = 0.022) in the 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg NT-814 groups; in waking due to night sweats reduction was 20% (P = 0.059), 55% (P = 0.135), 81% (P < 0.001), and 63% (P = 0.031) in the NT-814 groups and 32% in the placebo group. The improvement with NT-814 ≥ 150 mg was also evident in the first week of treatment. The most common treatment-related adverse events were mild somnolence and headache, more frequently in the 300 mg group. Safety monitoring identified no concerns.

Conclusions:

Once-daily NT-814 (≥ 150 mg/d) resulted in a rapid, marked improvement in hot flashes and waking due to night sweats. No safety concerns were identified. Doses up to 300 mg were well tolerated.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^113MeKQv]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Appendix B — Transdermal agents (patches) describe pharmacokinetics with increases in total testosterone from a baseline 167 ng/dL to a peak of 1,154 ng/dL at 5.7 hours, decreasing to 490 ng/dL over the next 12 hours, with an observed half-life of 116 minutes; an evening-applied patch mirrored circadian rhythm with a morning peak of 740 ng/dL and a night-time trough of 213 ng/dL. When applied to the abdomen, the patch exhibits slightly lower minimum testosterone values (over 24 hours) compared to other methods of delivery and some gels, and two RCTs showed improved maintenance of testosterone within normal physiologic levels and closer representation of the natural circadian rhythm versus IM testosterone. Patches are currently available in 2 and 4 mg formulations, with a 4mg starting dose recommended and titration to 6 mg permitted; patches are able to achieve testosterone levels within normal physiologic ranges (2 patches every 24–48 hours) in 77–100% of individuals with > 85% achieving values > 300 ng/dL. The most common adverse effect is application site reactions, historically reported in up to 60% of patients.

### Cancer treatment-related ovarian dysfunction in women of childbearing potential: management and fertility preservation options [^112zy2bG]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

PURPOSE

To review the complex concerns of oncofertility created through increased cancer survivorship and the long-term effects of cancer treatment in young adults.

DESIGN

Review chemotherapy-induced ovarian dysfunction, outline how fertility may be addressed before treatment initiation, and discuss barriers to oncofertility treatment and guidelines for oncologists to provide this care to their patients.

CONCLUSION

In women of childbearing potential, ovarian dysfunction resulting from cancer therapy has profound short- and long-term implications. Ovarian dysfunction can manifest as menstrual abnormalities, hot flashes, night sweats, impaired fertility, and in the long term, increased cardiovascular risk, bone mineral density loss, and cognitive deficits. The risk of ovarian dysfunction varies between drug classes, number of received lines of therapy, chemotherapy dosage, patient age, and baseline fertility status. Currently, there is no standard clinical practice to evaluate patients for their risk of developing ovarian dysfunction with systemic therapy or means to address hormonal fluctuations during treatment. This review provides a clinical guide to obtain a baseline fertility assessment and facilitate fertility preservation discussions.

### Hormone replacement therapy for women previously treated for endometrial cancer [^115MTHn8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women worldwide and most commonly occurs after the menopause (75%) (globocan.iarc.fr). About 319,000 new cases were diagnosed worldwide in 2012. Endometrial cancer is commonly considered as a potentially 'curable cancer', as approximately 75% of cases are diagnosed before disease has spread outside the uterus (FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage I). The overall five-year survival for all stages is about 86%, and, if the cancer is confined to the uterus, the five-year survival rate may increase to 97%. The majority of women diagnosed with endometrial cancer have early-stage disease, leading to a good prognosis after hysterectomy and removal of the ovaries (oophorectomy), with or without radiotherapy. However, women may have early physiological and psychological postmenopausal changes, either pre-existing or as a result of oophorectomy, depending on age and menopausal status at the time of diagnosis. Lack of oestrogen can cause hot flushes, night sweats, genital tract atrophy and longer-term adverse effects, such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. These changes may be temporarily managed by using oestrogens, in the form of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). However, there is a theoretical risk of promoting residual tumour cell growth and increasing cancer recurrence. Therefore, this is a potential survival disadvantage in a woman who has a potentially curable cancer. In premenopausal women with endometrial cancer, treatment induces early menopause and this may adversely affect overall survival. Additionally, most women with early-stage disease will be cured of their cancer, making longer-term quality of life (QoL) issues more pertinent. Following bilateral oophorectomy, premenopausal women may develop significant and debilitating menopausal symptoms, so there is a need for information about the risk and benefits of taking HRT, enabling women to make an informed decision, weighing the advantages and disadvantages of using HRT for their individual circumstances.

Objectives

To assess the risks and benefits of HRT (oestrogen alone or oestrogen with progestogen) for women previously treated for endometrial cancer.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1946 to April, week 4, 2017) and Embase (1980 to 2017, week 18). We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of review articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), in all languages, that examined the efficacy of symptom relief and the safety of using HRT in women treated for endometrial cancer, where safety in this situation was considered as not increasing the risk of recurrence of endometrial cancer above that of women not taking HRT.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We identified 2190 unique records, evaluated the full text of seven studies and included one study with 1236 participants. This study reported tumour recurrence in 2.3% of women in the oestrogen arm versus 1.9% of women receiving placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 2.50; very low-certainty evidence). The study reported one woman in the HRT arm (0.16%) and three women in the placebo arm (0.49%) who developed breast cancer (new malignancy) during follow-up (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.01; 1236 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not report on symptom relief, overall survival or progression-free survival for HRT versus placebo. However, they did report the percentage of women alive with no evidence of disease (94.3% in the HRT group and 95.6% in the placebo group) and the percentage of women alive irrespective of disease progression (95.8% in the HRT group and 96.9% in the placebo group) at the end of the 36 months' follow-up. The study did not report time to recurrence and it was underpowered due to closing early. The authors closed it as a result of the publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study, which, at that time, suggested that risks of exogenous hormone therapy outweighed benefits and had an impact on study recruitment. No assessment of efficacy was reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently, there is insufficient high-quality evidence to inform women considering HRT after treatment for endometrial cancer. The available evidence (both the single RCT and non-randomised evidence) does not suggest significant harm, if HRT is used after surgical treatment for early-stage endometrial cancer. There is no information available regarding use of HRT in higher-stage endometrial cancer (FIGO stage II and above). The use of HRT after endometrial cancer treatment should be individualised, taking account of the woman's symptoms and preferences, and the uncertainty of evidence for and against HRT use.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1122nN1A]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone testing confirmation — because serum testosterone (T) concentrations vary significantly due to diurnal, circadian and circannual rhythms, episodic secretion, and assay variations, it is important to confirm low T concentrations since 30% of men with an initial T concentration in the hypogonadal range have a normal T concentration on repeat measurement, and a small fraction of healthy young men can fall below the normal range during a 24-hour period.

### Assessing risks and benefits of nonhormonal treatments for vasomotor symptoms in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women [^115i9f2p]. Journal of Women's Health (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS); (hot flushes and night sweats) are the most common menopausal complaint for which women seek treatment. Several therapies can be considered to help manage these complaints. The objective of this review is to assess the risks and benefits of available and emerging therapeutic options for the management of menopausal VMS.

Methods

A review of the literature was conducted based on relevant publications identified through a PubMed search for clinical trials of agents used in the treatment of VMS.

Results

Hormone therapy (HT) remains the most effective treatment available, but there will always remain a need for nonhormonal options. Evidence does not support the efficacy of alternative or over-the-counter products, such as phytoestrogens and black cohosh, and their long-term safety is largely unknown. There is evidence supporting the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for the management of VMS from clinical trials of paroxetine, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine. Gabapentin appears to be effective, but the doses required may cause poor tolerability and reduced patient adherence. Data also suggest that clonidine has a modest effect at the expense of considerable adverse effects.

Conclusions

Choosing an appropriate treatment approach for the management of VMS requires careful assessment of the riskbenefit ratio of each alternative, as well as individual patient preference.

### Association of treatment-emergent symptoms identified by patient-reported outcomes with adjuvant endocrine therapy discontinuation [^1129YQs1]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

In our study, the cumulative probabilities of endocrine therapy discontinuation at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, respectively were 6, 11, 17, 19, and 23%. These observed discontinuation rates are lower than reported in many prior studies. It is possible that completing PRO measures motivated patients to continue endocrine therapy. Alternatively, although we did not mandate that clinicians review scores nor implement symptom management interventions, it is possible that greater patient and clinician awareness of symptoms due to the PROs led to better symptom management and, in turn, to enhanced persistence.

Our findings are consistent with prior studies linking symptoms prior to or during receipt of tamoxifen or an AI such as endocrine symptoms and sleep disturbance with non-adherence and early treatment discontinuation. Endocrine symptoms include vasomotor symptoms, weight changes, vaginal or sexual symptoms, mood changes and joint pain. In patients with breast cancer, endocrine symptoms, such as hot flashes and night sweats, can disrupt sleep. Evidence-based strategies can mitigate the treatment-emergent symptoms that were associated with early discontinuation of endocrine therapy in our cohort. For example, improved sleep hygiene, exercise, and cognitive behavioral therapy can support patients with sleep disturbance –. For patients with hot flashes or sweats, medications such as anti-depressants or gabapentin may improve both daytime symptoms and sleep.

As has been previously reported, endocrine therapy discontinuation was more frequent among participants in our study taking an AI than tamoxifen, a finding potentially attributable to frequent musculoskeletal discomfort during AI therapy. We also confirmed previous findings demonstrating that individuals with higher stage disease are less likely to discontinue endocrine therapy, a finding potentially explained by greater motivation to take therapy in light of higher recurrence risk. In addition to PRO scores, these factors may guide identification of patients at risk for endocrine therapy discontinuation for interventions to support persistence.

Strengths of our study are that we comprehensively assessed common symptoms during endocrine therapy prospectively over 5 years with validated PRO measures in a real-world population. Many previous studies evaluating symptoms during endocrine therapy used cross-sectional or retrospective designs and, of those that were prospective, many did not use validated measures, assessed fewer symptoms or limited symptom assessment to early during the course of therapy.

### Hot flashes and sweats in men with testicular insufficiency… [^115QkW7j]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Cessation of ovarian function in women frequently results in the climacteric or menopausal syndrome. Vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flashes and sweating attacks, are the most prominent complaints and are reported by 62% of women undergoing the menopause. 1 In contrast, reduction in testicular function in men usually occurs gradually, if at all, and usually does not result in specific manifestations. 2 Occasionally, however, as a result of testicular failure, men develop a syndrome known as the male climacteric. The chief symptoms of the male climacteric are loss of libido and sexual potency, irritability, depression, and inability to concentrate. Vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes and sweating, typical of the menopausal syndrome in women, are less common in the male climacteric. Recently we have studied three men who developed hot flashes and sweating after loss of testicular function. These vasomotor symptoms were completely reversed by adequate androgen replacement.

### Hot flashes and night sweats-NCI-national cancer institute… [^113Wpiyh]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Other treatments that can cause hot flashes and night sweats include:

- Chemotherapy.
- Hormone therapy, such as antiestrogens and aromatase inhibitors.
- Radiation therapy.
- Other drug therapy, such as opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and steroids. In people with breast cancer, severe hot flashes have been linked with:

- Sleeping problems.
- A lot of pain.
- Poor mental health. In premenopausal breast cancer survivors, hot flashes and night sweats have also been linked with depression. Men In men, the testes produce testosterone. Surgery to remove one or both testicles for the treatment of prostate cancer can trigger a set of symptoms that include hot flashes and night sweats. Hormone therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone or estrogen also causes these symptoms in men. Other drug therapy, such as opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and steroids, may also cause hot flashes and night sweats.

Drug Treatment for Hot Flashes and Night Sweats in People with Cancer and Survivors Key Points
- Hot flashes and night sweats may be controlled with estrogen replacement therapy.
- Other drugs may be useful in some people.
- Side effects from drug therapy for hot flashes and night sweats may develop. Hot flashes and night sweats may be controlled with estrogen replacement therapy. Hot flashes and night sweats during natural or treatment-related menopause can be controlled with estrogen replacement therapy. However, many women are not able to take estrogen replacement and may need to take a drug that does not have estrogen in it. Hormone replacement therapy that combines estrogen with progestin may increase the risk of breast cancer or breast cancer recurrence. Treatment of hot flashes in men who have been treated for prostate cancer may include estrogens, progestin, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants.

Side effects from drug therapy for hot flashes and night sweats may develop. Side effects of non-hormonal drug therapy may include:

- Antidepressants used to treat hot flashes over a short period of time may cause nausea, fatigue, dry mouth, and changes in appetite. Some antidepressants may change how other drugs, such as tamoxifen, work in the body.
- Anticonvulsants used to treat hot flashes may cause fatigue, dizziness, and trouble concentrating.
- Clonidine may cause dry mouth, fatigue, constipation, and insomnia.

### Night sweats are commonly vasomotor symptoms… [^114aFRrr]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

to the editor: In the article "Diagnosing Night Sweats, " 1 the authors overlooked the most prevalent and easy-to-diagnose type of night sweats: those occurring in women during perimenopause. Persons most likely to ask their family physician about night sweats are women in their late 30s to early 60s who are in the menopausal transition or the early years of menopause. This group of women is not even mentioned in the abstract of the article. 1 When menopausal women are mentioned on the third page of the article, 1 the description is inappropriately brief and somewhat inaccurate. Table 1 of the article 1 should be revised to list perimenopausal women instead of "ovarian failure. " It also should include the "selective estrogen receptor modulator" drugs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene. before they cease menstruation for a year and become menopausal.

One study 2 found that approximately 25 percent of menstruating women in midlife reported vasomotor symptoms before they had skipped one or several periods. Subsequent population-based studies 3 suggest that vasomotor symptoms, including night sweats, are common during perimenopause. The use of "ovarian failure" in Table 1 1 is anachronistic and inappropriately offensive in use of language. It also misrepresents the time course of hot flushes/night sweats in a woman's reproductive life cycle because the majority of women who have night sweats associated with menopause begin experiencing them when their cycles are still regular or becoming irregular. At this stage, follicle-stimulating hormone is highly variable and not diagnostic.
6. In summary, whenever a woman reports night sweats, the attending physician must ask about other changes in her menstrual patterns and cyclic experiences.

If she has experienced such changes, and also reports that her hands are warm during night sweats or hot f lushes, these changes are more likely vasomotor symptoms and less likely evidence of a disease process such as pheochromocytoma that is associated with peripheral vasoconstriction. 1 was meant to aid the physician who was evaluating a patient complaining of night sweats without an obvious cause. We agree that the gradual decline in ovarian function seen in women in their perimenopausal years can lead to hot flushes that may manifest as night sweats. We regret leaving the specific term "perimenopause" out of Table 1 in our article.
