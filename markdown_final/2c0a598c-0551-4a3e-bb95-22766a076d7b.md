## Question

Causes of atrial flutter

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of atrial flutter. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core electrophysiologic mechanism that enables atrial flutter. Then, I should verify the anatomic substrate and the specific circuits involved, especially the cavotricuspid isthmus. Next, I will examine acquired and structural drivers that remodel the atria and facilitate reentry. After that, I should review systemic and reversible precipitants. I will then consider special populations and scenarios, including athletes, post-cardiac surgery, and congenital heart disease. Finally, I will synthesize how these elements converge to initiate and sustain atrial flutter and outline the clinical implications for diagnosis and management, making sure I double-check each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental mechanism. Atrial flutter is a macroreentrant atrial tachycardia driven by a stable reentrant circuit, most classically around the tricuspid valve annulus through the cavotricuspid isthmus, which explains why typical flutter is often termed cavotricuspid isthmus–dependent flutter. This macroreentry framework is consistently described across contemporary reviews and guidelines, and it is the scaffold on which all other causal factors act [^117H1FU9] [^116hsSaA] [^112dhWCq].

> Wait, let me verify the anatomic substrate that permits this circuit. The right atrial architecture includes natural barriers such as the tricuspid annulus, crista terminalis, and caval orifices; a line of block between the venae cavae is functionally critical to complete the circuit, and when this line of block forms or is present, classical counterclockwise flutter can be sustained, whereas its absence or shortening favors atrial fibrillation rather than organized flutter; this mechanistic interrelationship between AF and AFL is well established in mapping studies and mechanistic reviews [^111FLSF8] [^1164cLun].

> I need to check the acquired and structural drivers that remodel the atria and create the substrate for reentry. Advancing age, hypertension, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and valvular disease all contribute to atrial fibrosis, conduction slowing, and low-voltage areas that facilitate macroreentry; population-based data show markedly higher incidence of flutter with heart failure and COPD, and Framingham analyses link smoking, MI, and heart failure to incident flutter, reinforcing the role of structural heart disease and systemic risk factors in substrate formation [^117H1FU9] [^117H1FU9] [^116UX1mA].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of atrial fibrillation itself in shaping flutter circuits. AF commonly precedes or coexists with flutter. During AF, functional lines of block and heterogeneous conduction can organize into a macroreentrant flutter circuit, and conversely, very rapid flutter drivers can produce fibrillatory conduction that manifests as AF, underscoring a bidirectional mechanistic relationship rather than a strict dichotomy. This helps explain why many patients exhibit both rhythms over time and why flutter ablation does not fully eliminate future AF risk [^111FLSF8] [^1164cLun] [^111mq71X].

> Let me consider iatrogenic and scar-mediated substrates. Prior cardiac surgery, catheter ablation lines, and congenital heart disease repairs create fixed conduction barriers that can anchor macroreentrant circuits. Post–AF ablation left atrial flutters often reflect incomplete linear lesions, and typical right atrial flutter is common after transplantation and other surgeries, highlighting how surgical scars become integral parts of the reentrant pathway [^114a6ymb] [^117Ly7E8] [^114ZUuGq].

> I should confirm systemic and reversible precipitants that can acutely trigger flutter in a vulnerable substrate. Hyperthyroidism, pulmonary disease and hypoxemia, alcohol excess, and acute illness such as infection or surgery are recognized triggers. Importantly, antiarrhythmic drugs used for AF, particularly class IC agents like flecainide or propafenone, can organize AF into isthmus-dependent flutter, and case reports even describe chemotherapy-associated flutter, reminding me to keep a broad differential for transient drivers when flutter appears in new contexts [^117H1FU9] [^111mq71X] [^112YVAj9].

> But wait, what about special populations where the "cause" may be less obvious at first glance. In athletes, long-term endurance training appears to increase the risk of atrial flutter via atrial remodeling, autonomic shifts, and possibly inflammatory or reflux-related mechanisms; in these patients, I need to ensure exclusion of structural heart disease and consider event monitoring when resting ECGs are non-diagnostic, aligning with sports cardiology guidance [^115aMduP]. In congenital heart disease, complex atrial anatomy and surgical scars predispose to multiple macroreentrant circuits, and management often requires tailored ablation strategies and rhythm-control approaches given the high recurrence risk and unique substrates [^112AnbwF] [^114ZUuGq].

> Let me synthesize how these elements converge. The necessary conditions for typical atrial flutter are threefold: a vulnerable atrial substrate with fibrosis and conduction heterogeneity, a functional or fixed line of block that completes a protected circuit, and a triggering event or driver that initiates the macroreentrant wavefront. Age, hypertension, heart failure, ischemia, valvular disease, AF, and surgical scars shape the substrate, while systemic stressors, thyroid disease, pulmonary disease, alcohol, and certain drugs act as triggers, with the final phenotype determined by the interplay among these factors [^117H1FU9] [^111FLSF8] [^112dhWCq].

> I should double-check the clinical implications because identifying causes guides both acute and longitudinal care. Because flutter and AF frequently coexist and share thromboembolic risk, guidelines recommend anticoagulation decisions mirror AF risk stratification using CHA2DS2-VASc, and after cardioversion or ablation, anticoagulation should be continued for at least four weeks and longer term if thromboembolic risk is elevated. Recognizing reversible precipitants can avert recurrence, and in typical flutter, catheter ablation targeting bidirectional cavotricuspid isthmus block is highly effective and often preferred over chronic antiarrhythmic therapy [^115zyyay] [^114srEj8] [^115mdMmH] [^114ifp1e].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought obesity might be a direct cause of flutter akin to AF, but I should be cautious. While obesity is a strong risk factor for AF and atrial remodeling, the provided sources directly linking obesity to incident flutter are limited here, so I will frame obesity as an indirect contributor via shared atrial remodeling pathways rather than a clearly established independent cause of flutter in this dataset, keeping the claim conservative and aligned with the cited evidence base [^115KvurP] [^117H1FU9].

> In summary, atrial flutter arises when a remodeled atrial substrate, a critical line of block completing a macroreentrant circuit, and a triggering factor align. Typical flutter reflects cavotricuspid isthmus–dependent right atrial macroreentry, but atypical flutters around left atrial scars or surgical barriers also occur, and the bidirectional relationship with AF means that identifying and modifying causal drivers — structural, systemic, or iatrogenic — is essential to both treatment and prevention strategies [^116hsSaA] [^111FLSF8] [^112dhWCq].

---

Atrial flutter is caused by a **macroreentrant circuit** in the right atrium, most often around the tricuspid annulus and cavotricuspid isthmus, producing rapid, regular atrial contractions [^117H1FU9]. Key drivers include **atrial remodeling** from hypertension, heart failure, ischemic or valvular heart disease, and atrial enlargement; **electrical triggers** such as hyperthyroidism, alcohol, and stimulants; and **iatrogenic factors** like prior catheter ablation or cardiac surgery [^116hsSaA]. Congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease, and electrolyte disturbances also increase risk [^117H1FU9]. These factors promote slow conduction, conduction block, and fibrosis, sustaining the reentrant circuit and enabling atrial flutter [^117H1FU9].

---

## Electrophysiological mechanisms

Atrial flutter is sustained by a **macroreentrant circuit** in the right atrium, typically around the tricuspid annulus and through the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) [^112dhWCq]. This circuit produces rapid, regular atrial contractions, often with 2:1 or 3:1 atrioventricular (AV) conduction [^111xTC1n].

---

## Structural heart disease and atrial remodeling

Structural heart disease and atrial remodeling are major drivers of atrial flutter, promoting the substrate needed to sustain reentry [^116hsSaA]:

- **Hypertension**: Causes atrial enlargement and fibrosis, increasing risk [^117H1FU9].

- **Heart failure**: Leads to atrial dilation and fibrosis, facilitating reentry [^notfound].

- **Coronary artery disease**: Ischemia causes atrial scarring and conduction delay [^notfound].

- **Valvular heart disease**: Mitral or aortic disease cause atrial enlargement and fibrosis [^notfound].

- **Congenital heart disease**: Structural anomalies and surgical scars create reentrant circuits [^114ZUuGq].

---

## Electrolyte imbalances and metabolic disturbances

Electrolyte and metabolic disturbances can precipitate atrial flutter by altering atrial electrophysiology:

- **Hyperthyroidism**: Increases atrial automaticity and triggers arrhythmias [^117H1FU9].

- **Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia**: Promote ectopy and reentry [^notfound].

- **Alcohol and stimulants**: Acute use can trigger atrial flutter [^notfound].

---

## Iatrogenic factors

Medical interventions can precipitate atrial flutter via atrial injury or scar formation:

- **Catheter ablation**: Incomplete lines or prior scars can create new circuits [^114a6ymb].

- **Cardiac surgery**: Surgical scars can anchor reentrant circuits [^114ZUuGq].

- **Antiarrhythmic drugs**: Flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone can organize AF into flutter [^111mq71X].

---

## Lifestyle and environmental factors

Lifestyle and environmental factors contribute to atrial flutter risk via atrial remodeling and autonomic effects:

- **Obesity**: Promotes atrial enlargement and fibrosis [^115KvurP].

- **Smoking**: Increases atrial remodeling and arrhythmia risk [^116UX1mA].

- **Chronic lung disease**: Hypoxia and right atrial strain promote flutter [^notfound].

---

Limitations

First, research relying on routinely collected health data relies on the accuracy of clinical coding. For example, a greater proportion of individuals in the final 2 years of the study period were recorded as ever smokers than in the first 2 years, but it is also known that recording of smoking status in UK primary care records increased after 2001. The validity of clinical diagnoses recorded in the linked CPRD dataset across UK primary care secondary care and death certificates has been independently investigated for a range of conditions (see Supplementary data online). Second, we did not have comprehensive information on medication and procedural treatment provided to the cohort, and so we are unable to make any direct inference on the associations between utilization of guideline-directed therapy and the observed trends in deaths and hospitalizations, although this has been reported in the literature. Third, given the observational nature of the study, we do not assume causation, and there is the risk of residual confounding from unmeasured risk factors or comorbidities. Fourth, we included atrial flutter diagnosis codes to identify AF cases as atrial flutter also confers an elevated stroke risk, shares the same recommendations for anticoagulation as AF, and many people with atrial flutter also have AF. Fifth, this was a study of a cohort of patients with AF from a high-income country and a predominantly White ethnic composition, so these results may not be generalizable to settings with a different country-level income classification or ethnic composition.

### Atrial flutter: more than just one of a kind [^1173km1Z]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Since its first description about one century ago, our understanding of atrial flutter (AFL) circuits has considerably evolved. One AFL circuit can have variable electrocardiographic (ECG) manifestations depending on the presence of pre-existing atrial lesions, or impaired atrial substrate. Conversely, different (right sided or even left sided) atrial circuits including different mechanisms (macroreentrant, microreentrant, or focal) can present with a very similar surface ECG manifestation. The development of efficient high-resolution electroanatomical mapping systems has improved our knowledge about AFL mechanisms, as well as facilitated their curative treatment with radiofrequency catheter ablation. This article will review ECG features for typical and atypical flutters, and emphasize the limitations for circuit location from the surface ECG.

### Atrial flutter associated with carboplatin administration [^112YVAj9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a novel case of atrial flutter associated with carboplatin administration and review chemotherapy-related cardiac toxicities, focusing on platinum-containing compounds.

Case Report

A 69-year-old man with extensive small cell lung cancer and asymptomatic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease was inconsistently adherent to his medication regimen. While undergoing carboplatin infusion, he developed atrial flutter. He had no other immediate arrhythmogenic causes of atrial flutter and the arrhythmia spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm after 24 hours. His condition remained stable until he died 8 days later. The cause of death was unknown and the family declined postmortem examination.

Discussion

Although this patient's cardiac history and nonadherence to his medications may have increased his susceptibility to develop atrial arrhythmias, the Naranjo probability scale reveals a possible relationship between atrial flutter and infusion of carboplatin. A literature search revealed other adverse cardiac events due to platinum compounds; however, to our knowledge, this case is the first to describe an association with atrial flutter. A definitive causal link cannot be determined, but this may have been the result of a direct arrhythmogenic effect of treatment or to a novel hypersensitivity reaction. Given the potential deleterious impact of drug-induced arrhythmias, we have reported this case to the Food and Drug Administration as a new adverse effect of carboplatin.

Conclusions

Providers should consider cardiac monitoring during carboplatin infusion in patients with known cardiac disease or at high risk of cardiac complications.

### Diagnosis and management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia [^117H1FU9]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on atrial flutter:

- **Definition**: Atrial flutter is a supraventricular arrhythmia characterized by rapid, regular atrial contractions, primarily confined to the right atrium.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of atrial flutter involves the formation of a reentrant circuit, often around the tricuspid valve or along the right atrial wall. This circuit results in a rapid and regular atrial rhythm. Abnormal intraatrial conduction, slow conduction paths, and areas of low voltage in the atria can contribute to the initiation and maintenance of these reentrant circuits.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of idiopathic neonatal atrial flutter in Europe is estimated at 1.5 per 100,000 population.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for atrial flutter include advancing age (particularly prevalent in the elderly population) and underlying cardiac conditions such as hypertension, HF, and congenital heart disease. Additional risk factors include pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, and the use of specific medications, such as class 1C antiarrhythmic drugs.
- **Disease course**: The clinical features of atrial flutter often include palpitations, dyspnea, and chest discomfort. However, the diagnosis is often confirmed through a 12-lead ECG or an electrophysiology study and mapping. Complications can include stroke, HF, thromboembolism, and progression to AF.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of atrial flutter can be influenced by several factors. The presence of underlying heart disease can complicate the condition and lead to poorer outcomes. There is a risk of progression to AF.

Age Distribution of Absolute and Relative/Prevalence and Deaths

Both AF/AFL prevalence and deaths are strongly age dependent. The age‐specific relative prevalence increases with age, reaching its climax in the age group of 90 to 94 years and slightly decreasing in the age group ≥ 95 years for all income groups. The difference of age‐specific relative prevalence in low‐income countries compared with the other 3 income groups is less than for the overall relative AF/AFL prevalence (Figure 2A). The age group of ≥ 65 years makes up for 73.0% of global absolute AF/AFL prevalence: 79.0% of AF/AFL cases in high‐income countries, 71.2% in upper‐middle‐income countries, 68.0% in lower‐middle‐income countries, and 65.5% in low‐income countries occur in this age group. The climax of absolute prevalence differs between income groups. In high‐income countries, the highest absolute prevalence of AF/AFL is observed among 75‐ to 79‐year‐old individuals, whereas in upper‐middle‐, lower‐middle‐, and low‐income countries the highest absolute prevalence is reached in the age group 70 to 74 years. Until the age group of 70 to 74 years, the highest absolute prevalence is reached by upper‐middle‐income countries, whereas high‐income countries are leading in the absolute prevalence in the age group of 75 to 79 years and onward. Until the age of 60 to 64 years, the absolute prevalence in lower‐middle‐income countries is higher than in high‐income countries (Figure 2B). The age‐specific death rate continuously increases with age, with comparatively small differences between income groups (Figure 2C). As with prevalence, the absolute number of deaths related to AF/AFL was strongly age‐dependent, with a shift to older age groups compared with prevalence. The highest number of deaths occurred in the age group 85 to 89 years in high‐ and upper‐middle‐income countries and in the age group 80 to 84 in lower‐middle‐ and low‐income countries. The age group ≥ 65 years is most burdened with deaths related to AF/AFL. Of all deaths related to AF/AFL, 97.0% occur above the age of 65 in high‐income countries, 94.4% in upper‐middle‐income countries, 91.1% in lower‐middle‐income countries, and 89.2% in low‐income countries (Figure 2D).

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2016). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation stroke-risk rationale and scoring note that "Nonvalvular AF increases the risk of stroke 5 times, and AF in the setting of mitral stenosis increases the risk of stroke 20 times over that of patients in sinus rhythm". Risk stratification uses CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc with age thresholds noted as "age ≥ 75 y" and "age 65–74 y", and "the CHA2DS2-VASc score for nonvalvular AF has a broader score range (0 to 9) and includes a larger number of risk factors". Treatment selection guidance states, "The selection of an antithrombotic agent should be based on shared decision making that takes into account risk factors, cost, tolerability, patient preference, potential for drug interactions, and other clinical characteristics, including time in the INR therapeutic range if the patient has been on warfarin, irrespective of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent".

### Recurrence rate of atrial flutter after initial presentation in patients on drug treatment [^1149tnLj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Atrial flutter (AFl) recurrence after initial in-patient presentation, cardioversion, and drug treatment is almost universal, often leading to rehospitalization and risk of serious clinical consequences. Radiofrequency ablation of AFl, which has an excellent safety record, should be evaluated as a first-line approach for most patients with AFl.

In sum, there is a significant global heterogeneity between patients with AF/AFL. Due to significant underrepresentation of low‐ and middle‐income countries in AF/AFL research, what is known about the manifestation and treatment of AF/AFL relates predominantly to patients in high‐income countries. It is not well understood to what extent this evidence can be generalized for and transferred to patients with AF/AFL in low‐, lower‐middle‐, and upper‐middle‐income countries, even though this group makes up the majority of global patients with AF/AFL.

Atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation (AF) — coexistence, post–CTI ablation AF, and antiarrhythmic-induced flutter: It is common for AF and atrial flutter to coexist in the same patient. After CTI ablation, 22% to 50% of patients have been reported to develop AF after a mean follow-up of 14 to 30 months, although 1 study reported a much higher rate of AF development, with 82% of patients treated by catheter ablation for atrial flutter manifesting AF within 5 years. Risk factors for the manifesting AF after atrial flutter ablation include prior AF, depressed left ventricular function, structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease, inducible AF, and increased LA size. Atrial flutter may result from antiarrhythmic therapy of AF, particularly when flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone is used for treatment of AF, and ablation of the CTI-dependent flutter may prevent recurrent flutter while antiarrhythmic therapy for AF is continued.

### Management of cardiac conduction abnormalities and arrhythmia in aircrew [^117GBsHm]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Atrial flutter

Atrial flutter may coexist with AF or occur in isolation. In most cases atrial flutter is caused by similar underlying pathology to those causing AF with similar aeromedical concerns. An additional concern in atrial flutter is the potential for 1:1 AV conduction resulting in extreme tachycardia and acute incapacitation. Aircrew with atrial flutter require thorough cardiac and non-cardiac evaluation (table 8).

Table 8
Recommendations for atrial flutter

Typical atrial flutter is a right atrial macro-re-entrant tachycardia with the re-entrant circuit passing through the cavo-tricuspid isthmus. Antiarrhythmic medication is usually only moderately effective and not appropriate for aircrew. Catheter ablation is usually the first line therapy, ablating a line to block the isthmus pathway, and has success rates > 90% with up to 2 years follow-up. Some studies suggest a moderate rate of subsequent AF, following flutter ablation, and recurrence can sometimes occur years after the ablation, with the highest incidence in those with atypical flutter (non-isthmus-dependent) and associated structural heart disease.

Due to the arrhythmogenic +G z environment, single seat and flying high performance aircraft are not generally recommended following flutter ablation. In selected cases, consideration of a diagnostic EP study to reconfirm bidirectional isthmus block would be recommended if considering a more lenient approach.

### Atrial flutter and the risk of thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11651sUf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to assess the risk of thromboembolism associated with atrial flutter.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, bibliographies, and consultation with clinical experts were used to identify studies that report the risk of thromboembolism associated with attempted cardioversion and longer-term risk in chronic atrial flutter. The review process and data extraction were performed by two reviewers. Study event rates were assessed graphically, and a chi-squared test was used to assess heterogeneity across studies. Meta-regression with weighted logistic regression was used to assess the association between study-level clinical factors and reported thromboembolic event rates.

Results

We found 13 studies that reported the risk of thromboembolism associated with cardioversion of atrial flutter. Short-term event rates ranged from 0% to 7.3%. A chi-squared test for heterogeneity was significant (P < 0.001), so results were not pooled. Instead, a meta-regression analysis was performed, which partly explained the heterogeneity across studies. Studies were more likely to report high event rates when they included patients with a prior history of thromboembolism, and to report lower event rates when at least some patients were anticoagulated or if patients underwent echocardiography before cardioversion. Four studies reported the longer-term risk of thromboembolism, and these suggest a yearly event rate of approximately 3% with sustained atrial flutter.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that atrial flutter is indeed associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, and that clinical factors account for the low event rates reported in some studies.

ACC/AHA AF performance measure PM-3 — PT/INR planned follow-up for warfarin at discharge — captures the percentage of patients, age ≥ 18 y, with atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter who have been prescribed warfarin and who have a prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) follow-up scheduled prior to hospital discharge. The numerator requires scheduling of PT/INR follow-up, specified as within 2 w for newly prescribed warfarin or within 30 d for patients previously on warfarin, and the denominator is patients with AF or atrial flutter who were prescribed warfarin. Denominator exclusions include patients age < 18 y, transient or reversible causes of AF (e.g., pneumonia, hyperthyroidism, pregnancy, cardiac surgery), those who leave against medical advice, die during hospitalization, are comfort care measures only, or are transferred to another acute care hospital; denominator exceptions are none. The measurement period is encounter, sources of data are medical record or other database, attribution is reportable at the facility or physician level, the care setting is inpatient, and all patients with exclusions are removed from the denominator while patients with exceptions are removed only if the numerator is not met.

### Inter-relationships of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter mechanisms and clinical implications [^1164cLun]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

There is a close interrelationship between atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL). Atrial fibrillation of variable duration precedes the onset of AFL in almost all instances; during AF, the functional components needed to complete the AFL re-entrant circuit, principally a line of block (LoB) between the vena cavae, are formed; if this LoB does not form, classical AFL does not develop. In contrast, there seems to be a spectrum of atrial re-entrant circuits (drivers) of short cycle lengths (CLs) (i.e. AFL). When the CL of the AFL re-entrant circuit is so short that it will only activate portions of the atria in a 1:1 manner, the rest of the atria will be activated rapidly but irregularly (i.e., via fibrillatory conduction), resulting in AF. In short, there are probably several mechanisms of AF, 1 of which is due to a very rapid AFL causing fibrillatory conduction. All of these interactions of AF and AFL have important clinical implications.

Methods

The GBD database is a freely accessible resource delivered by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation of the University of Washington. The GBD's goal is to improve the understanding of global diseases and their causes. The study was designed in compliance with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting recommendations. Extensive descriptions of the methodology of the GBD 2019 data set are available in the manuscript and appendix of a systematic analysis by the GBD 2019 Diseases and Injuries Collaborators. In the following, we briefly summarize the most important aspects of this methodology. The underlying primary data are collected by an international collaborative network to which > 9000 researchers from > 160 countries contribute. Most primary data are gathered by collaborating external organizations. Methods to collect such primary data include but are not limited to censuses, interviews, scientific literature, health care records and claims, and measurement of biometric data. In total, > 86 000 sources were used in the GBD 2019 data set. The update cycles of these collected data depend on the primary sources. After collection, these primary data are then processed by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation. The metadata and, if publicly available, the primary data sets are catalogued on the Global Health Data Exchange data page. Disability‐adjusted life years (DALYs) were computed by the addition of years of life lost and years lost to disease specifically for each age‐sex‐location group, with repeated draws to account for uncertainty. The Healthcare Access and Quality Index has been used to account for variations in health care access. A microsimulation process is used to correct for comorbidities of years lived with disease for each age‐sex‐location‐year group. The cause of death is determined, for example, by administrative data such as vital registration or a so‐called verbal biopsy, a battery of standardized questionnaires answered by the bereaved relatives to compensate for lacking vital registration. A complete flowchart depicting the input data and 6‐step modeling process for the estimation of AF/AFL death can be found on page 237 of Appendix 1 from Vos et al, with detailed descriptions of the methodology on the following pages. The data of more recent years are regularly updated, the most current data set is the 2019 data set used in the present study. Data were extracted from the GBD databasefor the years 1990 to 2019. Additionally, data from the World Bank Open Dataand WHO Global Health Observatorywas used for analysis. All data and materials are publicly available at the respective repository of the GBD and World Bank Open Data databases as well as the WHO Global Health Observatory, and can be accessed at, respectively. As this work is limited to the analysis of existing databases, no institutional review board approval or informed consent was required. All figures except for Figure S1 were produced using matplotlib in Python 3.8. Figures 1, 2, 3 through 1, 2, 3 were built using matplotlib's standard plot function without additional smoothing.

### Typical atrial flutter: a practical review [^116hsSaA]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Typical atrial flutter (AFL), defined as cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)-dependent macro-re-entrant atrial tachycardia, often causes debilitating symptoms, and is associated with increased incidence of atrial fibrillation, stroke, heart failure, and death. Typical AFL occurs in patients with atrial remodeling and shares risk factors with atrial fibrillation. It is also common in patients with a history of prior heart surgery or catheter ablation. It is characterized by a recognizable ECG pattern that is highly predictive of CTI-dependent re-entry in patients without iatrogenic atrial scars. Typical AFL is difficult to manage medically due to poor efficacy of rate-controlling and antiarrhythmic drugs. Catheter ablation has been established in randomized trials to be superior to medical management in terms of safety, efficacy, and clinical outcomes including hospitalization and quality of life. Catheter ablation aims at achieving bidirectional conduction block across the CTI, which can be efficiently assessed by well-established techniques such as differential pacing. Long-term ablation success requires creating a stable transmural and continuous lesion, which can be optimized by systematic assessment of ablation parameters and lesion contiguity. The present review discusses the epidemiology, mechanisms, ECG characteristics, medical management, and catheter ablation of typical AFL.

### The interrelationship between atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter [^111FLSF8]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

For a long time, it has been known that atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have a close clinical interrelationship. Recent electrophysiological studies, especially mapping studies, have significantly advanced our understanding of this interrelationship. Regarding the relationship of atrial fibrillation with atrial flutter: Atrial fibrillation of variable duration precedes the onset of atrial flutter in almost all instances. During the atrial fibrillation, the functional components needed to complete the atrial flutter reentrant circuit, principally a line of block between the venae cavae, are formed. If this line of block does not form, classical atrial flutter does not develop. If this line of block shortens or disappears, classical atrial flutter disappears. In fact, it is fair to say that the major determinant of whether atrial fibrillation persists or classical atrial flutter develops is whether a line of block forms between the venae cavae. Regarding the relationship of atrial flutter with atrial fibrillation: Studies in experimental models and now in patients have demonstrated that a driver (a rapidly firing focus or a reentrant circuit of very short cycle length) can cause atrial fibrillation by producing fibrillatory conduction to the rest of the atria. When the driver is a stable reentrant circuit of very short cycle length, it is, in effect, a very fast form of atrial flutter. There probably is a spectrum of reentrant circuits of short cycle length, i.e., "atrial flutter", that depend, in part, on where the reentrant circuit is located. When the cycle length of the reentrant circuit is so short that it will only activate small portions of the atria in a 1:1 manner, the rest of the atria will be activated rapidly but irregularly, i.e., via fibrillatory conduction, resulting in atrial fibrillation. In short, there are probably several mechanisms of atrial fibrillation, one of which is due to a very rapid atrial flutter circuit causing fibrillatory conduction. In sum, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have an important interrelationship.

### Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in athletes [^1128gNWv]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in clinical practice, with an estimated prevalence of 0.4% to 1% in the general population, increasing with age to 8% in those above 80 years. The recognised risk factors for developing AF include age, structural heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus or hyperthyroidism. However, the mechanisms underlying the initiation of AF in patients below 60 years of age, in whom no cardiovascular disease or any other known causal factor is present, remain to be clarified. This condition, termed as lone AF, may be responsible for as many as 30% of patients with paroxysmal AF seeking medical attention. Recent studies suggest that long-term endurance exercise may increase the incidence of AF and atrial flutter (AFl) in this population. This review article is intended to analyse the prevalence of AF and AFl, the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the association between endurance sport practice and AF or AFl and the recommended therapeutic options in endurance athletes.

### A population-based study of mortality among patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter [^113CmBMi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the mortality associated with atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation in the general population.

Subjects and Methods

Using the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area, a database that captures nearly all medical care and deaths among its 58,820 residents, we identified patients diagnosed with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation from July 1, 1991, through June 30, 1995. Patients were followed prospectively and compared with a group of controls without these arrhythmias.

Results

A total of 4775 person-years of follow-up were completed in 577 patients and 577 controls. Compared with controls, mortality among patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter was nearly 7.8-fold higher at 6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.1 to 15) and 2.5-fold higher (95% CI: 2.0 to 3.1; P < 0.0001) at the last follow-up (mean [± SD] of 3.6 ± 2.3 years; range, 1 day to 7.3 years). At 6 months, mortality among patients with atrial flutter alone was somewhat greater than in controls and less than one third that of those with atrial fibrillation (with or without atrial flutter) (P = 0.02). At the last follow-up, however, mortality was greater among patients with atrial flutter (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.6; P = 0.007), atrial fibrillation (HR = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.9 to 3.1; P < 0.0001), or both atrial arrhythmias (HR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.9 to 3.3; P < 0.0001) when compared with controls in models that adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors.

Conclusion

In the general population, both atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation are independent predictors of increased late mortality. The relatively benign course during the 6-month period after the initial diagnosis of atrial flutter suggests that early diagnosis and treatment of these patients may improve their long-term survival.

Atrial fibrillation — causes and associated conditions include reversible triggers, AF without demonstrable heart disease, and metabolic contributors. AF may be related to acute, temporary causes such as alcohol intake, surgery, electrocution, myocardial infarction (MI), pericarditis, myocarditis, pulmonary embolism or other pulmonary diseases, hyperthyroidism, and other metabolic disorders, and successful treatment of the underlying condition often eliminates AF. AF that develops in the setting of acute MI portends an adverse prognosis compared with preinfarction AF or sinus rhythm, and AF may be associated with atrial flutter, the Wolff–Parkinson–White (WPW) syndrome, or atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardias, where treatment of the primary arrhythmias reduces or eliminates recurrent AF; AF is a common early postoperative complication of cardiac or thoracic surgery. AF is often an electrical manifestation of underlying cardiac disease, yet approximately 30% to 45% of cases of paroxysmal AF and 20% to 25% of cases of persistent AF occur in younger patients without demonstrable underlying disease. Obesity is an important risk factor for development of AF, and after adjustment the excess risk appears mediated by left atrial dilation, with a graded increase in left atrial size as body mass index increases from normal to the overweight and obese categories.

### Acquired risk factors and incident atrial fibrillation according to age and genetic predisposition [^114G14Ew]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF), as the most common sustained arrhythmia, imposes a huge burden on individuals and public health worldwide. In the 2019 global statistics, there were ∼59.7 million people with AF/flutter. With the continuous improvement of lifespan and medical standards, the population with AF in the European Union will double in the next 40 years, and the lifetime risk will be one in three individuals of European ancestry at an index age of 55. Atrial fibrillation is an independent risk factor for heart failure and myocardial infarction, and is responsible for one in five strokes. Even worse, people with AF have twice the risk of premature death.

The pathophysiological mechanism and risk factors for AF are complex, multifactorial, and interacting, making prevention challenging. Previous studies have found that many social, lifestyle, and cardiometabolic factors and comorbidities are associated with the occurrence and development of AF. It has also been reported that interventions for some risk factors, such as alcohol reduction and weight management, are beneficial in reducing the AF burden, recurrence, and symptoms. Thus, the observed impact of risk factor burden/multiple comorbidities suggests that an early intervention addressing risk factors is urgently needed to reduce the number of new AF cases.

However, current evidence comes mainly from the general population, and considering that age and genetic predisposition are critical fixed risk factors for AF, it remains unclear whether there is a varied impact of those individual factors on the AF risk by age and genetic risk group and whether age and genetic risk-specific strategies of primary prevention should be adopted. Although the number of people with AF increases significantly with aging, a diagnosis of AF at a younger age or early onset AF poses a greater burden on health. Identifying the contribution of various risk factors to incident AF in different age and genetic risk groups is of great significance for the prevention of AF.

In this study, we aimed to explore the associations of 23 risk factors with incident AF and to present the ranking order of these factors by partial population-attributable risk (PAR) percentages among three consecutive age groups (40–49, 50–59, and 60–69 years) and different genetic risk groups (low, moderate, and high) in a large prospective UK cohort.

### Long-term outcomes after hospitalization for atrial fibrillation or flutter [^1142BynS]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Patients hospitalized for AF and flutter had a low survival of 55.2% at 10 years with an attributable loss of life expectancy of 2.6 years or nearly one-fifth of their anticipated life expectancy. AF-associated cardiovascular outcomes were relatively common, and so was re-hospitalization for AF or flutter, which occurred in two out of every five patients by 10 years. Despite the high burden of AF or flutter re-hospitalizations, the incidence of AF ablation was low with < 7% of patients receiving this procedure at 10 years post-discharge. Effective strategies are needed to reduce the AF burden and decrease the downstream risk of AF and flutter-related adverse cardiovascular events.

### Different implications of heart failure, ischemic stroke, and mortality between nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter-a view from a national cohort study [^1113c8E3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. AF is characterized by an irregularly irregular atrial rhythm with a rate of more than 350 beats per minute and electrophysiological mechanisms involving rapidly firing foci and random multiple micro‐ or macro‐reentrant activation wavelets. 1 The number of patients with AF worldwide was reportedly 33.5 million in 2010, 2 and it will be expected to double by 2050. 3 The Framingham heart study reported that AF is associated with an ≈5‐fold increased risk of embolic stroke, 2‐fold increased risk of heart failure, and 2‐fold higher risk of mortality. 4 Therefore, public awareness of AF and its related complications is an urgent and important issue. 5, 6

Atrial flutter (AFL) is a macro‐reentrant atrial tachycardia characterized by an organized atrial rhythm with a rate usually between 250 and 350 beats per minute. 7 The prevalence of AFL is around 200 000 in the United States, and AFL has been reported to increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, and mortality. 8, 9 AF and AFL have been observed to switch back and forth to one another clinically. 10 Therefore, AF and AFL are conceptually recognized to be the same risk factor in terms of preventing complications related to atrial tachyarrhythmias, and it is generally recommended according to guidelines and expert opinions that AFL patients should be risk stratified and treated in the same manner as AF patients. 5, 6

Although AF and AFL share several common risk factors with regard to occurrence, 11, 12 and both have been reported to contribute to heart failure, mortality, and stroke, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 they are fundamentally different in terms of atrial rate, substrate, and electrophysiological mechanisms, and consequently, they differ in the degree of atrial myopathy and neurohumoral activation. Therefore, it is reasonable to conduct a study to investigate the differential impact of AFL and AF on the development of heart failure, ischemic stroke, and mortality.

Accordingly, we conducted this study to investigate the difference in the impact of solitary nonvalvular AF versus AFL on the development of heart failure, ischemic stroke, and all‐cause mortality in a large‐population national database.

Related arrhythmias — atrial flutter and atrial tachycardia — are described in the context of atrial fibrillation (AF), as AF may occur in isolation or in association with other arrhythmias, most commonly atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia, and atrial flutter may arise during treatment with antiarrhythmic agents prescribed to prevent recurrent AF. Atrial flutter in the typical form is characterized by a saw-tooth pattern of regular atrial activation called flutter (f) waves on the ECG, particularly visible in leads II, III, aVF, and V1, and in the untreated state, the atrial rate in atrial flutter typically ranges from 240 to 320 beats per minute. Atrial flutter commonly occurs with 2:1 AV block, resulting in a regular or irregular ventricular rate of 120 to 160 beats per minute (most characteristically about 150 beats per minute), and atrial flutter may degenerate into AF and AF may convert to atrial flutter, with the ECG pattern fluctuating between atrial flutter and AF. Atrial flutter is usually readily distinguished from AF, but when atrial activity is prominent on the ECG in more than 1 lead, AF may be misdiagnosed as atrial flutter, and focal atrial tachycardias, AV reentrant tachycardias, and AV nodal reentrant tachycardias may also trigger AF.

Electrophysiological (EP) study — An EP study can be helpful when AF is a consequence of reentrant tachycardia such as atrial flutter, intra-atrial reentry, or atrioventricular (AV) reentry involving an accessory pathway. Detection of a delta wave on the surface ECG in a patient with a history of AF or syncope is a firm indication for EP study and ablation of the bypass tract. Some patients with documented atrial flutter also have AF, and ablation of flutter can eliminate AF, although this is not common and successful ablation of flutter does not eliminate the possibility of developing AF in the future; AF with rapid ventricular rates and wide-complex QRS morphology may be mislabeled as ventricular tachycardia, and an EP study will differentiate the 2 arrhythmias. In short, EP testing is indicated when ablative therapy of arrhythmias that trigger AF or ablation of AF is planned.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation: part I. rate and… [^117HqUtY]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia encountered in the primary care setting. Approximately 4 percent of persons in the general U. S. population have permanent or intermittent atrial fibrillation, and the prevalence of the arrhythmia increases to 9 percent in persons older than 60 years. 2 Atrial fibrillation can result in serious complications, including congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and thromboembolism. Recognition and acute management of atrial fibrillation in the physician's office or emergency department are important in preventing adverse consequences. Diagnosis The diagnosis of atrial fibrillation should be considered in elderly patients who present with complaints of shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations. The arrhythmia should also be suspected in patients with acute fatigue or exacerbation of congestive heart failure.

3 In some patients, atrial fibrillation may be identified on the basis of an irregularly irregular pulse or an electrocardiogram obtained for the evaluation of another condition. Cardiac conditions commonly associated with the development of atrial fibrillation include rheumatic mitral valve disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and hypertension. Noncardiac conditions that can predispose patients to develop atrial fibrillation include hyperthyroidism, hypoxia, alcohol intoxication, and surgery.
4. The ECG is the mainstay for diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. An irregularly irregular rhythm, inconsistent R-R interval, and absence of P waves are usually noted on the cardiac monitor or ECG. Atrial fibrillation waves, which are small, irregular waves seen as a rapid-cycle baseline fluctuation, indicate rapid atrial activity and are the hallmark of the arrhythmia.

Atrial flutter is included in the spectrum of supraventricular arrhythmia. This rhythm disturbance is usually distinguishable by its more prominent saw-tooth wave configuration and slower atrial rates. Atrial fibrillation should also be distinguished from atrial tachycardia with variable atrioventricular block, which usually presents with an atrial rate of approximately 150 beats per minute. In this condition, the atrial rate is regular, but conduction to the ventricles is not regular. The resultant irregularly irregular rhythm may be difficult to differentiate from atrial fibrillation. 3.

### Classification of atrial flutter and regular atrial tachycardia according to electrophysiologic mechanism and anatomic bases: a statement from a joint expert group from the working group of arrhythmias of the European Society of Cardiology and the north American society of pacing and electrophysiology [^112dhWCq]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2001). Low credibility.

Regular atrial tachycardias classically are classified into flutter or tachycardia, depending on the rate and presence of a stable baseline on the ECG. However, current understanding of electrophysiology atrial tachycardias makes this classification obsolete, because it does not correlate with mechanisms. The proposed classification is based on electrophysiologic mechanisms, defined by mapping and entrainment. Radiofrequency ablation of a critical focus or isthmus can afford proof. Focal tachycardias are characterized by radial spread of activation and endocardial activation not covering the whole cycle. Ablation of the focus of origin interrupts the tachycardia. The mechanism of focal firing is difficult to ascertain by clinical methods. Macroreentrant tachycardias are characterized by circular patterns of activation that cover the whole cycle. Fusion can be shown during entrainment on the ECG or by multiple endocardial recordings. Ablation of a critical isthmus interrupts the tachycardia. Macroreentry can occur around normal structures (terminal crest, eustachian ridge) or around atrial lesions. The anatomic bases of these tachycardias must be defined, to guide appropriate treatment. Atrial flutter is a mere description of continuous undulation on the ECG, and only some strictly defined typical flutter patterns correlate with right atrial macroreentry bounded by the tricuspid valve, terminal crest, and caval vein orifices. This classification should be considered open, as some classically described tachycardias, such as reentrant sinus tachycardia, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and type II atrial flutter, cannot be classified accurately. Furthermore, the possibility of fibrillatory conduction makes the limits with atrial fibrillation still ill defined.

### Atrial flutter: clinical risk factors and adverse outcomes in the framingham heart study [^116UX1mA]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Few epidemiologic cohort studies have evaluated atrial flutter (flutter) as an arrhythmia distinct from atrial fibrillation (AF).

Objective

The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical correlates of flutter and its associated outcomes to distinguish them from those associated with AF in the Framingham Heart Study.

Methods

We reviewed and adjudicated electrocardiograms (ECGs) previously classified as flutter or AF/flutter and another 100 ECGs randomly selected from AF cases. We examined the clinical correlates of flutter by matching up to 5 AF and 5 referents to each flutter case using a nested case referent design. We determined the 10-year outcomes associated with flutter with Cox models.

Results

During mean follow-up of 33.0 ± 12.2 years, 112 participants (mean age 72 ± 10 years, 30% women) developed flutter. In multivariable analyses, smoking (odds ratio [OR] 2.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.54–5.23), increased PR interval (OR 1.28 per SD, 95% CI 1.03–1.60), myocardial infarction (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.05–4.80) and heart failure (OR 5.22, 95% CI 1.26–21.64) were associated with incident flutter. In age- and sex-adjusted models, flutter (vs referents) was associated with 10-year increased risk of AF (hazard ratio [HR] 5.01, 95% CI 3.14–7.99), myocardial infarction (HR 3.05, 95% CI 1.42–6.59), heart failure (HR 4.14, 95% CI 1.90–8.99), stroke (HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.13–4.17), and mortality (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.44–2.79).

Conclusion

We identified the clinical correlates associated with flutter and observed that flutter was associated with multiple adverse outcomes.

### Breathless nights and heart flutters: understanding the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and atrial fibrillation [^111o7RVy]. Heart Rhythm (2023). Medium credibility.

There is an extraordinary and increasing global burden of atrial fibrillation (AF) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), two conditions that frequently accompany one another and that share underlying risk factors. Whether a causal pathophysiologic relationship connects OSA to the development and/or progression of AF, or whether shared risk factors promote both conditions, is unproven. With increasing recognition of the importance of controlling AF-related risk factors, numerous observational studies now highlight the potential benefits of OSA treatment in AF-related outcomes. Physicians are regularly faced with caring for this important and increasing population of patients despite a paucity of clinical guidance on the topic. Here, we review the clinical epidemiology and pathophysiology of AF and OSA with a focus on key clinical studies and major outstanding questions that should be addressed in future studies.

### Arrhythmias after heart transplantation: mechanisms and management [^117Ly7E8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

Atrial Flutter

Atrial flutter is the most common sustained atrial arrhythmia late after HT, and beyond 3 weeks of surgery, atrial flutter episodes outnumber AF. Atrial flutter is the most common arrhythmia associated with rejection. Late-onset flutter or reentrant tachycardia may reflect remodeling of the atria. Typical isthmus-dependent flutters may be easily identified, but atypical macroreentrant tachycardia may be difficult to differentiate from ectopic atrial tachycardia in the donor heart or atrial activity conducted from the recipient atrium when the biatrial method is used. Risk of atrial flutter is increased by use of the biatrial method and older donor age.

Patients with atrial flutter are more likely to have LV dysfunction and earlier mortality. When sustained atrial flutter occurs after HT, radiofrequency ablation is a viable option after primary etiologies such as acute rejection, LV dysfunction, and cardiac ischemia have been excluded. The altered anatomy of the transplanted heart often makes catheter placement challenging for ablation of right atrial isthmus flutter. Mitral isthmus flutter can be ablated using standard techniques used in the non-HT context.

Ventricular Arrhythmias and SCD

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) can be relatively common in the early postoperative period, and possible associations with rejection or early graft failure have been variable. However, symptomatic nonsustained VT occurring late after HT can be associated with severe cardiac allograft vasculopathy and may warrant ICD placement. Sustained VT is infrequent after HT and when observed should prompt both coronary angiography and cardiac biopsy. Sustained VT in the immediate postoperative period may indicate impending hyperacute rejection.

The mortality rate in the later years after HT is ≈4% per year, substantially higher than the age-matched general population. Many die because of noncardiac causes such as malignancy. Most deaths after HT, however, are attributed to severe cardiac allograft vasculopathy and ventricular dysfunction. Approximately 25% of such patients may suffer SCD. The reported incidence varies depending on the nature of the study, whether hospital based or autopsy based, and how SCD was defined. The proximate causes for sudden death include acute ischemia, rejection, and severe LV dysfunction. Primary arrhythmic death is diagnosed when no attributable anatomic cause is identified and is described in around 25% of sudden deaths after HT.

Results

Absolute and Relative Prevalence, and Deaths

The absolute global prevalence of AF/AFL has more than doubled between 1990 and 2019, from worldwide estimates of 28 273 978 AF/AFL cases in 1990 to 59 671 814 cases in 2019. In middle‐income countries, the rise in prevalence has been greatest, with an increase of 146.6% in lower‐middle‐income countries and an increase of 145.2% in upper‐middle‐income countries. In low‐income countries, the prevalence rose by 120.7%. In high‐income countries, AF/AFL prevalence has risen by 67.8%. High‐income countries had the highest absolute prevalence until 2014. Since then, prevalence in upper‐middle‐income countries is higher than in high‐income countries (Figure 1A). The relative prevalence of AF/AFL is still highest in high‐income countries with a prevalence rate of 1738 per 100 000 in 2019. In upper‐middle‐income countries, relative prevalence was 844 per 100 000, in lower‐middle‐income countries 487 per 100 000 and in low‐income countries 144 per 100 000 (Figure 1B). The absolute number of DALYs has continuously increased since 1990. This increase was greatest in upper‐middle‐income countries with the number of DALYs attributable to AF/AFL in upper‐middle‐income countries (+150.4%) almost reaching the numbers of high‐income countries (+80.0%) in 2019. In lower‐middle‐income countries, the number of DALYs has increased by 166.2% since 1990, and by 129.4% in low‐income countries (Figure 1C). In contrast to prevalence, the absolute number of AF/AFL‐related deaths continues to be highest in high‐income countries. It increased by 131.3% between 1990 and 2019. Deaths due to AF/AFL have risen by 202.3% in upper‐middle‐income countries and by 227.4% in lower‐middle‐income countries. In low‐income countries, the number of deaths increased by 162.3% (Figure 1D). This increase of absolute and relative prevalence in upper‐middle‐income countries was largely driven by women in an analysis of sex differences (Data S2 and Figure S2).

The authors compared the stroke rate in 59 patients with atrial flutter with rates in a sample in which age- and sex-specific ischemic cerebrovascular event rates were determined and in a sample of nonhypertensive patients with lone atrial fibrillation. The risk for developing atrial fibrillation after presenting with atrial flutter is also reported.

Measurements

Electrocardiograms and clinical data were collected and reviewed for each study participant.

Results

After adjustment for age and sex, patients with atrial flutter had a higher incidence of thromboembolic events than the sample control patients and patients with atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation developed in 56% of patients with atrial flutter.

Conclusions

Lone atrial flutter has a stroke risk at least as high as lone atrial fibrillation and carries a higher risk for subsequent development of atrial fibrillation than in the general population. Anticoagulation should be considered for all patients with atrial flutter who are older than 65 years of age.

Key points
- Atrial fibrillation, often called AFib or AF, is the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia.
- Some people who have AFib don't know they have it and don't have any symptoms. What it is Atrial fibrillation, often called AFib or AF, is the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia. An arrhythmia is when the heart beats too slowly, too fast, or in an irregular way. When a person has AFib, the normal beating in the upper chambers of the heart is irregular, and blood doesn't flow as well as it should from the atria to the lower chambers of the heart. AFib may happen in brief episodes, or it may be a permanent condition. Symptoms Some people who have AFib don't know they have it and don't have any symptoms. Others may experience one or more of the following symptoms:

- Irregular heartbeat.
- Heart palpitations.
- Lightheadedness.
- Extreme fatigue.
- Shortness of breath.
- Chest pain.

Risk factors The risk for AFib increases with age. High blood pressure, the risk for which also increases with advancing age, accounts for about 1 in 5 cases of AFib. Risk factors for AFib include:

- Advancing age.
- High blood pressure.
- Obesity.
- European ancestry.
- Diabetes.
- Heart failure.
- Ischemic heart disease.
- Hyperthyroidism.
- Chronic kidney disease.
- Moderate to heavy alcohol use.
- Smoking.
- Enlargement of the chambers on the left side of the heart. How is AFib related to stroke. AFib increases a person's risk for stroke. When standard stroke risk factors were accounted for, AFib was associated with an approximately fivefold increased risk of ischemic stroke. AFib causes about 1 in 7 strokes. Strokes caused by complications from AFib tend to be more severe than strokes with other underlying causes. Strokes happen when blood flow to the brain is blocked by a blood clot or by fatty deposits called plaque in the blood vessel lining.

Treatment and recovery Treatment for AFib can include:

- Medicines to control the heart's rhythm and rate.
- Blood-thinning medicine to prevent blood clots from forming and reduce stroke risk.
- Surgery.
- Medicine and healthy lifestyle changes to manage AFib risk factors.

Mechanisms of atrial tachycardia and atrial flutter — classification and examples — are as follows: Atrial arrhythmias can be broadly classified as focal, small circuit, or macroreentry. Examples include isthmus-dependent reverse common (clockwise) atrial flutter, isthmus-dependent common (counter clockwise) atrial flutter, focal atrial tachycardia with circumferential spread of activation of the atria (can arise from multiple sites within the left and right atrium), microreentrant atrial tachycardia with circumferential spread of activation of the atria, perimitral atrial flutter, and roof-dependent atrial flutter.

### Diagnosis and management of common types of supraventricular… [^1124zyL5]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Supraventricular tachycardia refers to rapid rhythms that originate and are sustained in atrial or atrioventricular nodal tissue, and then transmit through the bundle of His and cause rapid ventricular response. Although atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and multi-focal atrial tachycardia also arise from this area, in practice, SVT refers to atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, and atrial tachycardia. Figure 1 illustrates the three types of SVT. 1 These arrhythmias typically occur in patients with structurally normal hearts, although patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or a cardiac congenital anomaly may have accessory pathways. 2 Sudden onset of an accelerated heart rate can cause palpitations, light-headedness, chest discomfort, anxiety, dyspnea, or fatigue.

7 It is correlated with lower estrogen levels and higher progesterone levels, and is therefore more common during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and less common during pregnancy. 8 AVNRT involves a pattern of reentry in persons who have two pathways in their atrioventricular node, one slow and one fast. 4 Patients with AVRT have a bypass pathway that bridges the atrium and ventricle, creating an accessory track that can conduct impulses in an anterograde or retrograde manner and establish a reentry circuit. Anterograde conduction down an accessory pathway may reach the ventricle before the impulse through the AV node, producing preexcitation of a portion of the ventricle, which creates a slurred upstroke at the start of the QRS complex on ECG. ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA In contrast to AVNRT and AVRT, atrial tachycardia does not involve reentry through the AV node or ventricle. It is caused by a focal area of automaticity in the atrium.

Atrial tissue adjacent to the crista terminalis in the right atrium or the ostia of the pulmonary veins in the left atrium is particularly susceptible to the development of automaticity. 14 P waves are seen before the QRS complexes, although they can be hidden in the T wave with tachycardia.

### Fitness-related cardiac arrhythmias… [^115aMduP]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Fitness-Related Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Most cases of atrial fibrillation/flutter occur in older adults with coronary artery disease, valvular disease, or other heart disease. It can also occur in individuals — most commonly middle-aged adults and sometimes younger persons — who have high levels of physical fitness and no underlying heart disease or medical conditions. 1 It is estimated that for every 10 years of regular endurance exercise, the risk of atrial fibrillation increases by about 16%, and the risk of atrial flutter increases by 42%. 2 Well-known athletes, such as tennis icon Billie Jean King and basketball star Larry Bird, have developed atrial fibrillation/flutter — some when they were as young as 30 to 40 years of age. Episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter can occur during exercise or at rest.

Although the etiology is uncertain, a variety of causes have been suggested, mostly focusing on atrial remodeling due to exercise-related pressure overload in the atrium, high vagal tone, or the inflammatory mediators that circulate when individuals have sore muscles. 3–5 Direct inflammation of the atrium from the adjacent esophagus may contribute to these atrial arrhythmias in patients with acid reflux. 6, 7. Fitness-related atrial fibrillation/flutter should be suspected when athletic individuals who are in their 30s or 40s or older report symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, or dizziness when they are at rest or exercising. If the symptoms are occasional and atrial fibrillation/flutter is not confirmed with resting electrocardiography, a cardiac event monitor can be used to detect the arrhythmia, with the duration of monitoring determined by the anticipated frequency of the patient's symptoms.

8 More importantly, underlying heart disease should be excluded using echocardiography, exercise stress testing, and, when indicated, cardiac computed tomography angiography or cardiac catheterization. Additional testing for other potential causes or exacerbating factors such as hyperthyroidism and electrolyte abnormalities should be individualized. If the evaluation is negative for underlying heart disease and the patient's history is consistent with high-level exercise, a diagnosis of fitness-related atrial fibrillation/flutter can be made.

### Incidence and predictors of atrial flutter in the general population [^112QWehK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2000). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goal of our study was to determine the incidence and predictors of atrial flutter in the general population.

Background

Although atrial flutter can now be cured, there are no reports on its epidemiology in unselected patients.

Methods

The Marshfield Epidemiological Study Area (MESA), a database that captures nearly all medical care among its 58,820 residents was used to ascertain all new cases of atrial flutter diagnosed from July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1995. To identify predisposing risk factors, we employed an age- and gender-matched case-control study design using eight additional variables.

Results

A total of 181 new cases of atrial flutter were diagnosed for an overall incidence of 88/100,000 person-years. Incidence rates ranged from 5/100,000 in those < 50 years old to 587/100,000 in subjects older than 80. Atrial flutter was 2.5 times more common in men (p < 0.001). The risk of developing atrial flutter increased 3.5 times (p < 0.001) in subjects with heart failure and 1.9 times (p < 0.001) for subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Among those with atrial flutter 16% were attributable to heart failure and 12% to chronic obstructive lung disease. Three subjects (1.7%) without identifiable predisposing risks were labeled as having "lone atrial flutter".

Conclusions

This study, the first population-based investigation of atrial flutter, suggests this curable condition is much more common than previously appreciated. If our findings were applicable to the entire U.S. population, we estimate 200,000 new cases of atrial flutter in this country annually. At highest risk of developing atrial flutter are men, the elderly and individuals with preexisting heart failure or chronic obstructive lung disease.

### Introduction: American College of Chest Physicians guidelines for the prevention and management of postoperative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery [^1179wpXb]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are arrhythmias that commonly occur following cardiac surgery. The precipitating events are not always obvious, although predisposing factors including age have been defined. Postoperative AF and AFL add significantly to both the cost and morbidity of cardiac surgery. This guideline report, which was created under the auspices of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), critically reviews evidence-based literature defining optimal treatment and prophylaxis for postoperative AF. Specific issues addressed include the following: (1) controlling the ventricular response rate in the patient with postoperative AF and AFL; (2) preventing thromboembolism in the setting of AF and AFL including the appropriate role of anticoagulation therapy; (3) pharmacologic approaches to converting AF or AFL to normal sinus rhythm, and maintaining normal sinus rhythm postoperatively; and (4) pharmacologic and surgical prophylaxis against postoperative AF and AFL. The resulting clinical practice guidelines represent the best-supported treatments, based on a rational scientific approach formulated from randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews. The panel convened by the Health and Sciences Policy Committee of the ACCP reviewed the currently available evidence to provide a basis for making specific recommendations for patient care.
