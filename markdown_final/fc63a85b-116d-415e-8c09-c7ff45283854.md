## Question

oral semaglutide dosing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about oral semaglutide dosing, including formulation-specific regimens, administration requirements, dose escalation, special populations, switching scenarios, and safety monitoring, with explicit self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the two approved oral formulations and their labeled dosing. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetic rationale for fasting administration and water volume. Next, I will review the standard dose-escalation strategy and when to escalate to 14 mg. After that, I need to consider special populations and switching from injectable GLP-1 RAs. I will then examine flexible dosing evidence and real-world titration practices. Finally, I should confirm safety monitoring, missed-dose guidance, and summarize practical pearls for implementation, making sure each assertion is supported by labeling or trials.

> Let me first confirm the formulations and labeled dosing, because mixing R1 and R2 would mislead dosing. The original R1 formulation uses 3 mg, 7 mg, and 14 mg tablets, whereas the newer R2 formulation uses 1.5 mg, 4 mg, and 9 mg tablets, with R2 doses bioequivalent to half the corresponding R1 doses, which explains why R2 maintenance is 4–9 mg while R1 maintenance is 7–14 mg, and this bioequivalence has been demonstrated in crossover studies and reflected in FDA labeling, so I need to ensure I specify which tablet strength set the patient actually has before giving instructions [^114i2QZQ] [^114i2QZQ] [^114kHYEN] [^113dEAoS].

> Wait, let me verify the core administration rules because absorption is highly condition-dependent. Oral semaglutide must be taken in the fasting state with no more than 120 mL of water, swallowed whole without splitting or chewing, and the patient must wait at least 30 minutes before any food, drink, or other oral medications; pre-dose fasting and the 30-minute post-dose fast are critical to achieve clinically relevant exposure, and taking it with food essentially abolishes absorption, so I should double-check that the patient understands this timing at initiation and at every follow-up [^114i2QZQ] [^111mZc6N] [^113hB8GC] [^11184WQg].

> I need to check the standard escalation cadence next. For R1, start 3 mg daily for 30 days, then 7 mg daily for at least 30 days, and if additional glycemic control is needed, increase to 14 mg daily; for R2, start 1.5 mg daily for 30 days, then 4 mg daily for at least 30 days, and if needed, increase to 9 mg daily; the 3 mg or 1.5 mg doses are not intended for long-term glycemic control, so I should confirm that patients do not remain on the starter dose indefinitely [^114i2QZQ] [^114i2QZQ] [^114Jp9iv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about faster escalation; I should confirm when it is reasonable to shorten the intervals. In urgent glycemic scenarios with good GI tolerability, some experts allow escalation after 10–20 days at 3 mg or 7 mg, but patients must be counseled on transient GI symptoms and monitored closely; conversely, if GI intolerance emerges, extending time on 7 mg (R1) or 4 mg (R2) before escalating can improve persistence, so I need to balance speed with tolerability and document the rationale if I deviate from the label [^112PdKXe] [^114Jp9iv].

> Next, I should review special populations and switching scenarios. In moderate renal impairment, no dose adjustment is required, though I should monitor for dehydration risk if GI adverse effects occur; when switching from once-weekly GLP-1 RAs, start oral semaglutide 7 days after the last injection and choose 3 mg or 7 mg based on prior tolerability and efficacy; when switching from daily injectables, initiate the day after discontinuation and tailor the starting oral dose to prior GI tolerance and glycemic needs, explaining expected differences in weight effects between oral and injectable semaglutide [^114i2QZQ] [^111CWrnr] [^116egzrx].

> Let me consider the evidence for flexible dosing and real-world titration, because adherence and lifestyle constraints often necessitate pragmatism. The PIONEER 7 program demonstrated that flexible dose adjustment between 3, 7, and 14 mg based on HbA1c and tolerability yielded superior glycemic control and weight loss versus sitagliptin, supporting individualized titration; observational data show that many patients remain on 3 mg longer than recommended, suggesting a gap in escalation that clinicians should address proactively; a small real-world series suggests that alternative timing with adequate pre- and post-dose fasting can preserve effectiveness, but I should emphasize that this is low-certainty and that morning administration remains standard [^115vk3sB] [^112e2sid] [^1112Mvuc] [^111XZXC8].

> I should confirm safety monitoring priorities and missed-dose guidance. GI adverse events are dose-related and most often occur during initiation and escalation; they are usually mild to moderate and transient, but persistent vomiting or diarrhea warrants hydration assessment and renal function checks; if a dose is missed, skip it and resume the next day — do not double up; for patients on insulin or sulfonylureas, I need to anticipate hypoglycemia risk and consider dose reductions of secretagogues or insulin when adding semaglutide [^114Jp9iv] [^114i2QZQ] [^1161SihE].

> But wait, what if the patient asks about higher oral doses for weight loss; I should clarify the indication boundary. Higher oral semaglutide doses of 25 mg and 50 mg have been studied in obesity without diabetes and in type 2 diabetes, showing greater weight and HbA1c reductions, yet these doses are not currently approved for glycemic control in the United States; current FDA-approved oral dosing for T2D remains 3→7→14 mg (R1) or 1.5→4→9 mg (R2), so I must not conflate investigational or obesity-labeled dosing with diabetes treatment dosing [^1155p2iq] [^114DdbUM] [^114i2QZQ] [^114i2QZQ].

> Let me synthesize practical pearls to ensure nothing critical is missed. Always confirm which formulation the patient has and provide written, formulation-specific instructions; anchor administration to a consistent daily fasting window with a 30-minute post-dose fast; anticipate and preempt GI effects with dietary counseling and slower titration if needed; escalate promptly if targets are unmet and tolerability allows; and at each visit, verify adherence to fasting conditions because even excellent pill-taking without proper timing can blunt efficacy; these steps align with labeling, pharmacokinetic studies, and pragmatic expert guidance [^114i2QZQ] [^111mZc6N] [^114Jp9iv] [^1161SihE].

Oral semaglutide is dosed once daily [^114i2QZQ] in a fixed escalation sequence to balance efficacy and gastrointestinal tolerability [^114Jp9iv]. Start at **3 mg daily for 30 days** [^114i2QZQ], then increase to **7 mg daily** [^114UDMq7]; if additional glycemic control is needed, escalate to **14 mg daily** after at least 30 days at 7 mg [^114Jp9iv]. Take each dose with no more than 120 mL of water [^111mZc6N], wait at least 30 minutes before eating or taking other oral medications [^113hB8GC], and swallow tablets whole — do not split, crush, or chew [^111DX9NZ]. If a dose is missed, skip it and resume the next day; do not double the dose [^111DX9NZ]. Adjust the titration pace for tolerability [^114Jp9iv], and monitor for gastrointestinal adverse effects and hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas [^115AtJbi].

---

## Recommended dosing schedule

The recommended dosing schedule for oral semaglutide is summarized below:

| **Dose** | **Duration** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 3 mg once daily | Days 1–30 | Initiation dose to minimize gastrointestinal side effects [^114i2QZQ] |
| 7 mg once daily | Days 31–60 | Maintenance dose for glycemic control [^114i2QZQ] |
| 14 mg once daily | Day 61 onwards | Escalated dose if additional glycemic control is needed [^114i2QZQ] |

---

## Administration instructions

Proper administration is critical for **optimal absorption and efficacy**:

- **Fasting state**: Take on an empty stomach [^111mZc6N], preferably after an overnight fast [^113hB8GC].
- **Water volume**: Swallow whole with no more than 120 mL (4 oz) of water [^111mZc6N] [^113hB8GC].
- **Post-dose fasting**: Wait at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking, or taking other oral medications [^113hB8GC] [^1142vCRo].
- **Tablet integrity**: Do not split, crush, or chew tablets [^111DX9NZ].

---

## Missed dose guidance

If a dose is missed, skip it and take the next dose the following day; **do not double the dose** to compensate [^111DX9NZ].

---

## Dose adjustment and titration

- **Titration pace**: Adjust based on tolerability and glycemic response [^115vk3sB]; extend time on lower doses if gastrointestinal side effects occur [^114Jp9iv].
- **Maximum dose**: 14 mg once daily [^114i2QZQ].
- **Lower doses**: 3 mg and 7 mg are not intended for long-term maintenance if 14 mg is tolerated and needed [^114i2QZQ].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Renal impairment**: No dose adjustment required [^notfound].
- **Hepatic impairment**: No dose adjustment required [^notfound].
- **Elderly patients**: No specific dose adjustment required, but monitor closely for adverse effects [^notfound].

---

## Adverse effects and monitoring

Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain) [^notfound] and decreased appetite [^notfound]. Monitor for gastrointestinal adverse effects, especially during dose escalation [^114Jp9iv], and assess for hypoglycemia when used with insulin or sulfonylureas [^1123BArJ].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing regimen

The PIONEER program demonstrated dose-dependent HbA1c and weight reductions, with 14 mg providing the greatest efficacy [^114Ycy6s] [^111C4QoY]. Flexible dosing in PIONEER 7 allowed individualized titration based on glycemic response and tolerability, supporting the current regimen [^115vk3sB] [^117XhUC4].

---

Oral semaglutide uses a **once-daily, stepwise regimen** (3 mg → 7 mg → 14 mg) to optimize glycemic control while minimizing GI adverse effects. Adherence to fasting administration and dose titration is essential for efficacy and tolerability [^111mZc6N] [^114i2QZQ].

Suggested Strategies for Optimal Oral Semaglutide Administration

Ensuring that patients who start oral semaglutide therapy receive comprehensive education from their healthcare provider is crucial. This education should encompass various aspects such as instructions on timing and method of administration, expectations regarding efficacy and adverse events, preventive measures to minimize the occurrence of side effects and on how to address them promptly. Thus, thorough patient education not only enhances treatment adherence but also promotes proactive management of potential challenges, ultimately promoting better overall outcomes.

The different aspects, suggested by the experts, to consider in subjects starting therapy with oral semaglutide were the following:
Patient communication Adopt specific and proactive counseling as a key component in the management of patients with T2D initiating oral semaglutide treatment. Recommend and explain the dose escalation strategy, with a starting dose of 3 mg once daily for at least 1 month, which can be then increased to 7 mg. After at least 1 month the dose can be increased to a maintenance dose of 14 mg once daily if needed to further improve glycemic control and body weight. Staying longer than 1 month on the 7-mg dose may help diluting GI side effects, but should not delay the achievement of individual targets. Inform patients about the potential occurrence of GI side effects in the initial weeks of oral semaglutide treatment, particularly during dose escalation periods. Patients should be reassured that in most cases, GI symptoms are mild to moderate and typically resolve naturally over time, encouraging them to persist on treatment.
Method and timing of administration Communicate the specific instructions related to mode of administration and their importance to patients initiating oral semaglutide treatment, to guarantee an effective drug bioavailability. Underline the necessity for a pre-dose fasting condition (enough to have an empty stomach) and observing an additional fasting period of at least 30 min post-dose, along with avoiding pharmacological interactions to allow correct semaglutide absorption. Recommend taking the medication in a time slot based on patient daily routine, when the stomach is empty. Address the patient's lifestyle and needs, to evaluate whether taking oral semaglutide after the overnight fast is the most suitable option or whether an alternative dosing time could be considered. In the latter case, provide the patients with clear written dosing instructions, regarding pre- and post-dose fasting.
Dose escalation schedule Extend the escalation periods beyond the recommended duration, if tolerability concerns arise at lower doses, i.e. maintain longer than 1 month on 7 mg before increasing the dose to 14 mg. Reduce the dose temporarily if adverse events persist and resume dose escalation once the symptoms diminish or resolve.
Presence of diseases or conditions affecting adherence and prescription of therapy. Emphasize adherence to specific administration timing recommendations, such as taking oral semaglutide before any other oral medications and waiting for at least 30 min before other oral medications.
Adherence to recommended eating behaviors for patients with T2D (details reported in Table 1).

Conclusions

The growing recognition of GLP-1 RAs' advantages in international recommendations for T2D treatment emphasizes their early initiation in the disease's management. The efficacy and effectiveness of oral semaglutide in reducing HbA1c levels and body weight, coupled with its favorable clinical profile, positions it as an optimal choice for people with T2D.

The oral formulation provides an attractive therapeutic option for patients who may be more likely to use GLP-1 RA at an early stage of disease.

The importance of providing comprehensive education to individuals with T2D is established. This approach aims to empower the patient with information regarding the different aspects of available treatment options, including flexibility, complexity, route, and frequency of administration. By doing so, physicians can tailor the treatment regimen to patients' lifestyle and preferences. A fundamental component that guarantees optimal results involves, in particular, correct and complete information on potential side effects and the optimization of administration times. Educating patients on these aspects significantly contributes to improving adherence to therapeutic protocols, thus maximizing the benefits deriving from oral semaglutide.

Some degree of flexibility in the administration schedule of oral semaglutide would represent an opportunity that both physicians and patients could benefit from. We acknowledge there is quite limited evidence from trials or observational studies to strongly support alternative dosing times for oral semaglutide administration. This is an important evidence gap in the literature and we encourage new research on this topic. Although following an overnight fast should remain the standard timing of oral semaglutide administration, the flexibility option may allow patients to integrate diabetes treatment into their daily routine, potentially improving treatment adherence and overall glycemic control. At the same time, flexibility could help in minimizing GI adverse events. Ultimately, the emphasis on flexibility in oral semaglutide administration schedules would create a dynamic and collaborative therapeutic environment that is conducive to successful diabetes management.

This personalized approach acknowledges that a unique strategy may not be optimal for all patients and that tailoring treatment to individual circumstances and needs contributes to better overall outcomes. The use of this approach emphasizes the importance of patient engagement, education, and ongoing communication in a patient-centric model of care to ensure the successful integration of oral semaglutide into the daily lives of individuals managing T2D.

Persistence and Adherence to Therapy as Barriers to Optimal Care

The occurrence of GI side effects poses a potential challenge in garnering widespread patient acceptance of the medication and consequently it may result in suboptimal therapeutic adherence. This issue can limit the effectiveness of prescribed treatments, resulting in unmet treatment goals. In individuals with T2D, poor adherence and persistence represent barriers to achieving optimal care. Furthermore, the onset of GI complications could limit or interfere with the recommended dose escalation up to 14 mg, which represents the dosage for which the maximum effectiveness of the product is appreciated.

In the diabetes pharmacotherapy area, a systematic review assessed that only 56.2% of patients with T2D continued their treatments at 1 year post-initiation. Among the primary reasons reported for low adherence and persistence, the severity of adverse events was most common.

Overcoming these barriers becomes mandatory for diabetologists and healthcare providers. Efforts to address and manage GI side effects in the use of oral semaglutide, whether through patient education, proactive symptom management, or considering alternative strategies, are essential in promoting better patient tolerance and adherence to the prescribed medication regimen. By actively addressing and mitigating these challenges, healthcare professionals involved in diabetes care play a crucial role in ensuring that patients receive the full therapeutic benefits of the prescribed medication, contributing to more effective diabetes management and improved overall patient outcomes.

Need for Comprehensive Practical Guidance and Expert Insights

From clinical trials and observational data, oral semaglutide has proven to be an effective therapeutic approach to the management of patients with T2D. However, physicians face various practical questions that cannot be answered by guidelines or recently published clinical trials or observational studies results.

This article aims to provide practical guidance on the use of oral semaglutide to optimize therapeutic effects, while minimizing possible GI effects. A group of experts discuss and generate insights into these topics to try to fill the gaps that have been found in the use of the agent in conditions of normal clinical practice. It is a commentary based on the expert opinion and clinical experience of the authors. It does not involve new studies with human participants performed by any of the authors.

Topics included the effectiveness of oral semaglutide in clinical practice, the positioning of oral semaglutide to optimize the treatment benefits, critical issues encountered, the role of patient communication and information in the importance of dose escalation and management of adverse events.

### Real-world evidence on oral semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes. A narrative review for clinical practice [^114obvyv]. Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Oral semaglutide is the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) available for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management, whose effectiveness and tolerability have extensively been demonstrated in the PIONEER clinical trial program. Nevertheless, data from real-world are crucial to evaluate treatment performance under routine care. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize available evidence regarding real-world utilization patterns of oral semaglutide, and discuss efficacy, safety, and dosing regimen data in routine scenarios.

Methods

We searched PubMed for real-world studies evaluating oral semaglutide up to August 2024, and specific search terms were: "oral semaglutide", and "real-world studies" or "observational studies" or "retrospective studies".

Findings

19 real-world studies were included in the narrative review. In real-world settings, oral semaglutide provided significant glycemic (median HbA1c reduction at 6 months of 1%) and weight (median body weight reduction of 2 to 3 kg) benefits across the spectrum of T2DM, aligning with pre-clinical evidence from the PIONEER program. No new tolerability and safety issue has emerged from oral semaglutide administration in routine clinical practice.

Implications

Oral semaglutide constitutes an effective and safe option for T2DM management, and its increased acceptance has the potential to favor the early introduction of GLP-1RAs along the disease course. Nevertheless, continuous evaluation of real-world data is critical to better define the optimal positioning of oral semaglutide along T2DM trajectory and fully exploit its potential in everyday clinical practice.

### Oral semaglutide at a dose of 25 mg in adults with overweight or obesity [^114DdbUM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Oral semaglutide at a dose of 25 mg may provide an alternative treatment option to injectable semaglutide (2.4 mg) and higher-dose oral semaglutide (50 mg) for persons with overweight or obesity.

Methods

In a 71-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 22 sites in four countries, we enrolled persons without diabetes who had a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or higher or a BMI of 27 or higher with at least one obesity-related complication. The participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive oral semaglutide (25 mg) or placebo once daily, plus lifestyle interventions. The coprimary end points at week 64 were the percent change in body weight and a reduction of 5% or more in body weight; confirmatory secondary end points included reductions in body weight of 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more and the change in the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite Clinical Trials Version (IWQOL-Lite-CT) Physical Function score.

Results

A total of 205 participants were randomly assigned to receive oral semaglutide, and 102 to receive placebo. The estimated mean change in body weight from baseline to week 64 was -13.6% in the oral semaglutide group and -2.2% in the placebo group (estimated difference, -11.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -13.9 to -9.0; P < 0.001). Participants in the oral semaglutide group were significantly more likely than those in the placebo group to have body-weight reductions of 5% or more, 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more (P < 0.001 for all comparisons) and to have an improved IWQOL-Lite-CT Physical Function score (P < 0.001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with oral semaglutide than with placebo (74.0% vs. 42.2%).

Conclusions

Oral semaglutide at a dose of 25 mg once daily resulted in a greater mean reduction in body weight than placebo in participants with overweight or obesity. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; OASIS 4 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05564117.).

### Effect of various dosing conditions on the pharmacokinetics of oral semaglutide, a human glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue in a tablet formulation [^117Ct2ic]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

There were no unexpected safety findings in the two trials, and the safety profile of oral semaglutide was consistent with the GLP-1 RA drug class. The slightly higher number of AEs in the dosing conditions trial compared with the food-effect trial, particularly gastrointestinal AEs, may be explained by the difference in dosing regimen between the two trials. In the dosing conditions trial, subjects received 10 mg oral semaglutide on all 10 days of treatment. On the basis of learnings from that trial, the oral semaglutide dose in the subsequent food-effect trial was gradually increased from 5 mg during the first 5 days to 10 mg during the last 5 days to mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal AEs. Stepwise dose escalation was also applied in the phase 2 and 3 trials with oral semaglutide, leading to fewer events of nausea.

A strength of the two trial designs was that several different dosing conditions were tested in a controlled setting, thereby gaining a better understanding of potential food–drug interactions for oral semaglutide in order to establish acceptable dosing instructions for oral semaglutide. Another strength was that all doses of oral semaglutide were administered at the clinic, thereby optimising compliance to the specified dosing conditions.

A limitation of the current trials is that translation to clinical practice should be made with caution, as is always the case for results obtained in an experimental setting. Another limitation is that the pharmacokinetic assessments on the 10th day of dosing in the current trials do not fully reflect the steady-state situation achieved with continuous once-daily dosing in the clinical setting because of the long half-life of approximately 1 week for oral semaglutide. On the other hand, regulatory guidelines recommend that the effect of food is investigated in a single-dose trial. This option, however, would not be feasible for oral semaglutide because of the degree of within-subject day-to-day variability in absorption. During once-daily dosing of oral semaglutide, the within-subject day-to-day variability in exposure is reduced owing to overlapping exposure from sequential daily administrations as a result of the long half-life of oral semaglutide. Thus, 10 days of dosing in a parallel-group design as done in the two current trials was assessed to be the best possible compromise considering both clinical feasibility and regulatory guideline recommendations.

Standard Recommended Dosing Schedule

Prescribing information instructs taking oral semaglutide in the fasting state, followed by a post-dose fasting period of at least 30 min. This standardized recommendation is based on the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug and is designed to optimize its absorption through the gastric mucosa. Pre-dose fasting is required to protect the drugs from enzymatic degradation, while waiting less than 30 min to eat or drink after semaglutide dosing may decrease absorption due to dilution. Taking other oral medications within 30 min after semaglutide dosing may affect exposure to both semaglutide and the concomitantly administered medication. This may be particularly relevant for levothyroxine, which needs to be taken 30 min before breakfast itself. On the other side, the semaglutide exposure is not expected to be significantly modified by the pre-existence of upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract disease or symptoms. Though GI side effects may be more common among patients with as compared to those without pre-existing upper GI tract disease, concomitant treatment with oral semaglutide and proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole) does not significantly modify semaglutide exposure.

A pharmacokinetic study performed among healthy subjects explored various dosing schedules and found that the duration of pre-dose fasting is more important than the duration of post-dose fasting to ensure appropriate semaglutide exposure. Despite these data support dosing of oral semaglutide in accordance with prescribing information in the fasting state, it remains unclear to what extent these data obtained in healthy individuals translate into clinical benefits for people with T2D.

### Oral semaglutide: dosage in special situations [^112PdKXe]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Need for Urgency in Glucose Control

The prescribing information for oral semaglutide mentions that dose escalation should be done after 1 month. This advice is aimed at minimizing gastrointestinal symptoms and maximizing patient comfort.

There may be situations, however, where patients need urgent glucose control, to resolve symptoms, comorbidities, or complications of diabetes. Others may be concerned about their glucose levels, and may ask for early control.

If such people demonstrate good gastrointestinal tolerance to the 3 mg or 7 mg dose of semaglutide, one may consider dose up-titration after 10 or 20 days of therapy. Patients must be counseled about the possibility of transient symptoms, and how to mitigate them.

Tolerability

In routine clinical practice, there exists the need to promptly offer viable alternatives to manage and mitigate potential side effects associated with glucose-lowering agents.

Although GI side effects associated with the use of oral semaglutide are limited, they may prompt some patients to discontinue the medication, with consequent rapid resolution of GI effects. It should, however, be noted, that the rate of treatment discontinuation in the experience of participating experts is in line with that of the GLP-1 RA class.

Authors highlighted the need in their clinical practice to have viable approaches to mitigate side GI effects to suggest the patient. Some of these approaches, despite not currently being listed in the summary of product characteristics, can effectively mitigate the occurrence and severity of adverse effects, notably enhancing patients' adherence to treatment and persistence.

Management of GI Events to Benefit the Efficacy of Oral Semaglutide

Clinical Experience with Oral Semaglutide

Clinical experience with the use of oral semaglutide highlighted a reduction in efficacy attributed to inadvertent errors patients make in drug dosing and administration. This led clinicians to search for more flexible approaches in managing therapy with this novel glucose-lowering agent, aiming to maintain effectiveness, without compromising quality of life and ensuring adherence and compliance to the treatment regimen. This flexibility in administration aims to enhance treatment adherence by accommodating individual lifestyles and preferences. Case reports in the Supplementary Material exemplify the possibility of more flexible approaches in the timing of administration.

Evidence from GLIMPLES Study

An analysis of data from 166 patients treated with oral semaglutide and described in the GLIMPLES study provides some support to the feasibility of an alternative dosing schedule. There were 143 participants who took the drug before breakfast and 23 participants (13.9%) who took the drug at other timings (before lunch and before dinner) since their treatment initiation. They were always advised to fast 4–5 h before dosing and at least 30 min after dosing. We calculated HbA1c nadir during up to 18 months of treatment in the two groups. In these participants, HbA1c significantly declined by 0.8% from a baseline value of 8.1% (Fig. 1). These findings suggest that the effectiveness of oral semaglutide in reducing HbA1c levels was preserved in individuals who took the drug at times other than the morning fast, provided that a pre- and post-dose fasting was respected.

### Efficacy and safety of once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg and 50 mg compared with 14 mg in adults with type 2 diabetes (PIONEER PLUS): a multicentre, randomised, phase 3b trial [^1155p2iq]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Once-daily oral semaglutide is an effective type 2 diabetes treatment. We aimed to investigate a new formulation of oral semaglutide at higher investigational doses versus the approved 14 mg dose in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This global, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 3b trial, carried out at 177 sites in 14 countries, enrolled adults with type 2 diabetes, glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) 8.0–10.5% (64–91 mmol/mol), a BMI of 25.0 kg/m² or greater, receiving stable daily doses of one to three oral glucose-lowering drugs. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1), by means of an interactive web response system, to once-daily oral semaglutide 14 mg, 25 mg, or 50 mg for 68 weeks. Investigators, site personnel, trial participants, and trial sponsor staff were masked to dose assignment throughout the trial. The primary endpoint was change in HbA 1c from baseline to week 52, evaluated with a treatment policy estimand in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of trial drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04707469, and the European Clinical Trials register, EudraCT 2020–000299–39, and is complete.

Findings

Between Jan 15 and Sept 29, 2021, of 2294 people screened, 1606 (n = 936 [58.3%] male; n = 670 [41.7%] female; mean [SD] age 58.2 [10.8] years) received oral semaglutide 14 mg (n = 536), 25 mg (n = 535), or 50 mg (n = 535). At baseline, mean (SD) HbA 1c was 9.0% (0.8; 74.4 mmol/L [SD 8.3]) and mean bodyweight was 96.4 kg (21.6). Mean changes (SE) in HbA 1c at week 52 were -1.5 percentage points (SE 0.05) with oral semaglutide 14 mg, -1.8 percentage points (0.06) with 25 mg (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.27, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.12; p = 0.0006), and -2.0 percentage points (0.06) with 50 mg (ETD -0.53, -0.68 to -0.38; p < 0.0001). Adverse events were reported by 404 (76%) participants in the oral semaglutide 14 mg group, 422 (79%) in the 25 mg group, and 428 (80%) in the 50 mg group. Gastrointestinal disorders, which were mostly mild to moderate, occurred more frequently with oral semaglutide 25 mg and 50 mg than with 14 mg. Ten deaths occurred during the trial; none were judged to be treatment related.

Interpretation

Oral semaglutide 25 mg and 50 mg were superior to 14 mg in reducing HbA 1c and bodyweight in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes. No new safety concerns were identified.

### Oral semaglutide: the first-available noninjectable glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist [^112KyZ6K]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

There are roughly 30 million Americans diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM), with nearly 95% of these cases being type 2 (T2)-DM. The American Diabetes Association continues to recommend metformin as the first-line initial treatment of T2DM, in combination with lifestyle modifications; yet, many require multiple therapies to achieve adequate glycemic control. In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, adding a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist is a preferred treatment option; however, many patients are apprehensive about injecting medications. Semaglutide is the first oral option in this life-saving medication class. The purpose of this article was to review the pharmacology, clinical trials, safety profile, along with recommended dosing and costs, of oral semaglutide used for managing patients with T2DM.

Methods

A search through the PubMed, MEDLINE and Cochrane libraries was conducted for literature published from January 2017 through December 2020, using the key word semaglutide. Articles were selected if they were related to the approval of oral semaglutide or provided novel clinical information regarding this drug entity in its oral dosage formulation.

Findings

Three Phase II studies of the pharmacokinetic properties and Phase III trials from the PIONEER series were ultimately selected, as these trials were thought to provide pivotal information to the US Food and Drug Administration for the approval of oral semaglutide.

Implications

On review of the literature, it appeared that semaglutide is a viable option in treating T2DM. The use of this medication has been associated with glycosylated hemoglobin lowering similar to that with the injectable medication in its same class. Semaglutide was also showed some potential in preventing cardiovascular events as well as increasing weight loss.

Conclusions

On the basis of the combined results of the current food-effect and dosing conditions trials with oral semaglutide, it is concluded that administration of oral semaglutide in the fasting state with up to 120 mL water and at least 30 min post-dose fasting results in clinically relevant semaglutide plasma exposure. These dosing recommendations were implemented in the phase 3 clinical development programme for oral semaglutide and are part of the approved label.

### Effect of various dosing conditions on the pharmacokinetics of oral semaglutide, a human glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue in a tablet formulation [^113un5YZ]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

The overall purpose of the current investigation was to establish dosing recommendations for oral semaglutide to ensure clinically relevant semaglutide exposure with an acceptable safety profile without compromising compliance in patients' daily life. Results from two consecutive trials are presented demonstrating how the pharmacokinetics of oral semaglutide are affected (1) by different combinations of water volume with dosing and duration of post-dose fasting (the dosing conditions trial) and (2) by dosing in the fed state (the food-effect trial). In the food-effect trial, two of the investigated dosing conditions (fed and fasting) were according to guidelines on the investigation of food effect, while a third arm (reference) was included in which dosing conditions reflected those used in the oral semaglutide phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.

### Effect of various dosing conditions on the pharmacokinetics of oral semaglutide, a human glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue in a tablet formulation [^113hB8GC]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oral semaglutide is a novel tablet formulation of the human glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue semaglutide. In two trials, the effects of prior food ingestion (food effect), post-dose fasting period and water volume with dosing (dosing conditions) on oral semaglutide pharmacokinetics were investigated.

Methods

Subjects received once-daily oral semaglutide for 10 days. In the food-effect trial, 78 healthy subjects were randomised 1:1:1 to fed (meal 30 min pre-dose; 240 mL water with dosing), fasting (overnight until 4 h post-dose; 240 mL) or reference (fasting overnight until 30 min post-dose; 120 mL) arms. In the dosing conditions trial, 161 healthy men were randomised into eight dosing groups (overnight fasted with 50/120 mL water and 15/30/60/120 min post-dose fasting). Semaglutide plasma concentrations were measured frequently until 504 h after the 10th dose.

Results

In the food-effect trial, limited or no measurable semaglutide exposure was observed in the fed arm, while all subjects in the fasting arm had measurable semaglutide exposure. Area under the semaglutide concentration–time curve (AUC 0–24h, semaglutide, day10) and maximum semaglutide concentration (C max, semaglutide, day10) were numerically greater by approximately 40% for the fasting versus reference arm (p = 0.082 and p = 0.080, respectively). In the dosing conditions trial, AUC 0–24h, semaglutide, day10 and C max, semaglutide, day10 were not different between water volumes (p = 0.541 and p = 0.676), but increased with longer post-dose fasting (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Administration of oral semaglutide in the fasting state with up to 120 mL water and at least 30 min post-dose fasting results in clinically relevant semaglutide exposure. These dosing conditions have been used in the oral semaglutide phase 3 trials and are part of the approved label.

Sudden Change in Medical Status

If a person on oral semaglutide experiences sudden change in medical status, an individualized decision should be taken regarding continuation of therapy. Patients who are able to eat and hydrate themselves well, and have stable hepatorenal function, should continue the drug. Those who are unable to eat properly, have vomiting or diarrhea, or are admitted to intensive care will require discontinuation of GLP1RA, and may benefit from short-term insulin therapy.

Such decisions must be based upon a comprehensive assessment of the patient's needs, and should be revised on a regular basis.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide and the effect of switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 52-week, randomized, open-label extension of the PIONEER 7 trial [^114BCeHK]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Overall event rates of malignant neoplasms were similar to those in the much larger PIONEER 6 study, which reported rates of EAC-confirmed malignant neoplasms of 2.5 and 2.9 per 100 patient-years in the oral semaglutide and placebo groups, respectively (median follow-up of 15.9 months). The frequency of EAC-confirmed malignant neoplasms over 78 weeks of treatment was also similar with oral semaglutide and sitagliptin in the long-term safety trial, PIONEER 3. A meta-analysis including 3446 patients treated with subcutaneous semaglutide for up to 104 weeks and 419 patients treated with oral semaglutide for 26 weeks concluded that there was no increased risk of malignant neoplasms with semaglutide when compared with placebo or other glucose-lowering treatments (OR (95% CI) 0.89 (0.35 to 2.22); p = 0.80). Consistent with other studies of oral semaglutide, no clustering of malignancies to specific organ systems was observed.

The key strengths of this study include the flexible nature of the dosing regimen for oral semaglutide, which aids relevance for clinical practice, the long-term follow-up, the high treatment completion and trial completion rates for the extension phase, and the low amount of missing data. Our study also has some limitations, in addition to its open-label nature. First, as highlighted earlier, the relatively low HbA 1c at week 52 and dose-escalation criteria for oral semaglutide limited the ability to evaluate the relative HbA 1c -lowering efficacy of switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide. When designing the extension, the main phase was ongoing and the mean HbA 1c levels at the beginning of the extension were not known. Second, the number of patients who continued into the extension phase was relatively small, particularly in the switch part, limiting the ability to assess the incidence of infrequent side effects. This also resulted in a low power for the confirmatory endpoints in the switch part.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that long-term use of oral semaglutide with flexible dose adjustment results in durable improvements in glycemic control and further reductions in body weight and is generally well tolerated. Switching from sitagliptin to flexible dose-adjusted oral semaglutide maintained HbA 1c reductions, with less need for additional treatment intensification, and offers the potential for additional reductions in body weight, but is associated with an increase in gastrointestinal events.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide and the effect of switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 52-week, randomized, open-label extension of the PIONEER 7 trial [^115C3hPf]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Many patients had HbA 1c approaching or below the treatment target at the start of the switch part (week 52), with HbA 1c ≤ 7.5% in nearly two-thirds of patients. This may have limited the potential for further HbA 1c reductions with oral semaglutide, given the trial was designed for the achievement of glycemic control (HbA 1c < 7.0%), not to maximize HbA 1c reduction, and as the flexible dose regimen for oral semaglutide required HbA 1c to be ≥ 7.0% for dose escalation. However, despite this, 30.4% of patients rerandomized to oral semaglutide achieved HbA 1c ≤ 6.5% at week 104, compared with 11.5% of sitagliptin-treated patients. A third of patients who were on-treatment at week 104 were not receiving the highest (14 mg) dose of oral semaglutide. Those patients who required escalation to 14 mg appeared to have a smaller mean decrease in HbA 1c; however, it is unknown whether this may have been related to baseline HbA 1c status, reduced compliance with treatment, interindividual variability in response to oral semaglutide or some other factor. Among subgroups of patients with higher baseline HbA 1c levels, greater HbA 1c reductions were seen in both treatment groups; however, this post-hoc assessment was only conducted in a small number of patients and was not analyzed statistically.

3.3 Comparators, doses and treatment duration

Doses of oral semaglutide at 3, 7 and 14 mg were tested in the PIONEER programme (Table 1). To mitigate potential GI side effects, all patients randomized to oral semaglutide started treatment at the 3 mg dose, after which the dose was escalated in 4‐week increments to 7 mg and then 14 mg, until the randomized dose was achieved.

In PIONEER 1, oral semaglutide 3, 7 and 14 mg once daily were compared with placebo for 26 weeks in patients with early T2D managed by diet and exercise. 35 In PIONEER 2‐4, once‐daily oral semaglutide was compared with the SGLT2i empagliflozin (25 mg once daily), the DPP4 inhibitor sitagliptin (100 mg once daily) and the subcutaneous GLP‐1RA liraglutide (1.8 mg once daily) for either 52 or 78 weeks in patients with T2D who were already receiving one or two oral glucose‐lowering drugs. 36, 37, 38 In PIONEER 7, flexible dose adjustment of oral semaglutide (where each individual patient's daily dose could be increased or decreased between 3, 7 or 14 mg dependent on glycaemic efficacy and GI tolerability) was compared with 100 mg sitagliptin for 52 weeks. 41

Patients in PIONEER 5, 6 and 8 had T2D of 14‐15 years' duration and received oral semaglutide or placebo added on to background medication. 39, 40, 42 In PIONEER 8, patients were all taking insulin, the dose of which was recommended to be reduced by 20% at randomization, after which it could be raised between weeks 8 and 26, without exceeding the pre‐randomization dosage, and was freely adjustable after week 26. 42 Patients in PIONEER 5 had moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30‐59 mL/min/1.73 m²). 39 PIONEER 6 was an event‐driven, placebo‐controlled CV outcomes study designed to demonstrate the CV safety of oral semaglutide 14 mg once daily in patients with established T2D and CVD, CKD or CV risk factors. 40

The two Japanese trials tested oral semaglutide monotherapy compared with placebo or liraglutide (PIONEER 9), 43 and oral semaglutide compared with dulaglutide in patients receiving stable doses of background oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) (PIONEER 10). 44

### Effect of oral semaglutide compared with placebo and subcutaneous semaglutide on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial [^113AJnGt]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and are all currently available as an injection.

Objectives

To compare the effects of oral semaglutide with placebo (primary) and open-label subcutaneous semaglutide (secondary) on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, dosage-finding, 26-week trial with 5-week follow-up at 100 sites (hospital clinics, general practices, and clinical research centers) in 14 countries conducted between December 2013 and December 2014. Of 1106 participants assessed, 632 with type 2 diabetes and insufficient glycemic control using diet and exercise alone or a stable dose of metformin were randomized. Randomization was stratified by metformin use.

Interventions

Once-daily oral semaglutide of 2.5 mg (n = 70), 5 mg (n = 70), 10 mg (n = 70), 20 mg (n = 70), 40-mg 4-week dose escalation (standard escalation; n = 71), 40-mg 8-week dose escalation (slow escalation; n = 70), 40-mg 2-week dose escalation (fast escalation, n = 70), oral placebo (n = 71; double-blind) or once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide of 1.0 mg (n = 70) for 26 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to week 26. Secondary end points included change from baseline in body weight and adverse events.

Results

Baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment groups. Of the 632 randomized patients (mean age, 57.1 years [SD, 10.6]; men, 395 (62.7%); diabetes duration, 6.3 years [SD, 5.2]; body weight, 92.3 kg [SD, 16.8]; BMI, 31.7 [SD, 4.3]), 583 (92%) completed the trial. Mean change in HbA1c level from baseline to week 26 decreased with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, -0.7% to -1.9%) and subcutaneous semaglutide (-1.9%) and placebo (-0.3%); oral semaglutide reductions were significant vs placebo (dosage-dependent estimated treatment difference [ETD] range for oral semaglutide vs placebo, -0.4% to -1.6%; p = 0.01 for 2.5 mg, < .001 for all other dosages). Reductions in body weight were greater with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, -2.1 kg to -6.9 kg) and subcutaneous semaglutide (-6.4 kg) vs placebo (-1.2 kg), and significant for oral semaglutide dosages of 10 mg or more vs placebo (dosage-dependent ETD range, -0.9 to -5.7 kg; P < .001). Adverse events were reported by 63% to 86% (371 of 490 patients) in the oral semaglutide groups, 81% (56 of 69 patients) in the subcutaneous semaglutide group, and 68% (48 of 71 patients) in the placebo group; mild to moderate gastrointestinal events were most common.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with type 2 diabetes, oral semaglutide resulted in better glycemic control than placebo over 26 weeks. These findings support phase 3 studies to assess longer-term and clinical outcomes, as well as safety.

### High-dose once-weekly semaglutide: a new option for obesity management [^116HD88u]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide for chronic weight management.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched (inception to September 8, 2021) using keywords "semaglutide" and "obesity", "weight", "high dose", "high-dose", or "2.4".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials with published results were included. Publications studying the oral or < 2.4 mg formulation of semaglutide were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Four phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trials demonstrated efficacy of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide compared with placebo for weight loss. Study populations included patients with overweight or obesity (STEP 1, STEP 3, and STEP 4) or patients with diabetes and with overweight or obesity (STEP 2). Lifestyle interventions for diet and exercise were included for all participants. Weight loss from baseline was significant for all studies, and secondary outcomes demonstrated cardiometabolic improvements including waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and lipid profiles. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, but the medication was otherwise well tolerated.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

High-dose semaglutide offers significant weight-lowering potential and favorable effects on cardiometabolic risk factors and glycemic indices. Clinicians and patients should consider the route and frequency of administration, adverse effect profile, and cost when choosing an antiobesity medication. The importance of concomitant lifestyle interventions should be emphasized.

Conclusions

High-dose once-weekly semaglutide can significantly reduce weight, and although gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, it is generally well tolerated.

### Insights into the early use of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice: the IGNITE study [^112e2sid]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

In total, 34% of patients had no prescription for the 3 mg starting dose. This could be attributable to switching from another GLP‐1 RA, which permits initiation at a higher dose, or to patients receiving oral semaglutide samples, which were not captured in this dataset. The latter possibility would cause underestimation of changes in HbA1c from baseline because initiation of oral semaglutide for these patients would be earlier than the recorded index date. It is also notable that HbA1c reductions were observed, even though 26.1% of this cohort did not have a dose escalation beyond the initial 3 mg dose, indicating that further improvements might be achieved with escalation to the highest recommended dose of 14 mg. This is supported by the results of the PIONEER 7 trial, a flexible dosing study comparing oral semaglutide with sitagliptin 100 mg. All patients initiated the 3 mg dose of oral semaglutide, with the potential for dose adjustment to 7 or 14 mg at subsequent eight‐weekly intervals, based on HbA1c and gastrointestinal tolerability. Overall, 59% of patients on oral semaglutide at week 52 were receiving the 14 mg dose, 30% were receiving 7 mg and only 9% were receiving 3 mg. Overall, mean HbA1c reduction in the oral semaglutide group at this time point was −1.3% (standard error [SE]: 0.1) for the treatment policy estimand and −1.4% (SE: 0.1) for the trial product estimand. Although it is not possible to gather comprehensive information on the rationale underlying clinical decision‐making in a retrospective study, the fact that some patients in the current study received prescriptions only for the 3 mg initial dose may indicate an opportunity for education on dose escalation in the clinical care setting. Finally, the higher HbA1c reductions observed for patients with higher baseline HbA1c levels are consistent with data from the PIONEER programme highlighting the glycaemic benefit of oral semaglutide against comparators, across the full range of baseline HbA1c.

### Suitability and usefulness of a flexible dosing timing of oral semaglutide to maximize benefit in clinical practice: an expert panel [^1123pGX8]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

PIONEER 3 was a randomized double-blind trial that compared the efficacy of oral semaglutide vs. sitagliptin in patients with T2D not controlled on metformin with or without sulfonylurea. Among 1864 randomized patients, over 26 weeks, mean HbA1c changes from baseline were estimated as − 0.6%, − 1.0%, and − 1.3% for semaglutide at doses of 3, 7, and 14 mg/day, respectively, and − 0.8% for sitagliptin. Both 7 and 14 mg/day doses achieved statistically significant greater reduction in HbA1c when compared to sitagliptin (− 0.3% [95% CI − 0.4% to − 0.1%] and − 0.5% [95% CI − 0.6% to − 0.4%], respectively). Also, mean body weight changes from baseline were estimated as − 1.2, − 2.2, and − 3.1 kg for semaglutide 3, 7, and 14 mg/day, respectively, and − 0.6 kg for sitagliptin. A statistically significant greater reduction in body weight compared to sitagliptin was obtained (− 1.6 kg [95% CI − 2.0 to − 1.1 kg] and − 2.5 kg [95% CI − 3.0 to − 2.0 kg], for semaglutide 7 and 14 mg/day respectively). Furthermore, in both the 7 mg/day and 14 mg/day semaglutide groups, a significantly higher percentage of patients attained the composite outcome of achieving HbA1c levels below 7.0%, without experiencing hypoglycemia or weight gain, compared to the sitagliptin group (estimated treatment difference [ETD] 14%, 95% CI 8–14 for semaglutide 7 mg/day; ETD 26%, 95% CI 20–32 for semaglutide 14 mg/day).

Overview of Evidence from Clinical Trials on Efficacy of Oral Semaglutide

The efficacy of oral semaglutide was widely assessed in the PIONEER (Peptide InnOvatioN for Early diabEtes tReatment) program of 10 RCTs, which included more than 9500 patients and examined the use of oral semaglutide in different phases of T2D, on various background therapies. Oral semaglutide showed significant improvements in glycemic control and weight reduction versus various comparators.

As for the comparison of oral semaglutide with other oral agents, in the PIONEER 2 open-label trial, oral semaglutide (14 mg once daily) was evaluated against the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) empagliflozin (25 mg once daily) for 52 weeks in 822 patients with T2D uncontrolled on metformin with a mean HbA1c level of 8.1%. Semaglutide was superior to empagliflozin in reducing HbA1c (− 1.3% vs. − 0.8%; p < 0.001) and body weight (− 4.7 kg vs. − 3.8 kg; p = 0.01) after 52 weeks of treatment. Moreover, a higher number of patients reached the composite endpoint (HbA1c < 7% without severe or symptomatic hypoglycemia and no weight gain) with oral semaglutide compared to empagliflozin. The likelihood of achieving this endpoint was significantly greater with oral semaglutide (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.50–2.74).

Persons on Once-Weekly GLP1RA

People who switch from once-weekly exenatide, dulaglutide, or semaglutide should start oral semaglutide 7 days after their last injection. Similar principles, as detailed above, apply to the choice of dose of initiation. A prescription of oral semaglutide that is started in response to lack of tolerability should begin with 3 mg daily. However, if oral semaglutide is chosen owing to lack of efficacy of current therapy, one may commence with 7 mg/day.

Once-weekly semaglutide has been compared with oral semaglutide, i.e. 0.5 mg once-weekly semaglutide with 7 mg of oral semaglutide. However, the difference in the impact on weight should be explained to the patient.

Discussion

Treatment guidelines for T2D highlight the need for an individualized approach, and in clinical practice doses of therapeutic agents are frequently adjusted to achieve optimum results. The main phase of the PIONEER 7 study demonstrated that oral semaglutide dosing can be individualized, and that it is able to provide greater benefits to patients than sitagliptin. This long-term, open-label extension builds on these results, with the durability part representing the longest follow-up reported to date for oral semaglutide. Continued flexible dosing of oral semaglutide maintained reductions in HbA 1c and rates of achievement of HbA 1c goals, and resulted in further reductions in body weight over 104 weeks, while remaining well tolerated with no new safety signals. As expected for a GLP-1RA, and consistent with other trials from the PIONEER program, gastrointestinal events were the most frequently reported AEs with oral semaglutide and the AEs that most often resulted in premature discontinuation. However, the majority of these AEs occurred in the early part of the main phase, and only one patient discontinued due to an AE in the second year of the durability part, indicating that discontinuations due to gastrointestinal AEs with oral semaglutide are likely to occur early on in treatment (during the initial dose-escalation phase) and not with long-term use.

Oral semaglutide is the first glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) formulated for oral administration and approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide in patients with T2D were demonstrated in the global PIONEER phase 3a program, in which oral semaglutide was reported to reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) and body weight compared with placebo and several commonly used glucose-lowering drugs.

Most PIONEER trials assessed oral semaglutide at fixed once-daily doses of 3, 7, or 14 mg, with initial dose escalation. However, in clinical practice, doses may be adjusted, and in the PIONEER 7 trial oral semaglutide was flexibly dosed (3, 7, or 14 mg once daily) on the basis of efficacy (HbA 1c target < 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol)) and tolerability criteria. During the 52-week main phase of the trial, once-daily oral semaglutide with flexible dose adjustment provided superior glycemic control and weight loss compared with the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, sitagliptin (100 mg once daily).GLP-1RAs stimulate GLP-1 receptors and mimic the effects of GLP-1, while DPP-4 inhibitors potentiate the effects of endogenously secreted GLP-1 by preventing its degradation.

The extension phase of PIONEER 7, reported here, had two aims: to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide with flexible dose adjustment; and to evaluate the efficacy and safety when switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide with flexible dose adjustment compared with continued sitagliptin.

Introduction

The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide is approved as an oral formulation for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. This study aimed to confirm bioequivalence between a new, second-generation (2G) oral semaglutide formulation (1.5, 4 and 9 mg) and the initially approved first-generation (1G) formulation (3, 7 and 14 mg).

Methods

This was a randomised, multicentre, open-label, full replicate crossover study to confirm bioequivalence between 2G and 1G oral semaglutide formulations at steady-state (SS) in healthy participants (NCT05227196). Participants were recruited to three groups. In each group, participants were randomised to one of two alternating sequences comparing once-daily oral semaglutide treatment of 9 and 14 mg (group 1), 4 and 7 mg (group 2) or 1.5 and 3 mg (group 3) at SS. Treatment duration was 20 weeks, comprising four 5-week steady-state periods on alternating formulations. Repeated 24-h blood sampling at the end of each steady-state period supported pharmacokinetic analysis. Co-primary endpoints were area under the semaglutide plasma concentration–time curve during a dosing interval at SS (AUC 0–24h, SS) and maximum semaglutide plasma concentration at SS (C max, 0–24h, SS). Bioequivalence for co-primary endpoints was assessed using European Medicines Agency (EMA), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) criteria. Safety was monitored.

Results

A total of 222, 201 and 123 participants were recruited into groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The prespecified EMA, FDA and PMDA bioequivalence criteria were met for 2G versus 1G oral semaglutide for all three dose levels (1.5 vs 3 mg, 4 vs 7 mg and 9 vs 14 mg). The safety profile of 2G oral semaglutide was consistent with 1G oral semaglutide.

Conclusions

The 2G oral semaglutide formulation was confirmed as bioequivalent to 1G oral semaglutide, with no new safety concerns identified.

Dosing and Administration

Currently orally administered semaglutide is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency, Health Canada, Australia and Japan as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with T2DM. It is available as 3, 7 and 14 mg oral tablet formulations.
Orally administered semaglutide should be taken on an empty stomach.
Orally administered semaglutide should be swallowed whole with up to half a glass of water equivalent to 120 mL.
Do not split, crush or chew the tablet. Wait at least 30 min before the first meal or drink of the day or taking other oral medicinal products. Waiting less than 30 min may decrease the absorption of semaglutide.

If a dose is missed, the missed dose should be skipped, and the next dose should be taken the following day. Patient counselling on the administration of the drug is crucial for the effectiveness of orally administered semaglutide.

### Oral semaglutide: dosage in special situations [^113AfdKZ]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) have recently gained momentum after the introduction of semaglutide, the first oral molecule in their class. In a recent article in this journal by Evans et al., a succinct overview of the utility of semaglutide is highlighted in the context of virtual diabetes care. To take this discussion further, this commentary describes the value and positioning of oral semaglutide in common clinical situations. Its insights assist in pragmatic placement of this drug in clinical practice. Special emphasis is laid on the use of oral semaglutide in persons already on injectable GLP-1RA formulations, those experiencing sudden changes in life style pattern due to religious, social, or professional commitments, individuals seeking help for urgent glycemic control, and those who face sudden change in their concomitant medications or comorbidities.

### Efficacy and safety of semaglutide compared with liraglutide and placebo for weight loss in patients with obesity: a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial [^113bU4Z9]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Obesity is a major public health issue, and new pharmaceuticals for weight management are needed. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide in comparison with liraglutide and a placebo in promoting weight loss.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, multicentre, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial. The study was done in eight countries involving 71 clinical sites. Eligible participants were adults (≥ 18 years) without diabetes and with a body-mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m² or more. We randomly assigned participants (6:1) to each active treatment group (ie, semaglutide [0.05 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, 0.3 mg, or 0.4 mg; initiated at 0.05 mg per day and incrementally escalated every 4 weeks] or liraglutide [3.0 mg; initiated at 0.6 mg per day and escalated by 0.6 mg per week]) or matching placebo group (equal injection volume and escalation schedule to active treatment group) using a block size of 56. All treatment doses were delivered once-daily via subcutaneous injections. Participants and investigators were masked to the assigned study treatment but not the target dose. The primary endpoint was percentage weight loss at week 52. The primary analysis was done using intention-to-treat ANCOVA estimation with missing data derived from the placebo pool. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02453711.

Findings

Between Oct 1, 2015, and Feb 11, 2016, 957 individuals were randomly assigned (102–103 participants per active treatment group and 136 in the pooled placebo group). Mean baseline characteristics included age 47 years, bodyweight 111.5 kg, and BMI 39.3 kg/m². Bodyweight data were available for 891 (93%) of 957 participants at week 52. Estimated mean weight loss was -2.3% for the placebo group versus -6.0% (0.05 mg), -8.6% (0.1 mg), -11.6% (0.2 mg), -11.2% (0.3 mg), and -13.8% (0.4 mg) for the semaglutide groups. All semaglutide groups versus placebo were significant (unadjusted p ≤ 0.0010), and remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing (p ≤ 0.0055). Mean bodyweight reductions for 0.2 mg or more of semaglutide versus liraglutide were all significant (-13.8% to -11.2% vs -7.8%). Estimated weight loss of 10% or more occurred in 10% of participants receiving placebo compared with 37–65% receiving 0.1 mg or more of semaglutide (p < 0.0001 vs placebo). All semaglutide doses were generally well tolerated, with no new safety concerns. The most common adverse events were dose-related gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily nausea, as seen previously with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Interpretation

In combination with dietary and physical activity counselling, semaglutide was well tolerated over 52 weeks and showed clinically relevant weight loss compared with placebo at all doses.

### Efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide with flexible dose adjustment versus sitagliptin in type 2 diabetes (PIONEER 7): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3a trial [^115vk3sB]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Background

Oral semaglutide is the first oral formulation of a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of flexible dose adjustments of oral semaglutide with sitagliptin 100 mg.

Methods

In this 52-week, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3a trial, we recruited patients with type 2 diabetes from 81 sites in ten countries. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older (19 years or older in South Korea), had type 2 diabetes (diagnosed ≥ 90 days before screening), HbA 1c of 7.5–9.5% (58–80 mmol/mol), and were inadequately controlled on stable daily doses of one or two oral glucose-lowering drugs (for 90 days or more before screening). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of an interactive web-response system, stratified by background glucose-lowering medication at screening, to oral semaglutide with flexible dose adjustments to 3, 7, or 14 mg once daily or sitagliptin 100 mg once daily. To approximate treatment individualisation in clinical practice, oral semaglutide dose could be adjusted on the basis of prespecified HbA 1c and tolerability criteria. Two efficacy-related estimands were prespecified: treatment policy (regardless of treatment discontinuation or use of rescue medication) and trial product (on treatment and without use of rescue medication) for participants randomly assigned to treatment. The primary endpoint was achievement of HbA 1c of less than 7% (53 mmol/mol) at week 52 and the confirmatory secondary efficacy endpoint was change in bodyweight from baseline to week 52. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02849080, and European Clinical Trials Database, EudraCT number 2015–005593–38, and an open-label extension is ongoing.

Findings

Between Sept 20, 2016, and Feb 7, 2017, of 804 patients assessed for eligibility, 504 were eligible and randomly assigned to oral semaglutide (n = 253) or sitagliptin (n = 251). Most participants were male (285 [57%] of 504) with a mean age of 57.4 years (SD 9.9). All participants were given at least one dose of their allocated study drug except for one participant in the sitagliptin group. From a mean baseline HbA 1c of 8.3% (SD 0.6%; 67 mmol/mol [SD 6.4]), a greater proportion of participants achieved an HbA 1c of less than 7% with oral semaglutide than did with sitagliptin (treatment policy estimand: 58% [134 of 230] vs 25% [60 of 238]; and trial product estimand: 63% [123 of 196] vs 28% [52 of 184]). The odds of achieving an HbA 1c of less than 7% was significantly better with oral semaglutide than sitagliptin (treatment policy estimand: odds ratio [OR] 4.40, 95% CI 2.89–6.70, p < 0.0001; and trial product estimand: 5.54, 3.54–8.68, p < 0.0001). The odds of decreasing mean bodyweight from baseline to week 52 were higher with oral semaglutide than with sitagliptin (estimated mean change in bodyweight, treatment policy estimand: -2.6 kg [SE 0.3] vs -0.7 kg [SE 0.2], estimated treatment difference [ETD] -1.9 kg, 95% CI -2.6 to -1.2; p < 0.0001; and trial product estimand: -2.9 kg [SE 0.3] vs -0.8 kg [SE 0.3], ETD -2.2 kg, -2.9 to -1.5; p < 0.0001). Adverse events occurred in 197 (78%) of 253 participants in the oral semaglutide group versus 172 (69%) of 250 in the sitagliptin group, and nausea was the most common adverse event with oral semaglutide (53 [21%]). Two deaths occurred in the sitagliptin group during the trial.

Interpretation

Oral semaglutide, with flexible dose adjustment, based on efficacy and tolerability, provided superior glycaemic control and weight loss compared with sitagliptin, and with a safety profile consistent with subcutaneous GLP-1 receptor agonists.

### Efficacy, safety and cardiovascular outcomes of once-daily oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: the PIONEER programme [^113FRiHV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

5 DISCUSSION

In the PIONEER programme, oral semaglutide was shown to be effective for glycaemic control across the spectrum of disease durations, background therapies and comorbidities (CVD/CKD) in patients with T2D. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 Although most trials analysed the primary outcome after 26 weeks, treatment continued in most of the global trials for 52 weeks (78 weeks in PIONEER 3 37), and HbA1c remained significantly better for oral semaglutide 7 and 14 mg versus comparators at these later times. 36, 37, 38, 41, 42, 43, 44 At least half of the patients treated with oral semaglutide 14 mg in any given trial had HbA1c below the ADA target of 7.0% at the end of treatment. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44 When dose adjustment of oral semaglutide was permitted to account for a need to improve glycaemic control or to alleviate side effects (PIONEER 7), 41 oral semaglutide was more effective than sitagliptin after 52 weeks, suggesting that such an approach, in which the dose can be adjusted per individual patient, may be beneficial in clinical practice. Only 9% of patients were not escalated to the 7 or 14 mg dose by week 52. 41 The results of an open‐label extension phase of PIONEER 7, during which patients continued with (or switched from sitagliptin to) flexible oral semaglutide dosing for a further 52 weeks, are due to be reported soon (NCT02849080).

### Effect of various dosing conditions on the pharmacokinetics of oral semaglutide, a human glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue in a tablet formulation [^115Xy4RL]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

The present pharmacokinetic results need to be weighed against patient convenience and adherence, especially as oral semaglutide is indicated for long-term once-daily dosing. Consequently, in phase 2 and 3 trials with oral semaglutide, the recommendation was to administer oral semaglutide in the fasting state with up to 120 mL water and wait at least 30 min post-dose before eating or taking any other oral medications. Using these recommendations, oral semaglutide treatment in subjects with type 2 diabetes resulted in improved glycaemic control and weight loss compared with placebo, empagliflozin and sitagliptin. As a note, the well-established drug levothyroxine for treatment of hypothyroidism is also conventionally taken in the fasting condition at least 30 min before breakfast to prevent that food intake negatively impairs the absorption. Thus, the recommended dosing conditions for oral semaglutide are not considered to pose an undue burden to the patients.

In the current trials, SNAC pharmacokinetic endpoints after administration of oral semaglutide in the fasted state were generally in accordance with a previous study investigating the pharmacokinetics after oral administration of ibandronate co-formulated with SNAC. While no effect of water volume with dosing on SNAC pharmacokinetics was observed, interestingly, SNAC exposure increased when shortening the post-dose fasting period from 120 to 30 min in the dosing conditions trial (Supplementary Fig. S7). This indicates that food can increase the absorption of SNAC, thereby potentially resulting in less SNAC being available to facilitate absorption of semaglutide at the site of absorption. The same clear pattern was, however, not observed in the food-effect trial, as SNAC exposure was not increased in the fed arm. In the food-effect trial, SNAC absorption also appeared to increase following the post-dose meal, particularly at the 4-h meal in the fed and fasting arms (Supplementary Fig. S4). This observation was less obvious in the dosing conditions trial probably because of less frequent pharmacokinetic sampling around the time of the post-dose meal (Supplementary Table 1).

Procedures

Both trials included a screening visit, a treatment period with 10 days of once-daily dosing of oral semaglutide tablets (co-formulated with 300 mg SNAC), a 21-day pharmacokinetic blood sampling period, and a follow-up visit (Fig. 1). Trial product administration occurred each morning at the clinic to ensure that dosing conditions were followed on all 10 dosing days.

In the food-effect trial, subjects were randomised into three groups: fed, fasting or reference. The oral semaglutide dose was escalated from 5 mg during the first 5 days to 10 mg during the last 5 days in order to mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs). In both the fed and fasting groups, subjects initiated an overnight fast at least 10 h before oral semaglutide dosing with 240 mL water. In the fed group, after the overnight fast, subjects consumed a high-caloric, high-fat breakfast (4058 kJ, 27 energy percent [E%] carbohydrate, 60 E% fat and 13 E% protein) within the last 30 min before dosing. In the fasting group, no pre-dose meal was served. In both the fed and fasting groups, dosing was followed by 4-h post-dose fasting after which a standardised post-dose meal (2335 kJ, 49 E% carbohydrate, 34 E% fat and 17 E% protein) was served. In the reference group, subjects fasted overnight for at least 6 h before oral semaglutide dosing with 120 mL water. This was followed by 30-min post-dose fasting after which a standardised breakfast (2335 kJ, 49 E% carbohydrate, 34 E% fat and 17 E% protein) was served. In all three groups, subjects were in an upright position during the first 30 min after dosing, and no further liquid was allowed from 2 h before dosing until 30 min (reference) or 4 h (fed and fasting) after dosing, with no subsequent restrictions on liquid or food ingestion until the next pre-dose fasting period.

### Oral semaglutide reduces hbAand body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of background glucose-lowering medication: PIONEER subgroup analyses [^117WSC75]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue that is the first and, thus far, only GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) to be formulated as a once-daily oral tablet for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). GLP-1RAs are generally recommended for patients with T2D whose glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) is above target despite diet, exercise and existing glucose-lowering medication, and GLP-1RAs with proven cardiovascular benefit are also recommended in patients with T2D at elevated cardiovascular risk, regardless of HbA 1c. Consequently, patients receiving oral semaglutide will typically already be receiving treatment with other glucose-lowering agents. It is therefore important to understand how the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide may vary based on the presence of concomitant treatments.

The efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide was investigated in the global phase 3a Peptide InnOvatioN for Early diabEtes tReatment (PIONEER) programme. The PIONEER 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 trials included patients with T2D who were using more than one background medication. In PIONEER 3 and 7, oral semaglutide 7 mg, 14 mg, and flexibly dosed significantly reduced HbA 1c and body weight compared with sitagliptin 100 mg (up to week 52 in PIONEER 7 and week 78 in PIONEER 3). In PIONEER 4, oral semaglutide 14 mg was noninferior to liraglutide 1.8 mg and superior to placebo in decreasing HbA 1c, and superior to both for reducing body weight, at week 26. In PIONEER 5 in patients with moderate renal impairment, and PIONEER 8 in patients receiving insulin, oral semaglutide was superior to placebo for reducing HbA 1c and body weight at week 26. The safety profile of oral semaglutide in these trials was similar to that expected of other GLP-1RAs, with tolerability issues mainly comprising mostly transient, mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal events.

The aim of the current exploratory analyses was to investigate whether different combinations of background medications and insulin regimens affected the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide compared with active comparators and placebo in the PIONEER 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 trials.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide and the effect of switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 52-week, randomized, open-label extension of the PIONEER 7 trial [^117XhUC4]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The PIONEER 7 trial demonstrated superior glycemic control and weight loss with once-daily oral semaglutide with flexible dose adjustment versus sitagliptin 100mg in type 2 diabetes. This 52-week extension evaluated long-term oral semaglutide treatment and switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide.

Research Design and Methods

A 52-week, open-label extension commenced after the 52-week main phase. Patients on oral semaglutide in the main phase continued treatment (n = 184; durability part); those on sitagliptin were rerandomized to continued sitagliptin (n = 98) or oral semaglutide (n = 100; initiated at 3mg) (switch part). Oral semaglutide was dose-adjusted (3, 7, or 14mg) every 8 weeks based on glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) (target < 7.0% (< 53mmol/mol)) and tolerability. Secondary endpoints (no primary) included changes in HbA 1c and body weight.

Results

In the durability part, mean (SD) changes in HbA 1c and body weight from week 0 were -1.5% (0.8) and -1.3% (1.0) and -2.8kg (3.8) and -3.7kg (5.2) at weeks 52 and 104, respectively. In the switch part, mean changes in HbA 1c from week 52 to week 104 were -0.2% for oral semaglutide and 0.1% for sitagliptin (difference -0.3% (95% CI -0.6 to 0.0); p = 0.0791 (superiority not confirmed)). More patients achieved HbA 1c < 7.0% with oral semaglutide (52.6%) than sitagliptin (28.6%; p = 0.0011) and fewer received rescue medication (9% vs 23.5%). Respective mean changes in body weight were -2.4 kg and -0.9 kg (difference -1.5 kg (95% CI -2.8 to -0.1); p = 0.0321). Gastrointestinal adverse events were the most commonly reported with oral semaglutide.

Conclusions

Long-term oral semaglutide with flexible dose adjustment maintained HbA 1c reductions, with additional body weight reductions, and was well tolerated. Switching from sitagliptin to flexibly dosed oral semaglutide maintained HbA 1c reductions, helped more patients achieve HbA 1c targets with less use of additional glucose-lowering medication, and offers the potential for additional reductions in body weight.

### Insights into the early use of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice: the IGNITE study [^112fxQmt]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Oral semaglutide is the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and showed significant benefits in glycaemic control and weight reduction versus active comparators in the PIONEER phase 3a randomized controlled trial programme. In this retrospective study, we present early data on the use of oral semaglutide in clinical practice, from the US IBM Explorys electronic health record database. In 782 patients prescribed oral semaglutide, 54.5% were women, and the mean age (SD) was 57.8years (11.3); 66.0% of patients received their prescription from a primary care practitioner. Although prescribing information recommends increasing the dose to 7 mg after 30days, 37.0% of patients received a prescription only for the initial 3 mg dose. Mean body mass index was 36.2 kg/m 2 (7.6); mean HbA1c was 8.4% (1.8%). Mean HbA1c change from baseline to approximately 6 months after oral semaglutide initiation was -0.9% (95% CI: -1.1%; -0.6%), with greater reductions in patients with higher baseline HbA1c. These data indicate prevalent early adoption of oral semaglutide in primary care, show real-world improvements in glycaemic control, and identify potential treatment gaps.

We analysed data from 1552 adults from four randomized phase III trials of 30 to 56 weeks' duration, investigating once-weekly semaglutide doses 0.5 and 1.0 mg. Exposure-response relationships were investigated using graphical and model-based techniques to assess the two dose levels and subgroups with the highest and lowest exposure and response.

Results

The population had the following demographic characteristics: baseline mean age between 53.2 and 58.4 years, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) between 64 and 67 mmol/mol (8.0% and 8.3%), body weight between 71.3 and 96.2 kg, and diabetes duration between 4.2 and 8.9 years. Exposure-response analysis showed a clear HbA1c and weight reduction across exposures after 30 weeks, irrespective of baseline values. The exposure-response for HbA1c was influenced by baseline HbA1c, and body weight exposure-response was influenced by sex, with limited impact of other factors. Analyses for relevant subgroups of baseline body weight, baseline HbA1c and sex indicated clinically relevant additional benefits with regard to HbA1c and weight with 1.0 vs 0.5 mg semaglutide. The proportion of participants reporting gastrointestinal (GI) side effects increased with increasing exposure, but was counteracted by tolerance development.

Conclusions

The analysis showed that all subgroups obtained a clinically relevant benefit with semaglutide 0.5 mg and an additional benefit with semaglutide 1.0 mg. The increase in GI side effects with higher exposure was mitigated by gradually increasing the dose.

### Efficacy, safety and cardiovascular outcomes of once-daily oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: the PIONEER programme [^113NtDR5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

In a Phase II dose‐finding trial, oral semaglutide at doses of 2.5‐40 mg once daily demonstrated significant dose‐dependent reductions in glucose and body weight in patients with early T2D. 34 Oral semaglutide was well tolerated, and the main adverse events were GI‐related, which (in common with other GLP‐1RAs) mainly consisted of dose‐dependent, mild‐to‐moderate and transient nausea when initiating or titrating therapy. Fewer GI events were reported when patients started on a lower dose, suggesting that a gradual escalation could be a helpful mitigation strategy. 34 Based on the results of the Phase II trial, 34 oral semaglutide doses of 3, 7 and 14 mg were taken forward to the Phase 3 Peptide InnOvatioN for the Early diabEtes tReatment (PIONEER) programme, a series of 10 multicentre, randomized clinical trials.

Practical Considerations for Optimal Use of Oral Semaglutide

Due to the formulation of oral semaglutide, clinicians need to be aware of specific considerations in its administration. As absorption of oral semaglutide is reduced if taken with food and large volumes of fluid, with higher levels of absorption from longer post-dose fasting period, individuals prescribed oral semaglutide should be informed that once-daily dosing is required at least 30 min before eating, drinking or taking other oral medicinal products. They should additionally be advised that the tablet should be swallowed whole (and should not be split, crushed or chewed) with up to half a glass of tap water (approximately 120 mL/4 fluid oz) to ensure it traverses the oesophagus (avoiding irritancy) and reaches the stomach to be absorbed. It is also possible that consuming more than the recommended 120 mL water may also adversely impact absorption. Thus, to ensure adherence to this instruction, it is imperative that the pack label includes the volume of water in the administration instructions. Furthermore, given the importance of adhering to the administration directions in achieving an effective bioavailability, it is vital that healthcare professionals, including pharmacists, effectively communicate these instructions and their importance to those initiating treatment with oral semaglutide.

Gradual dose escalation is recommended (and if a dose is missed, the missed dose should be skipped and the next dose should be taken the following day), with 3 mg tablets taken daily in the first month, increasing to a maintenance daily dose of 7 mg tablets in the second month and thereafter. After at least 1 month of 7 mg tablets once daily, the dose can be increased to a maintenance daily dose of 14 mg tablets to further improve glycaemic control if required (taking two 7 mg tablets to achieve the effect of one 14 mg dose has not been studied, but would increase the cost, and so is not recommended). This escalation will minimise gastrointestinal adverse reactions during the initial stages of treatment. While these reactions are typically mild to moderate and abate over time, monitoring of renal function in people with T2D experiencing severe gastrointestinal reactions is recommended in case of potential dehydration.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide and the effect of switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 52-week, randomized, open-label extension of the PIONEER 7 trial [^115wGDHk]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The PIONEER 7 trial demonstrated superior glycemic control and weight loss with once-daily oral semaglutide with flexible dose adjustment versus sitagliptin 100 mg in type 2 diabetes. This 52-week extension evaluated long-term oral semaglutide treatment and switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide.

Research design and methods

A 52-week, open-label extension commenced after the 52-week main phase. Patients on oral semaglutide in the main phase continued treatment (n = 184; durability part); those on sitagliptin were rerandomized to continued sitagliptin (n = 98) or oral semaglutide (n = 100; initiated at 3 mg) (switch part). Oral semaglutide was dose-adjusted (3, 7, or 14 mg) every 8 weeks based on glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) (target < 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol)) and tolerability. Secondary endpoints (no primary) included changes in HbA 1c and body weight.

Results

In the durability part, mean (SD) changes in HbA 1c and body weight from week 0 were –1.5% (0.8) and –1.3% (1.0) and –2.8 kg (3.8) and –3.7 kg (5.2) at weeks 52 and 104, respectively. In the switch part, mean changes in HbA 1c from week 52 to week 104 were –0.2% for oral semaglutide and 0.1% for sitagliptin (difference –0.3% (95% CI –0.6 to 0.0); p = 0.0791 (superiority not confirmed)). More patients achieved HbA 1c < 7.0% with oral semaglutide (52.6%) than sitagliptin (28.6%; p = 0.0011) and fewer received rescue medication (9% vs 23.5%). Respective mean changes in body weight were –2.4 kg and –0.9 kg (difference –1.5 kg (95% CI –2.8 to –0.1); p = 0.0321). Gastrointestinal adverse events were the most commonly reported with oral semaglutide.

Conclusions

Long-term oral semaglutide with flexible dose adjustment maintained HbA 1c reductions, with additional body weight reductions, and was well tolerated. Switching from sitagliptin to flexibly dosed oral semaglutide maintained HbA 1c reductions, helped more patients achieve HbA 1c targets with less use of additional glucose-lowering medication, and offers the potential for additional reductions in body weight.

### Efficacy, safety and cardiovascular outcomes of once-daily oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: the PIONEER programme [^115cbTF9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30‐59 mL/min/1.73 m²) and long‐standing diabetes (mean duration 14 years) who took part in PIONEER 5, oral semaglutide 14 mg was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing HbA1c (baseline 8.0%) at week 26 (ETD –0.8%; P < .0001). 39 In patients with T2D (mean duration at baseline of 15 years) and at high CV risk in PIONEER 6, oral semaglutide reduced HbA1c by a mean of −1.0% versus −0.3% with placebo, both on top of standard of care, over a median trial duration of 15.9 months (outcome not analysed statistically). 40

Similar to the global trials, glycaemic control was improved with oral semaglutide 14 mg compared with both placebo and the GLP‐1RAs liraglutide 0.9 mg and dulaglutide 0.75 mg in the Japanese PIONEER 9 and 10 studies (efficacy for the 7 mg dose was similar to that of the active comparators). HbA1c reductions tended to be somewhat greater with oral semaglutide in the Japanese trials than in the global trials (from similar baseline levels). 43, 44

The proportion of patients achieving the ADA‐recommended target of HbA1c < 7.0% was consistently greater with oral semaglutide 7 and 14 mg (42%‐77%) than with placebo (7%‐31%) and active comparators (25%‐62%) at the primary analysis time point across the global trials (Table 2), and this advantage was generally maintained or improved upon at the end of the trial. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42 Generally, more patients also achieved the HbA1c target of ≤ 6.5% with oral semaglutide than with placebo or active comparators. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42 Other measures of glycaemic control, including fasting plasma glucose (Table 2), were also generally reduced in patients receiving oral semaglutide compared with those randomized to placebo or active comparators. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42

### Alternative dosing regimens of GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce costs and maintain weight loss efficacy [^115p9CyA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

3.2 Alternative dosing of semaglutide

Though dose sizes vary between patients, both semaglutide and tirzepatide are typically administered once per week (q1wk). Indeed, once‐weekly is the dosing frequency studied in clinical trials, and phase 2 trials did not test dosing intervals longer than 1 week. We now use the mathematical models to investigate the weight loss efficacy of alternative dosing regimens.

Semaglutide is commercially available in maintenance doses of 2.4 mg (recommended) and 1.7 mg, with 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg available as escalation doses. Figure 2 predicts the efficacy of 1.7 or 2.4 mg of semaglutide administered less frequently than once‐weekly. In Figure 2A, we plot the steady‐state percent change in body weight as a function of the dosing interval (time between doses). The most salient feature of Figure 2A is that increasing the dosing interval (i.e. decreasing the dosing frequency) does not commensurately decrease the weight loss efficacy of semaglutide. For instance, for a once‐weekly (q1wk) dose of 2.4 mg, the model predicts a steady‐state body weight reduction of 17%, which is in good agreement with clinical data for q1wk dosing. If the dose is fixed at 2.4 mg but the dosing interval is increased to 14 days (q2wk), the model predicts a steady‐state body weight reduction of 12%. Therefore, despite the fact that decreasing the dosing frequency from q1wk to q2wk decreases the total amount of drug taken over time by one half, the model predicts that patients retain 72% of their weight loss compared with q1wk. Similarly, 1.7 mg q2wk retains 69% of the weight loss of 1.7 mg q1wk. Furthermore, the model predicts that nearly 50% of weight loss is retained when comparing once‐weekly to only once‐monthly dosing (i.e. comparing a 7 versus 28‐day dosing interval in Figure 2A), though clinical validation is especially warranted for this prediction.

### Oral semaglutide: dosage in special situations [^116egzrx]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Persons on Daily Injectable GLP1RA

Persons on daily injectable GLP1RA (exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide) who interchange to oral semaglutide may take their first dose the day after discontinuation of previous therapy. As mentioned by Evans et al. a detailed explanation of the method of drug administration must be shared with the patient. Oral semaglutide usage may be associated with gastrointestinal side effects, but these are usually mild and transient.

If this interchange is prompted by lack of tolerability, oral semaglutide should be initiated at 3 mg/day for 1 month, after which the dose can be up-titrated. If the shift is due to lack of efficacy of 10 µg twice daily (BD) exenatide, 20 µg once daily (OD) lixisenatide, or 1.2 mg once daily (OD) liraglutide, one may consider initiating oral semaglutide at 7 mg/day. While some experts propose a 14 mg/day starting dosage for persons on 1.8 mg liraglutide, we suggest a more cautious approach, to minimize potential side effects and ensure patient comfort. These suggestions are based only on expert opinion of the authors and previously published suggestions.

If the switch is requested for reasons of convenience, i.e. to avoid injectable therapy, a 3 mg oral semaglutide dose can be used to substitute for 5 µg BD exenatide, 10 µg OD lixisenatide, or 0.6 mg OD liraglutide. Although the manufacturers do not provide equivalent doses of different GLP-1RAs, these have been proposed previously by other experts. People on a higher dose of these injectables can be directly transitioned to 7 mg oral semaglutide.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs; semaglutide and liraglutide) — titration, missed doses, and precautions are detailed as follows: To minimize risk of GI adverse effects, gradual dose titration is recommended for semaglutide and liraglutide. Semaglutide is started at 0.25 mg weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by doses of 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, and 1.7 mg weekly every 4 weeks at each dose, until the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg is reached after 16 weeks; for liraglutide, it is recommended to start with 0.6 mg daily for the first 7 days, followed by doses of 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, and 2.4 mg daily every 7 days at each dose until the maintenance dose of 3.0 mg is reached after 4 weeks. If more than 2 consecutive doses are missed, clinical judgement is required to decide on subsequent dosing, and restarting the titration schedule should be considered if 3 or more consecutive doses are missed. Liraglutide or semaglutide should not be used with other GLP-1 RAs or with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors; caution is advised when using GLP-1 RAs in combination with insulin or sulfonylureas, with dose adjustment and monitoring for hypoglycemia. Because GLP-1 RAs can delay gastric emptying, it may impact the absorption of some medications that require rapid onset of action, and GLP-1 RAs have been associated with thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents in dose- and treatment duration-dependent fashion.

### Efficacy and safety of escalating the dose of oral semaglutide from 7 to 14 mg: a single-center, retrospective observational study [^11512Qa5]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide, the first glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist available in tablet form for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, were established in the phase 3a PIONEER program. However, evidence regarding the titration of oral semaglutide in real-world clinical settings remains insufficient. This study aimed to elucidate the therapeutic advantages of escalating the dose of oral semaglutide from 7 to 14 mg through clinical data analysis.

Methods

This retrospective observational study was conducted at a single center in Japan, focusing on adults with type 2 diabetes who were initiated on 14 mg oral semaglutide. The primary endpoint was the alteration in HbA1c levels 24 weeks after the initial prescription of 14 mg oral semaglutide. Secondary endpoints included changes in metabolic parameters and the incidence of adverse events.

Results

Data from 66 patients who met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. The mean change in HbA1c levels from baseline to 24 weeks following dose escalation was - 0.5 ± 0.8% [from 7.4 ± 1.0% at baseline to 7.0 ± 0.9% at 24 weeks (p < 0.01)]. Moreover, a significant reduction in body weight of - 2.0 ± 4.4 kg was observed at 24 weeks [from 90.0 ± 20.5 kg at baseline to 88.2 ± 21.4 kg at 24 weeks (p < 0.01)], with 41% of patients achieving at least a 3% reduction compared to baseline. Gastrointestinal disorders emerged as the most prevalent adverse event (10.6%), particularly nausea (7.6%), although predominantly of mild or moderate severity, with no instances of serious adverse events necessitating drug discontinuation.

Conclusion

Escalating the dose of oral semaglutide to 14 mg could be an effective approach for enhancing glycemic control and managing body weight in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

### Efficacy, safety and cardiovascular outcomes of once-daily oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: the PIONEER programme [^112X91Hj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are recommended for glycaemic management in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Oral semaglutide, the first oral GLP-1RA, has recently been approved for clinical use, based on the results of the randomized, Phase 3a Peptide InnOvatioN for Early diabEtes tReatment (PIONEER) clinical trials. The PIONEER programme tested oral semaglutide in patients with T2D of duration ranging from 3.5 to 15years, from monotherapy through to insulin add-on, in global populations and two trials dedicated to Japanese patients. Outcomes (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] and body weight reduction, plus other relevant efficacy and safety endpoints) were tested against both placebo and active standard-of-care medications. A separate trial evaluated the cardiovascular safety of oral semaglutide in patients with T2D at high cardiovascular risk. Over periods of treatment up to 78weeks, oral semaglutide 7 and 14mg once daily reduced HbA1c and body weight across the spectrum of T2D, and improved other diabetes-related endpoints, such as fasting plasma glucose. Oral semaglutide provided significantly better efficacy than placebo and commonly used glucose-lowering medications from the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin) and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (empagliflozin) classes, as well as the subcutaneous GLP-1RAs liraglutide and dulaglutide. Oral semaglutide was well tolerated in line with the known safety profile of GLP-1RAs, with transient gastrointestinal events being the most common side effects reported. Cardiovascular safety was demonstrated for oral semaglutide in patients with cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk. The results of the PIONEER programme suggest that oral semaglutide is efficacious and well tolerated for glycaemic control of T2D. The availability of oral semaglutide may help to broaden treatment choice and facilitate adoption of earlier GLP-1RA treatment in the paradigm of T2D management.

### A phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of oral semaglutide in healthy Chinese subjects [^114DdRrw]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

The trial (NCT04016974) investigated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of oral semaglutide, the first orally administered glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue for type 2 diabetes, in healthy Chinese subjects.

Materials and Methods

This single-centre, multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trial randomized 32 healthy Chinese adults to once-daily oral semaglutide (3mg escalating to 14mg) or placebo for 12weeks. Blood samples were collected regularly during treatment and follow-up. The primary endpoint was the area under the semaglutide concentration-time curve over a dosing interval (0–24h) at steady state (AUC 0–24h, sema, SS). Secondary pharmacokinetic endpoints included the maximum observed semaglutide plasma concentration at steady state (C max, sema, SS). Supportive secondary pharmacodynamics endpoints included changes in body weight and fasting plasma glucose.

Results

Treatment with all oral semaglutide doses showed dose-dependent increases in semaglutide exposure in healthy Chinese subjects at steady state, determined by AUC 0–24h, sema, SS (233, 552 and 1288h·nmol/L for 3, 7 and 14mg of oral semaglutide, respectively) and C max, sema, SS. Oral semaglutide treatment was associated with significant reductions in body weight (p = .0001) and fasting plasma glucose (p = .0011) versus placebo at the end of treatment. The safety and tolerability of oral semaglutide were consistent with the known profile of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, with no severe or blood-glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic events, serious adverse events or deaths. The most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders.

Conclusions

At steady state, oral semaglutide exposure was dose dependent and close to dose proportionality in healthy Chinese subjects. This is consistent with previous clinical pharmacology results for oral semaglutide.

### Oral semaglutide: first-in-class oral GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^117UAtvr]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: The purpose of this article is to review the pharmacological characteristics and clinical evidence of oral semaglutide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Data Sources: A MEDLINE/PubMed search was conducted between January 1, 2005, and September 30, 2019. Search terms included semaglutide, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, GLP-1 receptor agonist, and type 2 diabetes. Study Selection and Data Extraction Quantification: The following study designs were included in the analysis: systematic review and/or meta-analyses, clinical trial, or observational study design. Narrative reviews were excluded. Articles were included only if they were published in the English language or evaluated oral semaglutide with regard to pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy in humans. Data Synthesis: Oral semaglutide has been Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of T2DM as an adjunct to diet and exercise. Oral semaglutide has been shown to result in an absolute hemoglobin A 1C reduction between -0.5% and -1.5% and weight reductions between -1 and -4.7 kg. Oral semaglutide has been shown to be noninferior to placebo for cardiovascular (CV) safety although additional CV outcomes trials are ongoing. Adverse effects appear to be similar to those of other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and are gastrointestinal in nature. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Oral semaglutide may be appropriate as second- or third-line add-on therapy for patients with T2DM who are not meeting treatment goals on metformin and are overweight and reluctant to use an injectable drug. Conclusions: Oral semaglutide appears safe and effective as monotherapy and add-on pharmacological therapy for the treatment of T2DM.

### Effect of various dosing conditions on the pharmacokinetics of oral semaglutide, a human glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue in a tablet formulation [^1148S6ry]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analyses

All statistical analyses were performed using SAS versions 9.3 or 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Statistical tests were two-sided with 5% significance level and based on the full analysis set consisting of all randomised subjects receiving at least one dose of trial product. The planned analysis of the primary endpoint in the food-effect trial comparing fed and fasting groups was controlled for type 1 error. Other analyses were not controlled for multiplicity.

In the food-effect trial, the sample size was determined on the basis of the precision of the ratio of AUC 0–24h, semaglutide, day10 between fed and fasting groups. On the basis of the dosing conditions trial, which was completed at the time of planning the food-effect trial, it was assumed that the standard deviation for the log-transformed AUC 0–24h, semaglutide, day10 was 0.60. A total of 24 subjects with evaluable pharmacokinetic profiles would then result in a probability of at least 80% to obtain a 95% CI for the ratio of fed/fasting groups lying within the range of 0.68–1.46 times the estimated mean ratio. This range was assessed to be sufficiently narrow. In order to account for withdrawn subjects, it was planned to randomise 26 subjects per group (i.e. 78 subjects in total).

2.4 Recommendations Regarding Missed Dose

If one dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is more than 2 days away (48 hours), administer WEGOVY as soon as possible. If one dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is less than 2 days away (48 hours), do not administer the dose. Resume dosing on the regularly scheduled day of the week.
If 2 or more consecutive doses are missed, resume dosing as scheduled or, if needed, reinitiate WEGOVY and follow the dose escalation schedule, which may reduce the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment.

### Dose-response, efficacy, and safety of oral semaglutide monotherapy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (PIONEER 9): a 52-week, phase 2 / 3a, randomised, controlled trial [^115KSDkE]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Given the unique phenotype of type 2 diabetes in Japanese patients, novel therapies such as oral semaglutide require evaluation in this population. PIONEER 9 aimed to assess the dose-response of oral semaglutide and to compare the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide with placebo and a subcutaneous GLP-1 receptor agonist in a Japanese population.

Methods

PIONEER 9 was a 52-week, phase 2/3a, randomised, controlled trial done at 16 sites (clinics and university hospitals) in Japan. Japanese patients aged 20 years or older with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes managed by diet or exercise or with oral glucose-lowering drug monotherapy (washed out) were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to receive double-blind once-daily oral semaglutide (3 mg, 7 mg, or 14 mg) or placebo, or open-label subcutaneous once-daily liraglutide 0.9 mg. The primary endpoint was change in HbA 1c from baseline to week 26 with the trial product (primary) estimand (which assumes all patients remained on trial product without rescue medication use) in all randomly assigned patients. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03018028.

Findings

Between Jan 10, and July 11, 2017, 243 patients were randomly assigned to oral semaglutide 3 mg (n = 49), 7 mg (n = 49), or 14 mg (n = 48), or placebo (n = 49), or to liraglutide 0.9 mg (n = 48). Changes in HbA 1c from baseline (mean 8.2%) to week 26 were dose-dependent with oral semaglutide (mean change -1.1% [SE 0.1] for oral semaglutide 3 mg, -1.5% [0.1] for 7 mg, and -1.7% [0.1] for 14 mg), -0.1% (0.1) with placebo, and -1.4% (0.1) with liraglutide 0.9 mg. Estimated treatment differences for change in HbA 1c compared with placebo were -1.1 percentage points (95% CI -1.4 to -0.8; p < 0.0001) for oral semaglutide 3 mg, -1.5 percentage points (-1.7 to -1.2; p < 0.0001) for oral semaglutide 7 mg, and -1.7 percentage points (-2.0 to -1.4; p < 0.0001) for oral semaglutide 14 mg. Estimated treatment differences for change in HbA 1c compared with liraglutide 0.9 mg were 0.3 percentage points (95% CI -0.0 to 0.6; p = 0.0799) for oral semaglutide 3 mg, -0.1 percentage points (-0.4 to 0.2; p = 0.3942) for oral semaglutide 7 mg, and -0.3 percentage points (-0.6 to -0.0; p = 0.0272) for oral semaglutide 14 mg. Gastrointestinal events, predominantly of mild or moderate severity, were the most frequently reported class of adverse event with oral semaglutide: constipation was most common, occurring in five to six (10–13%) patients with oral semaglutide, three (6%) with placebo, and nine (19%) with liraglutide 0.9 mg.

Interpretation

This study showed that oral semaglutide provides significant reductions in HbA 1c compared with placebo in a dose-dependent manner in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, and has a safety profile consistent with that of GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Sustained glycaemic control and weight loss are key targets for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), with current guidelines recommending a patient-centred approach for treatment selection. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) deliver effective glycaemic control with a low risk of hypoglycaemia, while increasing satiety, reducing body weight and blood pressure and improving cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. Semaglutide is a GLP-1 analogue that was initially approved as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection (Ozempic ®, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg) for treating T2D. An initial oral formulation of semaglutide was subsequently developed as the first once-daily orally available GLP-1 analogue, using novel constituents to obtain oral bioavailability with the additional benefits of convenience and non-invasive administration. The Peptide InnOvatioN for Early diabEtes tReatment (PIONEER) phase 3 programme demonstrated the efficacy of oral semaglutide versus placebo and active comparators (including empagliflozin, sitagliptin and liraglutide) in achieving glycaemic control and weight loss, with a safety profile consistent with the GLP-1RA drug class. Oral semaglutide (Rybelsus ®) received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval in 2019 and 2020, respectively, for the second-line treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled T2D to improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise at the once-daily oral doses of 3, 7 and 14 mg. In 2023, the FDA approved a label update for oral semaglutide allowing use as a first-line treatment option for adults with T2D.

### Gradual titration of semaglutide results in better treatment adherence and fewer adverse events: a randomized controlled open-label pilot study examining a 16-week flexible titration regimen versus label-recommended 8-week semaglutide titration regimen [^115p9Ldh]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a slower, flexible titration regimen of semaglutide would improve adherence and reduce gastrointestinal adverse events (GI-AEs) compared with the label-recommended regimen in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Research Design and Methods

A total of 104 patients with T2D were randomized to label-recommended titration (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg at 4-week intervals) or flexible titration (starting at 0.0675 mg [measured as five clicks made by the dose selector dial], with gradual increases by 0.0675 mg/week and delays for GI-AEs) for 26 weeks.

Results

While final doses were similar between groups, only 2% of patients in the flexible arm withdrew due to GI-AEs vs. 19% in the label arm (P = 0.005). The flexible arm reported less nausea (45.1% vs. 64.2%; P = 0.051) and asthenia (9.8% vs. 24.5%; P = 0.047), with fewer days experiencing nausea (2.88 vs. 6.3 days; P = 0.017). HbA1c and BMI changes were similar between groups.

Conclusions

Slower, flexible titration improved adherence and reduced adverse events without compromising efficacy.

### Will oral semaglutide be used to reduce cardiovascular risk in subjects with type 2 diabetes instead of subcutaneous semaglutide? [^114LHZCY]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: The 'glutides', which stimulate the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor to stimulate insulin secretion, are used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Semaglutide is the first glutide to be developed in an oral form. The PIONEER series of clinical trials (Peptide Innovation for Early Diabetes Treatment) were undertaken to establish a clinical role for oral semaglutide. Areas covered: This evaluation is of PIONEER 6 in a non-inferiority phase 3a trial. In PIONEER 6, the primary outcome was the time from randomization to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event and this was non-inferior with oral semaglutide, compared to placebo. Expert opinion: In my opinion, there are several reasons why once-daily oral semaglutide may not replace once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Most importantly, subcutaneous semaglutide has already been shown to be superior to placebo in reducing cardiovascular risk, whereas the study of this with oral semaglutide will not be completed until 2024. Secondly, it is debatable whether subjects will find the daily protocol for taking oral semaglutide more convenient than that for the weekly subcutaneous formulation.

### PIONEER 1: randomized clinical trial of the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide monotherapy in comparison with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes [^111C4QoY]. Diabetes Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This trial compared the efficacy and safety of the first oral glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, oral semaglutide, as monotherapy with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes managed by diet and exercise alone. Two estimands addressed two efficacy-related questions: a treatment policy estimand (regardless of trial product discontinuation or rescue medication use) and a trial product estimand (on trial product without rescue medication use) in all randomized patients.

Research Design and Methods

This was a 26-week, phase 3a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted in 93 sites in nine countries. Adults with type 2 diabetes insufficiently controlled with diet and exercise were randomized (1:1:1:1) to once-daily oral semaglutide 3 mg, 7 mg, 14 mg, or placebo. The primary end point was change from baseline to week 26 in HbA 1c. The confirmatory secondary end point was change from baseline to week 26 in body weight.

Results

In the 703 patients randomized (mean age 55 years, 50.8% male, and mean baseline HbA 1c 8.0% [64 mmol/mol]), oral semaglutide reduced HbA 1c (placebo-adjusted treatment differences at week 26: treatment policy estimand, -0.6% [3 mg], -0.9% [7 mg], and -1.1% [14 mg]; trial product estimand, -0.7% [3 mg], -1.2% [7 mg], and -1.4% [14 mg]; P < 0.001 for all) and body weight (treatment policy, -0.1 kg [3 mg], -0.9 kg [7 mg], and -2.3 kg [14 mg, P < 0.001]; trial product, -0.2 kg [3 mg], -1.0 kg [7 mg, P = 0.01], and -2.6 kg [14 mg, P < 0.001]). Mild-to-moderate transient gastrointestinal events were the most common adverse events with oral semaglutide. Trial product discontinuations occurred in 2.3–7.4% with oral semaglutide and 2.2% with placebo.

Conclusions

In patients with type 2 diabetes, oral semaglutide monotherapy demonstrated superior and clinically relevant improvements in HbA 1c (all doses) and body weight loss (14 mg dose) versus placebo, with a safety profile consistent with other GLP-1 receptor agonists.

### Impact on HbA1c and body weight of switching from other GLP-1 receptor agonists to semaglutide: a model-based approach [^116q1cwF]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The impact of switching treatment from another GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) to semaglutide was investigated by analyses of exposure-response models.

Methods

HbA1c and body weight time-course models were developed, using up to 30weeks of observations from four trials in the semaglutide phase 3 programme. Given the recommended dosing for each GLP-1RA, pharmacokinetic profiles were simulated based on published population pharmacokinetic models and exposure was adjusted by the relative potencies to ensure that model predictions matched the effects observed in clinical trials. After 26weeks of simulated treatment with liraglutide, dulaglutide or exenatide extended-release, simulated semaglutide treatment was initiated 1day after the last once-daily dose of liraglutide and 1week after the last once-weekly doses of dulaglutide or exenatide extended-release.

Results

The potency-adjusted total effective GLP-1RA concentration increased after switching from another GLP-1RA to semaglutide and was associated with reductions ranging from ~0.3% to ~0.8%-points for HbA1c and from ~2% to ~4% for body weight with semaglutide 1.0 mg. Temporary slight deteriorations in HbA1c were observed after switching to semaglutide 0.25mg from liraglutide 1.2/1.8 mg or dulaglutide 1.5 mg.

Conclusions

Exposure-response modelling suggests that switching to semaglutide from liraglutide, dulaglutide or exenatide extended-release results in further reductions in HbA1c and body weight. Initial slight deterioration in outcome values when switching to semaglutide 0.25mg could be avoided by initiating semaglutide treatment at a higher dose.

### Semaglutide-properties, action and chromatographic analysis [^113UiJYX]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

The absorption, distribution, and elimination of semaglutide by means of population pharmacokinetic models using data from nine clinical pharmacology trials conducted in both healthy subjects and those with type 2 diabetes was also investigated. In a typical subject with type 2 Diabetes, clearance was estimated at 0.0348 L/h, and the central and peripheral volumes were estimated at 3.59 L. Peak semaglutide concentrations were reached within tree days of starting treatment. However, steady-state levels were achieved after 4 to 5 weeks of weekly administration.

In other investigations based on the population pharmacokinetic model, no clinically significant effects of exposure on semaglutide were observed based on gender, age, race, ethnicity, renal function, or injection site. Only the patient's body weight was found to have an effect on semaglutide exposure. Higher body weight caused a proportional decrease in drug exposure.

Based on the conducted studies, general conclusions can be drawn that semaglutide has a predictable pharmacokinetic profile with a long t1/2, allowing for once-weekly subcutaneous administration. Oral absorption of semaglutide is significantly faster than subcutaneous administration, while the elimination of subcutaneous and oral semaglutide is similar. Additionally, food intake and various dosing conditions, including water volume and dosing schedules, can affect the exposure of oral semaglutide. The half-life of semaglutide was comparable between healthy subjects and individuals with type 2 diabetes.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology obesity consensus — semaglutide dosing and outcomes: subcutaneous (SC) semaglutide is "titrated monthly as tolerated up to a maximum dose of 2.4 mg weekly for treatment of obesity", and the oral form is "approved by the FDA for people with T2D at a dose of 14 mg per day" with phase III obesity doses of "25 mg and 50 mg per day". In STEP 1, semaglutide 2.4 mg produced "an average percent weight reduction of 16.9%… at 68 weeks of treatment", STEP 5 maintained "16.7%", and OASIS-1 oral 50 mg achieved "an average percent weight reduction of 17.1%" at 68 weeks. Higher-dose SC semaglutide "(7.2 mg/week)" is being tested; in SUSTAIN-FORTE, A1C fell "2.2%… with SC semaglutide 2.0 mg compared with 1.9% for 1.0 mg" in T2D. In SELECT among people "with established CVD with obesity and without T2D", semaglutide 2.4 mg SC resulted in "a 20% reduction in 3-point MACE".

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115JdpUi]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation and titration of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) should follow trial-tested dosing. SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials (e.g., 100 mg for canagliflozin, 10 mg for dapagliflozin, 10 mg for empagliflozin), and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. Among GLP-1RAs, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or injectable semaglutide have demonstrated CV benefit to reduce the risk of MACE, and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose and up-titrated stepwise to the doses used in the trials or the otherwise maximal tolerated dose. Prior to initiating T2D therapies aimed at CV disease risk reduction, a detailed patient-clinician risk discussion is recommended, including risks, benefits, drug-drug interactions, safety, patient preferences, and cost considerations.

### High-dose semaglutide (up to 16 mg) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^112RcCFN]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Studies have demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists for glycemic control and body weight. The aim of this trial was to characterize the dose-dependent effects of semaglutide (up to 16 mg/week) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity.

Research Design and Methods

In this parallel-group, participant- and investigator-blinded, phase 2 trial, 245 individuals with type 2 diabetes and BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² on metformin were randomized to weekly semaglutide (2, 8, or 16 mg s.c.) or placebo for 40 weeks. Doses were escalated every 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance period. Dose modifications were not allowed. Primary and secondary efficacy end points included change from baseline to week 40 in HbA1c and body weight, respectively.

Results

Estimated treatment difference between 16 and 2 mg was -0.3 percentage points (%-points) (95% CI -0.7 to 0.2; P = 0.245) for HbA1c change and -3.4 kg (-6.0 to -0.8; P = 0.011) for weight change for the treatment policy estimand and -0.5%-points (-1.0 to -0.1; P = 0.015) and -4.5 kg (-7.6 to -1.4; P = 0.004), respectively, for the hypothetical estimand. Dose-response modeling confirmed these findings. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and treatment discontinuations due to AEs, primarily gastrointestinal, were more frequent in the semaglutide 8 and 16 mg groups than in the 2 mg group. No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported.

Conclusions

Higher semaglutide doses for type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity provide modest additional glucose-lowering effect, with additional weight loss, at the expense of more AEs and treatment discontinuations. A study for evaluating high-dose semaglutide in obesity is currently underway.

### Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of concomitant administration of multiple doses of cagrilintide with semaglutide 2. 4 mg for weight management: a randomised, controlled, phase 1b trial [^11776rNr]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Cagrilintide, a long-acting amylin analogue, and semaglutide 2.4 mg, a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, are both being investigated as options for weight management. We aimed to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of this drug combination.

Methods

In this randomised, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending dose, phase 1b trial, individuals aged 18–55 years with a body-mass index 27.0–39.9 kg/m 2 and who were otherwise healthy were recruited from a single centre in the United States. The trial included six sequential overlapping cohorts, and in each cohort eligible participants were randomly assigned (3:1) to once-weekly subcutaneous cagrilintide (0.16, 0.30, 0.60, 1.2, 2.4, or 4.5 mg) or matched placebo, in combination with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg, without lifestyle interventions. In each cohort, the doses of cagrilintide and semaglutide were co-escalated in 4-week intervals to the desired dose over 16 weeks, participants were treated at the target dose for 4 weeks, and then followed up for 5 weeks. Participants, investigators, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was number of treatment-emergent adverse events from baseline to end of follow-up. Secondary pharmacokinetic endpoints assessed from day of last dose (week 19) to end of treatment (week 20) were area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 168 h (AUC 0–168 h) and maximum concentration [C max] of cagrilintide and semaglutide; exploratory pharmacokinetic endpoints were half-life, time to C max [t max], plasma clearance, and volume of distribution of cagrilintide and semaglutide; and exploratory pharmacodynamic endpoints were changes in bodyweight, glycaemic parameters, and hormones. Safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic endpoints were assessed in all participants who were exposed to at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03600480, and is now complete.

Findings

Between July 25, 2018, and Dec 17, 2019, 285 individuals were screened and 96 were randomly assigned to cagrilintide (0.16–2.4 mg group n = 12; 4.5 mg group n = 11) or placebo (n = 24), in combination with semaglutide 2.4 mg, of whom 95 were exposed to treatment (one patient in 0.60 mg cagrilintide group was not exposed) and included in the safety and full analysis datasets. The mean age was 40.6 years (SD 9.2), 56 (59%) of 95 participants were men and 51 (54%) were Black or African American. Of 566 adverse events reported in 92 participants (69 [97%] of 71 participants assigned to 0.16–4.5 mg cagrilintide and 23 [96%] of 24 assigned to placebo), 207 (37%) were gastrointestinal disorders. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and the proportion of participants with one or more adverse event was similar across treatment groups. Exposure was proportional to cagrilintide dose and did not affect semaglutide exposure or elimination. AUC 0–168 h ranged from 926 nmol×h/L to 24271 nmol×h/L, and C max ranged from 6.14 nmol/L to 170 nmol/L with cagrilintide 0.16–4.5 mg. AUC 0–168 h ranged from 12757 nmol×h/L to 15305 nmol×h/L, and C max ranged from 96.4 nmol/L to 120 nmol/L with semaglutide 2.4 mg. Cagrilintide 0.16–4.5 mg had a half-life of 159–195 h, with a median t max of 24–72 h. Semaglutide 2.4 mg had a half-life of 145–165 h, with a median t max of 12–24 h. Plasma clearance and volume of distribution for both cagrilintide and semaglutide were similar across treatment groups. At week 20, mean percentage bodyweight reductions were greater with cagrilintide 1.2 and 2.4 mg than with placebo (15.7% [SE 1.6] for cagrilintide 1.2 mg and 17.1% [1.5] for cagrilintide 2.4 mg vs 9.8% [1.2] for pooled placebo cohorts 1–5; estimated treatment difference of -6.0% [95% CI -9.9 to -2.0] for cagrilintide 1.2 mg and -7.4% [-11.2 to -3.5] for cagrilintide 2.4 mg vs pooled placebo), and with cagrilintide 4.5 mg than with matched placebo (15.4% [1.3] vs 8.0% [2.2]; estimated treatment difference -7.4% [-12.8 to -2.1]), all in combination with semaglutide 2.4 mg. Glycaemic parameters improved in all treatment groups, independently of cagrilintide dose. Changes in hormones were similar across treatment groups.

Interpretation

Concomitant treatment with cagrilintide and semaglutide 2.4 mg was well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. Future larger and longer trials are needed to fully assess the efficacy and safety of this treatment combination.

4.5 Cardiovascular outcomes

Among 3183 patients with T2D and high CV risk enrolled in PIONEER 6, oral semaglutide was non‐inferior to placebo for the incidence of first major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (3.8% in the oral semaglutide group and 4.8% in the placebo group; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.79 [95% CI 0.57‐1.11], P < .001 for non‐inferiority). 40 A lower incidence of CV‐related death (HR = 0.49 [95% CI 0.27‐0.92]) and all‐cause death (1.4% vs 2.8%; HR = 0.51 [95% CI 0.31‐0.84]) was observed with oral semaglutide versus placebo. 40

In the other PIONEER trials, among patients at lower CV risk, the incidence of CV events between patients receiving oral semaglutide and those receiving placebo or other glucose‐lowering drugs was low. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44 Fasting lipid levels (very low, low and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides) remained similar or were reduced with oral semaglutide (generally at the 14 mg dose) versus comparators, and reductions were maintained over time. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44

### Efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide by subgroups of patient characteristics in the PIONEER phase 3 programme [^1158kp5N]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide versus comparators by patient characteristic subgroups in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Materials and Methods

Change from baseline in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight, and achievement of HbA1c < 7.0% with oral semaglutide 7 mg, oral semaglutide 14mg, flexibly dosed oral semaglutide (flex) and comparators were assessed across baseline subgroups (age, race, ethnicity, diabetes duration, body mass index and HbA1c) from the PIONEER programme. Treatment differences were analysed using a mixed model for repeated measurements for continuous variables and a logistic regression model for the binary endpoint. Pooled safety data were analysed descriptively.

Results

Changes from baseline in HbA1c and body weight, and the odds of achieving HbA1c < 7.0%, were greater with oral semaglutide 14mg/flex (n = 1934) and higher or similar with oral semaglutide 7 mg (n = 823) versus comparators (n = 2077) across most subgroups. Changes in HbA1c with oral semaglutide 14mg/flex were greater for patients with higher baseline HbA1c (HbA1c > 9.0%: -1.7% to -2.6%; HbA1c < 8.0%: -0.7% to -1.2%). In some trials, Asian patients experienced greater HbA1c reductions with oral semaglutide 14mg/flex (-1.5% to -1.8%) than other racial groups (-0.6% to -1.6%). The overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) with oral semaglutide was similar to that with comparators and was consistent across subgroups. More gastrointestinal AEs were observed with oral semaglutide, versus comparators, across subgroups.

Conclusions

Oral semaglutide demonstrated consistently greater HbA1c and body weight reductions across a range of patient characteristics, with greater HbA1c reductions seen at higher baseline HbA1c levels.

### Oral semaglutide versus subcutaneous liraglutide and placebo in type 2 diabetes (PIONEER 4): a randomised, double-blind, phase 3a trial [^1156eKT5]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective treatments for type 2 diabetes, lowering glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) and weight, but are currently only approved for use as subcutaneous injections. Oral semaglutide, a novel GLP-1 agonist, was compared with subcutaneous liraglutide and placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

In this randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3a trial, we recruited patients with type 2 diabetes from 100 sites in 12 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, with HbA 1c of 7.0–9.5% (53–80.3 mmol/mol), on a stable dose of metformin (≥ 1500 mg or maximum tolerated) with or without a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor. Participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1) with an interactive web-response system and stratified by background glucose-lowering medication and country of origin, to once-daily oral semaglutide (dose escalated to 14 mg), once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide (dose escalated to 1.8 mg), or placebo for 52 weeks. Two estimands were defined: treatment policy (regardless of study drug discontinuation or rescue medication) and trial product (assumed all participants were on study drug without rescue medication) in all participants who were randomly assigned. The treatment policy estimand was the primary estimand. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 26 in HbA 1c (oral semaglutide superiority vs placebo and non-inferiority [margin: 0.4%] and superiority vs subcutaneous liraglutide) and the confirmatory secondary endpoint was change from baseline to week 26 in bodyweight (oral semaglutide superiority vs placebo and liraglutide). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered on Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT02863419, and the European Clinical Trials registry, number EudraCT 2015–005210–30.

Findings

Between Aug 10, 2016, and Feb 7, 2017, 950 patients were screened, of whom 711 were eligible and randomly assigned to oral semaglutide (n = 285), subcutaneous liraglutide (n = 284), or placebo (n = 142). 341 (48%) of 711 participants were female and the mean age was 56 years (SD 10). All participants were given at least one dose of study drug, and 277 (97%) participants in the oral semaglutide group, 274 (96%) in the liraglutide group, and 134 (94%) in the placebo group completed the 52-week trial period. Mean change from baseline in HbA 1c at week 26 was -1.2% (SE 0.1) with oral semaglutide, -1.1% (SE 0.1) with subcutaneous liraglutide, and -0.2% (SE 0.1) with placebo. Oral semaglutide was non-inferior to subcutaneous liraglutide in decreasing HbA 1c (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.1%, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.0; p < 0.0001) and superior to placebo (ETD -1.1%, -1.2 to -0.9; p < 0.0001) by use of the treatment policy estimand. By use of the trial product estimand, oral semaglutide had significantly greater decreases in HbA 1c than both subcutaneous liraglutide (ETD -0.2%, 95% CI -0.3 to -0.1; p = 0.0056) and placebo (ETD -1.2%, -1.4 to -1.0; p < 0.0001) at week 26. Oral semaglutide resulted in superior weight loss (-4.4 kg [SE 0.2]) compared with liraglutide (-3.1 kg [SE 0.2]; ETD -1.2 kg, 95% CI -1.9 to -0.6; p = 0.0003) and placebo (-0.5 kg [SE 0.3]; ETD -3.8 kg, -4.7 to -3.0; p < 0.0001) at week 26 (treatment policy). By use of the trial product estimand, weight loss at week 26 was significantly greater with oral semaglutide than with subcutaneous liraglutide (-1.5 kg, 95% CI -2.2 to -0.9; p < 0.0001) and placebo (ETD -4.0 kg, -4.8 to -3.2; p < 0.0001). Adverse events were more frequent with oral semaglutide (n = 229 [80%]) and subcutaneous liraglutide (n = 211 [74%]) than with placebo (n = 95 [67%]).

Interpretation

Oral semaglutide was non-inferior to subcutaneous liraglutide and superior to placebo in decreasing HbA 1c, and superior in decreasing bodyweight compared with both liraglutide and placebo at week 26. Safety and tolerability of oral semaglutide were similar to subcutaneous liraglutide. Use of oral semaglutide could potentially lead to earlier initiation of GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy in the diabetes treatment continuum of care.

### Effect of additional oral semaglutide vs sitagliptin on glycated hemoglobin in adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin alone or with sulfonylurea: the PIONEER 3 randomized clinical trial [^114Ycy6s]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Phase 3 trials have not compared oral semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, with other classes of glucose-lowering therapy.

Objective

To compare efficacy and assess long-term adverse event profiles of once-daily oral semaglutide vs sitagliptin, 100 mg added on to metformin with or without sulfonylurea, in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, phase 3a trial conducted at 206 sites in 14 countries over 78 weeks from February 2016 to March 2018. Of 2463 patients screened, 1864 adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin with or without sulfonylurea were randomized.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive once-daily oral semaglutide, 3 mg (n = 466), 7 mg (n = 466), or 14 mg (n = 465), or sitagliptin, 100 mg (n = 467). Semaglutide was initiated at 3 mg/d and escalated every 4 weeks, first to 7 mg/d then to 14 mg/d, until the randomized dosage was achieved.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and the key secondary end point was change in body weight, both from baseline to week 26. Both were assessed at weeks 52 and 78 as additional secondary end points. End points were tested for noninferiority with respect to HbA1c (noninferiority margin, 0.3%) prior to testing for superiority of HbA1c and body weight.

Results

Among 1864 patients randomized (mean age, 58 [SD, 10] years; mean baseline HbA1c, 8.3% [SD, 0.9%]; mean body mass index, 32.5 [SD, 6.4]; n = 879 [47.2%] women), 1758 (94.3%) completed the trial and 298 prematurely discontinued treatment (16.7% for semaglutide, 3 mg/d; 15.0% for semaglutide, 7 mg/d; 19.1% for semaglutide, 14 mg/d; and 13.1% for sitagliptin). Semaglutide, 7 and 14 mg/d, compared with sitagliptin, significantly reduced HbA1c (differences, -0.3% [95% CI, -0.4% to -0.1%] and -0.5% [95% CI, -0.6% to -0.4%], respectively; P < .001 for both) and body weight (differences, -1.6 kg [95% CI, -2.0 to -1.1 kg] and -2.5 kg [95% CI, -3.0 to -2.0 kg], respectively; P < .001 for both) from baseline to week 26. Noninferiority of semaglutide, 3 mg/d, with respect to HbA1c was not demonstrated. Week 78 reductions in both end points were statistically significantly greater with semaglutide, 14 mg/d, vs sitagliptin.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin with or without sulfonylurea, oral semaglutide, 7 mg/d and 14 mg/d, compared with sitagliptin, resulted in significantly greater reductions in HbA1c over 26 weeks, but there was no significant benefit with the 3-mg/d dosage. Further research is needed to assess effectiveness in a clinical setting.

### Efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide by subgroups of patient characteristics in the PIONEER phase 3 programme [^114vjTKK]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Trial designs

The design of trials within the global PIONEER phase 3a programme have been reported previously. The PIONEER efficacy trials (PIONEER 1–5, 7 and 8) were used for the present analyses; PIONEER 6 was a cardiovascular (CV) outcomes trialand was, therefore, not included in the subgroup analyses.

PIONEER 1, 4, 5 and 8 were placebo‐controlled trials and PIONEER 2, 3, 4 and 7 were active‐controlled trials (empagliflozin, sitagliptin or liraglutide; Table S1). PIONEER 1, 3 and 8 investigated three once‐daily doses of oral semaglutide (3, 7 and 14 mg), PIONEER 2, 4 and 5 assessed oral semaglutide 14 mg, and PIONEER 7 employed a flexible dose adjustment approach (flex), where the dose could be increased or decreased according to predefined efficacy or tolerability criteria. Here, we report oral semaglutide 14 mg/flex data (with 7 mg data in Appendix S1). The 3 mg dose is for the purposes of dose escalation and is not a maintenance dose, and was therefore not included in the analysis. Treatment durations were 26 weeks for PIONEER 1 and 5, 52 weeks for PIONEER 2, 4, 7 and 8 and 78 weeks for PIONEER 3.

The trials were performed according to relevant local regulatory guidance, and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.

For further details on the primary endpoint and patient populations in the PIONEER trials, please refer to Table S1.

### Efficacy and safety of escalating the dose of oral semaglutide from 7 to 14 mg: a single-center, retrospective observational study [^114omrZZ]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Safety Outcomes

Throughout the study period, AEs were reported in 18 of 66 patients (27.3%) (Table 3). The predominant AEs were gastrointestinal disorders (10.6%), with nausea being the most commonly reported symptom (7.6%). However, most of these events were mild or moderate in severity. Notably, only one patient (1.5%) required a dose reduction of oral semaglutide due to gastrointestinal disorders. Other reasons for discontinuation or dose reduction included perceived treatment ineffectiveness by the attending physician, financial constraints, and patient requests. Additionally, a single instance (1.5%) of blood glucose-confirmed hypoglycemia (54 mg/dL) was observed, with no serious AEs.

Table 3
Summary of adverse events

Data are presented as n (%)

Subgroup Analysis

The median duration of the escalation of the oral semaglutide dose from 3 to 14 mg was 114 days. In the subgroup analysis, significant improvements in HbA1c levels were evident in both the early (< 114 days) and late dose-titration groups (≥ 114 days) (Supplementary Material, Table S2). However, notable weight loss was observed in the early dose-titration group. Conversely, gastrointestinal tract disorders were more prevalent in the early dose-titration group (Supplementary Material, Table S3).

### Oral semaglutide reduces hbAand body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of background glucose-lowering medication: PIONEER subgroup analyses [^1178Sitq]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Subgroup Analyses

All randomised patients in PIONEER 3–5, 7 and 8 were included in the main background medication subgroup analyses, which were done for each trial separately. Subgroup data were not pooled across trials because of substantial differences in study design and patient population. Randomisation was stratified according to patients' background medications: metformin with or without sulphonylurea in PIONEER 3; metformin with or without SGLT2i in PIONEER 4; metformin alone, sulphonylurea with or without metformin, or basal insulin with or without metformin in PIONEER 5; metformin, SGLT2i or thiazolidinedione with or without sulphonylurea in PIONEER 7; and insulin with or without metformin in PIONEER 8.

In addition, a separate subgroup analysis was performed for PIONEER 8 to explore the effect of the insulin regimen on the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide compared with placebo.

Efficacy endpoints were change from baseline in HbA 1c and body weight (and, for the separate PIONEER 8 subgroup analysis, change from baseline in insulin dose) at the planned end of treatment (weeks 26, 52 or 78, according to the trial). Efficacy data are presented for oral semaglutide 14 mg or flexibly dosed, and for comparators. Safety outcomes were analysed by subgroup across all trials for all patients (including those receiving oral semaglutide 3 and 7 mg).

### Oral semaglutide reduces hbAand body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of background glucose-lowering medication: PIONEER subgroup analyses [^115AtJbi]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

In the PIONEER programme, oral semaglutide had a safety profile similar to that characterised for other GLP-1RAs. In the current subgroup analyses, background medication had a limited effect on the tolerability of oral semaglutide (including on gastrointestinal AEs). The incidence of AEs tended to be higher for patients receiving insulin than other background medications, which may reflect the safety profile and the fact that insulin is often used later in the treatment course of T2D, when patients are more vulnerable. As might be expected, hypoglycaemic episodes were more common in patients receiving background insulin and sulphonylurea.

Efficacy and tolerability outcomes with oral semaglutide were generally consistent regardless of background insulin regimen in PIONEER 8, although AEs (including severe or blood glucose-confirmed hypoglycaemia) were more common with background basal insulin than with premixed or basal-bolus regimens. The total daily insulin dose requirement was reduced with oral semaglutide compared with placebo, without a clear link between insulin regimen subgroup and the change in total daily insulin dose. Given the increased risk of body weight gain and hypoglycaemia associated with long-term insulin use, the potential for reducing insulin doses with the addition of oral semaglutide (as well as its weight-decreasing potential) may be of clinical importance. In line with these results, in the randomised, placebo-controlled SUSTAIN 5 trial of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide as an add-on to basal insulin, the insulin dose was significantly decreased from baseline with both the semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg doses compared with placebo.

Randomisation in these trials was prospectively stratified by baseline background medication, which can be considered a strength of the current analyses. Nevertheless, the subgroup analyses presented here were conducted post hoc and thus have limitations compared with prospective studies. Furthermore, the statistical analyses of efficacy outcomes were not controlled for multiplicity. As such, the outcomes should be considered exploratory in nature and warrant further prospective investigation. The PIONEER programme included a large number of patients, and data from more than 2800 were included in these analyses. Despite this, it should be noted that patient numbers in certain background medication subgroups were relatively low. Nevertheless, these analyses help to further characterise the profile of oral semaglutide in the context of guideline-recommended management of patients with T2D.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide and the effect of switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 52-week, randomized, open-label extension of the PIONEER 7 trial [^112ydtpS]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide appeared to result in body weight reductions by week 104, although superiority was not tested given the hierarchical testing strategy. As in the main phase, no significant differences were seen in the switch part between oral semaglutide and sitagliptin for DTSQ total treatment satisfaction score or for the items relating to convenience and flexibility of treatment. This suggests that the dosing conditions for oral semaglutide had no impact on treatment satisfaction when switching from sitagliptin.

More gastrointestinal events (a well-known class effect with GLP-1RAs) occurred in patients switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide than in those continuing sitagliptin. A similar finding was observed when switching to another GLP-1RA, liraglutide, from sitagliptin. In patients randomized to oral semaglutide with flexible dose adjustment in the switch part, the proportion discontinuing due to AEs (6%) was broadly similar to that observed in those randomized to flexibly dosed oral semaglutide in the main phase of PIONEER 7 (9%). While the potential for improved tolerability was part of the rationale for exploring flexible dosing, several other studies of oral semaglutide without flexible dose adjustment report comparable discontinuation rates. As such, it appears that the individualized and slower approach to dose escalation (every 8 weeks vs every 4 weeks in other oral semaglutide studies) did not impact discontinuation rates; however, as in the main phase, the extension was conducted open-label, which could have influenced the actions of patients and investigators. In the switch part of the study, the majority of AEs leading to oral semaglutide discontinuation occurred within 8 weeks of rerandomization, after patients initiated oral semaglutide 3 mg but before escalation to higher doses. Again, this is consistent with the results of the main phase of PIONEER 7, and suggests that if the initial treatment with the 3 mg dose is tolerated, subsequent dose escalation is also likely to be tolerated.

### Semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113aiBrc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The study SUSTAIN-6 was published by Steven P Marso and colleagues in 2016 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the trial question was: what is the role of semaglutide in patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk? In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the population was: 3297 patients (1295 female, 2002 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM who were on a standard-care regimen. The key exclusion criteria were treatment with a dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitor within 30 days before screening or with a GLP-1-receptor agonist or insulin other than basal or premixed within 90 days before screening; history of an acute coronary or cerebrovascular event within 90 days; planned revascularization of a coronary, carotid, or peripheral artery; long-term dialysis. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the interventions were: n = 1648 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for 4 weeks, then titrated to 0.5 mg for another 4 weeks until the maintenance dose of 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg once weekly, and continued for a total of 104 weeks) n = 1649 placebo (matching placebo for 104 weeks). In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (6.6% vs. 8.9%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.95). In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in nonfatal myocardial infarction (2.9% vs. 3.9%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.08) Significant decrease in death from all causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (7.4% vs. 9.6%; HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.97) Significant decrease in new or worsening nephropathy (3.8% vs. 6.1%; HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.88). In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in severe hypoglycemia. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the conclusion was: in patients with T2DM who were on a standard-care regimen, semaglutide was noninferior to placebo with respect to the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

### A phase 2, randomized, dose-finding study of the novel once-weekly human GLP-1 analog, semaglutide, compared with placebo and open-label liraglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes [^114AuWPf]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the dose-response relationship of semaglutide versus placebo and open-label liraglutide in terms of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

This was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind phase 2 trial. Patients (n = 415) were randomized to receive a subcutaneous injection of semaglutide once weekly without dose escalation (0.1–0.8 mg) or with dose escalation (E) (0.4 mg steps to 0.8 or 1.6 mg E over 1–2 weeks), open-label liraglutide once daily (1.2 or 1.8 mg), or placebo. The primary end point was change in HbA1c level from baseline. Secondary end points included change in body weight, safety, and tolerability.

Results

Semaglutide dose-dependently reduced the level of HbA1c from baseline (8.1 ± 0.8%) to week 12 by up to -1.7%, and body weight by up to -4.8 kg (1.6 mg E, P < 0.001 vs. placebo). Up to 81% of patients achieved an HbA1c level of < 7%. HbA1c level and weight reductions with semaglutide 1.6 mg E were greater than those with liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg (based on unadjusted CIs), but adverse events (AEs) and withdrawals occurred more frequently. The incidence of nausea, vomiting, and withdrawal due to gastrointestinal AEs increased with the semaglutide dose; most events were mild to moderate, transient, and ameliorated by dose escalation. There were no major episodes of hypoglycemia and few cases of injection site reactions.

Conclusions

After 12 weeks, semaglutide dose-dependently reduced HbA1c level and weight in patients with type 2 diabetes. No unexpected safety or tolerability concerns were identified; gastrointestinal AEs typical of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists were mitigated by dose escalation. On this basis, weekly semaglutide doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg with a 4-week dose escalation were selected for phase 3.

### A bioequivalence study of two formulations of oral semaglutide in healthy participants [^113dEAoS]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Confirmation of bioequivalence in the present study provides support that the safety profile and efficacy of each dose level of once-daily 2G oral semaglutide (1.5, 4 and 9 mg), in terms of reductions in HbA 1c and body weight, will be equivalent to the corresponding dose level of once-daily 1G oral semaglutide (3, 7 and 14 mg), therefore allowing switching from the 1G to the 2G formulation.

### What is the pipeline for future medications for obesity? [^112hcC6o]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Adverse events with oral GLP-1 RA

Similar to injectable GLP-1 RA, the most common AE with oral GLP-1 RA were gastrointestinal which were mild to moderate in severity (Tables 2 and 3, safety outcomes). In the OASIS-1 study, 13% of participants (people with obesity without diabetes) receiving oral semaglutide 50 mg experienced "altered skin sensation" events compared to 1% with placebo - these events were generally mild to moderate in severity, occurred during dose escalation to the higher doses and resolved without requiring permanent treatment discontinuation. The "altered skin sensation" has not been reported in the PIONEER-PLUS study or with injectable semaglutide 2.4 mg and its aetiology will need to be explored further in future studies.

AE leading to discontinuation of treatment were 6–13% with semaglutide 50 mg once daily in phase 3 trials (vs. 4–10% with placebo) and 10–21% with orforglipron in phase 2 trials (vs. 2–6% with placebo, Tables 2 and 3). The percentages of participants who experienced AE leading to treatment discontinuation as well as of those who experienced gastrointestinal AE with oral semaglutide 50 mg (Tables 2 and 3) were similar to those observed with subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (in STEP-1 and STEP-2 trials 6–7% discontinued treatment due to AE, 34–44% experienced nausea, 21–32% diarrhoea and 22–25% vomiting).

For orforglipron, participants initiated on higher doses and those on rapid titration schemes appeared to have higher discontinuation rates, providing insights into the optimisation process for the phase 3 trials.

For danuglipron, most AE were mild in severity at the phase 2 trial for people with T2D, but 22–34% of participants receiving the higher doses (≥ 80 mg twice daily) discontinued the medication due to AE (vs. 8% with placebo, Table 3). As the discontinuation rates were also high with the twice daily danuglipron at the phase 2 obesity trial (as discussed above), twice daily danuglirpon formulation will not advance into phase 3 studies, but an improved once-daily formulation with an aim to improve tolerability profile is currently under assessment. Another oral, non-peptide GLP-1 RA (lotiglipron) has also been withdrawn from development as in early phase clinical trials resulted in elevated liver enzymes which could indicate liver toxicity.

### Cardiovascular safety of oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: rationale, design and patient baseline characteristics for the PIONEER 6 trial [^112VtKJS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

To assess the cardiovascular (CV) safety of oral semaglutide, the first tablet formulation of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist.

Materials and Methods

PIONEER 6 is a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of CV events (defined as being aged ≥ 50 years and having established CV disease [CVD] or moderate [stage 3] chronic kidney disease [CKD], or being aged ≥ 60 years with ≥ 1 other CV risk factor). Patients were randomized to once-daily oral semaglutide (up to 14 mg) or placebo added to standard of care. The primary composite endpoint is time to first occurrence of CV death or non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. The primary hypothesis was to exclude an excess in CV risk with oral semaglutide by assessing non-inferiority versus placebo for the primary endpoint (non-inferiority margin of 1.8 for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio). PIONEER 6 is event-driven, with follow-up continuing until accrual of at least 122 primary outcome events. There is no pre-defined minimal duration.

Results

Overall, 3183 patients have been enrolled (mean age 66.1 years, 31.6% females) in 214 sites across 21 countries. At baseline, the mean duration of diabetes was 14.9 years, mean glycated haemoglobin concentration was 66 mmol/mol (8.2%), and 84.6% of patients had established CVD/moderate CKD.

Conclusions

PIONEER 6 will provide evidence regarding the CV safety of oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes and high CV risk.

### A bioequivalence study of two formulations of oral semaglutide in healthy participants [^114kHYEN]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this interventional, randomised, three-group, full replicate crossover study, bioequivalence was confirmed between 2G oral semaglutide and the initially approved formulation, 1G oral semaglutide, at SS in healthy participants across the three investigated dose levels of 1.5 versus 3 mg, 4 versus 7 mg and 9 versus 14 mg, all once daily. This was based on the comparison of AUC 0–24h, SS and C max values, which showed bioequivalence between formulations at all three dose levels in accordance with the prespecified criteria designated in EMA, FDA and PMDA guidelines. Furthermore, C tau, 24h and t max, 0–24h were comparable across formulations. Given the successful demonstration of bioequivalence across the two formulations, these results demonstrate that the change in excipients in the 2G formulation of oral semaglutide improved the bioavailability of semaglutide.

The overall safety profile of 2G oral semaglutide was consistent with the established safety profile of 1G oral semaglutide and with that of the GLP-1RA class; no new safety concerns were identified. Comparison of PK parameters with those reported in other studies of oral semaglutide is challenging due to differences in doses and study designs. However, the reported geometric means for AUC 0–24h and C max were within the expected range and median t max values were comparable to previous reports. The shapes of the semaglutide dosing interval profiles were also similar to curves reported by van Hout et al. and Bækdal et al.

Study limitations include that the full replicate crossover study design without wash-out periods utilised here is not optimised for a head-to-head safety comparison between the two formulations. TEAEs were allocated to the formulation the participant was taking at the time of TEAE onset, and therefore it is possible that a TEAE could have occurred due to the previously administered formulation.

In the PIONEER program, the most common AEs were gastrointestinal disorders, occurring in a dose-dependent manner with oral semaglutide, requiring discontinuation in 2–12% of patients receiving 14 mg oral semaglutide. These AEs typically manifested earlier in the study during the dose initiation and escalation phases. In the current study, gastrointestinal disorders were also the predominant AEs, occurring in 10.6% of patients. Notably, these events were more frequent in the early dose-titration group (18.2%) than in the late group (3.0%). However, these gastrointestinal disorders were mild to moderate in intensity and transient, requiring dose reduction in only one patient (1.5%), and none required discontinuation of oral semaglutide. Throughout the study period, only one case (1.5%) of blood glucose-confirmed hypoglycemia (54 mg/dL) was observed. GLP-1RAs are regarded as possessing a minimal risk of hypoglycemia owing to their mechanism of action, which is contingent on glucose levels. In alignment with other GLP-1RAs, severe or blood glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia was infrequent in the PIONEER programs, although it seemed to occur more frequently in trials combining oral semaglutide with sulfonylureas (SU) or insulin (PIONEER 3, 5, 7, and 8). As expected, the background therapy for patients experiencing hypoglycemia in our study was SU. No cases of acute pancreatitis were reported during the study period. Overall, the AEs observed in our study were mild or moderate in severity and did not lead to drug discontinuation. These findings provide valuable reassurance for physicians hesitant to increase the dosage of oral semaglutide to the highest level because of concerns about side effects. This information can help them make informed decisions about dose escalation to achieve therapeutic benefits.

### Dosage-ranging trial of oral semaglutide vs placebo vs subcutaneous semaglutide in diabetes… [^11624WGE]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

There was no dose escalation in the oral semaglutide 2. 5-mg and placebo groups. In the other oral semaglutide groups, the dose was doubled from a starting dose of 2. 5 mg or 5 mg every 4 weeks until the trial maintenance dose of the group was achieved. The subcutaneous semaglutide dose was doubled every 4 weeks from a starting dose of 0. 25 mg until a 1 mg trial maintenance dose was achieved. In addition, a slow dose escalation to 40 mg of oral semaglutide at 8-week intervals and a fast dose escalation to 40 mg of oral semaglutide at 2-week intervals were included. Interventions Once-daily oral semaglutide of 2. 5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, 40-mg 4-week dose escalation, 40-mg 8-week dose escalation, 40-mg 2-week dose escalation, oral placebo or once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide of

0 mg for 26 weeks. Oral semaglutide and placebo doses were blinded from both the investigator and the patient. In addition to a 4-week interval dose escalation, in which oral semaglutide or placebo doses were doubled every 4 weeks until the trial maintenance dose was achieved, the efficacy and safety of an 8-week interval and a 2-week interval dose escalation regimen for the highest dose of oral semaglutide were explored. Treatment groups included 5 oral semaglutide dosage groups and an oral placebo group, and a 1-mg subcutaneous semaglutide group. No significant difference was observed between 20 mg and 40-mg standard escalation groups of oral semaglutide and the subcutaneous semaglutide group.
