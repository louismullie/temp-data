## Question

Can you push IV calcium gluconate through a central line?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether IV calcium gluconate can be pushed through a central line. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic properties and labeled administration instructions for calcium gluconate. Then, I should verify whether central venous access is explicitly endorsed or discouraged in guidelines and labels. Next, I will review clinical scenarios where central access is preferred or required, and contrast this with peripheral considerations. After that, I need to check dosing, dilution, and rate limits for bolus administration via a central line. Finally, I should confirm safety issues, drug incompatibilities, and monitoring requirements before synthesizing a clear recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the drug and its basic properties. Calcium gluconate is an intravenous calcium salt used to treat acute symptomatic hypocalcemia and certain emergencies. It is supplied as a 10% solution containing 100 mg/mL calcium gluconate, which corresponds to 9.3 mg/mL elemental calcium, and it is intended for IV administration via a secure line with appropriate dilution and monitoring [^116dwCC6] [^116TuBda].

> Wait, let me verify whether central venous administration is acceptable. The FDA labeling instructs to administer via a secure intravenous line and to dilute prior to use. It does not restrict administration to peripheral veins and, in fact, emphasizes secure access to mitigate extravasation and calcinosis risks, which central lines inherently reduce, implying acceptability of central administration when available [^116dwCC6] [^116B8Fvr].

> Next, I should review guideline-level support for central access. The ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline explicitly recommends intravenous calcium as first-line therapy in beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker toxicity when central or reliable peripheral venous access is present, which directly supports administering calcium salts, including gluconate, via central lines in those contexts [^116LcxMH] [^1145eMru].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check clinical scenarios where central access is preferred. In pediatric hypocalcemia, expert guidance notes IV calcium is irritating and that central line administration is preferred when available, reinforcing the safety rationale for central delivery in children with symptomatic hypocalcemia [^1175DUnU]. In trauma and massive transfusion, calcium chloride is often preferred centrally due to its higher elemental calcium load and causticity, but this preference underscores the broader principle that central access is advantageous for IV calcium therapy when feasible, and calcium gluconate is likewise compatible with central administration when needed [^114G3xdk].

> I will now examine dosing and administration specifics for bolus via a central line. For adults, typical bolus dosing uses 1–2 g of elemental calcium as calcium gluconate diluted in 50–100 mL of D5W or normal saline and infused over about 20 minutes, with careful titration to effect and ECG monitoring. The FDA label advises diluting to 10–50 mg/mL for bolus and not exceeding 200 mg/min of calcium gluconate in adults, which is readily achievable through a central line [^112phrys] [^116dwCC6] [^116TuBda].

> But wait, what about compatibility and safety nuances with central lines. I need to ensure we avoid simultaneous administration with ceftriaxone because of the risk of fatal precipitates; sequential administration with thorough line flushing is acceptable in patients older than 28 days, and this is especially important when using central lines where precipitates can embolize [^115jt1BQ] [^111CZNLi]. I should also confirm that rapid injection can cause bradycardia, hypotension, or arrhythmias; therefore, even with central access, calcium gluconate should be infused slowly with ECG monitoring to mitigate cardiotoxicity risk [^117FriqZ] [^116dwCC6].

> Let me consider special populations and monitoring. In renal impairment, start at the low end of dosing ranges and monitor serum calcium frequently, which is feasible with central access allowing serial sampling. In pediatrics, weight-based dosing and slower infusion rates apply, and central lines facilitate both accurate delivery and monitoring in critically ill children [^115W3gk7] [^116dwCC6].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "push" might be prohibited outright. Hold on, I should verify the rate language. The FDA label permits bolus administration when diluted and infused within recommended rate limits; thus, a slow IV push or bolus via central line is acceptable if it respects adult maximums of about 200 mg/min of calcium gluconate with continuous ECG monitoring, whereas truly rapid undiluted pushes should be avoided due to arrhythmia risk [^116dwCC6].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, IV calcium gluconate can be administered through a central line, and central venous access is often preferred when available because it reduces extravasation and tissue injury risk and facilitates higher or repeated dosing in emergencies. Ensure appropriate dilution, adhere to adult and pediatric rate limits, avoid coadministration with ceftriaxone, and monitor the ECG and serum calcium during administration [^116dwCC6] [^116LcxMH] [^115jt1BQ].

---

Yes, **IV calcium gluconate can be administered through a central line** when necessary, but it should be diluted and infused slowly with continuous ECG monitoring to minimize risks of arrhythmias, hypotension, and extravasation-related tissue injury [^116dwCC6] [^112hWsvw]. Central access is preferred in critical care or when rapid, high-volume calcium is needed, as it reduces peripheral vein irritation and allows safer infusion [^112phrys]. Always confirm catheter patency, avoid mixing with incompatible agents (e.g. ceftriaxone, bicarbonate, phosphate), and monitor serum calcium closely during infusion [^115jt1BQ] [^111CZNLi] [^116dwCC6].

---

## Clinical indications for central line administration

Central venous access is indicated for **IV calcium gluconate** in the following scenarios:

- **Critical illness**: Severe hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia with ECG changes, or calcium channel blocker toxicity requiring rapid correction [^116LcxMH] [^115Gqbhv].

- **Peripheral access limitations**: Poor peripheral veins or need for prolonged infusion.

- **High-volume infusions**: Continuous or repeated dosing where central access reduces peripheral irritation [^112phrys].

---

## Advantages of central line administration

Administering calcium gluconate via a central line offers several advantages over peripheral administration:

- **Reduced extravasation risk**: Central lines minimize the risk of extravasation and tissue necrosis associated with calcium-containing solutions [^112phrys].

- **Higher infusion rates**: Central lines can accommodate higher infusion rates and volumes, facilitating rapid correction of severe hypocalcemia or hyperkalemia [^116qFTMK].

- **Improved patient comfort**: Central lines reduce the need for repeated peripheral injections, thereby improving patient comfort and compliance.

---

## Potential risks and complications

While central line administration of calcium gluconate is generally safe, **potential risks and complications** include:

- **Arrhythmias**: Rapid infusion can cause bradycardia, asystole, or ventricular fibrillation, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions or those receiving digitalis glycosides [^117FriqZ].

- **Hypotension**: Rapid administration may cause vasodilation and hypotension [^117FriqZ].

- **Infection**: Central lines carry a risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections, necessitating strict aseptic technique and regular monitoring [^115q9scB].

- **Thrombosis**: Central lines may be associated with thrombotic complications, although calcium gluconate is less thrombogenic than calcium chloride [^116dKwr8].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Several clinical guidelines provide recommendations on the **administration of IV calcium gluconate via central lines**:

- **Dilution and infusion rate**: Calcium gluconate should be diluted to a concentration of 10–50 mg/mL and infused slowly, not exceeding 200 mg/min in adults. Continuous ECG monitoring is recommended during administration [^116dwCC6] [^117FriqZ].

- **Monitoring**: Serum calcium levels should be monitored every 4–6 hours during intermittent infusions and every 1–4 hours during continuous infusions [^116dwCC6].

- **Drug interactions**: Calcium gluconate should not be mixed with ceftriaxone, bicarbonate, or phosphate-containing solutions due to the risk of precipitation [^111CZNLi] [^115jt1BQ].

---

## Clinical scenarios where central line administration is preferred

Central line administration of calcium gluconate is **particularly beneficial** in the following clinical scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale for central line administration** |
|-|-|
| Severe hypocalcemia | Rapid correction requires high infusion rates and volumes |
| Hyperkalemia with ECG changes | Rapid calcium administration is critical to stabilize cardiac membranes |
| Calcium channel blocker toxicity | High-dose calcium infusions are required for hemodynamic stabilization [^11412ZMm] |
| Prolonged calcium infusion therapy | Central lines reduce peripheral vein irritation and improve patient comfort |

---

## Precautions and monitoring

When administering calcium gluconate via a central line, the following precautions and monitoring steps are **essential**:

- **Confirm catheter patency**: Ensure the central line is patent and properly positioned before administration [^notfound].

- **Monitor ECG**: Continuous ECG monitoring is recommended during infusion to detect arrhythmias early [^115Dj4Kk].

- **Monitor serum calcium**: Regularly check serum calcium levels to avoid hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia [^116dwCC6].

- **Aseptic technique**: Strict aseptic technique must be maintained to prevent infection [^113YU671].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Dilution**: Dilute calcium gluconate to 10–50 mg/mL before administration [^116dwCC6].

- **Infusion rate**: Do not exceed 200 mg/min in adults; monitor ECG continuously [^116dwCC6].

- **Monitoring**: Check serum calcium every 4–6 hours during intermittent infusions and every 1–4 hours during continuous infusions [^116dwCC6].

- **Drug interactions**: Avoid mixing with ceftriaxone, bicarbonate, or phosphate-containing solutions [^111CZNLi] [^115jt1BQ].

- **Clinical judgment**: Use central lines when rapid correction is needed or peripheral access is inadequate.

---

IV calcium gluconate can be administered through a central line, providing advantages such as reduced extravasation risk, higher infusion rates, and improved patient comfort. However, careful monitoring and adherence to clinical guidelines are **essential** to minimize risks and ensure safe administration [^116dwCC6].

WARNINGS

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Before therapy with ceftriaxone:one is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins and other beta-lactam agents or other drugs. This product should be given cautiously to penicillin and other beta-lactam agent sensitive patients. Antibacterial drugs should be administered with caution to

any patient who has demonstrated some form of allergy, particularly to drugs. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require the use of subcutaneous epinephrine and other emergency measures. As with all beta-lactam antibacterial agents, serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity reactions (i.e., anaphylaxis) have been reported. In case of severe hypersensitivity reactions, treatment with ceftriaxone must be discontinued immediately and adequate emergency measures must be initiated.

Interaction with Calcium-Containing Products

Interaction with Calcium-Containing Products

Do not use diluents containing calcium, such as Ringer's solution or Hartmann's solution, to reconstitute Ceftriaxone for Injection vials or to further dilute a reconstituted vial for IV administration because a precipitate can form. Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can also occur when Ceftriaxone for Injection is mixed with calcium-containing solutions in the same IV administration line. Ceftriaxone for Injection must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, Ceftriaxone for Injection and calcium-containing solutions may be administered sequentially of one another if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with

a compatible fluid. In vitro studies using adult and neonatal plasma from umbilical cord blood demonstrated that neonates have an increased risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, CONTRAINDICATIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Complications of regional citrate anticoagulation: accumulation or overload? [^114Zkgd2]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Numerous protocols for RCA have been proposed and tested. They differ by solution type (ACD, trisodium citrate, diluted citrate solutions) and CRRT modality (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF)). All these protocols require pre-filter administration of a citrate solution at the required dose to reach approximately 3 to 4 mmol of citrate per liter of blood in the circuit. Such a dose is usually sufficient to decrease ionized calcium to the target range (0.2 to 0.35 mmol/l according to the protocol used). Post-filter calcium is monitored to ensure adequate anticoagulation and permit citrate dose adjustment according to pre-defined models. In current CRRT machines, citrate administration rate is coupled with blood flow, minimizing the risk of variation in citrate concentration. A calcium chloride solution needs to be administered either at the end of the circuit or directly through a separated central line to compensate for calcium loss in the effluent in the form of CCC (Fig. 2). Calcium reinfusion rate is adjusted according to sequentially measured systemic ionized calcium level (targeting physiological range). After the initiation phase, regular monitoring (every 6 h) of post-filter, systemic, and total calcium levels (with total/ionized ratio calculation) should be performed. Since, according to the composition of dialysate/replacement fluids used, magnesium might also need to be supplemented, daily monitoring of serum magnesium levels is also advisable.

Fig. 2
Schematic view of a CRRT circuit with regional citrate administration in CVVHD mode. Alternative modes can be used (postdilution CVVH, combined pre- and postdilution CVVH, CVVHDF, etc.) according to the protocol used. Citrate solution is administered at the beginning of the CRRT circuit. It forms citrate–calcium complexes, which are largely removed from the blood at the level of the filter. Only complexes which are not removed through the hemofilter return to the patient's blood and need to be metabolized

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^112phrys]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — management when symptoms progress or become severe: If symptoms progress and serum calcium remains < 7 mg/dL, magnesium levels should be measured and supplemented as needed; if severe symptomatic hypocalcemia develops despite oral calcium and calcitriol, a 12-lead EKG should be performed, corrected QT interval measured, and intravenous calcium administered. For rapid correction, an i.v. bolus (1–2 g of calcium gluconate [93 mg elemental calcium in one vial of calcium gluconate] in 50 mL of 5% dextrose infused over 20 min) can be used; calcium gluconate (90 mg of elemental calcium per 10 mL) is preferred for peripheral i.v. repletion, whereas calcium chloride (270 mg of elemental calcium per 10 mL) is prone to phlebitis and local tissue necrosis unless delivered through a central line or appropriately diluted.

### Bioequivalence and pharmacokinetics of intravenous calcium during cesarean delivery [^111XtVcd]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Few studies have assessed the dose ratio of calcium gluconate to calcium chloride or defined the time course of change in serum ionized calcium concentration after intravenous injection.

Methods

In a bioequivalence (dose ratio) trial, parturients undergoing cesarean delivery were randomly assigned to receive calcium chloride (0.5g) or calcium gluconate (1.5 or 2g) by 10-min intravenous infusion. Venous serum ionized calcium concentration was measured before calcium infusion and approximately 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60min after infusion start. These data were combined with serum ionized calcium concentration measurements in parturients who received 1g calcium chloride or saline placebo in two recent clinical trials to define the pharmacokinetics of intravenous calcium over the first hour during and after drug administration.

Results

The bioequivalence study enrolled 34 participants, from whom were collected 181 serum ionized calcium concentration measurements. The dose ratio of calcium gluconate to calcium chloride was 3.11 (95% CI, 2.77 to 3.48). Population pharmacokinetics of calcium were determined using 311 serum ionized calcium concentration measurements from 70 parturients. The pharmacokinetics of intravenous calcium were described by a two-compartment model with systemic clearance of 0.18 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.27) l/min, distributional clearance of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.03 to 1.56) l/min, central volume of 10.9 (95% CI, 9.3 to 12.6) l, and peripheral volume of 16.5 (95% CI, 12.5 to 24.7) l. After adjusting for the dose ratio, calcium gluconate and calcium chloride had identical time courses. A 1-g infusion of calcium chloride resulted in a peak increase in serum ionized calcium concentration of 0.39 (0.38 to 0.42mM), which decreased by half (29 [23 to 40] min) after initiation of the 10-min infusion.

Conclusions

This study confirmed a 3:1 dose ratio of calcium gluconate to calcium chloride and estimated the pharmacokinetics over the first hour after intravenous delivery. These data inform clinical care and may guide future trials assessing calcium efficacy to reduce bleeding in obstetric patients.

### Dextrose, sodium chloride, sodium lactate, potassium chloride, and calcium chloride (dextrose in lactated Ringer's) [^115RWLzQ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

This solution is for intravenous use only.

Dosage is to be directed by a physician and is dependent upon age, weight, clinical condition of the patient and laboratory determinations. Frequent laboratory determinations and clinical evaluation are essential to monitor changes in blood glucose and electrolyte concentrations, and fluid and electrolyte balance during prolonged parenteral therapy.

When a hypertonic solution is to be administered peripherally, it should be slowly infused through a small bore needle, placed well within the lumen of a large vein to minimize venous irritation. Carefully avoid infiltration.

Fluid administration should be based on calculated maintenance or replacement fluid requirements for each patient.

The presence of calcium ions in this solution should be considered when phosphate is present in additive solutions, in order to avoid precipitation.

Some additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist. When introducing additives, use aseptic techniques. Mix thoroughly. Do not store.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Ceftriaxone must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing intravenous solutions such as 5% Dextrose in Lactated Ringer's Injection via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone and 5% Dextrose in Lactated Ringer's Injection may be administered sequentially if the infusion

lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [see Contraindications, Warnings, Drug Interactions, Pediatric Use].

Pediatric Use

There is no specific pediatric dose. The dose is dependent on weight, clinical condition and laboratory results. See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS.

2.1 Important Administration Information

NOURESS is for intravenous infusion after dilution and admixing use only. Prior to administration, NOURESS must be diluted and used as an admixture in parenteral nutrition solutions.

The resulting solution is for intravenous infusion into a central or peripheral vein. The choice of a central or peripheral venous route should depend on the osmolarity of the final infusate. Solutions with osmolarity of 900 mOsm/L or greater must be infused through a central catheter [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.2 Preparation and Administration Information

Prior to administration, NOURESS must be diluted and used as an admixture in parenteral nutrition solutions.
NOURESS is to be prepared only in a suitable work area such as a laminar flow hood (or an equivalent clean air compounding area). The key factor in the preparation is careful aseptic technique to avoid inadvertent touch contamination during mixing of solutions and addition of other nutrients.
NOURESS is for addition to amino acid solutions prior to further admixing with dextrose injection using a parenteral nutrition container.

### Calcium gluconate (calcium gluconate in sodium chloride) [^114ro9NM]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.4	Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Cardiac Arrhythmias with Rapid Administration

Rapid injection of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection may cause vasodilation, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, syncope and cardiac arrest. To avoid adverse reactions that may follow rapid intravenous administration, Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection should be infused slowly. If rapid intravenous bolus of Calcium Gluconate Injection is required, the rate of intravenous administration should not exceed 200 mg/minute in adults and 100 mg/minute in pediatric patients and ECG monitoring during administration is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

5.5	Aluminum Toxicity

Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection contains aluminum, up to 25 mcg per liter, that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 mcg/kg/day to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.

5.1 Arrhythmias with Concomitant Cardiac Glycoside Use

Cardiac arrhythmias may occur if calcium and cardiac glycosides are administered together. Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Administration of Calcium Gluconate Injection should be avoided in patients receiving cardiac glycosides. If concomitant therapy is necessary, Calcium Gluconate Injection should be given slowly in small amounts and with close ECG monitoring [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.2 End-Organ Damage due to Intravascular Ceftriaxone-Calcium Precipitates

Concomitant use of ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate Injection is contraindicated in neonates (28 days of age or younger) due to cases of fatal outcomes in neonates in which a crystalline material was observed in the lungs and kidneys at autopsy after ceftriaxone and calcium were administrated simultaneously through the same intravenous line. Concomitant administration can lead to the formation of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates that may act as emboli, resulting in vascular spasm or infarction [see Contraindications (4)].

In patients older than 28 days of age, ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate Injection may be administered sequentially, provided the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid. Do not administer Ceftriaxone simultaneously with Calcium Gluconate Injection via a Y-site in any age group.

5.3 Tissue Necrosis and Calcinosis

Intravenous administration of Calcium Gluconate Injection and local trauma may result in calcinosis cutis due to transient increase in local calcium concentration. Calcinosis cutis can occur with or without extravasation of Calcium Gluconate Injection, is characterized by abnormal dermal deposits of calcium salts, and clinically manifests as papules, plaques, or nodules that may be associated with erythema, swelling, or induration. Tissue necrosis, ulceration, and secondary infection are the most serious complications.

If extravasation occurs or clinical manifestations of calcinosis cutis are noted, immediately discontinue intravenous administration at that site and treat as needed.

5.4 Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Cardiac Arrhythmias with Rapid Administration

Rapid injection of Calcium Gluconate Injection may cause vasodilation, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, syncope and cardiac arrest. To avoid adverse reactions that may follow rapid intravenous administration, Calcium Gluconate Injection should be diluted with 5% dextrose or normal saline and infused slowly.

### Anesthetic anaphylactic shock in an emergency cesarean section: a case report [^113tkzvZ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Anaphylactic shock due to succinylcholine was suspected. Immediate interventions included:

- Epinephrine: Initial boluses of 20–30 µg were administered intravenously, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.3 µg/kg/min to maintain blood pressure and improve cardiac output.
- Methylprednisolone: 40 mg was administered intravenously to reduce inflammation and prevent biphasic reactions. Methylprednisolone is commonly used as an adjunct in anaphylaxis management to reduce inflammation and prevent biphasic reactions. While corticosteroids do not act immediately, they help in long-term control.
- Crystalloids: Intravenous normal saline was used for rapid volume expansion to correct hypotension.
- Sodium bicarbonate and calcium gluconate were also administered to correct blood pH and electrolyte imbalances.

A central venous catheter was placed to allow for precise central venous pressure measurements, rapid fluid administration, and medication delivery. In addition, invasive blood pressure monitoring via arterial line placement was utilized to provide continuous and accurate blood pressure measurements, allowing for real-time assessment of the patient's hemodynamic status. In this case, the patient had a history of intracranial vascular malformations, raising concerns about the potential for an aneurysm rupture when she experienced a sudden and severe drop in blood pressure. Although cardiac arrest was not observed, the significant hypotension prompted immediate concern for possible intracranial bleeding. As a precautionary measure, an ice cap was applied to provide cerebral protection in case the hypotension was secondary to a rupture of the vascular malformation. About 30 min later, the patient's vital signs gradually stabilized with BP at 90–110/60–65 mmHg, HR at 55–60 beats per minute, and SpO2 at 100%.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^11412ZMm]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

The workgroup agreed that each of the treatments here mentioned could be considered as first line alone or in combination. A supplementary round of Delphi did not allow prioritization of one intervention over another. Comparative studies were rare, and more than one interventions were done concurrently in most of the studies reviewed. Therefore, the workgroup emphasized that the first-line treatments should be prioritized based on the desired effect tailored to the individual patient's clinical condition (Fig. 3; Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 2).

The workgroup recommended IV calcium as a first-line treatment based on improvement in contractility and blood pressure observed in some case series and animal studies. This therapy is readily available and carries little risk provided central venous or secure peripheral venous access is available. The regimen often used for the administration of 10% calcium chloride in CCB-poisoned adults is 10–20 mL (1–2 g) every 10–20 minutes or an infusion at 0.2–0.4 mL/kg/hr (0.02–0.04 g/kg/hr). When 10% calcium gluconate is given, notably to minimize peripheral vein irritation, the dose regimen frequently used is 30–60 mL (3–6 g) every 10–20 minutes or an infusion at 0.6–1.2 mL/kg/hr (0.06–0.12 g/kg/hr).

### Calcium chloride dihydrate [^113zMrR2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of calcium chloride injection for the treatment of acute symptomatic hypocalcemia have been established in pediatric patients.

The use of calcium chloride injection is contraindicated in newborns if they require (or are expected to require) ceftriaxone intravenous treatment because of the risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium, regardless of whether these products would be received at different times or through separate intravenous lines [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In pediatric patients older than 28 days of age, calcium chloride injection and ceftriaxone intravenous solutions may be administered sequentially one after another if infusion lines at different sites are used, infusion lines are replaced, or infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with physiological salt solution to avoid precipitation. Do not mix or administer calcium chloride injection simultaneously with ceftriaxone, even if using different infusion lines or different infusion sites as it can lead to precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium.

Calcium chloride injection contains aluminum that may be associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Because of immature renal function, preterm infants receiving prolonged parenteral nutrition treatment with calcium chloride injection may be at higher risk of aluminum toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of calcium chloride injection did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients.

8.6 Renal Impairment

The use of calcium chloride injection in patients with renal impairment may increase the risk of a higher calcium-phosphorus product. For patients with renal impairment, initiate calcium chloride injection at the lowest recommended dose within the recommended dose range [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Monitor serum calcium levels frequently based on the severity of the renal impairment and the risk of a high calcium-phosphorus product (e.g., every 4 hours).

### Association between hypocalcemia and mortality in trauma patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114G3xdk]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

There is currently no guideline specifying the timing of calcium measurement in trauma patients, so clinicians should be vigilant for trauma-induced hypocalcemia. The European guideline recommends promptly correcting serum calcium levels below 7.5 mg/dL or serum iCa below 0.9 mmol/L in trauma patients who have received a blood transfusion. Calcium chloride is the preferred supplement because it contains approximately three times more element calcium than calcium gluconate; however, due to its high potential to irritate veins and surrounding tissues, it should be administered via a central line. The role of prophylactic calcium administration remains unclear and requires further study to analyze the optimal endpoint for calcium repletion.

Regarding the necessity of calcium supplements, no set procedure has demonstrated their advantages. Moore et al supported administering 1 g of calcium gluconate for every 1–2 units of blood product infused, emphasizing that iCa levels should be monitored early and frequently in patients with hemorrhagic shock. Additionally, in the presence of MT, Wade et al conducted a retrospective study on trauma patients with MT to evaluate the relationship between increased intravenous calcium administration during MT and survival, using the calcium-to-blood product ratio (CBR) as a measure. Their findings suggest that a CBR of 50 or higher within the first 4 hours of resuscitation was associated with improved survival, which translates to approximately 1 g of calcium gluconate for every 5 units of blood product. However, Helsloot et al found no significant difference in coagulopathy or transfusion requirement between patients with hypocalcemia (iCa < 1.10 mmol/L) and those with hypercalcemia (iCa ≥ 1.30 mmol/L). Their study does not support routine early empiric calcium supplementation. Thus, early calcium administration in trauma patients receiving a blood transfusion to prevent hypocalcemia still requires validation through large prospective studies.

### Bullous skin reaction seen after extravasation of calcium gluconate [^112trtP8]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Intravenous (IV) calcium is usually given to temporarily treat the effects of hyperkalaemia on muscle and heart. When extravasation of a calcium gluconate infusion occurs, there may be rapid and marked swelling and erythema, with signs of soft-tissue necrosis or infection, and ensuing extensive local calcification, called calcinosis cutis. We report a 26-year-old woman who was hospitalized for exacerbation of acute intermittent porphyria. She had a history of hypertension and chronic renal failure. On the second day of her hospitalization, she developed hyperpotassaemia (6.7 mEq/L potassium; normal range 3.5–5 mEq/L). She was given an IV infusion of 10 mL calcium gluconate into the left dorsal pedal vein. Bullous skin reactions occurred in the infusion area nearly 2 h after administration. The patient's leg was elevated and the lesions cleaned with 0.9% saline. By day 9 of hospitalization, the lesions had markedly regressed. Several drugs have been associated with dermoepidermal blistering as an adverse drug reaction, but there is only one existing report in the literature about this side-effect associated with calcium gluconate. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of bullous skin reactions, which may be a predictor of extravasation and necrosis, when treating patients with IV calcium gluconate.

### Treatment of acute hypocalcemia in critically ill multiple-trauma patients [^116zQMFB]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Recent data indicate that critically ill, adult multiple trauma patients receiving specialized nutrition support commonly experience hypocalcemia (ionized serum calcium [iCa] ≤ 1.12 mmol/L). However, validated methods for the treatment of acute hypocalcemia are lacking.

Methods

The efficacy of a single dose of calcium gluconate using an empiric IV calcium gluconate graduated dosing regimen was evaluated in 37 patients. Patients with an iCa of 1–1.12 mmol/L (mild hypocalcemia) were provided 1–2 g of IV calcium gluconate. Patients with an iCa of < 1 mmol/L (moderate to severe hypocalcemia) were given 2–4 g. The calcium gluconate was infused at a rate of 1 g/h in a small-volume admixture. Serum iCa determination was repeated on the following day.

Results

One to 2 g of IV calcium gluconate was effective in normalizing iCa for 23 out of 29 patients (79%) with mild hypocalcemia and 2–4 g was effective for 3 of 8 patients (38%) with moderate to severe hypocalcemia. The individual response to calcium therapy (g/d) or when normalized to body weight (mg/kg/d) was highly variable.

Conclusions

One to 2 g of IV calcium gluconate were effective for most patients with mild hypocalcemia; however, treatment of moderate to severe hypocalcemia with 2–4 g of IV calcium gluconate was often unsuccessful. Further study with frequent serial ionized serum calcium and phosphorus determinations and electrocardiographic monitoring appears to be indicated for patients with moderate to severe hypocalcemia.

2.2 Important Administration Instructions

Set the vent to the closed position on a vented intravenous administration set to prevent air embolism.
Use a dedicated line without any connections to avoid air embolism.
CLINIMIX E is for intravenous infusion only into a central or peripheral vein. The choice of a central or peripheral venous route should depend on the osmolarity of the final infusate. Solutions with osmolarity of 900 mOsm/L or greater must be infused through a central catheter [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
For central vein infusion only: CLINIMIX E 4.25/10, 5/15, 5/20, 8/10, 8/14
For central or peripheral vein infusion: CLINIMIX E 2.75/5 and 4.25/5
The solution should be inspected for precipitates before admixing, after admixing, and again before administration.
Use a 0.22 micron filter for administration of CLINIMIX E. If a lipid is also administered, use a 1.2 micron filter.
If lipid emulsion is added, do not use administration sets and lines that contain di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). Administration sets that contain polyvinyl chloride (PVC) components have DEHP as a plasticizer.
Ceftriaxone must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing intravenous solutions such as CLINIMIX E via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone and CLINIMIX E may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Calcium Gluconate Injection contains 100 mg of calcium gluconate per mL which contains 9.3 mg (i.e., 0.465 mEq) of elemental calcium.
Dilute Calcium Gluconate Injection prior to use in 5% dextrose or normal saline and assess for potential drug or IV fluid incompatibilities [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].
Inspect Calcium Gluconate Injection visually prior to administration. The solution should appear clear and colorless to slightly yellow. Do not administer if there is particulate matter or discoloration.
Use the diluted solution immediately after preparation.
Administer Calcium Gluconate Injection intravenously via a secure intravenous line to avoid calcinosis cutis and tissue necrosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
Administer Calcium Gluconate Injection by bolus administration or continuous infusion:

For bolus intravenous administration:
Dilute the dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] of Calcium Gluconate Injection in 5% dextrose or normal saline to a concentration of 10–50 mg/mL prior to administration. Administer the dose slowly and DO NOT exceed an infusion rate of 200 mg/minute in adults or 100 mg/minute in pediatric patients, including neonates. Monitor patients, vitals and electrocardiograph (ECG) during administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Dilute Calcium Gluconate Injection in 5% dextrose or normal saline to a concentration of 5.8–10 mg/mL prior to administration. Administer at the rate recommended in Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] and monitor patients, vitals, calcium and ECG during the infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Calcium Gluconate Injection is supplied in single-dose vials and pharmacy bulk packages [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage

Individualize the dose of Calcium Gluconate Injection within the recommended range depending on the severity of symptoms of hypocalcemia, the serum calcium level, and the acuity of onset of hypocalcemia.

Table 1 provides dosing recommendations for Calcium Gluconate Injection in mg of calcium gluconate for neonates, pediatric and adult patients.

2.3 Serum Calcium Monitoring

Measure serum calcium every 4 to 6 hours during intermittent infusions with Calcium Gluconate Injection and measure serum calcium every 1 to 4 hours during continuous infusion.

IV. Warnings and Cautions

Contraindications:

None known

Precautions for use:

- Solutions are NOT INTENDED FOR DIRECT INFUSION.

- Do not use if particulate matter is present or if the solution is cloudy.

Note: Some opacity of the plastic container due to moisture absorbance by the PVC during the sterilization process may be observed. This is normal and does not affect the quality or the safety of the product. This white, hazy appearance will diminish gradually over time. This advice only applies to the plastic container. Do not use if the solution itself is cloudy or contains particulate matter.

- Do not use if the container is damaged, leaking or if there is any visible sign of deterioration.

Note: The over wrap serves as a moisture barrier. Upon removing the solution bag, small droplets of condensation may be present in the packaging. This is considered normal. After removing the over wrap gently squeeze the inner bag which protects the sterility of the solution. Discard if any leaks are observed or if an excessive amount of solution is noted within the over wrap.

- Do not reuse solution. Discard any unused or partially used solutions.

- Protect from sharp objects.

- Verify that solutions have been appropriately connected to avoid leaks.

- The set should be loaded and primed for use within 8 hours of the start of the collection.

- Carry out the apheresis procedure in accordance with the detailed instructions of the manufacturer of the apheresis device.

Adverse Reactions:

Donors being reinfused with citrated blood or blood components may experience side effects due to the presence of citrate. Patients being transfused with the blood components could also experience a reaction to the citrated blood components. The major symptom experienced by donors is paraesthesia. Should this occur the reinfusion should be stopped or the reinfusion rate decreased. In the event of inadvertent bolus of the product administer calcium gluconate.

Drug Abuse / Dependence:

Both solutions are intended to be used only with automated apheresis devices for collecting human blood and blood components. CP2D is used as an anticoagulant solution and AS-3 is intended for use a nutrient solution. Neither solution is intended for direct infusion; neither solution produces a pharmacological effect.

Resuscitation — additions to care for specific causes during cardiac arrest include attempts at active rewarming for hypothermia. For the dialysis patient/known hyperkalemic patient, give calcium gluconate 10% 1 g IV bolus over 2 minutes (for pediatrics, the dose is 100 mg/kg which is 1 mL/kg), can repeat the dose if no response, or calcium chloride 10% 1 g IV bolus over 2 minutes (for pediatrics, the dose is 20 mg/kg which is 0.2 mL/kg); sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg IV is also listed. For tricyclic antidepressant overdose, additions to care include sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg IV. For hypovolemia, additions to care include normal saline 2 L IV (or 20 mL/kg, repeated up to 3 times for pediatrics). If the patient is intubated at the time of arrest, assess for tension pneumothorax and misplaced ETT; if tension pneumothorax suspected, perform needle decompression and assess ETT, if misplaced, replace ETT.

### Improving vasopressor use in cardiac arrest [^111Wn7W5]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Route of administration

A variety of routes for drug administration have been used over the years. These include intra-cardiac, central intravenous (IV), endobronchial, peripheral IV and intraosseous access (IO). Current guidelines do not recommend intracardiac or endobronchial administration due to the risk of injury / misplacement (intracardiac) or variable / uncertain absorption (endobronchial). If central venous access is already in place then it should be the preferred route for drug administration due to the short transit time of drugs injected to reach the central circulation. The risks of misplacement and damage to adjacent structure through attempting central venous cannulation during CPR likely outweigh the benefits. The intramuscular route for adrenaline administration in cardiac arrest might facilitate very early drug administration, but ongoing uncertainties regarding its absorption preclude its routine use outside the research setting.

The use of IO drug administration has been growing in recent years. In the PARAMEDIC2 one third of participants received drug treatment through the IO route whilst in the COCA (calcium for out of hospital cardiac arrest) trial it was as high as two thirds. Potential advantages of the IO route are that it is easier and quicker to obtain IO rather than IV access. Disadvantages include misplacement and variable drug absorption, although a post hoc analysis of survivors in the COCA trial showed similar ionised calcium levels on hospital admission between patients administered calcium chloride via the IO and IV route.

Observational studies comparing IO and IV drug administration are often limited by the risk of confounding due to resuscitation time bias as IO is often used as a rescue therapy after initial attempts at IV access have failed. The PARAMEDIC2 study, was able to provide unique insights in the potential efficacy of the IO route as it included matched patients who received placebo through both the intravenous and IO routes. The study reported that the adjusted odds ratios for ROSC were similar in the IV (adjusted OR 4.07 (95% CI 3.42–4.85)) and IO groups (adjusted OR 3.98 (95% CI 2.86–5.53), p-value for interaction 0.90). Survival rates were not statistically different for long-term survival and favourable neurological outcomes between the IO and IV group.

The potential benefit of an IO first strategy in out of hospital cardiac arrest is being tested in ongoing trials in Denmark (NCT05205031) and the United Kingdom (ISCRTN 14223494).

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^111zz2s4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

General medical hyperglycemia — prehospital management directs providers to provide volume expansion with normal saline bolus; adult dosing is normal saline 20 mL/kg at rate of 1000 mL/hr, and pediatric dosing is normal saline 10 mL/kg bolus IV, reassess, and repeat up to 40 mL/kg total; if symptoms of hypovolemic shock, follow Shock Guideline. If findings of hyperkalemia are present, administer IV fluids and consider administration of calcium chloride 1 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes (do not exceed 1 mL per minute) OR calcium gluconate 2 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes with constant cardiac monitoring. If findings of hyperkalemia, consider administration of sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg (max dose of 50 mEq) IV bolus over 5 minutes and consider albuterol 5 mg via nebulizer (can be repeated if no response is seen). Reassess patient status, including vital signs, mental status, and signs of dehydration, and if mental status changes, reassess blood glucose level and provide appropriate treatment if hypoglycemia has developed. Disposition guidance is to transport to closest appropriate receiving facility. Patient safety notes state that overly aggressive administration of fluid in hyperglycemic patients may cause cerebral edema or dangerous hyponatremia, and that cerebral edema is a leading cause of death in children with DKA but is very rare in adults; closely monitor for signs of altered mental status and increased intracranial pressure, immediately discontinue IV fluids and elevate head of bed if signs of increased ICP develop; asymptomatic hyperglycemia poses no risk to the patient while inappropriately aggressive interventions to manage blood sugar may harm patients.

### Ceftriaxone [^115jt1BQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Ceftriaxone may be administered intravenously or intramuscularly.

Do not use diluents containing calcium, such as Ringer's solution or Hartmann's solution, to reconstitute ceftriaxone vials or to further dilute a reconstituted vial for IV administration because a precipitate can form. Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can also occur when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium-containing solutions in the same IV administration line. Ceftriaxone must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone and calcium-containing solutions may be administered sequentially of one another if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid (see WARNINGS).

There have been no reports of an interaction between ceftriaxone and oral calcium-containing products or interaction between intramuscular ceftriaxone and calcium-containing products (IV or oral).

Neonates

Hyperbilirubinemic neonates, especially prematures, should not be treated with ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone is contraindicated in premature neonates (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Ceftriaxone is contraindicated in neonates (≤ 28 days) if they require (or are expected to require) treatment with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition because of the risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Intravenous doses should be given over 60 minutes in neonates to reduce the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy.

Pediatric Patients

For the treatment of skin and skin structure infections, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg given once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day). The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams.

For the treatment of acute bacterial otitis media, a single intramuscular dose of 50 mg/kg (not to exceed 1 gram) is recommended (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).

For the treatment of serious miscellaneous infections other than meningitis, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg, given in divided doses every 12 hours. The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams.

In the treatment of meningitis, it is recommended that the initial therapeutic dose be 100 mg/kg (not to exceed 4 grams). Thereafter, a total daily dose of 100 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 4 grams daily) is recommended. The daily dose may be administered once a day (or in equally divided doses every 12 hours). The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 14 days.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^115wbZiE]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypocalcemia

Hypocalcemia is caused by decreased gastrointestinal absorption, decreased bone resorption, or increased kidney Ca excretion. It can occur in various conditions such as disturbances in serum magnesium levels, toxic shock syndrome, tumor lysis syndrome, post-thyroid surgery, and fluoride poisoning. Hypocalcemia can be divided into four main categories: neonatal, with high PTH, with low PTH, and miscellaneous. These various categories are demonstrated in Table 9. The main determinant of hypocalcemia is ionized calcium concentration. The onset of symptoms in hypocalcemia typically occurs when ionized levels drop to around a level of 0.63 mmol/L and present as tingling sensations in the extremities and face, carpopedal spasm, stridor, tetany, muscle cramps, and seizures. Patients may also exhibit hyperreflexia with positive Chvostek and Trousseau signs. Cardiac implications include reduced contractility and an increased risk of heart failure, while hypocalcemia can exacerbate digitalis toxicity. Prompt treatment of hypocalcemia involves administration of calcium, typically 10% calcium gluconate or calcium chloride. 1 mL of 10% calcium gluconate contains 100 mg of calcium gluconate, which is equivalent to 9.3 mg of elementary calcium. Contrastingly, 1 mL of 10% calcium chloride contains 100 mg of calcium chloride which is equal to 27 mg of elementary calcium per milliliter. For acute symptomatic cases, give 20 mg/kg of elemental calcium IV over a 10–20 min period, which is approximately 2 ml/kg of 10% calcium gluconate or 0.7 ml/kg of 10% calcium chloride. Follow this with an IV infusion of 200 mg/kg (or 500 mg/kg in neonates) of 10% calcium gluconate over 24 h. Monitor serum calcium levels at intervals of 4 to 6 h to maintain a total serum calcium concentration within the range of 1.75 to 2.25 mmol/L. Any irregularities in magnesium, potassium, and pH should be addressed as well. One thing to note is that untreated hypomagnesemia can render hypocalcemia resistant to treatment. Hence, it is crucial to assess serum magnesium levels when dealing with hypocalcemia, especially if the condition does not respond adequately to the initial calcium therapy.

### Incompatibility of the short-acting benzodiazepine remimazolam with common perioperative medication [^113B542C]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Remimazolam (Byfavo ®) is incompatible with the commonly used peri-operative medications ampicillin/sulbactam, calcium gluconate, clindamycin, dexamethasone, dimenhydrinate, the 148mval/l electrolyte - glucose 1% solution E148G1 ®, furosemide, the 4% gelatine volume expander gelafundin ®, heparin sodium, insulin, the commonly used crystalloids jonosteril ® and sterofundin ®, meropenem, sodium bicarbonate 8.4%, prednisolone, thiopental and tranexamic acid, although, as a matter of principle, this applies of course only to the specific galenic formulation given by the pharmaceutic manufacturer and tested in our study. Administration of remimazolam (Byfavo ®) and one of the above-mentioned drugs over the same iv line must be avoided. The results strongly affirm remimazolam's safety requirements: A separate line for remimazolam and an approved compatible baseline infusion is mandatory and an alternative way to administer bolus medication is required.

### Treatment of moderate to severe acute hypocalcemia in critically ill trauma patients [^112nTVuH]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Our recent data indicate that 21% of critically ill, adult, multiple-trauma patients receiving specialized nutrition support experience hypocalcemia. However, evidence-based methods for the treatment of moderate to severe acute hypocalcemia (ionized calcium concentration [iCa] < 1 mmol/L) are lacking.

Methods

The efficacy of an infusion of 4 g of calcium gluconate was evaluated in 20 critically ill, adult, multiple-trauma patients with moderate to severe hypocalcemia (iCa < 1 mmol/L). The calcium gluconate was infused at a rate of 1 g/h in a small volume admixture. A serum iCa determination was obtained on the following day.

Results

Calcium gluconate infusion significantly increased serum iCa from 0.90 ± 0.08 mmol/L to 1.16 ± 0.11 mmol/L (p < .001) on the following day. This dosage regimen was successful for achieving a serum iCa > 1 mmol/L for 19 of 20 (95%) hypocalcemic patients and achieved a concentration > 1.12 mmol/L in 14 (70%) of the patients. Two patients developed mild hypercalcemia (iCa of 1.34 mmol/L and 1.38 mmol/L) postinfusion.

Conclusions

A short-term infusion of 4 g of intravenous (IV) calcium gluconate for the treatment of moderate to severe hypocalcemia appears to be a promising regimen for critically ill, adult, multiple-trauma patients.

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker toxicity — supportive therapy and dosing: Because of improvements in heart rate and blood pressure, coupled with low risk of adverse effects, intravenous calcium is often recommended as a first-line therapy if central or reliable peripheral venous access is present, and a systematic review of treatment for calcium channel blocker poisoning not specific to SND found 7 animal studies demonstrating reduced mortality and hemodynamic improvement with intravenous calcium, while hemodynamic benefits in humans were less consistent in 11 case series and 21 case reports; both calcium chloride and calcium gluconate (to minimize peripheral vein irritation) are commonly used. Glucagon dosing in this setting is described as the standard therapy in cardiac arrest being a bolus of 10 mg given over 3 to 5 minutes, and because effects are transient, an infusion of 3 to 5 mg/h is also initiated; although scores of case reports and case series (the largest comprised of 9 patients) have been published showing increased heart rate in the settings of beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdose, no clinical trials have been performed. High-dose insulin therapy has been studied using a bolus of 1 unit/ kg followed by an infusion of 0.5 units/ kg/ h in patients with severe beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker poisoning.

### Hypocalcaemia in patients with prostate cancer treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab: prevention supports treatment completion [^1164LQAR]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Severe hypocalcaemia

For symptomatic or at-risk patients, or those possibly/probably non-compliant with oral calcium supplement, intravenous calcium should be administered if corrected serum calcium concentration falls below 1.9 mmol/l (ionized calcium < 1.0 mmol/l; i.e.g.rade ≥ 2). Asymptomatic patients with a corrected serum calcium below 1.9 mmol/l can rapidly become critically ill, and so it is important to treat and monitor these patients closely.

Intravenously administered calcium gluconate (10%) is preferred to calcium chloride, which is a strong irritant. It can be given as repeated 50–100 mL boluses in 5% dextrose or by continuous infusion. If calcium chloride is given, it should be administered via a central line to prevent irritation of veins. In order to avoid precipitation of calcium salts, phosphate and bicarbonate should not be infused with the calcium. Patients with severe hypocalcaemia should also receive oral calcium supplements (as described above) and vitamin D (e.g. 50,000 IU each week for 8 weeks or calcitriol 0.5–1 μg/day for patients with hypoparathyroidism) as needed. Treatment should be repeated until symptoms have subsided. It should be noted that hypocalcaemia can be prolonged, so continuous administration of a dilute solution of calcium for a few days may be required. Magnesium replacement should also be given (as described above) to those who are hypomagnesaemic. Cardiac monitoring during intravenous calcium administration is recommended because the rapid elevation of serum calcium concentration required to correct hypocalcaemia can result in cardiac arrhythmia.

### Routine changing of intravenous administration sets does not reduce colonization or infection in central venous catheters [^115q9scB]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of routine intravenous (IV) administration set changes on central venous catheter (CVC) colonization and catheter-related bacteremia.

Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled trial.

Setting

Eighteen-bed intensive care unit (ICU) in a large metropolitan hospital.

Participants

Two hundred fifty-one patients with 404 chlorhexidine gluconate and silver sulfadiazine-coated multi-lumen CVCs.

Interventions

CVCs inserted in the ICU and in situ on day 4 were randomized to have their IV administration sets changed on day 4 (n = 203) or not at all (n = 201). Use of fluid containers and blood product administration sets was limited to 24 hours. CVCs were removed when not required, infection was suspected, or in place on day 7. Catheter cultures were performed on removal by blinded laboratory staff. Catheter-related bacteremia was diagnosed by a blinded intensivist using strict definitions. Data were collected regarding catheter duration, site, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, patient age, diagnosis, hyperglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, immune status, number of fluid containers and IV injections, and administration of propofol, blood, total parenteral nutrition, or lipid infusion.

Results

There were 10 colonized CVCs in the group receiving a set change and 19 in the group not receiving one. This difference was not statistically significant on Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. There were 3 cases of catheter-related bacteremia per group. Logistic regression found that burns diagnosis and increased ICU stay significantly predicted colonization.

Conclusion

IV administration sets can be used for 7 days in patients with short-term, antiseptic-coated CVCs.

### Perioperative administration of buffered versus non-buffered crystalloid intravenous fluid to improve outcomes following adult surgical procedures [^112SAEXh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Perioperative fluid strategies influence clinical outcomes following major surgery. Many intravenous fluid preparations are based on simple solutions, such as normal saline, that feature an electrolyte composition that differs from that of physiological plasma. Buffered fluids have a theoretical advantage of containing a substrate that acts to maintain the body's acid-base status - typically a bicarbonate or a bicarbonate precursor such as maleate, gluconate, lactate, or acetate. Buffered fluids also provide additional electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium, and calcium, more closely matching the electrolyte balance of plasma. The putative benefits of buffered fluids have been compared with those of non-buffered fluids in the context of clinical studies conducted during the perioperative period. This review was published in 2012, and was updated in 2017.

Objectives

To review effects of perioperative intravenous administration of buffered versus non-buffered fluids for plasma volume expansion or maintenance, or both, on clinical outcomes in adults undergoing all types of surgery.

Search Methods

We electronically searched the Clinicaltrials.gov major trials registry, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 6) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1966 to June 2016), Embase (1980 to June 2016), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to June 2016). We handsearched conference abstracts and, when possible, contacted leaders in the field. We reran the search in May 2017. We added one potential new study of interest to the list of 'Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate this trial into formal review findings when we prepare the review update.

Selection Criteria

Only randomized controlled trials that compared buffered versus non-buffered intravenous fluids for surgical patients were eligible for inclusion. We excluded other forms of comparison such as crystalloids versus colloids and colloids versus different colloids.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened references for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We resolved disagreements by discussion and consensus, in collaboration with a third review author. We contacted trial authors to request additional information when appropriate. We presented pooled estimates for dichotomous outcomes as odds ratios (ORs) and for continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed data via Review Manager 5.3 using fixed-effect models, and when heterogeneity was high (I² > 40%), we used random-effects models.

Main Results

This review includes, in total, 19 publications of 18 randomized controlled trials with a total of 1096 participants. We incorporated five of those 19 studies (330 participants) after the June 2016 update. Outcome measures in the included studies were thematically similar, covering perioperative electrolyte status, renal function, and acid-base status; however, we found significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity among the included studies. We identified variable protocols for fluid administration and total volumes of fluid administered to patients intraoperatively. Trial authors variably reported outcome data at disparate time points and with heterogeneous patient groups. Consequently, many outcome measures are reported in small group sizes, reducing overall confidence in effect size, despite relatively low inherent bias in the included studies. Several studies reported orphan outcome measures. We did not include in the results of this review one large, ongoing study of saline versus Ringer's solution. We found insufficient evidence on effects of fluid therapies on mortality and postoperative organ dysfunction (defined as renal insufficiency leading to renal replacement therapy); confidence intervals were wide and included both clinically relevant benefit and harm: mortality (Peto OR 1.85, 95% CI 0.37 to 9.33; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 6 deaths, 276 participants; low-quality evidence); renal insufficiency (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.98; I² = 0%; 4 trials, 22 events, 276 participants; low-quality evidence). We noted several metabolic differences, including a difference in postoperative pH measured at end of surgery of 0.05 units - lower in the non-buffered fluid group (12 studies with a total of 720 participants; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.07; I² = 61%). However, this difference was not maintained on postoperative day one. We rated the quality of evidence for this outcome as moderate. We observed a higher postoperative serum chloride level immediately after operation, with use of non-buffered fluids reported in 10 studies with a total of 530 participants (MD 6.77 mmol/L, 95% CI 3.38 to 10.17), and this difference persisted until day one postoperatively (five studies with a total of 258 participants; MD 8.48 mmol/L, 95% CI 1.08 to 15.88). We rated the quality of evidence for this outcome as moderate.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence is insufficient to show effects of perioperative administration of buffered versus non-buffered crystalloid fluids on mortality and organ system function in adult patients following surgery. Benefits of buffered fluid were measurable in biochemical terms, particularly a significant reduction in postoperative hyperchloraemia and metabolic acidosis. Small effect sizes for biochemical outcomes and lack of correlated clinical follow-up data mean that robust conclusions on major morbidity and mortality associated with buffered versus non-buffered perioperative fluid choices are still lacking. Larger studies are needed to assess these relevant clinical outcomes.

Calcium in in-hospital cardiac arrest — No RCTs were identified that compared calcium administration with no calcium administration during in-hospital cardiac arrests, hence the weak recommendation against the use of calcium for adults with in-hospital cardiac arrests. Calcium is administered for special circumstances, such as hyperkalemic cardiac arrest, hypocalcemia and calcium channel overdose, but the ILCOR review notes that there is insufficient data from existing trials to evaluate these subgroups.

### Child with suspected hypocalcemia [^1175DUnU]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Child with suspected hypocalcemia — initial evaluation focuses on confirming true hypocalcemia and assessing symptoms; calcium is bound heavily to albumin and hypoalbuminic states can cause hypocalcemia with ionized calcium levels maintained and the child asymptomatic, and if the child is having seizures or spasms due to hypocalcemia then intravenous calcium therapy is indicated; if symptomatic, the child needs to be admitted and started on intravenous calcium therapy, which is very irritating to the veins, and preferably therapy should be given using a central line.

Important Administration Instructions

Do not use in series connections.
Do not introduce additives into the DUPLEX® Container.
Administer Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection intravenously over approximately 30 minutes.
After the indicated stability time periods, unused portions of solutions should be discarded.
Vancomycin, amsacrine, aminoglycosides, and fluconazole are physically incompatible with ceftriaxone in admixtures. When any of these drugs are to be administered concomitantly with ceftriaxone by intermittent intravenous infusion, it is recommended that they be given sequentially, with thorough flushing of the intravenous lines (with 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose in water (D5W)) between the administrations.
Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection should not be physically mixed with or piggybacked into solutions containing other antimicrobial drugs due to possible incompatibility [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]
Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can also occur when Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection is mixed with calcium-containing solutions in the same IV administration line. Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection and calcium-containing solutions may be administered sequentially of one another if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
There have been no reports of an interaction between ceftriaxone and oral calcium-containing products or interaction between intramuscular ceftriaxone and calcium-containing products (IV or oral).

5.1	Arrhythmias with Concomitant Cardiac Glycoside Use

Cardiac arrhythmias may occur if calcium and cardiac glycosides are administered together. Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Administration of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection should be avoided in patients receiving cardiac glycosides. If concomitant therapy is necessary, Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection should be given slowly in small amounts and with close ECG monitoring [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.2	End-Organ Damage due to Intravascular Ceftriaxone-Calcium Precipitates

Concomitant use of ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in neonates (28 days of age or younger) due to cases of fatal outcomes in neonates in which a crystalline material was observed in the lungs and kidneys at autopsy after ceftriaxone and calcium were administrated simultaneously through the same intravenous line. Concomitant administration can lead to the formation of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates that may act as emboli, resulting in vascular spasm or infarction [see Contraindications (4)].

In patients older than 28 days of age, ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection may be administered sequentially, provided the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid. Do not administer Ceftriaxone simultaneously with Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection via a Y-site in any age group.

5.3	Tissue Necrosis and Calcinosis

Intravenous administration of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection and local trauma may result in calcinosis cutis due to transient increase in local calcium concentration. Calcinosis cutis can occur with or without extravasation of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection, is characterized by abnormal dermal deposits of calcium salts, and clinically manifests as papules, plaques, or nodules that may be associated with erythema, swelling, or induration. Tissue necrosis, ulceration, and secondary infection are the most serious complications.

If extravasation occurs or clinical manifestations of calcinosis cutis are noted, immediately discontinue intravenous administration at that site and treat as needed.

2.5 Drug Incompatibilities

Do not mix Calcium Gluconate Injection with ceftriaxone. Concurrent use of intravenous ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate Injection can lead to the formation of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates. Concomitant use of ceftriaxone and intravenous calcium-containing products is contraindicated in neonates (28 days of age or younger) [see Contraindications (4)]. In patients older than 28 days of age, ceftriaxone and calcium-containing products may be administered sequentially, provided the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid. Ceftriaxone must not be administered simultaneously with intravenous calcium-containing solutions via a Y-site in any age group [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.3)].
Do not mix Calcium Gluconate Injection with fluids containing bicarbonate or phosphate. Calcium Gluconate Injection is not physically compatible with fluids containing phosphate or bicarbonate. Precipitation may result if mixed.
Do not mix Calcium Gluconate Injection with minocycline injection. Calcium complexes minocycline rendering it inactive.

2.6 Preparation of Pharmacy Bulk Package

The pharmacy bulk package (PBP) of Calcium Gluconate Injection is intended for dispensing of single doses to multiple patients in a pharmacy admixture program. Penetrate the container closure only one time with a suitable sterile transfer device or dispensing set that allows measured dispensing of the contents. Use the PBP only in a suitable ISO Class 5 work area such as a laminar flow hood (or an equivalent clean air compounding area).

### The amount of calcium in calcium chloride-is there a need to clarify emergency treatment of hyperkalaemia algorithm? [^11611QSM]. Resuscitation (2022). Medium credibility.

European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines emphasize a rapid administration of calcium chloride (10 mL 10% CaCl 2) to protect the myocardium in the hyperkalaemia algorithm. However, calcium chloride preparations available in European markets vary from country to country. In our opinion, the drug dose recommended in the guidelines should not raise questions about the volume and amount of calcium in the intravenous supply and should be unambiguous to minimize the risk of error. Calcium dose should be given in terms of mmol/L or mEq or mg of calcium ions.

Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Cardiac Arrhythmias with Rapid Administration: To avoid adverse reactions that may follow rapid intravenous administration, Calcium Gluconate Injection should be diluted with 5% dextrose or normal saline and infused slowly, with careful ECG monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias. For continuous intravenous infusion: Dilute Calcium Gluconate Injection in 5% dextrose or normal saline to a concentration of 5. 8–10 mg/mL prior to administration. Administer at the rate recommended in Table 1 and monitor patients, vitals, calcium and ECG during the infusion [see Warnings and Precautions of elemental calcium.
12. 1 Mechanism of Action Intravenous administration of calcium gluconate increases serum ionized calcium level. Calcium gluconate dissociates into ionized calcium in plasma.

Ionized calcium and gluconate are normal constituents of body fluids.
12. 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Calcium Gluconate Injection is 100% bioavailable following intravenous injection. Metabolism Calcium itself does not undergo direct metabolism. The release of ionized calcium from intravenous administration of calcium gluconate is direct and does not seem to be affected by the first pass through the liver.

### Citrate anticoagulation and systemic heparin anticoagulation during continuous renal replacement therapy among critically-ill children [^112hWsvw]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation method

Before March 2017, RCA was not performed at our center; thus, the anticoagulation protocol was systemic heparin in all patients admitted before this date. After this date, anticoagulation was chosen based on age, clinical characteristics and diagnosis.

For heparin, infusion was started with 10 international units (IU)/kg/hr pre-filter. The heparin dose was subsequently adjusted toward a target postfilter activated clotting time (ACT) of 180–220 s. Dialysis and replacement solutions were the Dialisan (DVVHD BG2D, Baxter) and Prism0calB22 (Baxter) solutions.

For citrate administration, a Prismaflex system (Baxter), employing an automated RCA method with commercially available citrate-buffered solution (Prismocitrate 18/0, Baxter) and compatible bicarbonate dialysate solutions (Prism0cal B22, Baxter), was used. Citrate flow was coupled to blood flow and adjusted by the CRRT device to achieve the prescribed citrate dose (3 mmol per L of blood). CRRT was performed with pre-filter citrate anticoagulation and post-filter replacement fluid. Citrate effect was neutralized using a continuous calcium infusion, calcium gluconate 10% 50/50 with dextrose 5% (116 mmol/L). Calcium infusion was administered through a different central venous line. Only when a separate central line was not available, we administered calcium infusion through the return line of the circuit. An initial infusion rate of 1 mL/kg/h was used to maintain ionized calcium blood level. Calcium compensation was determined according to systemic ionized calcium values. The filter target iCa ++ level was between 0.25 and 0.35 mmol/L and the patient's iCa ++ target was between 1 and 1.2 mmol/L. The monitoring of iCa ++ concentrations was performed at several time points to ensure maintenance of target concentrations: at the 30th minute, the first, second and fourth hour of therapy, and then routinely every 4 h. Patient calcium levels were also checked one hour after any change in blood flow, citrate concentration, or dialysis. Biochemical indicators and electrolytes were checked every 12–24 h in both anticoagulation strategies.

Intervention 2: multiple changes towards reduction of MBD rate (June 2017–September 2017)

With the outcomes of intervention 1 and review of literature regarding MBD, the team came up with other evidence-based interventions to further enhance calcium and phosphorus supplementation. Parenteral calcium and phosphorus were added to the TPN as PDSA cycle 2. If the line is central in position, then 6 mL of 10% calcium gluconate and 0.35 mL of potassium phosphate were added to 100 mL of TPN. This provided calcium of 60 mg/100 mL TPN and phosphorus of 32 mg/100 mL TPN. If the line was not central in position, then 3.6 mL of 10% calcium gluconate and 0.2 mL of potassium phosphate were added to 100 mL of TPN. This provided calcium of 36 mg/100 mL TPN and phosphorus of 19 mg/100 mL TPN. Targeted intravenous intake of calcium was 20–90 mg/kg/day, and phosphorus was 35–70 mg/kg/day. Molar ratio of calcium and phosphorus for TPN was maintained at 1.5:1 to prevent precipitation. The orders for the TPN were written by the doctor on duty with the help of an Excel-based TPN worksheet. TPN was then prepared by the pharmacist with the help of the senior nurse. TPN was prepared under laminar airflow. Dextrose, amino acids, electrolytes, multivitamin, calcium and phosphorus were added in the same order for TPN preparation to prevent precipitation. The TPN was visually inspected for precipitation and if present, was discarded. TPN was stopped once enteral feeds of 125 mL/kg/day were achieved. HMF was added to EBM once feeds of 100 mL/kg/day were achieved as PDSA cycle 3. In the team meeting, the consensus was to change the target enteral calcium and phosphorus supplementation according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations. AAP recommends calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D supplementation of 150–200 mg/kg/day, 75–140 mg/kg/day and 400 IU/day, respectively.

### Hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets: a report of four cases with two novel variants in the VDR gene and successful use of intermittent intravenous calcium via a peripheral route [^116RDmXg]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Background Hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets (HVDRR) is caused by vitamin D receptor (VDR) defects. Patients with HVDRR do not respond to standard doses of calcitriol and oral calcium (Ca) treatment and need to be treated with intravenous Ca (IV-Ca) via a central route. However, central catheter-related complications can cause significant morbidity. Case presentation Four unrelated patients with HVDRR presenting with rickets and alopecia totalis were administered intermittent IV-Ca treatment (2–5 times/week) through a peripheral route. No complications such as infection, extravasation or arrhythmias were detected upon peripheral infusion. Peripheral 1–22 months' duration of IV-Ca normalized parathyroid hormone (PTH) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in all patients, after which, oral Ca of 200–400 mg/kg/day and calcitriol of 0.5 μg/kg/day were sufficient to maintain normal PTH levels. Molecular studies on the VDR gene showed a previously reported homozygous c.454C > T (p.Q152*) pathogenic variant in two patients. Two novel homozygous variants in the other two patients were detected: (1) c.756–2A > G, which affects the splice acceptor site, and (2) c.66dupG (p. I23Dfs*20) variant leading to a frameshift that results in a premature stop codon. Conclusions Peripheral IV-Ca treatment is an effective and practical alternative treatment mode that provides dramatic clinical benefit in patients with HVDRR.

### A.S.P.E.N. clinical guidelines: parenteral nutrition ordering, order review, compounding, labeling, and dispensing [^114BDNwR]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a high-alert medication available for patient care within a complex clinical process. Beyond application of best practice recommendations to guide safe use and optimize clinical outcome, several issues are better addressed through evidence-based policies, procedures, and practices. This document provides evidence-based guidance for clinical practices involving PN prescribing, order review, and preparation.

Method

A systematic review of the best available evidence was used by an expert work group to answer a series of questions about PN prescribing, order review, compounding, labeling, and dispensing. Concepts from the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) format were applied as appropriate. The specific clinical guideline recommendations were developed using consensus prior to review and approval by the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) Board of Directors. The following questions were addressed: (1) Does education of prescribers improve PN ordering? (2) What is the maximum safe osmolarity of PN admixtures intended for peripheral vein administration? (3) What are the appropriate calcium intake and calcium-phosphate ratios in PN for optimal neonatal bone mineralization? (4) What are the clinical advantages or disadvantages of commercially available premade ("premixed") multichambered PN formulations compared with traditional/customized PN formulations? (5) What are the clinical (infection, catheter occlusion) advantages or disadvantages of 2-in-1 compared with 3-in-1 PN admixtures? (6) What macronutrient dosing limits are expected to provide for the most stable 3-in-1 admixtures? (7) What are the most appropriate recommendations for optimizing calcium (gluconate) and (Na- or K-) phosphate compatibility in PN admixtures? (8) What micronutrient contamination is present in parenteral stock solutions currently used to compound PN admixtures? (9) Is it safe to use the PN admixture as a vehicle for non-nutrient medication delivery? (10) Should heparin be included in the PN admixture to reduce the risk of central vein thrombosis? (11) What methods of repackaging intravenous fat emulsion (IVFE) into smaller patient-specific volumes are safe? (12) What beyond-use date should be used for (a) IVFE dispensed for separate infusion in the original container and (b) repackaged IVFE?

### Thrombotic complications associated with right atrial lines in neonates and infants undergoing cardiac surgery. is calcium chloride a culprit? [^116dKwr8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine if a change from calcium chloride to calcium gluconate infusion resulted in a decreased incidence of atrial thrombi and thrombotic events in neonates undergoing cardiac surgery.

Design

A single-center, retrospective cohort analysis.

Setting

A single center in Houston, TX.

Participants

135 neonates undergoing cardiac surgery who had either a central venous catheter or tunneled atrial catheter placed and received infusions of either calcium chloride or calcium gluconate in the perioperative period.

Interventions

Patients either received a calcium chloride or calcium gluconate infusion in the perioperative period.

Measurements and Main Results

The study cohort consisted of 93 procedures using calcium chloride and 88 procedures using calcium gluconate infusions. The 181 procedures were recorded on a total of 135 patients. The overall incidence of thrombosis was 9.9%. The association between calcium chloride or calcium gluconate infusion and thrombotic events was assessed using a generalized linear mixed model for binary data (proc Glimmix, SAS v.9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC), to account for within-subjects correlation in patients requiring more than one procedure. The odds of thrombotic events when receiving calcium chloride infusion was 3.45 times that with calcium gluconate infusion in the setting of neonatal cardiac surgery (15% v 4.6%, odds ratio = 3.46, 95% confidence interval = 1.02, 11.7, p = 0.047).

Conclusions

In this single-center study, a significant decrease in the odds of an atrial catheter-related thrombus when a calcium gluconate infusion is used instead of calcium chloride was shown.

Hemorrhage control with appropriate adjuncts: Pressure dressings and wound packing (preferably with hemostatic products) for severe wounds. Tourniquets for significant extremity hemorrhage. Pelvic binders for suspected pelvic fractures. Wound packing or junctional tourniquets for junctional hemorrhage.
Vascular access must be promptly obtained: Intravenous access (18 g or greater) is preferred. If intravenous access cannot be rapidly established, obtain intraosseous access. Humeral intraosseous access is preferred over tibial access due to significantly higher flow rates.
Hemostatic resuscitation: WB when available. Low-titer O WB. Plasma. Packed RBCs. Aim for balanced 1:1 ratio of plasma to RBCs when possible.
Minimize crystalloid use: Limit crystalloid resuscitation to less than 500 mL. Excessive crystalloid worsens coagulopathy and contributes to hemodilution.
Prevent hypothermia: Use appropriate warming devices for blood products. Maintain patient temperature with passive warming measures. Consider active warming devices when available.
Tranexamic Acid (TXA) administration: For patients who will receive blood and are within 3 hours of injury. Adult dose options: 2 g intravenous/intraosseous once. 1 g intravenous/intraosseous over 10 min, followed by 1 g over 8 hours. Pediatric dose: 15 mg/kg (maximum 1 gram) intravenous over 10 min.
Calcium replacement: Consider calcium intravenous after 2 units of blood products have been administered and after other hemostatic interventions are completed. Calcium Gluconate 3 g (less caustic to tissue). Calcium chloride 1 g. Monitor for signs of hypercalcemia. Pediatric dose: 60 mg/kg calcium gluconate. 20 mg/kg calcium chloride. Flush the line with a minimum of 10 mL of saline Monitor closely for signs of intravenous/intraosseous infiltration/extravasation.

### Potassium phosphate, monobasic potassium phosphate, dibasic injection, (Potassium phosphates) [^115moqHb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.7 Vein Damage and Thrombosis

Potassium phosphates injection must be diluted and administered in intravenous fluids or used as an admixture in parenteral nutrition. It is not for direct intravenous infusion. The infusion of hypertonic solutions into a peripheral vein may result in vein irritation, vein damage and/or thrombosis. The primary complication of peripheral administration is venous thrombophlebitis, which manifests as pain, erythema, tenderness or a palpable cord. Remove the catheter as soon as possible and initiate appropriate medical treatment if thrombophlebitis develops.

When administered peripherally in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia, a generally recommended maximum concentration is phosphorus 6.8 mmol/100 mL (potassium 10 mEq/100 mL) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Parenteral nutrition solutions with an osmolarity of 900 mOsmol/L or greater must be infused through a central catheter [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

5.8 Laboratory
Monitoring

Monitor serum phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium concentrations during treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4)].

Background

Hypocalcemia is prevalent among critically ill patients requiring intensive care. Several epidemiological studies highlight a direct association between hypocalcemia and mortality. These data provide the impetus for current guidelines recommending parenteral calcium administration to normalize serum calcium. However, in light of the considerable variation in the threshold for calcium replacement, the lack of evidence to support a causal role of hypocalcemia in mortality, and animal studies illustrating that calcium supplementation may worsen outcomes, a systematic review is essential to evaluate whether or not the practice of calcium supplementation for intensive care unit (ICU) patients provides any benefit.

Objectives

To assess the effects of parenteral calcium administration in ICU patients on the following outcomes: mortality, multiple organ dysfunction, ICU and hospital length of stay, costs, serum ionized calcium concentration, and complications of parenteral calcium administration.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Controlled Trials, and the National Research Register. We hand-searched conference abstracts from the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the American Thoracic Surgery, the American College of Surgeons, the American College of Chest Physicians, the American College of Physicians, and the International Consensus Conference in Intensive Care Medicine. We checked references of publications and attempted to contact authors to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled and controlled clinical trials of ICU patients comparing parenteral calcium chloride or calcium gluconate administration with no treatment or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently applied eligibility criteria to trial reports for inclusion and extracted data.

Main Results

There are no identifiable studies that have evaluated the association between parenteral calcium supplementation in critically ill ICU patients and the following outcomes: mortality, multiple organ dysfunction, ICU and hospital length of stay, costs, and complications of calcium administration. Serum ionized calcium concentration was reported in 5 studies (12 trial arms, 159 participants). These trials showed a small but significant increase in serum ionized calcium concentration after calcium administration. These trials showed considerable statistical heterogeneity and differed extensively in the population studied (adult versus neonate), the indication (hypocalcemia versus prophylaxis) and threshold of hypocalcemia for which parenteral calcium was administered, and the timing of subsequent measurement of serum ionized calcium concentration to the extent that we consider a pooled estimate almost inappropriate.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no clear evidence that parenteral calcium supplementation impacts the outcome of critically ill patients.
