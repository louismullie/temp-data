## Question

What is the relationship between metformin and liver problems?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between metformin and "liver problems", including whether it causes or worsens them, its safety in hepatic impairment, the risk of lactic acidosis, the possibility of direct hepatotoxicity, potential benefits in chronic liver disease, and what major guidelines recommend. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory labeling and mechanistic rationale for caution in hepatic disease. Then, I should quantify the actual risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis and identify key modifiers. Next, I will examine evidence for true metformin hepatotoxicity. After that, I should assess potential benefits in cirrhosis, HCC prevention, and MASLD/NASH. Then, I will synthesize society guidance and reconcile apparent contradictions. Finally, I will propose a risk–benefit framework and practical monitoring plan with a clear bottom line for clinical decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory baseline. FDA labeling across multiple metformin products states that use in hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis, and therefore metformin is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment, which frames the core safety concern and explains why many combination labels advise avoidance in chronic liver disease and emphasize hepatic impairment as a risk factor for MALA. Wait, I initially recalled this as an absolute contraindication, but I should correct myself: the core metformin labels say "not recommended", while several SPLs and fixed-dose combinations operationalize this as "avoid use", reflecting a conservative stance rather than a universal black-box contraindication for hepatic disease per se. Mechanistically, this makes sense because metformin primarily suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis, the liver has high drug uptake via organic cation transporters, and impaired hepatic lactate clearance could potentiate acidosis risk in the setting of metformin's redox effects on lactate–pyruvate handling [^112migWo] [^116rT2Lg] [^115qm4Zx] [^114deXZH] [^116Y459j] [^111eB1go] [^117XcUKa] [^111g1Zjf] [^114yv39Q] [^111rXhz4].

> Next, I should review how often metformin-associated lactic acidosis actually occurs. The incidence in general diabetic populations is very low, on the order of roughly 3–10 per 100,000 patient-years, and most cases occur with additional precipitating factors such as renal dysfunction, hypoxia, sepsis, or shock; hepatic disease is a recognized risk factor, but precise attributable risk data in isolated hepatic impairment are limited and often confounded by multimorbidity. Hold on, let me verify the consistency of these numbers across higher-quality reviews and case aggregations; the JAMA systematic review, pharmacoepidemiology summaries, and case reports align in describing MALA as rare, with labeling consistently emphasizing risk mitigation in settings such as impaired renal function, contrast exposure, hypoxic states, older age, and hepatic impairment [^113Rx3fT] [^114tUtyv] [^113RhPGz] [^1114X1LU] [^114H88U7].

> I will now examine whether metformin directly injures the liver. True drug-induced liver injury from metformin appears exceedingly uncommon, with scattered case reports of cholestatic or mixed patterns and isolated hepatocellular injury, while randomized data generally show small, clinically modest changes in aminotransferases without a hepatotoxic signal; the FDA has no boxed warning for hepatotoxicity, and large trials in other populations have not signaled systematic liver injury attributable to metformin. But wait, I should not overstate absence of harm; rare idiosyncratic cases do exist and resolve with drug discontinuation, so vigilance is warranted when jaundice or significant enzyme elevations occur after initiation or up-titration [^114GoeZp] [^113Zce25] [^111aKhWt] [^113Nd1Yv] [^112migWo] [^115VykXy].

> Let me consider potential benefits in chronic liver disease, which complicate a simple risk narrative. Observational cohorts suggest that continuing metformin after a diagnosis of cirrhosis is associated with markedly improved survival and no observed MALA cases during follow-up; however, I need to emphasize that these are retrospective and inherently confounded, so causality cannot be assumed. Additionally, meta-analytic and cohort data link metformin exposure with lower hepatocellular carcinoma risk and improved survival after curative HCC therapy, though a possible negative interaction with sorafenib has been reported, which I should keep in mind when co-managing advanced HCC regimens [^112dAGbJ] [^117CqaeQ] [^116vumZF] [^114JpxwS].

> Now, I should review MASLD/NASH specifically. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions based on metabolic rationale alone; high-quality guideline statements consistently conclude that evidence is insufficient to recommend metformin as a MASLD- or MASH-targeted therapy, even though it remains indicated for glycemic control in T2DM and for cardiorenal indications. RCT data in nondiabetic NASH show no meaningful histologic benefit, and while older uncontrolled studies hinted at enzyme improvements, these do not substitute for robust antifibrotic efficacy in MASH management [^116RFbSq] [^111RFs4a] [^112d5m2W] [^111VBhvC].

> Next, I should synthesize guideline positions so recommendations are coherent. FDA labeling advises that metformin is not recommended in hepatic impairment due to lactic acidosis risk, and multiple product labels operationalize this as avoidance in chronic liver disease, whereas hepatology and diabetes guidelines for MASLD focus on CVD risk reduction with statins and structured fibrosis risk stratification rather than positioning metformin as a liver-directed therapy; ADA 2025 emphasizes MASLD screening pathways and still considers metformin first-line for glycemic control unless a contraindication exists. Wait a minute, I should verify the AASLD angle; they prioritize statins for CVD risk and do not endorse metformin to treat liver disease itself, which aligns with EASL/EASD/EASO language on non-recommendation for MASLD-targeted therapy [^112migWo] [^114deXZH] [^116Y459j] [^111eB1go] [^117XcUKa] [^111cGJzi] [^116RFbSq] [^111RFs4a] [^112Lwiss] [^1117t3F5] [^113qqfW8].

> I should now build a practical risk–benefit framework. In acute liver failure, decompensated cirrhosis with hypoxic or hemodynamic instability, or acute alcohol intoxication, the confluence of hypoxia and metabolic stress substantially elevates MALA risk, so avoidance is prudent and consistent with labeling that highlights hepatic impairment and hypoxic states as risk factors. Conversely, in compensated chronic liver disease with preserved synthetic function, the decision is individualized: potential glycemic, survival, and oncologic benefits must be balanced against a theoretical MALA risk that appears very low in stable outpatients without concurrent precipitants, while still acknowledging evidence quality constraints and the need for shared decision-making [^111g1Zjf] [^114yv39Q] [^1114X1LU] [^114H88U7] [^112dAGbJ] [^113Rx3fT].

> I need to ensure monitoring is concrete if metformin is used. Let me double-check label-based safeguards: obtain baseline and periodic renal function given its primacy in MALA risk, consider baseline liver tests and clinical surveillance for jaundice or cholestatic symptoms, hold metformin for acute illness with hypoxia or poor perfusion, implement sick-day rules, and interrupt around iodinated contrast per eGFR thresholds; educate on early MALA symptoms and check vitamin B12 periodically during long-term therapy. If MALA is suspected, immediate discontinuation and supportive care with consideration of prompt hemodialysis per EXTRIP guidance are warranted [^112migWo] [^115qm4Zx] [^11464kH9] [^111g1Zjf] [^114yv39Q] [^117WmgF6] [^117NzdMZ].

> But wait, what about the pathophysiology tying hepatic function to MALA risk. Metformin's principal glucose-lowering effects include inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis with redox shifts that selectively limit lactate and glycerol substrates, while hepatic impairment reduces lactate clearance; together with high hepatic and intestinal drug exposure, this provides a biologically plausible synergy for lactic acidosis during intercurrent hypoxic or renal events, even if metformin alone rarely causes acidosis at therapeutic levels in stable patients [^114Qeu86] [^111rXhz4] [^11279Dub].

> Let me reconsider for potential pitfalls and one correction I already made. I first framed hepatic disease as an absolute contraindication, but labeling more precisely states "not recommended", and many product-specific SPLs advise "avoid" in chronic liver disease, which is a cautious implementation rather than a uniform prohibition; this nuance matters when counseling patients with compensated cirrhosis whose diabetes control may substantially benefit from metformin, provided careful selection and monitoring are in place [^112migWo] [^116Y459j] [^111eB1go] [^117XcUKa].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the clinical bottom line. Metformin does not commonly cause direct liver injury, with only rare idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity reported, but hepatic impairment is a recognized risk factor for MALA and leads regulators to advise against use in such patients; meanwhile, observational data suggest potential survival and anticancer benefits in cirrhosis and HCC that have not yet translated into guideline endorsement of metformin as a liver-directed therapy. Therefore, avoid metformin in acute or decompensated hepatic failure and in settings with hypoxia or hemodynamic compromise, but consider individualized use in stable, compensated liver disease when benefits for diabetes control are compelling, with stringent monitoring and clear sick-day guidance [^114GoeZp] [^113Zce25] [^111aKhWt] [^113Nd1Yv] [^112migWo] [^112dAGbJ] [^116vumZF] [^114JpxwS] [^116RFbSq] [^111RFs4a].

---

Metformin is generally safe for the liver and does not cause clinically significant hepatotoxicity in most patients [^113Nd1Yv] [^114Qeu86]. However, it is contraindicated in advanced liver disease due to the risk of lactic acidosis, and should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment or acute liver failure. In patients with mild to moderate liver dysfunction, metformin can be used cautiously with close monitoring of liver function and lactic acidosis risk. Metformin is not recommended as a primary treatment for NAFLD or NASH [^116RFbSq], but may be continued for glycemic control in patients with compensated cirrhosis if tolerated and monitored [^112dAGbJ].

---

## Hepatic metabolism and pharmacokinetics of metformin

Metformin is not metabolized by the liver; it is excreted unchanged by the kidneys [^112migWo]. This **lack of hepatic metabolism** means it does not directly cause hepatotoxicity; however, in severe liver impairment, reduced lactate clearance can increase the risk of lactic acidosis [^114yv39Q].

---

## Hepatotoxicity and liver enzyme abnormalities

Metformin-associated hepatotoxicity is rare, with only isolated case reports of cholestatic hepatitis [^114GoeZp] and mixed-pattern injury that resolved after discontinuation [^111aKhWt]. Large trials report minimal effects on liver enzymes, with small mean changes and low rates of significant ALT elevations (> 3× ULN) [^113Nd1Yv] [^115VykXy]. Overall, **clinically significant hepatotoxicity** is uncommon [^114Qeu86].

---

## Lactic acidosis risk in hepatic impairment

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is rare but serious, and risk increases in advanced liver disease due to impaired lactate clearance [^114H88U7]. The incidence is low (3–10 per 100,000 patient-years) [^113Rx3fT], though it rises with severe hepatic impairment, renal dysfunction, or acute illness [^112xRwTb]. A key risk factor is **advanced liver disease** [^114deXZH].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines advise against use of metformin in severe hepatic impairment or acute liver failure due to lactic acidosis risk [^112migWo] [^116rT2Lg]. In mild to moderate liver dysfunction, metformin may be used cautiously with regular monitoring of liver function and lactate levels. A contraindication is **severe hepatic impairment**.

---

## Metformin in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)

Metformin is not recommended as primary therapy for NAFLD or NASH, as evidence does not show significant histologic improvement [^116RFbSq] [^111cGJzi]. However, it may be continued for glycemic control in patients with compensated cirrhosis if tolerated and monitored [^112dAGbJ]. Metformin should not be used as **primary therapy** for NAFLD/NASH [^1135XNN4].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

- **Baseline assessment**: Obtain liver function tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin) before starting metformin.
- **Regular monitoring**: Reassess liver function and lactate levels periodically, especially in patients with liver dysfunction.
- **Patient education**: Inform patients about symptoms of liver injury (jaundice, dark urine, fatigue) and lactic acidosis (malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress) [^1114X1LU].
- **Discontinuation criteria**: Stop metformin if significant liver enzyme elevations (> 3× ULN) or lactic acidosis occur [^114H88U7] [^116yFsEC].

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

Metformin use in patients with compensated cirrhosis has been associated with improved survival and reduced hepatic decompensation in observational studies [^112dAGbJ] [^117CqaeQ] however, caution is required in advanced liver disease due to lactic acidosis risk. Patients with **compensated cirrhosis** may benefit from continued metformin with monitoring.

---

Metformin is generally safe for the liver, with rare hepatotoxicity [^113Nd1Yv], but it should be **avoided in severe hepatic impairment** due to lactic acidosis risk [^112migWo]. In mild to moderate liver dysfunction, it can be used with monitoring, and it is not recommended as primary therapy for NAFLD or NASH [^116RFbSq].

### Continuation of metformin use following a diagnosis of cirrhosis significantly improves survival of patients with diabetes [^112dAGbJ]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

The risks and benefits of metformin use in patients with cirrhosis and diabetes are debated. Although data on a protective effect of metformin against liver cancer development have been reported, metformin is frequently discontinued once cirrhosis is diagnosed due to concerns about an increased risk of adverse effects in patients with liver impairment. This study investigated whether continuation of metformin after cirrhosis diagnosis improves the survival of patients with diabetes.

Diabetic patients diagnosed with cirrhosis between 2000 and 2010 who were on metformin at the time of cirrhosis diagnosis were identified (n = 250). Data were retrospectively abstracted from medical records. The survival of patients who continued versus discontinued metformin after cirrhosis diagnosis was compared using the log-rank test. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using Cox's proportional hazards analysis.

Overall, 172 patients continued metformin, whereas 78 discontinued it. Patients who continued metformin had a significantly longer median survival than those who discontinued (11.8 vs. 5.6 years overall, P < 0.0001; 11.8 vs. 6.0 years for Child A patients, P = 0.006; and 7.7 vs. 3.5 years for Child B/C patients, P = 0.04, respectively). After adjusting for other variables, the continuation of metformin remained an independent predictor of better survival, with an HR of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.24–0.78; P = 0.005). No patients developed metformin-associated lactic acidosis during follow-up.

### Metformin: An old but still the best treatment for type 2 diabetes [^112xRwTb]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Metformin is contraindicated in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic precoma, renal failure, or renal dysfunction. Additionally, it is not recommended in acute conditions that have the potential to alter renal function, such as dehydration, severe infection, shock, or the intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents. Metformin is also contraindicated in acute or chronic diseases that may cause tissue hypoxia, including cardiac or respiratory failure, recent myocardial infarction, or shock, as well as in cases of hepatic insufficiency, acute alcohol intoxication, and in lactating women.

Numerous reports in the literature have noted an increased risk of lactic acidosis with biguanides, primarily phenformin, with an event rate of 40–64 per 100,000 patient years, whereas the reported incidence with metformin is considerably lower at 6.3 per 100,000 patient years.

- **Structural and pharmacokinetic differences**: Metformin's unique attributes, such as poor adherence to the mitochondrial membrane, lack of interference with lactate turnover, unchanged excretion, and inhibition of electron transport and glucose oxidation, may account for these differences.

### The role of co-morbidity in the selection of antidiabetic pharmacotherapy in type-2 diabetes [^113Zsoew]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Metformin is usually preferred over other antidiabetic drugs for the first-line treatment of type-2 diabetes, provided it is not contraindicated and is tolerated by the patient. The decision on which antidiabetic agent to use is based on variables such as efficacy, cost, potential side effects, effects on weight, comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences. However, there is no guidance on how to consider these factors in the selection of antidiabetic drugs. In this work, we aim to summarize available evidence and provide pragmatic treatment recommendations from a clinical practice perspective. There are clear contraindications for some drugs in patients with impaired renal and liver function, and precautions are advised in those with heart failure for the use of metformin (NYHA III-IV) and glitazones.

On the other hand, GLP-1 analogs, DPP-4 inhibitors, and acarbose are generally less critical and can be used in the majority of patients. We identified the following gaps concerning the selection of antidiabetic drug treatment in patients with co-morbid conditions:

- **Guidelines fail to provide advice**: They do not offer guidance on the use of specific antidiabetic drugs in patients with co-morbidity.

- **Deficient literature**: Studies documenting antidiabetic drug use in patients with severely impaired renal function, diabetic retinopathy, cerebrovascular disease, and systolic heart failure are lacking.

- **Lack of specific data**: There is an absence of specific data on patients with multiple co-morbid conditions.

We postulate that the differential use of antidiabetic drugs in patients with co-morbid disease constellations needs further investigation and clarification.

Regarding the medical management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, particularly concerning glucose-lowering agents:

- **Guidelines recommendations**: The EASD/EASL/EASO 2024 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend metformin as MASLD-targeted therapy. However, it should be initiated for its respective indications, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), heart failure (HF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in cases of MASLD.

### The effect of metformin and standard therapy versus standard therapy alone in nondiabetic patients with insulin resistance and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): A pilot trial [^112d5m2W]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is increasing in prevalence and is related to underlying insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of metformin on the characteristic histopathologic lesions of NASH. This was a 12-month prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing diet and exercise alone to diet, exercise, and metformin in nondiabetic patients with insulin resistance and NASH.

Patients were randomized into either group A or B. Group A received a placebo, dietary counseling, and recommendations for weight loss and exercise four times per week. Group B received long-acting metformin 500 mg daily (titrated to 1000 mg daily) plus dietary counseling, recommendations for weight loss, and exercise four times per week. Histopathology was assessed at 12 months, and biopsies were scored by two pathologists who were blinded to all data.

Twenty-three subjects were screened, and 19 were randomized to either group A (n = 10) or group B (n = 9). Seven of the 10 subjects in group A completed the study, including repeat liver biopsy, while all patients in group B completed the study. Body mass index improved in both groups, decreasing by 1.7 kg/m² in group A and 0.9 kg/m² in group B, which was not significant when comparing control versus treatment.

The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance scores improved in both groups, decreasing by 1.14 in group A and 1.58 in group B, also not significant when comparing control versus treatment. No significant difference in histopathology was seen between groups on follow-up liver biopsy. Metformin appeared to have little effect in the improvement of liver function.

### Metformin hydrochloride [^115Pd2K2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce and manage this risk are provided below:

- **Renal impairment**: The postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based on the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:
	- Before initiating metformin hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
	- Metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [see Contraindications (4)].
	- Initiation of metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m².
	- Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g. the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.
	- In patients taking metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m², assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.

- **Drug interactions**: The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This includes drugs that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, or interfere with acid-base balance.

### Metformin — the gold standard in type 2 diabetes: What does the evidence tell us [^117H2PAq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Metformin is a cornerstone of oral antidiabetic treatment. Recent joint American and European guidelines recommend instituting metformin therapy along with lifestyle modification at the time type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is diagnosed. Metformin acts to reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve glucose uptake, and it may exert protective effects on pancreatic islet cells. Although metformin therapy produces substantial reductions in HbA1c, it does not produce body weight gain, is not associated with substantial risk for hypoglycaemia, and has neutral to positive effects on lipids and blood pressure. The major adverse events associated with metformin are gastrointestinal.

T2DM progresses even with initially effective monotherapy, and most patients will therefore receive combination therapy. When selecting agents to coadminister with metformin, a physician must consider efficacy in glycaemic control, safety, tolerability, and any effects that may compromise overall efficacy (e.g. effects on body weight, lipids, or blood pressure). In this regard, incretin-based therapies have characteristics that make them particularly suitable for add-on therapy with metformin.

### Risk of hepatic events associated with use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors versus glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and thiazolidinediones among patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [^116U4b5m]. Gut (2025). High credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has become a significant global health concern, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes, where its prevalence is over 60%. Given the asymptomatic nature of MASLD and its potential for adverse hepatic and extrahepatic outcomes, a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to its management is crucial. The efficacy of glucose-lowering drugs, such as metformin, has been observed to be limited in addressing the challenges posed by MASLD.

However, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have explored the potential benefits of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) or thiazolidinediones (TZD), which are commonly used in the management of type 2 diabetes, in ameliorating hepatic steatosis among patients with MASLD. Although these agents have shown positive effects in the treatment of MASLD and are recommended by guidelines, there is inconclusive evidence regarding hepatic outcomes among patients with MASLD.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) restrain glucose reabsorption at the proximal tubule of the kidney and have demonstrated cardiovascular and renal benefits beyond lowering glycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. Data from several RCTs have shown that SGLT-2i may have promising effects on fibrosis or steatosis, based on biological mechanisms of glucagon signaling pathways or insulin use reduction. However, these trials had short follow-up periods or a small number of patients, making it difficult to generate clinically meaningful evidence on this issue. One observational study, which included patients…

Laboratory abnormalities included elevated blood lactate levels, anion gap acidosis, increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs, age ≥ 65 years old, radiological studies with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states, excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high-risk groups are provided in the Full Prescribing Information.

If lactic acidosis is suspected, discontinue JANUMET and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^1158Mhr2]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Given the contraindications in the US, some might consider it a challenge to conduct a new clinical trial to evaluate the use of metformin in individuals with various degrees of impaired renal function, taking into account new criteria for assessing glomerular filtration. Evidence suggests that metformin is often already used in practice outside of the labeling contraindications, prescribed in full knowledge of the relevant cutoffs. For example, in a review of restrictions to metformin therapy conducted in Scotland, 24.5% of metformin users had filled a prescription despite active contraindications (3.4% had the specific local exclusion of a serum creatinine ≥ 1.7 mg/dL recorded twice on different days within 4 weeks).

A single case of lactic acidosis during 4,600 patient-years of follow-up occurred in a patient with an extensive acute myocardial infarction who developed acute renal failure and died the same day. Given the clinical scenario, the authors intimated that acidosis had occurred because of hemodynamic compromise related to the infarct and not to metformin accumulation.

In a U.S. study performed in the primary care practice setting, 4.5% of patients treated with metformin had creatinine levels > 1.4 mg/dL for women and 1.5 mg/dL for men. Two other studies of sicker patients admitted to hospitals in Germany and the U.S. confirmed a high frequency of metformin use despite various contraindications (73% and 27%, respectively).

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes [^111uUo5w]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Adverse effects of metformin are a significant consideration in its use as a first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes.

- **Gastrointestinal**: The most common side effects of metformin are nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Many patients (20–30%) report experiencing at least one of these side effects. The gastrointestinal side effects will be less impactful if metformin is taken with a meal and the dose is titrated gradually. Metformin therapy could be initiated at a low dose of 500 mg twice daily and increased by 500 mg daily every 1–2 weeks until the patient reaches the maximum tolerated dose. For those unable to tolerate the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects associated with the standard immediate-release formulation, extended-release tablets are available. While most patients either tolerate the side effects or switch to the slow-release option, approximately 5% discontinue the drug due to severe GI distress. The exact mechanisms of action which result in the common GI side effects are currently unknown. Possible mechanisms may be related to high concentrations of metformin within the GI tract, an increase in serotonin within GI cells, or metformin's effect on the gut microbiome, leading to opportunistic infections. Furthermore, it has been proposed that an individual's unique microbiome might influence metformin tolerance. Metformin's relationship with the gut microbiome continues to be a topic of scientific interest.

- **Lactic acidosis**: While the association between metformin and lactic acidosis is notably less significant compared with other biguanides, there is still a slight risk of developing lactic acidosis while taking metformin.

### Metformin: Update on mechanisms of action and repurposing potential [^115mHL6z]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Currently, metformin is the first-line medication to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in most guidelines and is used daily by over 200 million patients. Surprisingly, the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic action are complex and are still not fully understood. Early evidence highlighted the liver as the major organ involved in the effect of metformin on reducing blood levels of glucose. However, increasing evidence points towards other sites of action that might also have an important role, including the gastrointestinal tract, the gut microbial communities, and the tissue-resident immune cells.

At the molecular level, it seems that the mechanisms of action vary depending on the dose of metformin used and the duration of treatment. Initial studies have shown that metformin targets hepatic mitochondria; however, the identification of a novel target at low concentrations of metformin at the lysosome surface might reveal a new mechanism of action. Based on the efficacy and safety records in T2DM, attention has been given to the repurposing of metformin as part of adjunct therapy for the treatment of cancer, age-related diseases, inflammatory diseases, and COVID-19. In this review, we highlight the latest advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of action of metformin and discuss potential emerging novel therapeutic uses.

### Evaluation of liver function in type 2 diabetic patients during clinical trials: Evidence that rosiglitazone does not cause hepatic dysfunction [^114rvP12]. Diabetes Care (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether the idiosyncratic liver toxicity observed with troglitazone is molecule-specific or a class effect of thiazolidinediones. This concern arises from reports of hepatic failure and fatalities associated with troglitazone treatment, prompting inquiries about the hepatotoxicity potential of all thiazolidinediones or peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists, and the sufficiency of clinical trial data in identifying such risks.

Research Design and Methods: An analysis of liver function was conducted among type 2 diabetic patients participating in 13 double-blind, 2 open-label active-controlled, and 7 open-label extension studies of rosiglitazone treatment. These studies took place in outpatient centers across North America and Europe. The study involved over 6,000 participants aged 30–80 years with type 2 diabetes. Baseline liver function assessments were performed, and patients with alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or alkaline phosphatase levels exceeding 2.5 times the upper limit of the reference range were excluded. Liver enzyme levels were the primary outcome measure, with evaluations conducted at screening, baseline, every 4 weeks for the first 3 months, and at 6- to 12-week intervals subsequently.

### Zituvimet [^114LCqmC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Patients with hepatic impairment**: Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of Zituvimet in patients with hepatic impairment have not been performed.

- **Sitagliptin**: In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and Cmax of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score > 9) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

- **Metformin**: No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment.

- **Effects of age, body mass index (BMI), gender, and race**:
	- **Sitagliptin**: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis: A serious complication of a common drug [^113RhPGz]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is a rare and potentially life-threatening complication of metformin use. It typically occurs in diabetic patients with additional risk factors for lactic acidosis, such as kidney and liver conditions, malignancy, or the use of certain medications. We report a case of MALA in a man in his 70s with diabetes who presented with gradually worsening gastrointestinal symptoms, including severe abdominal pain and nausea. He reported these symptoms in the context of metformin use alongside acute kidney injury (AKI), likely induced by poor oral intake and excessive antibiotic use for a urinary tract infection. He was promptly treated with intravenous fluids and a bicarbonate drip to address both his prerenal AKI and lactic acidosis, which led to a rapid resolution of symptoms. His renal function normalized within 12 days of admission. Since diabetic patients commonly use metformin and are also at a higher risk of renal dysfunction, this case underscores the vulnerability of this group and the need for increased knowledge and awareness of MALA.

### Diabetes medications and risk of HCC [^114JpxwS]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Evidence regarding the potential effects of metformin in patients with HCC has been shown by a prior meta‐analysis, which revealed that metformin significantly prolonged the survival of diabetic patients with HCC who were treated with curative intent, whereas it had no effect in patients with more advanced stages of cancer. Consistent with this finding, Seo et al. found a significantly lower risk for HCC‐specific mortality (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.30–0.49) and for retreatment events (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.33–0.52) among metformin-treated patients.

Finally, a recent multicenter study reported that diabetic patients with HCC on metformin treatment had a significantly longer median overall survival than those who were not treated with metformin (22 vs. 15 months, p = 0.019), and that this effect was more relevant among patients with potentially curative stages of HCC. A unique finding is the potential negative impact on survival that metformin may have when used in combination with sorafenib, a well-known tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of HCC. Schulte et al. demonstrated that co-treatment with metformin tended to have a negative impact on survival in patients treated with sorafenib (7 vs. 11 months, p = 0.088). This finding may be explained by the potential of metformin to confer resistance to sorafenib, as was previously shown by Casadei Gardini et al. in their study of 279 patients, in which 19% were on metformin therapy and 12% were on insulin therapy. For patients with HCC on metformin, the use of sorafenib was associated with poor progression-free survival and overall survival.

### Serum lactate level and mortality in metformin-associated lactic acidosis requiring renal replacement therapy: A systematic review of case reports and case series [^112uUVbV]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

All information in this review, including baseline demographics, was directly extracted from the primary literature at the individual level. The diagnostic criteria for MALA described in this review refers to an arterial pH of less than 7.35 and a serum lactate level above 5 mmol/L in association with metformin exposure, or based on the author's clinical diagnosis where papers did not provide measurements of either pH or lactate level. The baseline renal function was defined as the lowest serum creatinine concentration that could be traced back prior to the index event. Peak serum creatinine and lactate levels were defined as the highest serum creatinine and lactate concentrations, respectively, after the index event and before RRT initiation.

- **Clinical parameters**: Other clinical parameters related to MALA, including pH, serum bicarbonate, and glucose, were also abstracted using the reported values closest in time prior to the peak lactate level or at the same time. Values greater than the highest bound and less than the lowest bound of the individual's laboratory reportable range were assigned the highest laboratory reportable value and a half of the detection limit, respectively.

- **Post-MALA conditions and metformin dosing**: Cases with post-MALA ESRD were defined as being long-term RRT dependent after the index event. Cases with acute kidney injury (AKI) were defined either by the authors of the source paper or by an absolute decline from baseline renal function. Inappropriateness of metformin dosing was defined by the contraindicated use of metformin if serum creatinine was higher than 1.4.

This is a case report of a 44-year-old obese female who developed subclinical hepatic injury four weeks after starting metformin for type 2 diabetes. She experienced a rise in her alanine aminotransferase levels, which peaked at five months (738 U/l) and rapidly declined within days of discontinuing metformin. No other positive evidence of alternative causes for the hepatic injury was found. The likelihood of metformin-induced injury was assessed as a 7 on the Naranjo scale of adverse drug reactions. A brief review of the 11 previously reported cases in the English medical literature is also provided.

### Metformin: an old but still the best treatment for type 2 diabetes [^1125tAHL]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Despite the use of metformin in cases where it is contraindicated, the incidence of lactic acidosis has not increased. Most patients with case reports relating metformin to lactic acidosis had at least one or more predisposing conditions for lactic acidosis.

Renal dysfunction is the most common risk factor associated with lactic acidosis, but so far there is no clear evidence indicating at which level of renal dysfunction metformin should be discontinued or contraindicated to prevent lactic acidosis. Some authors have suggested discontinuing its use when serum creatinine is above 1.5 mg/dL in men and 1.4 mg/dL in women, while others suggested a cut-off of 2.2 mg/dL and continuous use even in the case of ischemic cardiopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cardiac failure.

As serum creatinine can underestimate renal dysfunction, particularly in elderly patients and women, the use of estimated GFR (eGFR) has been advocated. The recommended eGFR thresholds are generally consistent with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines in the U.K. and those endorsed by the Canadian Diabetes Association and the Australian Diabetes Society. Metformin may be continued or initiated with an eGFR of 60 mL/min per 1.73 m², but renal function should be monitored closely (every 3–6 months). The dose of metformin should be reviewed and reduced (e.g. by 50% or to half-maximal dose) in those with an eGFR of 45 mL/min per 1.73 m², and renal function should be monitored closely (every 3 months). Metformin should not be initiated in patients at this eG.

### Changes in liver tests during 1-year treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes with pioglitazone, metformin or gliclazide [^113Nd1Yv]. Diabetic Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with type 2 diabetes are at an increased risk of liver damage, necessitating investigation into the hepatic effects of drugs used for treatment.

- **Methods**: Liver testing results from four 1-year, randomized, double-blind studies were analyzed. These studies compared the effects of pioglitazone, metformin, or the sulfonylurea gliclazide in treating over 3,700 patients with type 2 diabetes.

- **Results**: Pioglitazone resulted in mean reductions in hepatic enzyme levels of 3% to 18%, while gliclazide caused small increases of 3% to 13%. Metformin treatment resulted in small mean increases or decreases. At the end of treatment, more patients receiving pioglitazone had liver tests within the normal range (≥ 87%) compared to those receiving metformin (≥ 80%) or gliclazide (≥ 75%). Fewer patients on pioglitazone showed a large increase (> 3 times the upper limit of normal) in alanine aminotransferase levels during treatment (pioglitazone 0.9%, metformin 1.9%, gliclazide 1.9%).

- **Conclusions**: Pioglitazone treatment leads to a reduction in liver enzyme levels. Although the mechanism remains unclear, the results suggest potential beneficial effects on the liver during the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes using pioglitazone.

### Serum lactate level and mortality in metformin-associated lactic acidosis requiring renal replacement therapy: A systematic review of case reports and case series [^114tUtyv]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Metformin is recommended as the first-line pharmacological agent for type 2 diabetes by international guidelines for its weight neutrality and strong evidence-based cost-effectiveness in preventing diabetic vasculopathy. The spectrum of clinical application of metformin has continued to widen and presently includes metabolic syndrome and polycystic ovarian syndrome. The most feared adverse effect of metformin use is lactic acidosis, due to the historically reported mortality of approximately 50% during the period of 1960–2000 and about 25% since 2000. Although metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is rare, with a stable estimated incidence of 1 to 10 per 100,000, the stigma of this concern greatly limits the use of metformin in elderly populations where heart failure and renal impairment are common conditions.

The rarity and fatality of MALA make it difficult to obtain conclusive evidence regarding predisposing and prognostic factors, as most studies performed at the time of writing have been retrospective single-center or registry-based ecological studies with small sample sizes and without blood metformin levels. Consequently, whether to discontinue metformin in patients with cardiac or renal dysfunction remains undetermined, and a growing body of evidence demands a critical re-evaluation of contraindications for metformin. More importantly, standard management of MALA is uncertain, albeit renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been considered crucial in treating severe forms of MALA for its ability to provide renal support, eliminate metformin, and optimize acid-base status.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: Is routine screening and supplementation justified [^117WmgF6]? Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

In the absence of contraindications such as renal and hepatic dysfunction, recent guidelines advocate for the use of metformin as the first-line glucose-lowering agent, alongside lifestyle modification approaches. Despite its highly effective glycemic-lowering effects, metformin has long been shown to decrease vitamin B12 levels. In an early randomized controlled trial by DeFronzo et al, metformin decreased serum vitamin B12 levels by 22% and 29% compared to placebo and glyburide, respectively. This side effect of metformin has been demonstrated again in several ensuing cross-sectional studies, case reports, and randomized controlled trials.

The risk of developing metformin-associated vitamin B12 deficiency is significantly influenced by increasing age, metformin dose, and duration of use. In a nested case-control study performed among 155 adult Chinese DM patients on metformin and 310 controls, each 1 g/day increase in the metformin dose conferred an odds ratio of 2.9 (95% confidence interval, 2.15–3.87) for developing vitamin B12 deficiency. Among patients using metformin for ≥ 3 years, the adjusted odds ratio was 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.46–3.91) compared with those who had received metformin for ≤ 3 years.

The decrease in vitamin B12 absorption and levels following metformin use typically starts as early as the 4th month. Clinically overt features of vitamin B12 deficiency manifest by 5–10 years, owing to the large body stores in the liver that are not quickly depleted.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^116jCw7a]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Although metformin is eliminated renally, and accumulation may conceivably lead to lactic acidosis, there is currently limited systematic evidence to justify continued reliance on the creatinine-based contraindications in use in the U.S. In the modern era, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) provides a more reliable estimate of renal dysfunction. According to the available literature, metformin-associated lactic acidosis is exceedingly rare. Although the use of metformin has not been comprehensively assessed in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), extensive evidence suggests it is often used without adverse effects in those with mildly to moderately reduced renal function.

In the context of rising concerns regarding other glucose-lowering therapies, safety restrictions over the use of metformin in this population may result in the drug being unnecessarily discontinued prematurely, potentially leading to significant deterioration in glycemic control or the need for other glucose-lowering medications, which present their own safety concerns. An evidence-based approach to prescribing metformin in this group appears warranted, taking into account the pervasive use of eGFR in clinical care.

We therefore suggest that the guidelines for metformin use in the U.S. be updated. These recommendations should include eGFR thresholds that are generally consistent with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines in the U.K. and those endorsed by the Canadian Diabetes Association.

### EASL-EASD-EASO clinical practice guidelines on the management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) [^1135XNN4]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, specifically in terms of general principles, the 2024 EASD/EASL/EASO guidelines state there is insufficient evidence to recommend MASH-targeted pharmacotherapy in adult patients with MASH at the cirrhotic stage.

---

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^116WnjZC]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Without question, such a treatment program could not be implemented without meticulous clinical follow-up, clear communication with patients regarding risks and benefits of therapy, and adherence to frequent monitoring. The plan, therefore, should be modified in patients with suboptimal adherence to medical instructions or regular follow-up. It is clear that vigilance would be required so that cases of lactic acidosis do not emerge because of inappropriate use of metformin in patients with more advanced and/or unstable CKD.

Given the frequency with which clinicians must decide whether to continue or initiate metformin in mild-to-moderate CKD, these recommendations would have a profound impact on clinical practice. Such proposals, being consistent with the sentiments of several well-respected national guideline committees, should be reviewed by professional medical organizations in the U.S. such as the American Diabetes Association. If a consensus emerges, perhaps the Food and Drug Administration might reconsider the metformin-prescribing guidelines, which, like those of other nonbranded compounds, tend to remain static despite emerging evidence and changes in clinical care.

In the future, more research in this important area is needed, including prospective, randomized trials of metformin at varying degrees of renal impairment and/or closer examination of registries of CKD patients receiving metformin.

### Metformin-induced cholangiohepatitis [^113Zce25]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Drug-induced cholangiohepatitis accounts for 20–50% of non-viral chronic hepatitis cases. Metformin is the most commonly prescribed oral anti-diabetic drug from the biguanide class, used in the treatment of overweight and obese type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Metformin-induced cholangiohepatitis, characterized by marked elevations in serum liver transaminases and intrahepatic cholestasis, has been infrequently reported. Here, we report a case of acute cholangiohepatitis following the initiation of metformin treatment.

### Alogliptin and metformin hydrochloride [^116yFsEC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hepatic effects**: There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking alogliptin, although some reports contain insufficient information to establish the probable cause [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were reported in 1.3% of patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and 1.7% of patients treated with active comparators or placebo. In the EXAMINE trial, a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular (CV) risk, increases in serum alanine aminotransferase three times the upper limit of the reference range occurred in 2.4% of patients treated with alogliptin and in 1.8% of patients treated with placebo.

Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have clinically significant liver enzyme elevations and if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.

- **Vitamin B12 levels**: In metformin clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal vitamin B12 was observed.

### Glumetza [^115qm4Zx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:

- **Renal impairment**: The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based on the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:
	- Before initiating Glumetza, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
	- Glumetza is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m² [see Contraindications (4)].
	- Initiation of Glumetza is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m².
	- Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking Glumetza. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g. the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.
	- In patients taking Glumetza whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m², assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.

- **Drug interactions**: The concomitant use of Glumetza with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interact].

### Alogliptin and metformin hydrochloride [^1139JMsB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hepatic effects**: Inform patients that postmarketing reports of liver injury, sometimes fatal, have been reported during the use of alogliptin. If signs or symptoms of liver injury occur, patients should discontinue alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets and seek medical advice promptly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

- **Vitamin B12 levels**: Inform patients about the importance of regular hematological parameter monitoring while receiving treatment with metformin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

- **Hypoglycemia with concomitant use with insulin or insulin secretagogues**: Inform patients that hypoglycemia can occur, particularly when an insulin secretagogue or insulin is used in combination with alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets. Educate patients about the risks, symptoms, and appropriate management of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

- **Severe and disabling arthralgia**: Inform patients that severe and disabling joint pain may occur with this class of drugs. The time to onset of symptoms can range from one day to years. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if severe joint pain occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

- **Bullous pemphigoid**: Inform patients that bullous pemphigoid may occur with this class of drugs. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if blisters or erosions occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

- **Dosage**: Instruct patients to take alogliptin with metformin HCl tablets only as prescribed, twice daily, and that it should be taken with food. In the case of a missed dose, instruct patients not to double their next dose.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes [^111zWTnH]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

By the end of the 20th century, metformin's ability to safely lower glucose levels in patients with diabetes had been well-documented on a global scale. In 2002, metformin became the most commonly prescribed oral anti-hyperglycemic medication. In 2005, the International Diabetes Foundation published guidelines recommending metformin as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes. Nearly 50 years after the rediscovery of metformin, the World Health Organization added metformin to its list of essential medications in 2011.

Numerous clinical trials in the last decade have thoroughly assessed concerns regarding the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis in patients with comorbidities such as renal and hepatic dysfunction or congestive heart failure. Results from such trials continue to support metformin as a safe and effective medication for the vast majority of patients. In fact, the restriction for using metformin in patients with impaired kidney function has recently been relaxed.

### Optimizing metformin therapy in practice: Tailoring therapy in specific patient groups to improve tolerability, efficacy and outcomes [^111L3rL8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Metformin is the first-line medication for type 2 diabetes. It is effective and safe, provided some caution is taken in specific populations. In patients with chronic kidney disease, metformin may provide long-term benefits and is a first-line therapy for diabetes; however, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) must be assessed regularly to minimize the risk of metformin accumulation. When the eGFR is 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m², the dose should be reconsidered, and sick-day education provided. Metformin should be discontinued when eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Metformin accumulation may increase the risk for lactic acidosis if concomitant risk factors for hyperlactataemia (liver or respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, acute heart failure) are present; in these conditions, metformin is contraindicated, although the available evidence is reassuring.

Patients on metformin often complain of gastrointestinal side effects (mainly diarrhea and nausea) during therapy initiation, but they may sometimes occur after years of stable therapy. These usually resolve if the dose is carefully titrated or by switching to the extended-release formulation. Patients with obesity may benefit from the significant, although modest, metformin-associated weight loss and appetite reduction. During pregnancy, metformin is associated with a reduction in pregnancy complications, especially in obese women, but some concern remains because metformin crosses the placenta and is associated with a significantly lower mean birth weight than insulin. In the elderly, gastrointestinal tolerability must also be considered.

### Reversible acute blindness in suspected metformin-associated lactic acidosis [^113BAZvd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Metformin is commonly used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Renal insufficiency is one of the contraindications for its use. Inadvertent prescription in patients with renal insufficiency may lead to metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA), which is associated with a high risk of mortality. Consequently, the early recognition and management of MALA is essential.

- **Case report**: We present the case of a 68-year-old man who had reversible blindness resulting from severe lactic acidosis. On presentation, he was alert, oriented, and had no complaints except mild abdominal discomfort and blindness. He denied any history of trauma or drug abuse. The results of the laboratory studies showed severe metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap and increased levels of serum creatinine. There were no predisposing ocular or neurologic lesions that could have induced the blindness. Although the blood levels of methanol, ethanol, and metformin were not estimated, correction of acidosis and hemodialysis led to a complete recovery.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?** Rarely, transient blindness may occur in patients with fatal severe metabolic acidosis. Evaluation for the presence of metabolic acidosis and a detailed medical history are essential in the management of acute blindness in such patients.

### Maladaptive: Do we avoid metformin unnecessarily [^111NcV1N]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Convention holds that the use of metformin is contraindicated in many patients due to concerns about lactic acidosis. However, evidence suggests that metformin-associated lactic acidosis is at most idiosyncratic. Awareness of this evidence should permit broader use of this valuable medication.

### Combination therapy using metformin or thiazolidinediones and insulin in the treatment of diabetes mellitus [^111i1uZD]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

The biguanide metformin sensitizes the liver to the effect of insulin, suppressing hepatic glucose output. Thiazolidinediones, such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, enhance insulin-mediated glucose disposal, which leads to reduced plasma insulin concentrations. These classes of drugs may also have varying beneficial effects on features of insulin resistance such as lipid levels, blood pressure, and body weight.

Metformin, in combination with insulin, has been shown to significantly improve blood glucose levels while lowering the total daily insulin dose and body weight. The thiazolidinediones, when combined with insulin, have also proven effective in reducing blood glucose levels and the total daily insulin dose. Triple combination therapy using insulin, metformin, and a thiazolidinedione improves glycaemic control to a greater degree than dual therapy involving either insulin and metformin or insulin and a thiazolidinedione.

There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of metformin or thiazolidinediones in type 1 diabetic patients. Although these agents are generally well tolerated, some subjects experience significant gastrointestinal issues while using metformin. Metformin is associated with a low risk of lactic acidosis but should not be used in patients with elevated serum creatinine or those undergoing treatment for congestive heart failure.

Thiazolidinediones are associated with an increase in body weight, although this can be avoided with careful lifestyle management. Thiazolidinediones may also lead to edema and are associated with a low incidence of hepatocellular injury.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^111vtukM]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The experience with phenformin resulted in cautious use of metformin in Europe. In the 1980s, the creatinine cut points for contraindication to metformin were considered to be appropriate at 1.4 mg/dL in women and 1.5 mg/dL in men. This was based on the calculated ability to remove 3 g of metformin (an amount slightly beyond the maximum daily U.S. dose) at steady-state levels within 24–48 hours. In fact, the ability to comfortably remove the drug extends up to creatinine levels of 1.8–2.0 mg/dL, but the cut points chosen were intentionally set lower to ensure that those patients who may be lost to follow-up and whose creatinine levels increase over time would not be at risk for appreciable drug accumulation.

Metformin was not approved in the U.S. until December 1994 and was marketed in 1995. The experience with phenformin led to judicious labeling and recommendations for careful monitoring of adverse events. Its new-drug application was the subject of extensive review. The risk for lactic acidosis was estimated to be approximately 3 cases per 100,000 patient-years based on cases reported from France, the U.K., and other countries where pharmacovigilance information was available. Similar estimates were quoted from Sweden (2.4 cases per 100,000 patient-years), where the number of cases appeared to be decreasing despite rising clinical use of metformin. After careful deliberation, metformin was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with lactic acidosis risk seen as small, although inevitable with future widespread availability of the drug.

### Cellular and molecular mechanisms of metformin action [^114Qeu86]. Endocrine Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Metformin is the most widely prescribed drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and is considered an "essential medicine" by the World Health Organization. Several studies have shown that metformin effectively improves glycemic control in patients with T2D, yet it rarely causes hypoglycemia due to its remarkable safety profile. Metformin's antidiabetic effect is primarily due to inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis; however, its mechanism of action remains a subject of debate. In this review, we will discuss proposed mechanisms of action of metformin in the context of initial studies in patients with T2D dating back several decades through the most recent studies at the time of writing.

- **Essential points**: Metformin's glucose-lowering effect in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes is primarily due to inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis, while muscle and gut microbiota effects are largely secondary. Hepatic gluconeogenesis is regulated through four distinct mechanisms: transcription, allosteric, substrate availability, and redox. Metformin inhibition of complex I is only observed at millimolar concentrations that are not therapeutically relevant. Metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis both in vitro and in vivo in a redox-dependent manner. An increased cytosolic redox state, due to metformin inhibition of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, is observed at clinically relevant concentrations, and this is the only proposed mechanism of action that predicts substrate-selective (glycerol and lactate) inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^1133f5Yq]. Gut (2018). High credibility.

Liver blood or function tests (LFTs), which are perceived to be inexpensive, are checked increasingly frequently in both primary and secondary care. This is an attempt to exclude liver disease, monitor potential adverse effects of drugs on the liver such as statins, and investigate the generally unwell patient. These tests often produce an abnormal result, the clinical significance of which is unclear. In many cases, they are requested in response to non-specific symptoms where there is little potential link between symptoms and the likelihood of liver disease, or the blood tests are performed for unrelated reasons, such as chronic disease monitoring. This commonly leads to a cycle of additional liver blood testing in an otherwise asymptomatic individual. Notably, most patients referred to hospitals with abnormal liver tests do not have any evidence of significant liver disease. For example, University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust received 130,849 requests for liver blood tests in 2016, from 82 general practices. Of these, 38,636 (30%) contained at least one abnormal result, defined as being outside the stated reference range. The Abnormal Liver Function Investigations Evaluation (ALFIE) study from Tayside in Scotland showed that over a 10-year period, 25% of the community population aged over 16 had liver blood tests, with about a third having at least one abnormal value. Although an abnormal aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was predictive of liver disease (HR = 4.2), the rate of detection was remarkable.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^116Nv2gb]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Lactic acidosis associated with metformin therapy**: Even though elevated metformin concentrations have been proposed to lead to lactic acidosis, there are few data regarding the level predisposing to hyperlactatemia. In fact, multiple studies suggest that elevated circulating lactate levels, often attributed to metformin, may actually not be caused by the drug.

First, lactic acidosis occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes more frequently than in the general population; in some reports, the observed rate appears to be similar in patients on metformin versus other glucose-lowering agents.

Second, metformin and lactate levels do not necessarily appear to correlate, such that higher metformin concentrations do not consistently occur in those with more severe degrees of lactic acidosis.

Finally, metformin levels are not linked to mortality in those who develop lactic acidosis, perhaps reflecting the primary effect of the underlying cause of the acidosis (e.g. hypoxia, hemodynamic compromise) on outcomes rather than incriminating metformin itself.

Although lactic acidosis remains a recognized, albeit rare, adverse event associated with metformin, the number of lactic acidosis cases continues to be very small, particularly when one considers the widespread use of this drug. In the largest updated Cochrane meta-analysis, Salpeter et al. pooled data from 347 comparative trials and cohort studies. Not a single case of lactic acidosis was found in over 70,000 metformin patient-years or over 55,000 nonmetformin person-years.

### Metformin biodistribution: A key to mechanisms of action [^111rXhz4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Metformin has undisputed glucose-lowering effects in diabetes and an impressive safety record. It has also shown promising effects beyond diabetes, and several hundred clinical trials involving metformin are currently planned or active. Metformin targets intracellular effectors, but exactly which remain to be established, and in an era of precision medicine, an incomplete understanding of mechanisms of action may limit the use of metformin. Distribution of metformin depends on specific organic cation transporter proteins that are organ- and species-specific. Therefore, target tissues of metformin can be identified by cellular uptake of the drug, and exploring the biodistribution of the drug in humans becomes an attractive strategy to assist the many investigations into the mechanisms of action of metformin performed in animals. In this review, we combine the emerging evidence from the use of 11C-labeled metformin in humans to discuss metformin action in liver, intestines, and kidney, which are the organs with the most avid uptake of the drug.

### Metformin for liver cancer prevention in patients with type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116vumZF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Data on the potential effect of metformin on the risk of liver cancer are limited and inconsistent.

The objective of this study was to review the evidence currently available to examine the potential role of metformin in chemoprevention for liver cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes. The data sources of the study included the PubMed and SciVerse Scopus databases. Selection included studies that assessed the effect of metformin therapy on the risk of liver cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes. Summary effect estimates were derived using a random-effects meta-analysis model.

A database was developed on the basis of five studies consisting of approximately 105,495 patients with type 2 diabetes. In meta-analyses, metformin was associated with an estimated 62% reduction in the risk of liver cancer among patients with type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.24, 0.59; P < 0.001). The effect estimates were heterogeneous across the five included studies (P for heterogeneity = 0.001; I² = 78%). When restricting the analysis to the four studies related to hepatocellular carcinoma, metformin was again associated with a significantly lower cancer risk (odds ratio 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.17, 0.52; P < 0.001), and there was evidence of significant heterogeneity between these four studies (P for heterogeneity = 0.03; I² = 67%).

Metformin appears to be associated with a lower risk of liver cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes. Further investigation is warranted.

### Metformin and/or clomiphene do not adversely affect liver or renal function in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^115VykXy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is common in insulin-resistant states such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Metformin (MET) is often used to treat PCOS, but information is limited as to its effects on liver function. This study aimed to determine the effects of MET on serum hepatic parameters in PCOS patients. It was a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind trial conducted from 2002–2004 in academic centers.

The trial included 626 infertile women with PCOS who had serum liver function parameters less than twice the upper limit of normal. Interventions included clomiphene citrate (n = 209), MET (n = 208), or a combination of both (n = 209) for up to 6 months.

- **Main outcome measure**: The percent change from baseline in renal and liver function between- and within-treatment arms was assessed.

Renal function improved in all treatment arms with significant decreases in serum blood urea nitrogen levels (range, -14.7 to -21.3%) as well as in creatinine levels (-4.2 to -6.9%). There were similar decreases in liver transaminase levels in the clomiphene citrate and combined arms (-10% in bilirubin, -9 to -11% in transaminases) without significant changes in the MET arm. When categorizing baseline bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase into tertiles, there were significant within-treatment arm differences between the tertiles, with the highest tertile having the largest decrease from baseline regardless of the treatment arm.

In conclusion, women with PCOS can safely use MET or clomiphene without adversely affecting liver or renal function.

### Metformin beyond type 2 diabetes: Emerging and potential new indications [^112Qx9cQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Metformin is best known as a foundational therapy for type 2 diabetes but is also used in other contexts in clinical medicine, with a number of emerging and potential indications. Many of its beneficial effects may be mediated by modest effects on weight loss and insulin sensitivity, but it has multiple other known mechanisms of action.

Clinical uses beyond type 2 diabetes include polycystic ovarian syndrome; diabetes in pregnancy/gestational diabetes; prevention of type 2 diabetes in prediabetes; and adjunct therapy in type 1 diabetes. As metformin has been in clinical use for almost 70 years, much of the underpinning evidence for its use in these conditions is, by definition, based on trials conducted before the advent of contemporary evidence-based medicine. As a result, some of the above-established uses are "off-label" in many regulatory territories and their use varies accordingly in different countries.

Going forward, several current "repurposing" investigational uses of metformin are also being investigated: prevention of cancer (including in Li-Fraumeni syndrome), renal protection, Alzheimer's disease, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, and promotion of healthy ageing. Despite the longevity of metformin and its important roles beyond type 2 diabetes in clinical medicine, it has further potential and much research is ongoing.

### Synjardy [^114H88U7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue Synjardy or Synjardy XR and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Warning: Lactic acidosis**: See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. Symptoms included malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated blood lactate levels, anion gap acidosis, increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [5.1].

- **Risk factors**: Include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs, age ≥ 65 years old, radiological studies with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states, excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high-risk groups are provided in the Full Prescribing Information [5.1].

If lactic acidosis is suspected, discontinue Synjardy or Synjardy XR and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [5.1].

### Metformin in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^111VBhvC]. Lancet (2001). Low credibility.

There is no established treatment for steatohepatitis in patients who are not alcoholics. This disease is a potentially progressive liver condition associated with hepatic insulin resistance. Only a weight-reducing diet in overweight patients has proved effective. We treated 20 patients who had steatohepatitis but were not alcoholics with metformin (500 mg three times a day for 4 months), an agent that improves hepatic insulin sensitivity.

When compared with the six individuals not complying with treatment, long-term metformin significantly reduced mean transaminase concentrations, which returned to normal in 50% of actively-treated patients. Also, insulin sensitivity improved significantly and liver volume decreased by 20%. Similar data have been reported in insulin-resistant ob/ob mice with fatty liver. A randomized-controlled study is needed.

### Guideline approach to therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [^116eGZ17]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Specific advantages and disadvantages of individual main drug classes are discussed below.

- **Metformin**: Metformin as first-line therapy is in general consensus, since its efficacy is similar to other antihyperglycemic drugs — besides insulin. It has a large safety margin and can be used by most patients, except for a small number who experience gastrointestinal side effects. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, has a mild effect on peripheral resistance, and increases both total and active endogenous glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 in response to food. It might also be cardioprotective, especially in obese type 2 diabetic patients. Moreover, recently published observational studies, as well as animal and cell-line studies, suggest that this drug might be effective in reducing cancer-related morbidity. Thus, metformin is accepted as first-line therapy by both guidelines and pathophysiologic reasoning.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis: Moving towards a new paradigm [^11279Dub]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

While a more precise categorization paradigm may provide useful guidance to clinicians when dealing with suspected cases of MALA, the authors suggest that metformin does not play a contributing role in cases in which any other condition could be attributed to the LA event and conclude that MULA "is probably by far the most common". The authors do not provide new data to justify such a conclusion, and this conclusion does not incorporate the additive and perhaps synergistic effect metformin concentration has on inducing LA when a secondary event occurs. Contrary to the authors' assessment, MALA represents the majority of cases as there is often insufficient information in real‐world clinical settings to definitively exclude metformin as a contributing cause of LA.

The underlying assumption made by Lalau et al. is that a single low measurement of plasma metformin and the presence of any other hypoxic condition is sufficient to rule out metformin relatedness. We do not believe that metformin's involvement in the development of LA can be so easily excluded for two reasons. Firstly, metformin increases the risk of LA because of its ability to disrupt lactate metabolism. Metformin accumulation can cause LA on its own in extreme cases (e.g. renal failure, overdose), and moderate accumulation can increase the likelihood that a secondary hypoxic event would lead to LA, even though the severity of such an event may not have been sufficient to lead to LA in the absence of metformin accumulation. Thus, metformin use presents a risk of metformin plasma accumulation, which lowers the threshold for LA development during secondary hypoxic events.

### Diabetes medications and risk of HCC [^117CqaeQ]. Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Metformin has not only been associated with a reduced risk of HCC and mortality but has also shown to prolong overall survival (OS) among patients with cirrhosis. A retrospective study conducted at the Mayo Clinic, involving 250 patients with diabetes and cirrhosis taking metformin at the initial visit, demonstrated that patients who continued metformin during the observation period had a significantly longer median survival than those who discontinued metformin. Specifically, the median survival was 11.8 years versus 5.6 years in the overall cohort (p < 0.0001); 11.8 years versus 6.0 years for Child-Pugh class A patients (p = 0.006); and 7.7 years versus 3.5 years for class B/C patients (p = 0.04), even after adjusting for other variables (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24–0.78, p = 0.005). Notably, the administration of metformin was safe, with no adverse reactions reported and no cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis during the follow-up.

These results were confirmed in a nested case-control study by Bosetti et al. and in a recently published Thai study of 1061 patients with cirrhosis followed for at least 5 years. In this latter study, the outcomes of 719 metformin users were compared with those of 342 metformin never-users. Consistent with previous results, metformin-exposed patients had a significantly lower risk of developing HCC (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36–0.61, p < 0.001), and the median survival of metformin users was almost twice that of metformin never-users (6.9 and 3.88 years, respectively, p = 0.003).

### Avandamet [^114T78sS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

- **Hepatic effects**: Metformin: Since impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis, Avandamet should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.

	- **Rosiglitazone**: Liver enzymes should be measured prior to the initiation of therapy with Avandamet in all patients and periodically thereafter per the clinical judgment of the healthcare professional. Therapy with Avandamet should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels (ALT > 2.5X upper limit of normal). Patients with mildly elevated liver enzymes (ALT levels ≤ 2.5X upper limit of normal) at baseline or during therapy with Avandamet should be evaluated to determine the cause of the liver enzyme elevation. The initiation or continuation of therapy with Avandamet in patients with mild liver enzyme elevations should proceed with caution and include close clinical follow-up, including more frequent liver enzyme monitoring, to determine if the liver enzyme elevations resolve or worsen. If at any time ALT levels increase to > 3X the upper limit of normal in patients on therapy with Avandamet, liver enzyme levels should be rechecked as soon as possible. If ALT levels remain > 3X the upper limit of normal, therapy with Avandamet should be discontinued.

	- If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, and/or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked. The decision whether to continue the patient on therapy with Avandamet should be carefully considered.

### Actions of metformin and statins on lipid and glucose metabolism and possible benefit of combination therapy [^117ASAzj]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

Metformin is generally thought to exert its beneficial effects on glucose metabolism mainly in the liver. However, in line with recent literature, we conclude that the drug acts primarily in the intestine. This is due to the significantly higher concentrations of metformin present in the intestine compared to the liver. The drug is certainly not absent in the liver, hence parts of its effects may be localized to this organ, most probably via its effects on gluconeogenesis.

To treat T2DM and its cardiovascular comorbidity, combination therapy of metformin with statins appears well-suited and may act as a double-sided sword, particularly in the case of statins. While statins increase the risk of T2DM, particularly in prediabetic subjects, co-treatment with metformin might reduce this risk. However, this hypothesis has not yet been systematically verified.

In this review, we have investigated possible sites of interaction between metformin and statins and conclude that they act on largely parallel pathways. Statins reduce plasma cholesterol via activation of the LDL-C receptor in the liver and may influence glucose homeostasis primarily by inhibiting insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells. We propose that combination therapy will ameliorate the risk of statin-induced T2DM. More studies of combined metformin–statin treatment in patients are necessary to elucidate the effects of different metformin–statin doses on glucose and lipid metabolism, in various stages of diabetes and/or dyslipidemia progression, in more detail.

### Metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease: A systematic review [^113Rx3fT]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

Metformin is widely viewed as the best initial pharmacological option to lower glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the drug is contraindicated in many individuals with impaired kidney function because of concerns of lactic acidosis.

- **Objective**: To assess the risk of lactic acidosis associated with metformin use in individuals with impaired kidney function.

- **Evidence acquisition**: In July 2014, we searched the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases for English-language articles pertaining to metformin, kidney disease, and lactic acidosis in humans between 1950 and June 2014. We excluded reviews, letters, editorials, case reports, small case series, and manuscripts that did not directly pertain to the topic area or that met other exclusion criteria. Of an original 818 articles, 65 were included in this review, including pharmacokinetic/metabolic studies, large case series, retrospective studies, meta-analyses, and a clinical trial.

- **Results**: Although metformin is renally cleared, drug levels generally remain within the therapeutic range and lactate concentrations are not substantially increased when used in patients with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rates, 30–60 mL/min per 1.73 m²). The overall incidence of lactic acidosis in metformin users varies across studies from approximately 3 per 100,000 person-years to 10 per 100,000 person-years and is generally indistinguishable from the background rate in the overall population with diabetes. Data suggesting an increased risk of lactic acidosis is limited.

### Metformin-induced cholestatic hepatitis [^114GoeZp]. Endocrine Practice (2003). Low credibility.

To report a case of metformin-induced cholestatic hepatitis, we present a detailed case report that includes laboratory and biopsy findings. Additionally, similar cases from the literature are reviewed.

In a 68-year-old man with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, metformin therapy was initiated. The dosage was initially 500 mg twice daily and later was increased to 850 mg twice a day. Four weeks after the onset of metformin treatment, jaundice, pruritus, and liver enzyme abnormalities were observed. The patient underwent an extensive work-up, including a hepatitis screen, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, all of which showed normal findings. A liver biopsy revealed severe cholestasis and mild portal inflammation.

Following the discontinuation of metformin, the liver enzymes normalized, except for a persistently increased level of alkaline phosphatase, most likely related to a prolonged cholestatic effect of metformin.

Although rare, metformin can induce liver damage, and it is crucial for patients and physicians to be aware of this potential side effect.
