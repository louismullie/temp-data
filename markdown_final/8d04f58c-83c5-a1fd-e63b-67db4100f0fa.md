## Question

Management of hepatic abcess

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of hepatic abscess. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying the abscess type. Then, I should assess severity and decide on the initial source control strategy. Next, I will select empiric antibiotics and plan for culture-directed narrowing. After that, I need to determine duration and whether oral step-down is appropriate. I will then consider special populations and complications, including biliary communication, trauma, and immunocompromise. Finally, I should outline monitoring, response criteria, and salvage strategies, and close with a concise algorithm that integrates these elements with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and classify the abscess, because treatment hinges on etiology and anatomy. Ultrasound is a good first-line modality, but contrast-enhanced CT best characterizes size, loculation, gas, perilesional edema, and biliary communication, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound can help distinguish abscess from tumor or necrosis when CT is contraindicated, so I should not jump to conclusions based on a single noncontrast study [^278b6833] [^3638dd42] [^70daefcc]. I need to check for pyogenic, amebic, fungal, or hydatid etiologies using clinical context, travel history, and serology, and I should obtain blood cultures before antibiotics when feasible because they improve pathogen detection in intra-abdominal infections, including liver abscesses [^f6c93906] [^07e7e5d6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity. I should assess for sepsis, organ dysfunction, abscess size, multiplicity, loculation, and proximity to critical structures, because these factors drive the urgency and choice of source control. Large abscesses, multiloculation, and high SOFA scores portend worse outcomes and may push me toward catheter drainage rather than aspiration alone, and I should remember that mortality in severe cases can still be substantial even with modern care, so I need to escalate promptly when indicated [^07e7e5d6] [^ad61af8b].

> Next, I should review source control, since this is the cornerstone of therapy. For most pyogenic liver abscesses, image-guided percutaneous drainage is first-line, with success rates around 90–97% and lower morbidity than surgery, though I must tailor the approach to size, loculation, and patient factors [^e376a1c4] [^ad61af8b]. Wait, let me verify the role of aspiration versus catheter drainage. Prospective data suggest catheter drainage achieves higher success and faster clinical improvement than repeated needle aspiration, especially for larger or partially liquefied abscesses, so I should favor catheters when anatomy and resources allow [^c7f4622e] [^211152e6]. But wait, what if the abscess is very small and uncomplicated? In that scenario, antibiotics alone may suffice, so I should individualize based on size, symptoms, and response [^e376a1c4].

> I will now examine surgical indications, because I need to ensure I do not delay necessary operative management. Surgery is reserved for failure of percutaneous therapy, rupture with peritonitis, inaccessible location, or suspected malignancy, and in select large abscesses some series suggest surgical drainage may reduce failures and length of stay compared with percutaneous drainage, though this remains controversial and should be balanced against invasiveness and patient comorbidity [^8948487e] [^e376a1c4]. Let me reconsider the default to surgery; contemporary practice still positions surgery as second-line after failed or unsuitable percutaneous approaches, which aligns with guideline trends and most comparative data [^e376a1c4].

> For amebic liver abscess, I should confirm that most cases resolve with metronidazole alone and avoid routine drainage. Indications for aspiration or drainage include imminent rupture, failure of medical therapy after 3–5 days, large left-lobe abscesses, or diagnostic uncertainty, and I should remember that open drainage historically increased mortality due to secondary bacterial infection, so I must avoid unnecessary procedures [^e376a1c4] [^761a4f35]. I should double-check that serology is obtained when amebiasis is suspected, because direct stool testing is insensitive early and serology supports the diagnosis and guides therapy duration [^notfound].

> Now, I need to select empiric antibiotics while cultures are pending, and I should tailor to likely sources and local resistance. For community-acquired pyogenic abscess, a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone covers common gram-negatives including Klebsiella and E. coli, and I should add metronidazole for anaerobic coverage when biliary or enteric sources are suspected or when imaging suggests gas-forming organisms [^e4fa988b]. Hold on, I should verify risk factors for resistant organisms; in patients with recent healthcare exposure, prior resistant organisms, or immunocompromise, I should broaden to include coverage for ESBLs and consider MRSA risk, aligning with intra-abdominal infection guidance for resistant pathogens [^f6c93906]. For suspected hypervirulent Klebsiella, I should maintain a low threshold for drainage and extend therapy given metastatic potential, even though optimal duration remains debated and evidence is evolving [^e4fa988b] [^c031eff1].

> Let me think about amebic therapy specifics. Metronidazole 750 mg orally three times daily or 500 mg IV every 8 hours for 7–10 days is standard, followed by a luminal agent such as paromomycin to eradicate cysts, and I should confirm adherence and response before stopping therapy [^e376a1c4]. I should double-check that IV metronidazole is reasonable when oral intake is unreliable, as historical cases document efficacy with parenteral therapy in that setting [^a2711f70].

> Next, I should review duration and the possibility of oral step-down. Historically, 2–4 weeks of antibiotics has been common, but emerging data suggest that in drained patients, courses of 30 days or fewer may be noninferior to longer regimens for relapse-free survival, which can shorten hospitalization and reduce costs when patients are clinically stable and responding [^4d55418c]. For Klebsiella liver abscess, a randomized trial showed oral ciprofloxacin was noninferior to continued IV ceftriaxone after initial IV therapy, supporting early oral step-down in stable patients with susceptible organisms, though I should confirm susceptibilities and clinical response before switching [^3a8fa402]. I need to ensure total therapy is individualized to source control success, host factors, and clinical trajectory, extending if response is slow or complications persist [^e4fa988b].

> I will now examine special populations and complications, starting with biliary communication or obstruction. If there is a biliary fistula or stricture, I should coordinate ERCP with sphincterotomy and stenting to relieve obstruction and decompress the biliary tree, because untreated biliary obstruction undermines drainage and antibiotics and increases failure risk [^f543873f]. Hold on, I should verify that this endoscopic approach is particularly relevant in post-transplant or post-traumatic biliary complications, where percutaneous biliary drainage may be needed if ERCP is not feasible [^a8702c5d] [^d64cf356].

> For post-transplant patients, I need to ensure a high index of suspicion for hepatic artery thrombosis and biliary strictures as drivers of abscess, and I should involve transplant teams early because management often requires percutaneous or endoscopic biliary interventions and, when refractory, retransplantation may be necessary given the high mortality of persistent infection in this group [^671e0ff3] [^a8702c5d]. Let me verify that early source control with drainage plus antibiotics is standard here, with escalation if sepsis persists despite appropriate therapy [^671e0ff3].

> In trauma or post-embolization settings, I should confirm that percutaneous drainage is indicated for infected bilomas or intrahepatic abscesses, and I must remember that bilioenteric anastomosis or sphincter incompetence markedly increases the risk of post-embolization abscess, prompting proactive surveillance and early drainage when suspected [^9603fafe] [^768a63a8]. I should double-check that these patients often need broader anaerobic and enterococcal coverage initially, given altered biliary flora and prior interventions [^notfound].

> For immunocompromised hosts, I need to broaden my differential to include fungi such as Candida and consider early antifungal therapy if there is no improvement with antibacterial therapy, especially with multiple small low-attenuation lesions and splenic involvement, and I should coordinate with infectious diseases for optimal agent selection and duration [^e376a1c4]. But wait, what if the patient has chronic granulomatous disease? In CGD, Staphylococcus aureus predominates and recurrence is common with drainage alone, so definitive resection of involved liver tissue is often preferred to prevent relapse and prolonged morbidity, and I should involve pediatric surgery or hepatobiliary surgery early in the course [^3510bf96] [^45af96ee].

> For hydatid disease, I should confirm cyst stage and biliary communication before choosing PAIR, because PAIR is contraindicated with biliary communication and is best for CE1 or CE3a cysts larger than 5–10 cm, whereas smaller active cysts may be managed medically with albendazole alone and complex cysts may require surgery plus albendazole, with praziquantel added peri-procedurally to reduce recurrence if spillage occurs [^c0857feb] [^375f3665] [^bf1ca0cc]. Hold on, I should verify that medical therapy alone is discouraged for active cysts unless intervention is contraindicated, to avoid persistent disease and complications [^4f47775c].

> Next, I should review monitoring and response criteria to decide when to de-escalate or escalate. I will track fever curve, leukocyte count, CRP, and liver enzymes, and I should obtain follow-up imaging at about 7–10 days to document cavity resolution, recognizing that larger abscesses may take 4–6 weeks to fully resolve even with appropriate therapy [^notfound]. I need to ensure that if there is no meaningful clinical improvement within 48–72 hours, I reassess for undrained collections, biliary obstruction, resistant organisms, or alternative diagnoses and consider repeat imaging and intervention as indicated [^notfound].

> I should double-check for complications that change management. Rupture with peritonitis requires urgent surgical exploration, endophthalmitis or other metastatic foci from hypervirulent Klebsiella necessitate ophthalmology involvement and prolonged therapy, and portal vein thrombosis may require anticoagulation decisions balanced against bleeding risk and the underlying septic process, so I must maintain vigilance for these sequelae throughout care [^e376a1c4] [^5538925c] [^07e7e5d6]. Let me verify that early recognition of these complications improves outcomes, which reinforces the need for close follow-up and multidisciplinary coordination when red flags arise [^5538925c].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm. Confirm diagnosis and classify etiology with contrast-enhanced imaging and cultures. Assess severity and decide on source control, favoring percutaneous catheter drainage for most pyogenic abscesses larger than 3–5 cm or when symptomatic, reserving surgery for failure, rupture, inaccessibility, or suspected malignancy. Start empiric antibiotics tailored to likely sources and local resistance, then narrow to culture results. Treat amebic abscess with metronidazole plus a luminal agent and drain only if indicated. Individualize duration, with 2–4 weeks common but shorter courses acceptable in drained, clinically stable patients, and consider early oral step-down for Klebsiella when appropriate. Monitor clinically and radiologically at 7–10 days, escalate if no improvement, and address complications promptly with specialty input [^e376a1c4] [^4d55418c] [^3a8fa402].

---

Hepatic abscess management centers on **early diagnosis with contrast-enhanced CT or ultrasound** [^278b6833] and **prompt source control via percutaneous drainage** [^e4fa988b] combined with **culture-directed antibiotics** [^f6c93906]. For pyogenic abscesses, use a third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole [^notfound], then tailor to cultures; for amebic abscesses, use metronidazole followed by a luminal agent [^e376a1c4]. Drainage is indicated for abscesses > 3–5 cm, multiloculated, or failing medical therapy [^e376a1c4]; surgery is reserved for rupture, complex biliary disease, or percutaneous failure [^e376a1c4]. Monitor clinically and with imaging until resolution, and address underlying causes to prevent recurrence [^e4fa988b].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Clinical presentation

Typical features include **fever, right upper quadrant pain, and elevated inflammatory markers** [^e376a1c4]; however, presentations can be subtle, especially in older adults or immunocompromised patients [^262ec274].

---

### Imaging modalities

- **Contrast-enhanced CT**: gold standard for detection, sizing, and characterization; shows peripheral rim enhancement and perilesional edema [^278b6833] [^e376a1c4].
- **Ultrasound**: useful for initial assessment and follow-up; contrast-enhanced ultrasound aids characterization and can guide interventions [^3638dd42] [^00795d6d].
- **MRI**: helpful when CT is contraindicated or to characterize atypical lesions [^notfound].

---

### Laboratory tests

Obtain **CBC, LFTs, CRP/ESR, and blood cultures** [^f6c93906]; abscess aspiration for Gram stain, culture, and sensitivity is essential for targeted therapy [^e4fa988b].

---

## Medical management

### Antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should cover gram-negative rods and anaerobes; a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g. ceftriaxone) plus metronidazole is a common regimen [^notfound]. For amebic abscesses, treat with **metronidazole 750 mg PO/IV TID for 7–10 days**, followed by a luminal agent (e.g. paromomycin) to prevent recurrence [^e376a1c4]. Tailor antibiotics to culture results and local resistance patterns [^e4fa988b].

---

### Duration of therapy

Treat for **2–4 weeks**, adjusting to clinical response, abscess size, and source control [^e4fa988b]. Shorter courses (≤ 30 days) may be noninferior in drained patients [^4d55418c].

---

## Interventional management

### Indications for drainage

- **Abscess size**: > 3–5 cm or multiloculated [^e376a1c4].
- **Clinical factors**: persistent symptoms, failure of medical therapy, or risk of rupture [^e376a1c4].
- **Amebic abscesses**: rare indications include imminent rupture, failure of medical therapy, or diagnostic uncertainty [^e376a1c4].

---

### Drainage techniques

Percutaneous catheter drainage is **first-line** [^e4fa988b] due to high success and low morbidity [^65c1e052]; needle aspiration is an option for small, uniloculated abscesses [^211152e6]. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided drainage is an alternative for abscesses near the stomach or duodenum [^e28e64b3] [^56fb166d]. Surgery is reserved for rupture, complex biliary disease, or failed percutaneous therapy [^e376a1c4].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **rupture with peritonitis, complex biliary disease, or failure of percutaneous therapy** [^e376a1c4]. Options include open or laparoscopic drainage, hepatic resection, or biliary procedures (e.g. ERCP) for biliary fistulas [^f543873f].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Track temperature, abdominal pain, and inflammatory markers; repeat imaging at 7–10 days to confirm resolution [^notfound]. Address underlying causes — such as biliary disease, diabetes, or immunosuppression — to prevent recurrence [^e4fa988b].

---

## Complications and outcomes

Complications include rupture, sepsis, biliary fistula, and metastatic infection (e.g. endophthalmitis) [^5538925c]. Mortality is **5–20%**, with better outcomes when drainage and appropriate antibiotics are instituted early [^e376a1c4].

---

## Special considerations

- **Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae**: associated with metastatic complications; consider longer antibiotic courses and close monitoring [^e4fa988b] [^5538925c].
- **Post-transplant patients**: higher risk; percutaneous drainage plus antibiotics is standard, with retransplantation for refractory cases [^671e0ff3].
- **Resource-limited settings**: ultrasound-guided needle aspiration plus antibiotics is effective and safe [^5a7ad181].

## Summary of management algorithm

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm diagnosis with contrast-enhanced CT or ultrasound [^278b6833] [^3638dd42] |
| 2 | Obtain blood cultures and abscess aspiration for culture [^f6c93906] |
| 3 | Start empiric antibiotics (ceftriaxone + metronidazole) [^notfound] |
| 4 | Perform percutaneous drainage for abscesses > 3–5 cm or failing medical therapy [^e376a1c4] |
| 5 | Tailor antibiotics to culture results [^e4fa988b] |
| 6 | Monitor clinically and with imaging until resolution [^notfound] |
| 7 | Address underlying causes to prevent recurrence [^e4fa988b] |

---

Effective management of hepatic abscess requires **early diagnosis, prompt source control, and targeted antibiotics**, with percutaneous drainage as first-line and surgery reserved for complications or failure. Close follow-up and treatment of underlying causes are essential to reduce recurrence and mortality.

Pyogenic liver abscesses (PLAs) are a suppurative infection of the hepatic parenchyma responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. PLAs are categorized into a variety of mechanisms: (1) via the portal vein, (2) through the biliary tract, (3) via the hepatic artery, (4) from trauma, (5) contiguously via direct extension, and (6) cryptogenically. The pathogenesis of PLA, which informs treatment, can often be discerned based on host factors, clinical presentation, and causative microorganisms. The Streptococcus anginosus group, hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae, and multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens have emerged as microbiologically challenging organisms to treat. The identification of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae should prompt for assessment for metastatic spread and consideration of prolonged antimicrobial treatment. Abdominal imaging is indispensable in characterizing PLAs and facilitating source control interventions. Source control remains the most critical aspect of PLA management, followed by antimicrobial therapy. Empiric antibiotics for PLAs are informed by the suspected etiology of PLA formation. Duration of antimicrobial therapy is individualized and dependent on multiple components, including the success of achieving source control, host factors, mechanism of PLA development, and the illness course of the individual-factoring in clinical, biochemical, and radiographic parameters.

### Percutaneous hepatic abscess drainage: do multiple abscesses or multiloculated abscesses preclude drainage or affect outcome? [^3badda86]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the effectiveness of percutaneous abscess drainage in patients with pyogenic liver abscesses of the following types: single, single multiloculated, multiple, and multiple multiloculated.

Materials and Methods

One hundred nine patients with 149 liver abscesses who underwent percutaneous drainage during an 11-year period were divided into a single abscess group and a multiple abscess group. Of the 109 patients, 54 had multiloculated abscesses and were divided into single and multiple multiloculated abscess groups. Technical success was defined as the ability to place the catheter within the abscess cavity and clinical success was defined as improvement in the patient's symptoms. Clinical findings, management strategy, complication rate, and success rate were analyzed.

Results

Technical success rates were 96% (82 of 85) for a single abscess and 96% (23 of 24) for multiple abscesses (P = 1.0). Clinical success was achieved in 74 of 85 patients (87%) with a single abscess and 22 of 24 patients (92%) with multiple abscesses (P = 0.729). Technical success rates were 94% (32 of 34) for a single multiloculated abscess and 95% (19 of 20) for multiple multiloculated abscesses (P = 1.0). Clinical success was achieved in 30 of 34 patients (88%) with a single multiloculated abscess and 18 of 20 patients (90%) with multiple multiloculated abscesses (P = 1). No significant difference in hospital stay was seen between single and multiple abscess groups (P = 0.373) or between single multiloculated and multiple multiloculated abscess groups (P = 0.180). There were no major complications or mortality related to the procedure.

Conclusions

Percutaneous drainage is a safe and effective procedure in the treatment of pyogenic liver abscess, regardless of abscess complexity and/or multiplicity.

### Clinical characteristics and management of liver abscess in the Gambia, a resource-limited country [^7914e3aa]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This retrospective cohort study conducted in the Gambia, a low-resource country, found that liver abscess predominantly affects mostly males with clinical, laboratory, and radiological features consistent with late presentation. In spite of this and the lack of diagnostic and material resources, morbidity and mortality rates in this cohort were low. This suggests that the current strategy of antibiotic therapy combined with percutaneous abscess drainage is a reasonable treatment strategy for the management of liver abscess in resource-poor settings.

### Hepatic abscess in patients with chronic granulomatous disease [^3510bf96]. Annals of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the clinical presentation, diagnostic procedures, and surgical management of hepatic abscesses in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD).

Summary Background Data

Chronic granulomatous disease is a rare inherited primary immunodeficiency in which phagocytes cannot destroy catalase-positive bacteria and fungi. Defects in the phagocytic cells' respiratory burst lead to life-threatening infections, including hepatic abscess. These abscesses are recurrent and often multiple and are treated differently from bacterial abscesses in patients without CGD.

Methods

Between 1980 and 2000, 61 cases of hepatic abscess in 22 patients with CGD were treated at the National Institutes of Health. Clinicopathologic features were investigated by retrospective review of the medical records, radiographs, and histopathology.

Results

Twelve of the 61 cases were primary hepatic abscesses. Twenty-nine of the cases were recurrent hepatic abscesses, and 20 cases were persistent hepatic abscesses. The median age at the time of initial hepatic abscess presentation was 14 years. Subjective fever was the most frequent presenting symptom, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated in 98% of cases. Fifty-two cases were managed surgically and eight cases were managed with percutaneous drainage. One patient refused surgery. The surgical complication rate was 56%; however, there were no deaths directly related to the hepatic abscesses. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent organism identified in culture (88% of positive cultures). Aggressive surgery and antibiotics ultimately resulted in successful treatment of all patients.

Conclusions

Hepatic abscesses occurring in patients with CGD represent a difficult diagnostic and treatment challenge. Early excision and treatment with antibiotics directed against S. aureus is necessary. General surgeons should be aware of this rare immunodeficiency and should aggressively manage hepatic abscesses in these patients.

### Clinical characteristics and management of liver abscess in the Gambia, a resource-limited country [^10e4cffc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Liver abscess (LA) is endemic in developing countries, especially in tropical countries such as the Gambia. Pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) and amoebic liver abscess (ALA) are common types of liver abscesses, although tubercular and fungal abscesses have also been reported. There are limited data on the clinical characteristics, management, and outcome of liver abscesses in resource-limited countries such as the Gambia where advanced imaging techniques and modern treatment modalities are in short supply.

### Liver abscesses: pathogenesis, treatment, and ongoing challenges [^026cff49]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Underreporting of hvKp infections remains a significant concern, in part due to the absence of standardized, accessible diagnostic tools to differentiate hvKp from classical strains in Western healthcare settings. Currently, clinical management of K. pneumoniae bacteremia appropriately prioritizes identifying an anatomic source through imaging, such as CT or ultrasound, particularly in patients with persistent fever. Despite this, emerging evidence suggests that hvKp strains are disproportionately associated with deep-seated infections, such as liver abscesses, which may otherwise go unrecognized. While no inexpensive, rapid, and reliable test for hvKp is currently available, increased clinical awareness and targeted testing where feasible, especially in patients with no clear source of bacteremia, could facilitate earlier prognosis, help prevent the development of intractable liver abscesses, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

Although still relatively rare, the emergence of convergent hvKp strains that combine hypervirulence with antibiotic resistance pose a serious public health threat, necessitating ongoing surveillance and rapid response strategies. Preventive efforts, including risk factor management, such as controlling diabetes and fatty liver disease, as well as potential decolonization strategies, may help reduce the incidence of KLA.

Despite major advances in the basic biology of hvKp pathogenesis, critical gaps remain in our understanding of hvKp abscess development, metastatic spread, and treatment failure. The complex interplay between bacterial virulence, host immune responses, and antibiotic penetration within abscesses is not yet fully understood, highlighting the need for continued research. Addressing these challenges will be key to improving both diagnostic capabilities and therapeutic approaches, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.

### Cut it out: managing hepatic abscesses in patients with chronic granulomatous disease [^45af96ee]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatic abscesses develop in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) because the liver is a site of constant bacterial challenge. The authors investigated the roles of drainage and hepatic resection in the management of liver abscesses in CGD patients.

Methods

Medical records of CGD patients with hepatic abscesses from 1990 to 2001 were reviewed.

Results

There were 6 patients. Mean age of initial abscess was 7.2 years (range, 3 weeks to 18.9 years). All abscesses involved the right lobe of the liver (2 single, 4 multiple). All patients received appropriate antibiotics. Four patients were treated with one to 6 drainage procedures over one to 4 admissions before ultimately undergoing resection. The other 2 patients underwent primary resection without preliminary drainage. Of the 6 resections, 4 were nonanatomic, and 2 were anatomic. There was one major postoperative complication (bleeding) requiring reoperation. There were no recurrences after resection (mean follow-up 4.3 yr). Mean total days in hospital for the treatment of liver abscess was 49 in the preliminary drainage group and 8.5 in the primary resection group. Three patients required admission into the intensive care unit, one after a drainage procedure and 2 after resection.

Conclusions

For CGD patients with hepatic abscesses, drainage procedures are associated with recurrence and prolonged hospitalization. Primary hepatic resection removing all involved tissue is safe and definitive for the management of this problem.

ABSTRACT

Over the past 30 years, a distinct pathotype of hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) has emerged, characterized by its ability to cause severe tissue-invasive infections, including liver abscesses in otherwise healthy individuals. Klebsiella liver abscesses (KLA) are most prevalent in East and Southeast Asia; however, their global incidence is rising, with hvKp now recognized as an important pathogen in Europe and the United States. While K. pneumoniae often colonizes the gut asymptomatically, KLAs develop when hvKp disseminates from the gut to the liver via the portal vein. Strains expressing K1 and K2 capsule types demonstrate the highest resistance to clearance by Kupffer cells, the liver resident macrophages, and are responsible for most KLA cases. KLAs present as fibrously encapsulated lesions composed of bacteria, pus, and immune cells. Treatment typically involves a combination of abscess drainage and antibiotic therapy; however, clinical outcomes are often poor, even in the absence of antibiotic resistance. This is due, in part, to significant barriers to achieving effective antibiotic efficacy within abscesses that can result in devastating complications such as metastatic infection, liver resection, or death. The emergence of KLA caused by multidrug-resistant hvKp strains, although still rare, represents an additional and alarming therapeutic challenge. This review explores the pathogenesis of KLA and highlights critical obstacles to effective management and therapy.

### Current management of pyogenic liver abscess: surgery is now second-line treatment [^8f9e6ab4]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to examine the current treatment for liver abscess and to assess the factors associated with failure of percutaneous drainage.

Study Design

Records of 58 patients with pyogenic hepatic abscess, from 1998 to 2009, were examined. Clinicopathologic variables were analyzed as predictors of failure of percutaneous drainage using multivariable logistic regression. The results of surgical intervention after failure of percutaneous treatment were also examined.

Results

Fifty-one patients (88%) had a history of malignancy including pancreas (36%), cholangiocarcinoma (17%), colon (12%), and gallbladder (10%). Recent hepatic artery embolization or radiofrequency ablation preceded development of abscess in 13 patients (22%). Fifteen patients (26%) had evidence of biliary tract communication, and 14 of 15 (93%) of these patients had concomitant biliary tract obstruction. Percutaneous drainage was successful in 38 patients (66%) with a median drain dwell time of 26 days (range 3 to 319 days). Five patients (9%) required operative intervention and 2 of these patients (3% overall) died postoperatively from septic complications. Fifteen patients (26%) died with percutaneous drains in place; 9 (60%) of these patients died of cancer progression without evidence of sepsis. Independent predictors of failure of percutaneous drainage included abscesses containing yeast (p = 0.003) and communication of the abscess cavity with the biliary tree (p = 0.02).

Conclusions

Pyogenic hepatic abscess was treated successfully in the majority of patients with advanced malignancy, although mortality remained high. The presence of yeast and communication with an untreated obstructed biliary tree were associated with failure of percutaneous drainage. The need for surgical salvage was associated with a high mortality.

### Management and outcome of liver abscesses after liver transplantation [^671e0ff3]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Liver abscess after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a rare, life-threatening complication. The aim of this study is to analyze the incidence, risk factors, clinical manifestations, treatment and outcomes of liver abscesses after OLT.

Methods

We perform a retrospective review of the patients who developed one or more liver abscesses among a series of 984 patients who underwent OLT between January 2000 and December 2016.

Results

Fourteen patients (1.5%) developed 18 episodes of liver abscesses, and the median time from OLT to the diagnosis of liver abscess was 39.7 months. Major predisposing factors were biliary strictures in 11 patients, hepatic artery thrombosis in 8, re-OLT in 3, choledochojejunostomy in 2, living donor OLT in 2, donor after cardiac death in 1, split liver in 1, and liver biopsy in 1. All patients were managed by intravenous antibiotics; percutaneous drainage was performed in 10 patients, while 2 patients underwent re-OLT. The mortality rate related to liver abscesses was 21.4%. The mean hospital stay was 30 ± 19 days, and during a mean follow-up of 93 ± 78 months, three other patients died.

Conclusions

Liver abscesses must be managed with antibiotic therapy and percutaneous drainage, but when these conservative measures fail (persistent abscess and sepsis), a re-OLT must be performed in order to prevent the high mortality associated with this severe complication.

### Treatment of pyogenic hepatic abscesses… [^f49795f8]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- A retrospective review of 39 patients with pyogenic hepatic abscess treated from 1977 through 1984 included 23 patients who were surgically treated and 16 who underwent percutaneous drainage. The average age in each group was similar. The most common cause of abscesses in each group was biliary tract disease. Abscesses caused by portal seeding and local extension were more common in the surgical group, 14 of whom required additional surgical procedures at the time of surgical drainage. Of the 16 patients in the percutaneously drained group, seven were seen during the immediate postoperative period. Most of the abscesses occurred in the right lobe of the liver, but single abscesses in the left lobe and multiple abscesses were more common in the surgical group. Klebsiella enterobacter and group D streptococcus were most common in the surgically and percutaneously drained groups, respectively.

All patients received antibiotics, with a mean length of treatment of 14 days. Mean time to defervescence was about four days in both groups, with a longer hospital stay for the percutaneously drained group. Morbidity was high in both groups. Three of the percutaneously treated patients required surgical drainage because of highly viscous abscess contents. Mortality was 17% in the surgical group and 13% in the percutaneously drained group. Percutaneous drainage with computed tomography probably should be the initial drainage procedure in patients with pyogenic hepatic abscesses in whom no concomitant surgical procedure is planned. Regardless of treatment, the morbidity and mortality remain high. Bertel CK, van Heerden JA, Sheedy PF. Treatment of Pyogenic Hepatic Abscesses: Surgical vs Percutaneous Drainage.

### Treatment of liver abscess: prospective randomized comparison of catheter drainage and needle aspiration [^69b949ae]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

In recent years, image-guided percutaneous drainage has been increasingly used to treat liver abscesses with reported success rates ranging from 70–100%. Although percutaneous placement of an indwelling catheter is the method most widely preferred to drain liver abscesses, recent studies have claimed needle aspiration to be a simpler, less costly, and equally effective mode of treatment.

### Hepatobiliary infections [^c041b8bf]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

The major hepatobiliary infections (excluding the viral hepatitides) include amebic and pyogenic liver abscess and cholangitis. Little new information has been published in the area of cholangitis during the last several years. In contrast, the clinical presentation and management of liver abscess have evolved considerably, not only in the last several years but also during a more extended period spanning the last two decades. In the United States, amebic liver abscess occurs largely in individuals from endemic areas or in those traveling to endemic areas. Recent data suggest that patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at an increased incidence of amebic liver abscess. New serologic tests and molecular techniques are being added to the diagnostic armamentarium for amebic liver abscess. In most cases, amebic liver abscess is associated with an excellent prognosis (up to 100% survival) if properly managed. Pyogenic liver abscess, although commonly occurring in patients with known biliary tract disease, is often cryptogenic in origin (ie, no clear causal factor can be identified) or often is caused by underlying medical disorders. An emerging population of patients with pyogenic liver abscess includes those with complications of aggressive interventions (hepatic chemoembolization, cryoablation, liver transplantation). Pyogenic liver abscess was predominantly managed by surgical methods up until the early 1980s, but almost entirely has changed to being managed by interventional techniques; in 2000, this trend has continued. In contrast to amebic liver abscess, pyogenic liver abscess is associated with greater morbidity and mortality, ostensibly caused by the severity of the underlying disease in many patients. However, it should be emphasized that the prognosis of patients with pyogenic liver abscess, who do not have underlying comorbid conditions, is excellent.

### Pyogenic liver abscess: uncommon presentation [^670ad639]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Pyogenic liver abscess is a rare entity, but it is fatal when untreated. With a peak incidence in the fifth decade of life, its early recognition and intervention are key to successful treatment and better prognosis of patients. In recent years, its approach has been enhanced by the use of percutaneous drainage, improved imaging techniques and a better microbiological characterisation, allowing for a more appropriate use of antibiotics. Clinical manifestations are variable and depend on the size of the abscess, the condition of the patient, associated diseases and possible complications. Among the most common symptoms that stand out are the pain in the upper quadrants of the abdomen, high fever, nausea and vomiting. The authors present the case of a patient who developed an atrial flutter as the initial presentation of a hepatic abscess that imagiologically mimicked a hepatic tumour.

### The infected liver: radiologic-pathologic correlation [^278b6833]. Radiographics (2004). Low credibility.

Recent technologic advances have significantly enhanced the role of imaging in the detection, characterization, and management of infectious diseases involving the liver. In addition, imaging-guided percutaneous drainage has greatly improved the clinical treatment of patients with focal liver abscess. Infectious liver diseases can be accurately evaluated with ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Characteristic changes in US echogenicity, CT attenuation, or MR imaging signal intensity and typical enhancement patterns can contribute to the diagnosis of specific infectious diseases, including abscesses, parasitic diseases, fungal diseases, granulomatous diseases, viral hepatitis, and other less common infections. CT is particularly helpful in revealing the presence of calcifications and gas and in detailing the enhancement pattern. The multiplanar capability of MR imaging and its sensitivity to small differences in tissue composition increase its specificity for certain hepatic infections, including hydatid cyst and candidiasis. Radiologic findings may be sufficient to obviate aspiration or histologic examination, although in most instances they are less specific. Nevertheless, imaging findings taken together with appropriate clinical information may provide the most likely diagnosis, even if biopsy is sometimes required for confirmation.

### Clinical characteristics and management of liver abscess in the Gambia, a resource-limited country [^5a7ad181]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

d) Treatment

Antibiotic therapy contributes a crucial role in the management of liver abscess. In this study, only 16.7% of patients (5/30) were exclusively treated with antibiotics (ciprofloxacillin or ceftriaxone and/or metronidazole). The majority of the patients had both ultrasound-assisted percutaneous needle aspiration and antibiotics (25 patients, 83.3%). This is different from developed countries where pigtail catheters are readily available and are used. None of the patients had complications related to percutaneous needle aspiration. Percutaneous needle aspiration combined with antibiotics appears to be a safe, effective, and promising treatment for pyogenic liver abscess of 3–6 cm in size. Other studies have also found percutaneous catheter drainage to be more effective than percutaneous needle aspiration. None of the patients underwent surgical operations. Outcome of open surgical drainage is found to be worse when compared with percutaneous drainage.

e) Patients outcomes

The total mortality in this study was 3.3% (1 patient). The rest of the patients recovered fully. The patient who died had multiple, bilobular, pyogenic liver abscesses due to Staphylococcus aureus infection. Studies have reported a mortality rate of 2.8% in Thailand and 12.3% in UK. Deaths within 2 years of follow-up for ALA was found to be 3.33% in Bangladesh and in hospital mortality for PLA was 2.2% in South Korea. In another study, there were no mortalities for ALA but the 30-day mortality for pyogenic liver abscess was 5.3%.

The presence of weight loss, a longer median duration of symptoms, hypoalbuminaemia and giant liver abscess (abscess size ≥ 10 cm) in the majority of patients at presentation suggest that most of the patients with liver abscess present late. The reasons for this could be related to 1) delay in the community as most patients visit herbalist as first point of contact before visiting health facilities 2) The lack of specialist services (e.g. trained personnel, imaging services) in the primary and secondary health facilities which can result in miss diagnosis of patients liver abscess and 3) delay in health facilities before referring to tertiary facility due to inadequate referral protocol and guideline. The findings in this study further suggest that in resource-limited countries where advanced imaging techniques and modern treatment modalities for liver abscess are limited or unavailable, ultrasound-assisted percutaneous needle aspiration combined with antibiotic treatment still remains effective and safe in the treatment of liver abscess.

### Pediatric liver abscess: outcomes of protocol-based management and predictors of poor outcome [^dec38593]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Liver abscess (LA) is an important cause of morbidity in children, especially in tropical countries. There is a paucity of data in pediatric LA with no standard guidelines regarding the best modality of treatment and drainage. With a large influx of patients at our center and protocol-based management; we aimed to study clinic-radiologic profile, risk factors, complications and outcomes of children with liver abscess and assessed possible predictors for poor outcomes.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective observational study was conducted from January 2019 to September 2019 at a tertiary care hospital in India. Records of all children (< 12 years of age) with ultrasonographically diagnosed liver abscess were accessed for clinic-radiological and demographic profile, laboratory investigations, treatment, complications and outcomes. Patients were categorized into favorable or unfavorable groups based on predefined criteria and were compared for possible predictors of poor outcomes. Outcomes for the protocol-based management were analyzed.

Results

There were 120 cases of pediatric liver abscess with a median age of 5 years at presentation. The commonest clinical features were fever (100%) and pain in the abdomen (89.16%). The majority of liver abscesses were solitary (78.4%) and in the right lobe (73.3%). Malnutrition was present in 27.5%, overcrowding for 76.5% of patients and worm infestation in 2.5% of patients. Age-related leukocytosis (P = 0.004), neutrophilia (P = 0.013), elevated Aspartate transaminase (P = 0.008), elevated alanine transaminase (P = 0.007) and hypoalbuminemia (P = 0.014) were significantly more in the unfavorable group. Overall, 29.2% of patients underwent conservative management with antibiotics alone, 25.0% underwent percutaneous needle aspiration (PNA), 49.1% underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous drain (PCD) insertion and open surgical drainage (OSD) was needed in a single patient. The success rate was 100% for conservative management, 76.6% for PNA, 94.7% for PCD and 100% for OSD with an overall mortality of 2.5%.

Conclusions

Age-related leukocytosis, neutrophilia, elevated aspartate transaminase or alanine transaminase and hypoalbuminemia at presentation are predictors of poor outcomes in pediatric liver abscess. Protocol-based management leads to the appropriate use of PNA and PCD while decreasing mortality and morbidity related to either.

### Cirrhosis: diagnosis and management… [^992bd9e3]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology and Natural History of Cirrhosis Chronic liver injury causes inflammation and hepatic fibrosis. Regardless of the cause, this can lead to the formation of fibrous septae and nodules, collapse of liver structures, and distortion of hepatic parenchyma and vascular architecture. Progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis subsequently result in decreased metabolic and synthetic hepatic function, causing a rise in bilirubin and decreased production of clotting factors and thrombopoietin, as well as splenic platelet sequestration, increased portal pressure, and the development of ascites and esophageal varices. Newer research has established that liver fibrosis is a dynamic process and that even early cirrhosis is reversible. 11 Studies have demonstrated biopsy-proven fibrosis improvement rates as high as 88% after antiviral treatment in patients with HBV and HCV and as high as 85% after bariatric surgery in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. 12, 13.

After cirrhosis is established, a patient may remain clinically stable, or compensated, for years. Patients with compensated cirrhosis caused by HBV, HCV, and alcoholic liver disease develop clinical signs of decompensation, which include ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, jaundice, or bleeding, at a rate of 4% to 10% per year. 14 Variability of disease progression is influenced by the underlying cause and the presence or absence of treatment and ongoing liver injury. The median survival for those with compensated cirrhosis is 12 years, compared with two years once decompensation occurs.
15. Clinical Presentation HISTORY Most patients with compensated cirrhosis remain asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they include fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, right upper quadrant discomfort, and unexplained weight loss.

With the onset of decompensation, patients may report symptoms of impaired liver function such as jaundice, portal hypertension, and hepatic encephalopathy. Consultation Varices, hepatic encephalopathy, and ascites herald hepatic decompensation; these conditions warrant referral for subspecialist evaluation. The management of acute or refractory complications of cirrhosis is best addressed in the inpatient or referral setting.

### Tuberculous liver abscess: a case report and review of literature [^b30b12f8]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Tuberculous liver abscess is rare worldwide. We report a 45-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain, fever and weight loss. Ultrasound and computed tomography of the abdomen showed multiple cystic lesions in the liver. Ultrasound guided needle aspiration revealed yellowish brownish aspirate, which was flooded with acid-fast bacilli. The abscess was drained under ultrasound guidance. Subsequent abdominal ultrasound a few days later showed resolution of the abscess cavity. He was concomitantly started on systemic antituberculous therapy. A tuberculous liver abscess has to be thought of in the differential diagnosis of liver abscesses and to consider the role of percutaneous drainage along with systemic antituberculous chemotherapy as an alternative to surgery in the management. A greater awareness of this clinical entity is required for successful treatment.

### Endoscopic ultrasound-guided hepatic and perihepatic abscess drainage: an evolving technique [^e28e64b3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Interventional radiology-guided percutaneous drainage of liver abscesses with concomitant use of antibiotics has been the conventional approach for the treatment of liver abscesses. Hepatic abscesses refractory or not amenable to percutaneous drainage have been treated with surgical drainage, either via laparoscopic or open laparotomy techniques. The aim of this review was to evaluate the technical feasibility and efficacy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided drainage of liver abscesses. A literature review was performed to identify the studies describing the technique. In this review article we have summarized case series or reports describing EUS-guided liver abscess drainage. The indications, techniques, endoprostheses, limitations and complications reported are discussed. A total of seven cases have been described so far in the literature which included patients with failed conventional treatment modalities. The EUS-guided drainage technique involves puncturing the abscess using endosonography to gain access, passing a guidewire followed by tract dilation and placement of an endoprosthesis for drainage. Studies have reported 100% technical and clinical success rates in selected cases. No complications were reported. EUS-guided drainage of liver abscesses can be a safe and effective alternative approach in the management of liver abscesses in selected patients.

### Liver abscesses: factors that influence outcome of percutaneous drainage [^ad61af8b]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to identify the details of percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) of pyogenic liver abscesses, the etiologic factors, and the management techniques that contribute to successful treatment.

Materials and Methods

The records of 75 consecutively registered patients who underwent PCD of 96 abscesses at a single institution between May 2009 and May 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Thirty-nine patients (52%) were oncology patients, and 36 (48%) had recently undergone abdominal surgery. Primary success was defined as abscess healing with the primary PCD intervention and 30-day postdrainage survival. Salvage success was defined as abscess healing with follow-up secondary PCD placement for symptomatic hepatic satellite collections or for clinical recurrence. Catheter adjustments were performed during follow-up to optimize existing drains. Univariate, multivariate, and general linear mixed model analyses were performed. The median follow-up time after catheter removal was 6 months (range, 2–62 months).

Results

Drains were primarily successful in 54 patients (72%), and 17 patients (23%) needed salvage PCD; thus, overall success was achieved in 71 patients (95%). The other four patients (5%) died of sepsis. The primary success rate was reduced in patients with unresectable malignancies (p = 0.01), multiple abscesses (p = 0.01), and output ≥ 15 mL/d at catheter endpoint (n = 7, p = 0.001). Only unresectable malignancies had slightly lower overall success. Large abscesses (> 150 cm 3) required more catheter adjustments and longer drainage duration to reach abscess cavity closure. Successfully drained abscesses reached cavity closure a mean of 23 days (95% CI, 20–27 days) after treatment.

Conclusion

PCD was effective first-line treatment of complicated pyogenic liver abscesses, which often require catheter adjustment and salvage drainage procedures to reliably achieve success.

### Liver abscesses: pathogenesis, treatment, and ongoing challenges [^486495d3]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

Parenteral (non-oral) antibiotic therapy is generally preferred over oral administration to deliver the medication directly into the bloodstream. At present, no randomized clinical trials have specifically assessed the efficacy of various antibiotic regimens for treating KLAs. Consequently, the optimal antibiotic treatment for these infections remains a topic of ongoing debate. Historically, first-generation cephalosporins, with or without aminoglycoside therapy, were commonly selected due to their affordability, effectiveness, and the sensitivity of most hvKp strains that cause KLAs. Cephalosporins combined with aminoglycosides offer synergistic bactericidal activity against certain Gram-negative infections; however, studies have not demonstrated improved clinical outcomes compared to cephalosporins monotherapy, for the treatment of KLAs. Additionally, the use of aminoglycosides carries a risk of nephrotoxicity, which may outweigh any theoretical benefit, particularly in critically ill patients. More recently, thirdgeneration cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone are used to treat KLAs due to their increased stability to β-lactamases and extended half-life for once daily dosing. Additionally, ceftriaxone has a dual mechanism of elimination (through both the liver and kidney), which allows for treatment of patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction. However, even when KLAs are treated with antibiotics deemed appropriate based on in vitro susceptibility testing, outcomes are inconsistent. In some cases, antibiotic therapy combined with drainage effectively resolved the KLA. In other cases, antibiotic therapy with drainage failed to resolve the abscess or fever, necessitating surgical removal of the infected liver tissue even in otherwise healthy individuals. The reasons for these contrasting outcomes are not well understood but could depend on a variety of factors including penetration of the drugs to the site of infection, antagonism of antibiotics by factors encountered at the infection site, or the metabolic state of the bacteria within the abscess (Fig. 1), described in more detail below.

### Postprocedure sepsis in imaging-guided percutaneous hepatic abscess drainage: how often does it occur? [^68b94eca]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This retrospective study was conducted to determine the incidence of sepsis at our institution after percutaneous drainage of a hepatic abscess.

Materials and Methods

Thirty-three patients with a hepatic abscess treated using percutaneous aspiration and drainage from 1995 to 2000 were identified from a search of the interventional database. The patients' charts and CT images were reviewed independently by two radiologists for clinical presentation, relevant medical history, pre- and postprocedure antibiotic regimens, and clinical course after percutaneous aspiration and drainage. The preprocedure images were reviewed for the location and morphology of the abscess. The procedure details including percutaneous approach, guidance technique, catheter size, and immediate postprocedure complications were reviewed.

Results

Of the 33 patients, 14 patients underwent only needle aspiration of the abscess. In six (43%) of these 14 patients, the abscesses resolved with aspiration and appropriate antibiotic treatment alone. Eight (57%) of the patients who had aspiration of the abscess initially went on to have drainage catheters placed within a 72-hr period. Nineteen patients had drainage catheters placed from the onset. Of these, 17 patients (89%) had abscess resolution. Of the 27 patients who had catheters placed, a total of seven patients (26%) developed clinical symptoms of septicemia after catheter placement, but all patients, at least initially, responded to supportive treatment. Two patients died from septicemia 3–6 weeks after the procedure. None of the patients who underwent aspiration only developed postprocedure septicemia.

Conclusion

After placement of a percutaneous drainage catheter in a hepatic abscess, there is a significant risk (26%) of postprocedure sepsis. Although it appears to be a random and unpredictable event in our small series, interventional radiologists and referring physicians should be aware of the risk of sepsis after percutaneous drainage of hepatic abscess.

### Beyond pyogenic liver abscess: a comprehensive review of liver infections in emergency settings [^220e44ac]. Emergency Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatobiliary infections are commonly encountered in emergency settings ranging from common pathology such as pyogenic abscess to relatively uncommon and rare etiologies. Since extensive literature is already available on imaging of more common bacterial infections, for the sake of focused discussion, this review will discuss radiological appearance of less commonly encountered hepatic infections of fungal, parasitic, viral, and tubercular etiologies. Epidemiological and clinical information remain extremely important for obtaining more accurate presumptive diagnosis. In the era of diverse population migration, a modern-era radiologist must be well versed about the imaging spectrum of liver infections.

### MultiCenter study of intra-abdominal abscess formation after major operative hepatic trauma [^47a6dace]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

One of the significant complications of operative liver trauma is intra-abdominal abscesses (IAA). The objective of this study was to determine risk factors associated with postoperative IAA in surgical patients with major operative liver trauma.

Methods

A retrospective multi-institutional study was performed at 13 Level 1 and Level 2 trauma centers from 2012 to 2021. Adult patients with major liver trauma (grade 3 and higher) requiring operative management were enrolled. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.

Results

Three hundred seventy-two patients were included with 21.2% (n = 79/372) developing an IAA. No difference was found for age, gender, injury severity score, liver injury grade, and liver resections in patients between the groups (P > 0.05). Penetrating mechanism of injury (odds ratio (OR) 3.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54–7.57, P = 0.02), intraoperative massive transfusion protocol (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.23–4.79, P = 0.01), biloma/bile leak (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.01–4.53, P = 0.04), hospital length of stay (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02–1.06, P < 0.001), and additional intra-abdominal injuries (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.09–4.72, P = 0.03) were independent risk factors for IAA. Intra-abdominal drains, damage control laparotomy, total units of packed red blood cells, number of days with an open abdomen, total abdominal surgeries, and blood loss during surgery were not found to be associated with a higher risk of IAA.

Conclusions

Patients with penetrating trauma, massive transfusion protocol activation, longer hospital length of stay, and injuries to other intra-abdominal organs were at higher risk for the development of an IAA following operative liver trauma. Results from this study could help to refine existing guidelines for managing complex operative traumatic liver injuries.

### Treatment of an amebic liver abscess with intravenous metronidazole… [^a2711f70]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A case of amebic liver abscess was treated in which the abscess was not visualized by hepatic ultrasonography, thus delaying the diagnosis and initiation of appropriate therapy. The abscess was surgically drained because of imminent rupture. Postoperatively, the patient was unable to take oral medications and was successfully treated with intravenously administered metronidazole. Hepatic ultrasonography should not be relied on to rule out liver abscesses. We suggest that parenteral metronidazole should be considered as an alternate therapy to dehydroemetine in patients who are not able to take oral medications. Kovaleski T, Malangoni MA, Wheat LJ.

### Endoscopic treatment of a hepatic cyst, buried lumen-apposing metal stent, and liver abscess: the good, the bad, the ugly [^4513e336]. VideoGIE (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Ideally located, symptomatic hepatic cysts in nonsurgical patients can be treated with EUS-guided cystogastrostomy using a LAMS. One must drain all components of the cyst and be aware of the risk of buried LAMS in the antrum. Management of patients with a large symptomatic hepatic cyst should be carried out in a multidisciplinary setting. This case demonstrated that long-term relief of symptomatic cysts can be achieved with a cystogastrostomy. The procedure and indication require further study before being widely adopted, and the risk of life-threatening bleeding (as with any transhepatic puncture) should be discussed with the patient.

### Two cases of monomicrobial intraabdominal abscesses due to KPC – 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 clone [^39b24721]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The management of liver and pancreatic pyogenic abscesses is extremely complex. A treatment of choice that could be consistently adopted as a first line of intervention has still to be defined. The literature describes a wide range of approaches, ranging from simple conservative treatments associated with specific antibiotic therapy to surgical interventionist approaches using endoscopic or percutaneous drainage or the traditional open method. However, while interventional endoscopy is a common strategy across recent reports, there is still a lot of debate over what is the best drainage technique to adopt.

Both patients described in this report underwent percutaneous drainage as there was no evidence of complications (e.g. intra-abdominal rupture, shock, peritonitis). This approach allowed us to diagnose the monomicrobial nature of the abscess. Although K. pneumoniae has previously been identified in western Europe as a causative agent of liver abscesses, monomicrobial infections, as appeared in both of our cases, have been rarely described.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: classification, diagnosis, and management [^e376a1c4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Liver abscess

Pyogenic liver abscesses develop secondary to ascending cholangitis, hematogenous dissemination, or pylephlebitis following intra-abdominal infections such as acute appendicitis or diverticulitis. The incidence is higher in middle-aged or elderly patients who present with low-grade evening fever, right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, tender hepatomegaly, and elevated white blood cell count.

Infectious abscesses on contrast-enhanced CT demonstrate a peripherally enhancing rim surrounding a central low attenuation area, and then an outer low attenuation zone secondary to perilesional parenchymal edema, producing the characteristic "double target" sign. The presence of gas within an abscess is a strong indication of gas-producing species. Treatment options for pyogenic liver abscesses include antibiotic therapy and percutaneous or open drainage. Long-term antibiotic therapy alone (> 3 weeks) can be applied in patients with single small (< 3 cm) liver abscesses. Percutaneous catheter drainage combined with antibiotics has been associated with success rates exceeding 97% and more rapid clinical improvement. Ahmed et al studied 40 patients with pyogenic liver abscesses measuring > 10 cm in diameter. Percutaneous drainage was successful in 98% of patients, with 1 patient requiring subsequent open drainage and 3 patients undergoing secondary percutaneous drainage procedures. Complications (mostly minor) were observed in 25% of patients and there was 1 death. Open surgical drainage comes into play for patients who fail to respond to the above treatment, as well as in patients with peritonitis or complex, septated, and multiloculated abscesses.

Amoebic abscess is the most common extracolonic manifestation of amebiasis. Patients present with hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant pain, diarrhea, history of travel to an endemic area and positive serology. Unlike pyogenic abscesses, amoebic abscesses rarely need therapeutic drainage and are quite effectively managed with oral metronidazole administered for 7–10 days. Percutaneous or surgical drainage may be necessary in up to 15% of cases, to manage enlarging superficial abscesses (with high risk of rupture), bacterial superinfections, or when metronidazole treatment fails.

Candida abscesses are usually encountered in immune-compromised patients. CT scans show multiple low-attenuation lesions, with a typical enhancing rim and frequent involvement of the spleen. In patients who fail to improve after drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotics, antimycotic therapy should be considered early, before the onset of fungemia.

### A finding of hepatic abscess in a teenager presenting with abdominal pain [^b10ef817]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Pyogenic hepatic abscess is a rare infection, but it is an important diagnosis to consider because the current mortality is approximately 5%. We present a case of abdominal pain in a 16-year-old male patient whose presentation was initially concerning for appendicitis but was later diagnosed as having a pyogenic hepatic abscess. It is important to direct the patient to the proper treatment including source control with drainage and antibiotics to decrease morbidity and mortality.

### Treatment of liver abscess: prospective randomized comparison of catheter drainage and needle aspiration [^c57f4a4b]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

A liver abscess is a suppurative cavity in the liver resulting from the invasion and multiplication of microorganisms, entering directly from an injury through the blood vessels or by the way of the biliary ductal system. Liver abscesses are most commonly due to pyogenic, amebic or mixed infections. Less commonly these may be fungal in origin.

Liver abscess has been recognized since Hippocrates (circa 400 B.C.) who speculated that the prognoses of the patients were related to the type of fluid within the abscess cavity. Although amebic liver abscess occurs more commonly on a worldwide basis, the pyogenic liver abscess predominates in the United States.

Liver abscess is found more commonly in men between 20 and 40 years of age, but can occur at any age. Approximately 60% are solitary and mainly located in the right lobe of the liver, as a result of the streaming of portal blood flow secondary to the fact that the right lobe is predominantly supplied by the superior mesenteric vein, and because most of the hepatic volume is in the right lobe. When multiple abscesses are present, pyogenic or mixed is the most probable type. Patients usually present with a constant dull pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen which may be referred to the scapular region or the right shoulder. These patients usually have fever of between 38 o C and 40 o C.

Liver abscesses, both amebic and pyogenic, continue to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical countries. However, recent advances in interventional radiology, intensive care, progress in antibiotic therapy, and liberal use of sonography and computerized tomography scanning of the abdomen have led to early diagnosis and treatment of patients with liver abscess, thus improving the patient outcome. Percutaneous drainage of liver abscess has been an important advancement in the treatment of pyogenic liver abscesses.

The primary mode of treatment of amebic liver abscess is medical; however as many as 15% of amebic abscesses may be refractory to medical therapy. Also, secondary bacterial infection may complicate 20% of amebic liver abscesses. In such patients and in patients with pyogenic liver abscesses, surgical drainage has been the traditional mode of treatment. However, operative drainage is associated with significant (10–47%) morbidity and mortality.

INTERVENTION

Standard of care

KLAs are commonly identified using a CT scan or ultrasound imaging combined with K. pneumoniae culture from abscess aspirate or blood. Treatment involves systemic antibiotic therapy, which is customized based on the results of in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing. In addition to antibiotics, drainage of the liver abscess is often recommended although the location of the abscess can significantly impact the patient's risk. For instance, a study examining six case reports of patients with KLAs found that five of the patients successfully underwent percutaneous drainage. In some cases, abscesses located beneath the diaphragm may be difficult or impossible to drain safely, as attempts could pose a significant risk of complications such as pneumothorax. Additionally, KLAs often present as large, multiloculated abscesses with hypermucoviscous consistency that poses challenges for effective drainage using standard needle aspiration techniques. Incomplete drainage can lead to persistent infections, an increased likelihood of complications such as the formation of new abscesses, bacteremia, metastatic infection, or even death.

INTRODUCTION

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative, non-motile encapsulated bacteria, and strains are separated into two pathotypes: classical K. pneumoniae (cKp) and hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp). CKp strains are frequently multidrug resistant and are a major cause of hospital-acquired infections, such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and urinary tract infections (UTIs), particularly in immunocompromised individuals. HvKp can also cause these types of infections but are distinct in their ability to cause severe community-acquired tissue-invasive infections in immunocompetent individuals. While hvKp infections are most prevalent in populations in Asian countries, their incidence is rising globally, and hvKp is now recognized as a significant cause of pyogenic (pus-filled) liver abscesses in the United States and Europe.

K. pneumoniae is a common colonizer of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, detected in 4%–35% of stool samples in Western countries and in 18%–88% of individuals in endemic regions. In Asian populations, approximately 10% of individuals colonized with K. pneumoniae harbor strains that are likely hvKp. However, the prevalence of hvKp GI carriage in Western countries remains poorly defined, as most studies do not distinguish between cKp and hvKp strains.

KLAs can occur when hvKp migrates from the gut to the liver via the portal vein, typically following bowel leakage. However, KLAs can also arise from other primary sites, such as lung or wound infections. Gut colonization by hvKp is also thought to facilitate community transmission through the fecal-oral route.

Once established, hvKp liver abscesses are difficult to treat with antibiotics and are prone to metastatic spread, leading to conditions such as endophthalmitis or meningitis that can result in vision loss or death, respectively. Reported mortality rates for KLAs range from 5% to 40%. Despite the significant clinical impact of KLAs, the mechanisms underlying the poor outcomes are not well understood. In this review, we explore the pathogenesis of KLAs, and the challenges associated with management and treatment of these infections.

### Triple biliary drainage: adding a third direction [^56fb166d]. VideoGIE (2024). Medium credibility.

Hepatic abscess formation is secondary to ascending biliary infections, peritoneal contamination by bowel contents, or hematogenous spread from the portal or systemic circulation. The mainstays of treatment are antimicrobials based on needle aspirates and percutaneous drainage. Surgical drainage is warranted for patients who fail to respond to conventional management or have an abscess that is not accessible by interventional radiology. Surgical management includes laparoscopic or open laparotomy. Liver abscesses can occur in segment 2 or 3, which are in close proximity to the stomach and readily available to therapeutic interventions by EUS.

Initial attempts at endoscopic drainage were by ERCP. This means of drainage is only successful if the abscess is contiguous with the biliary tree. The advances in EUS have allowed for improvements in cystgastrostomy, choledochoduodenostomy, and transluminal gallbladder drainage. The technique of using EUS-guided hepaticogastrostomy was first reported in 2003. There have been significant advances in both technique and available equipment.

A review of 7 cases in 2014presented the infections, techniques, accessories, endoprostheses, limitations, and adverse events reported with EUS-guided liver abscess drainage. Case series have shown high rates of technical success and are comparable to percutaneous drainage in selected patients. Case reports have been published of EUS-guided hepaticogastrostomy with lumen-apposing metal stents. There are now some data on outcomes of a long partially covered metal stent used for a hepaticogastrostomy. Technical success rates (100%) and clinical success rates (94%) were high, but so were adverse events with an adverse event occurring in 25% of patients. It is unclear what the long-term prognosis is of patients with indwelling stents and how outcomes compare with standard percutaneous drainage.

### Image-guided percutaneous procedure plus metronidazole versus metronidazole alone for uncomplicated amoebic liver abscess [^26d0da6f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Metronidazole is the standard of care for uncomplicated amoebic liver abscesses (considering that complicated liver abscesses are those localized in left lobe, multiple, and/or pyogenic abscesses). However, a subset of patients with amoebic liver abscesses remain symptomatic, with a significant risk of rupture of the abscess into the peritoneum. The role of image-guided percutaneous therapeutic aspiration in these patients remains controversial.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of image-guided percutaneous procedure plus metronidazole versus metronidazole alone in patients with uncomplicated amoebic liver abscess.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2007), EMBASE (1988 to September 2007), and Science Citation Index Expanded (1945 to September 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing an image-guided percutaneous procedure plus metronidazole versus metronidazole alone in patients with uncomplicated amoebic liver abscess.

Data Collection and Analysis

Inclusion criteria, trial quality assessment, and data extraction were done in duplicate. We calculated relative risks (RR) and mean differences, and checked for heterogeneity by visual inspection of forest plots and chi-squared and I(2) tests.

Main Results

Seven low quality randomised trials were included. All studies included a total of 310 patients, but due to selective outcome reporting bias, less patients could be included in our analyses. Pooled analysis of three homogenous trials showed that needle aspiration did not significantly increase the proportion of patients with fever resolution (RR 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.61). Sensitivity analysis according to trial quality preserved these findings. Trials that evaluated resolution of abdominal pain, days to resolution of fever, pain, resolution of abscess cavities, reduction in liver size, and duration of hospitalisation were heterogeneous. The benefits in the number of days to resolution of pain (MD -1.59, 95%CI -2.73 to -0.42), number of days to resolution of abdominal tenderness (MD -1.70, 95%CI -2.86 to -0.54), and duration of hospitalisation (MD -1.31, 95%CI -2.05 to -0.57) were observed in the needle aspiration group only.

Authors' Conclusions

Therapeutic aspiration in addition to metronidazole to hasten clinical or radiologic resolution of uncomplicated amoebic liver abscesses cannot be supported or refuted by the present evidence. The trials lack methodological rigour and adequate sample size to conclude on the presence of effectiveness of adjunctive image-guided aspiration plus metronidazole versus metronidazole alone. Further randomised trials are necessary.

### A rare complication of pyogenic hepatic abscess after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy-case report and literature review emphasizing the role of imaging [^48bec8d0]. Clinical Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

A pyogenic hepatic abscess is an uncommon complication after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) that can develop secondary to an infected hematoma or a staple line leak due to bacterial seeding. Appropriate screening for and management of a pyogenic hepatic abscess are essential in patients with clinical suspicion for complications after LSG. Early diagnosis is essential as pyogenic hepatic abscess can be fatal if not treated early. Only five cases have been reported in the literature so far. We present a case of pyogenic hepatic abscess that occurred two weeks after LSG in a 46-year-old female without immunosuppressive conditions or early postoperative leak. The abscess was diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) and was successfully treated with antibiotics and CT-guided drainage.

### 18F-PSMA expression in amoebic liver abscesses mimics as metastatic prostate cancer [^9458592f]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT imaging has revolutionized the management of prostate cancer. Increased PSMA expression is also reported in many benign pathologies and can lead to diagnostic pitfalls if not carefully considered. The knowledge of these conditions is crucial in clinical decision-making in prostate cancer. Here, we highlight a case of liver amoebic abscesses interpreted as necrotic hepatic metastases on ultrasonography showing PSMA expression in periphery of the early hepatic amoebic lesions.

### Diverticulitis: a comprehensive review with usual and unusual complications [^60dddf64]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment approach to the abscess depends on its size as well as the location and the overall medical condition of the patient. Conservative management may be preferred in abscesses less than 3 cm in size whereas percutaneous drainage or surgical intervention may be required for larger lesions. Complicated diverticulitis are classified according to the Hinchey classification (Table 1). Stage III and IV diverticulitis in the Hinchey classification requires emergency operative treatment.

Table 1
Staging complicated diverticulitis by CT

Abscess secondary to diverticulitis may also occur at distant sites such as liver, adnexa, lung and rare localizations such as brain and spine. The liver is the most common remote site of abscess formation. Hematogeneous spread of microorganisms may be due to bacterial invasion into the portal system via colonic mucosal defects. The mortality rate in case of pylephlebitis and liver abscess formation can be as high as 32%. On US, these hepatic abscesses may appear as highly echogenic fluid collection with thick walls. However, it should be kept in mind that liver abscesses may also mimic an infiltrative solid mass with ill-defined contours on US (Fig. 5). CT is the most commonly used imaging modality and abscesses appear as hypodense fluid-attenuated lesions with intensely enhancing walls and may contain air. Multiphasic imaging (with arterial phase) may aid in differentiating an abscess from possibly other malignant lesions.

### Endoscopic treatment of a hepatic cyst, buried lumen-apposing metal stent, and liver abscess: the good, the bad, the ugly [^3d987a02]. VideoGIE (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic cysts represent a heterogenous group of lesions that typically have a benign course. However, a minority of these cysts can cause symptoms related to abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or bloating. A larger cyst can lead to adverse events related to infection, spontaneous hemorrhage, compression of the biliary tree, or potential malignant transformation. These symptomatic cysts are ideally managed with percutaneous aspiration or surgery. In this video, we describe a patient who underwent multiple surgical attempts over a 33-year period to completely eradicate a recurrent hepatic cyst that was ultimately managed endoscopically despite adverse events by a buried lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) and a liver abscess (Video 1, available online at).

### An appraisal of surgical and percutaneous drainage for pyogenic liver abscesses larger than 5 CM [^8948487e]. Annals of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether first-line treatment with percutaneous or surgical drainage of liver abscesses larger than 5 cm results in better clinical outcome.

Summary Background Data

Pyogenic liver abscesses larger than 5 cm are currently treated by intravenous antibiotics and either percutaneous (PD) or surgical drainage (SD). Percutaneous techniques have been increasingly performed in place of open drainage as first-line treatment. This paradigm shift has been fueled by the drive for low-risk and less-invasive procedures and the surgical option being reserved for percutaneous failures. Yet there is a lack of data to support percutaneous drainage over open surgical drainage as first-line treatment.

Methods

Over a 3-year period, 80 patients with liver abscesses larger than 5 cm amenable to PD and SD were included in the study. This situation was possible as 1 team of surgeons favored the use of PD and 1 team favored the use of SD as first-line treatment. The treatment outcomes in both groups were compared, and clinical end-points included time to defervescence of fever, failure of treatment, secondary procedures, hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality.

Results

PD was performed in 36 patients and SD in 44 patients as first-line treatment. Clinical, laboratory, and abscess parameters were comparable in both groups. Sixty-four of 80 patients (80%) had multiloculated abscess. The time to defervescence of fever was not statistically significant (PD versus SD, 4.85 versus 4.38 days; P = 0.09). However, SD had less treatment failures (3 versus 10, P = 0.013), less requirement for secondary procedures (5 versus 13, P = 0.01), and shorter length of hospital stay (8 versus 11 days, P = 0.03). There was no difference in morbidity or mortality rates.

Conclusions

The results of our study show that for large liver abscesses more than 5 cm, SD provides better clinical outcomes than PD in terms of treatment success, number of secondary procedures, and hospital stay with comparable morbidity and mortality rates. SD should be considered as first-line treatment of large liver abscesses.

### Amebic abscess of the liver with secondary infection… [^761a4f35]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Amebic abscesses of the liver may be divided into two groups from the standpoints of therapy and prognosis. The first group is composed of those without secondary bacterial infection. The accepted method of therapy in this group is the administration of emetine hydrochloride, usually combined with aspiration of the abscess. Open drainage is contraindicated, since it causes a higher fatality rate, chiefly because of the unavoidable postoperative bacterial invasion of the abscess. In a collected series of 5, 000 cases, Ochsner and DeBakey1 report a fatality rate of 5. 6 per cent for the cases treated by the closed method and
43. 1 per cent for the cases treated by open drainage. The second group consists of amebic abscesses which have become secondarily infected with bacteria of various types. In these cases the prognosis is much worse, and the accepted surgical treatment is essentially the same as for other pyogenic hepatic abscesses. Noth PH, Hirshfeld JW.

### Percutaneous needle aspiration of multiple pyogenic abscesses of the liver: 13-year single-center experience [^88041994]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to report 13 years of experience in the management of multiple pyogenic liver abscesses with only percutaneous needle aspiration of the abscess cavities under sonographic guidance.

Materials and Methods

From December 1991 to October 2004, 39 consecutively registered patients (29 men and 10 women; age range, 37–82 years; mean age, 64 years) with 118 pyogenic liver abscesses were treated with sonographically guided percutaneous needle aspiration at our institution. The number of pyogenic liver abscesses per patient ranged from two to 15 (mean, 3.0).

Results

Eighty-seven percutaneous needle aspirations were performed on 39 patients with 118 pyogenic liver abscesses (range, 1–4 aspirations per patient; mean, 2.2 aspirations per patient). Because they were close to another aspirated abscess in the right lobe of the liver, 31 (26.3%) of 118 abscesses were aspirated without removal of the needle from the liver. Thirty-six (92.3%) of 39 patients were treated with a single aspiration of an abscess in a single session. The other three patients needed two aspiration sessions. No patient needed imaging-guided percutaneous catheter drainage or open surgical drainage. Complete reconstitution of liver parenchyma occurred within a maximum of 80 days. No abscesses recurred during the follow-up period, which ranged from 7 to 42 months (mean, 18 months).

Conclusion

Percutaneous needle aspiration of multiple pyogenic abscesses under sonographic guidance is a safe, effective, and low-cost procedure. In our experience, percutaneous needle aspiration was acceptable to patients. Our data suggest that a trial of percutaneous needle aspiration should always be undertaken before catheter drainage or surgery.

### Prognosis of liver abscess in the intensive care unit (POLAIR), a multicentre observational study [^07e7e5d6]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of critically ill patients with liver abscess (LA) admitted to 24 ICUs in France over a decade, representing the largest cohort of severe LA cases published to date.

We observed an ICU mortality rate of 11.6%, significantly lower than the 28% reported in 2008. This may reflect improvements in ICU management, as seen in other septic conditions.

Patient characteristics were consistent with previous studies, with diabetes, cancer and chronic liver disease being the most common comorbidities. As expected, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp remained the predominant pathogens.

Higher SOFA scores were strongly associated with mortality, reinforcing the link between organ dysfunction and poor prognosis. Similarly, portal vein thrombosis (PVT) was a significant risk factor, consistent with recent reports of its impact on mortality and recurrence. This may be related to undiagnosed hepatic comorbidities or to hazards of anticoagulant therapy in these critically-ill patients.

Microbiological documentation varied according to the method of collection. While pus cultures from abscesses were less likely to be positive, they tended to yield polymicrobial results compared with blood cultures. In this study, blood cultures appeared to be the most effective method of identifying pathogens in LA, as only 53% of patients who underwent drainage had a positive abscess culture.

It can be hypothesised that, since the median time to drainage was one day after admission, the procedure was often performed under ongoing antibiotic therapy, which may have reduced the sensitivity of pus cultures. The discrepancy between blood and abscess cultures may be due to several factors, including early administration of antibiotics, variations in bacterial load and growth conditions, and differences in specimen collection techniques. Early antibiotic exposure prior to drainage may have reduced bacterial recovery from abscess cultures. In addition, while blood cultures are obtained under strictly sterile conditions, liver abscess aspiration is technically challenging and may be affected by sampling variability, potentially affecting microbial detection rates.

### Treatment of uncomplicated hepatic cystic echinococcosis (hydatid disease) [^2828ffc0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cystic echinococcosis is a parasitic infection mainly impacting people living in low- and middle-income countries. Infection may lead to cyst development within organs, pain, non-specific symptoms or complications including abscesses and cyst rupture. Treatment can be difficult and varies by country. Treatments include oral medication, percutaneous techniques and surgery. One Cochrane review previously assessed the benefits and harms of percutaneous treatment compared with other treatments. However, evidence for oral medication, percutaneous techniques and surgery in specific cyst stages has not been systematically investigated and the optimal choice remains uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of medication, percutaneous and surgical interventions for treating uncomplicated hepatic cystic echinococcosis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, two other databases and two trial registries to 4 May 2023. We searched the reference lists of included studies, and contacted experts and researchers in the field for relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in people with a diagnosis of uncomplicated hepatic cystic echinococcosis of World Health Organization (WHO) cyst stage CE1, CE2, CE3a or CE3b comparing either oral medication (albendazole) to albendazole plus percutaneous interventions, or to surgery plus albendazole. Studies comparing praziquantel plus albendazole to albendazole alone prior to or following an invasive intervention (surgery or percutaneous treatment) were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were symptom improvement, recurrence, inactive cyst at 12 months and all-cause mortality at 30 days. Our secondary outcomes were development of secondary echinococcosis, complications of treatment and duration of hospital stay. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included three RCTs with 180 adults and children with hepatic cystic echinococcosis. Two studies enrolled people aged 5 to 72 years, and one study enrolled children aged 6 to 14 years. One study compared standard catheterization plus albendazole with puncture, aspiration, injection and re-aspiration (PAIR) plus albendazole, and two studies compared laparoscopic surgery plus albendazole with open surgery plus albendazole. The three RCTs were published between 2020 and 2022 and conducted in India, Pakistan and Turkey. There were no other comparisons. Standard catheterization plus albendazole versus PAIR plus albendazole The cyst stages were CE1 and CE3a. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of standard catheterization plus albendazole compared with PAIR plus albendazole on cyst recurrence (risk ratio (RR) 3.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 84.66; 1 study, 38 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of standard catheterization plus albendazole on 30-day all-cause mortality and development of secondary echinococcosis compared to open surgery plus albendazole. There were no cases of mortality at 30 days or secondary echinococcosis (1 study, 38 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Major complications were reported by cyst and not by participant. Standard catheterization plus albendazole may increase major cyst complications compared with PAIR plus albendazole, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 10.74, 95% CI 1.39 to 82.67; 1 study, 53 cysts; very low-certainty evidence). Standard catheterization plus albendazole may make little to no difference on minor complications compared with PAIR plus albendazole, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.77; 1 study, 38 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Standard catheterization plus albendazole may increase the median duration of hospital stay compared with PAIR plus albendazole, but the evidence is very uncertain (4 (range 1 to 52) days versus 1 (range 1 to 15) days; 1 study, 38 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Symptom improvement and inactive cysts at 12 months were not reported. Laparoscopic surgery plus albendazole versus open surgery plus albendazole The cyst stages were CE1, CE2, CE3a and CE3b. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of laparoscopic surgery plus albendazole on cyst recurrence in participants with CE2 and CE3b cysts compared to open surgery plus albendazole (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 71.56; 1 study, 82 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The second study involving 60 participants with CE1, CE2 or CE3a cysts reported no recurrence in either group. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of laparoscopic surgery plus albendazole on 30-day all-cause mortality in participants with CE1, CE2, CE3a or CE3b cysts compared to open surgery plus albendazole. There was no mortality in either group (2 studies, 142 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of laparoscopic surgery plus albendazole on major complications in participants with CE1, CE2, CE3a or CE3b cysts compared to open surgery plus albendazole (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.92; 2 studies, 142 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Laparoscopic surgery plus albendazole may lead to slightly fewer minor complications in participants with CE1, CE2, CE3a or CE3b cysts compared to open surgery plus albendazole (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.98; 2 studies, 142 participants; low-certainty evidence). Laparoscopic surgery plus albendazole may reduce the duration of hospital stay compared with open surgery plus albendazole (mean difference (MD) -1.90 days, 95% CI -2.99 to -0.82; 2 studies, 142 participants; low-certainty evidence). Symptom improvement, inactive cyst at 12 months and development of secondary echinococcosis were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Percutaneous and surgical interventions combined with albendazole can be used to treat uncomplicated hepatic cystic echinococcosis; however, there is a scarcity of randomised evidence directly comparing these interventions. There is very low-certainty evidence to indicate that standard catheterization plus albendazole may lead to fewer cases of recurrence, more major complications and similar complication rates compared to PAIR plus albendazole in adults and children with CE1 and CE3a cysts. There is very low-certainty evidence to indicate that laparoscopic surgery plus albendazole may result in fewer cases of recurrence or fewer major complications compared to open surgery plus albendazole in adults and children with CE1, CE2, CE3a and CE3b cysts. Laparoscopic surgery plus albendazole may lead to slightly fewer minor complications. Firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to the limited number of studies, small sample size and lack of events for some outcomes.

### Liver abscess due to ileocecal perforation: a case report with literature review [^340e1d09]. Emergency Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The pyogenic liver abscess is a potentially life-threatening disease with low incidence, which has undergone significant changes in epidemiology, management and mortality over the past decades. Usually, patients with pyogenic liver abscesses present to the emergency department with fever of unknown origin. The computed tomography (CT) is basic to confirm the diagnosis.

### Tracking the foreign body, a rare cause of hepatic abscess [^44455cb5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Despite the sensitivity of CT, pre-operative diagnosis remains poor in recent reviews, averaging 25%. When a liver abscess is diagnosed, the presence of a foreign object as the source of the infection should be suspected if, in the previous 3 months, the patient has complained of epigastralgias of unknown origin or has had hematemesis, or if the patient shows more than one of the following characteristics: left lobe liver abscess, single location, no comorbidities, failure of antibiotic-based treatment, indirect signs of foreign object perforation on CT (thickened gastrointestinal walls, fistulous tract), or adherences between the liver and the gastrointestinal tract during surgery.

Treatment consists of culture-guided antibiotherapy, drainage, abcess and laparotomy for fishbone removal followed if necessary by the perforation site repair. Germs responsible for abscess formation are typically found in the normal flora of the human oral cavity, or alternatively those of the lower gut flora. Wide-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated on presentation; then guided by culture of aspirates. A conservative approach consisting of radiological-guided percutaneous aspiration and drainage of the abscess can be considered, but if the fishbone is not extracted, it must be regarded as an ongoing risk for organ injury and microbial colonisation.

The mortality in a recent review of 17 cases of liver abscesses secondary to fishbone perforation was 17,6%. This high mortality rate underscores the difficulty of diagnosis and the need for awareness of this rare occurrence.

### Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess: a new invasive syndrome [^5538925c]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a well known human nosocomial pathogen. Most community-acquired K pneumoniae infections cause pneumonia or urinary tract infections. During the past two decades, however, a distinct invasive syndrome that causes liver abscesses has been increasingly reported in Asia, and this syndrome is emerging as a global disease. In this Review, we summarise the clinical presentation and management as well the microbiological aspects of this invasive disease. Diabetes mellitus and two specific capsular types in the bacterium predispose a patient to the development of liver abscesses and the following metastatic complications: bacteraemia, meningitis, endophthalmitis, and necrotising fasciitis. For patients with this invasive syndrome, appropriate antimicrobial treatment combined with percutaneous drainage of liver abscesses increases their chances of survival. Rapid detection of the hypervirulent strain that causes this syndrome allows earlier diagnosis and treatment, thus minimising the occurrence of sequelae and improving clinical outcomes.

### Percutaneous and surgical treatment of pyogenic liver abscesses: observation over a 21-year period in 148 patients [^65c1e052]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Percutaneous drainage of pyogenic liver abscess has become first-line treatment. In the past surgical drainage was preferred in some centres.

Aim

The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the effectiveness of percutaneous treatments and surgical drainage, in terms of treatment success, hospital stay and costs.

Patients

Data of 148 patients (90 males; 58 females; mean age, 61 yrs; range, 30–86 yrs) were retrospectively analysed.

Methods

Patients' outcomes, including the length of hospital stay, procedure-related complications, treatment failure and death, were recorded. Multiple logistic regression model was used for statistical analysis.

Results

One hundred and four patients (83 with solitary and 21 with multiple abscesses) were treated percutaneously, either by needle aspiration (91 patients) or catheter drainage (13 patients) depending on the abscess's size, and 44 patients (30 with solitary and 14 with multiple abscesses) were treated surgically. There was no statistically significant difference in patients' demographics or abscess characteristics between groups. Hospital stay was longer, and costs were higher in patients treated surgically (p < 0.001). There was statistically significant difference in morbidity rate between groups (p < 0.001). No death occurred in both groups.

Conclusions

Percutaneous and surgical treatment of pyogenic liver abscesses are both effective, nevertheless percutaneous drainage carries lower morbidity and is cheaper.

### Summary of clinical features of 1800 cases of pyogenic liver abscess [^3b1fadf3]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, when diagnosing and treating PLA, clinicians should continuously deepen their understanding of liver diseases. Alongside familiarizing themselves with traditional pathogens, they should remain vigilant for rare or emerging strains. It is also important to closely monitor global and regional resistance patterns and use antimicrobial agents according to guidelines to ensure effective patient treatment and prognosis. However, this study has certain limitations: the small number of liver abscess cases included may restrict the generalizability of the findings and the reliability of the statistical analysis. Due to the limited sample size, caution should be exercised when applying these findings to other populations or regions. Future research should focus on more comprehensive and detailed sample selection and study design to enhance the generalizability and applicability of the results. Additionally, although this study explored the diversity of pathogens causing PLA, it did not delve into the characteristics of different strains and their impact on treatment. Future studies should further analyze the resistance patterns and treatment outcomes of different strains.

### Purulent pericarditis and septic shock secondary to a hepatic-pericardial fistula in a patient with complex oncologic and cardiac history [^6a83f862]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Hepatic-pericardial fistulas, though rare, should be part of the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with signs of purulent pericarditis and septic shock, particularly in the presence of liver abscess. Multidisciplinary management, including early surgical intervention with definitive repair of the fistula, proper antibiotic management, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and vasopressor support, is critical for the management of patients with purulent pericarditis and septic shock secondary to hepatic-pericardial fistulas.

### Tracking the foreign body, a rare cause of hepatic abscess [^6cef2659]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This case report illustrates an uncommon cause of liver abcess rarely observed in the westerns world. Fishbones ingestion responsible of this complications are more often described in the Asian Literature. This clinical case also emphasises the fact that, although we have access to powerful imagery methods, the diagnosis of foreign body ingestion still remains a confounding one. Indeed, many liver abscesses secondary to perforation are still being misdiagnosed as cryptogenic, thereby impending a correct management. Failure to recognise this particular condition has serious repercussions, as shows the high mortality due to perforation and/or septic shock.

### A rare hepatic mass in an Italian resident [^4e8b2129]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Amebiasis is a rare condition in developed countries, even in high-risk subgroups. The presence of liver abscess is usually suggested by clinical history and signs and/or symptoms of the disease. ALA usually comes from hematic circulation, probably via the portal circulation, after amoebic trophozoites have breached the colic mucosa. Interestingly, our case showed three major peculiarities. First, exceptional indolence until severe hepatic diffusion: indeed, left-side lobe abscess localizations are much less frequent and less symptomatic than right-side ones, that usually present prodromic diarrhea, hypochondrial pain and hepatomegaly. Second, and more important, our patient did not refer travels abroad, nor risky-behavior: he could only have somehow been infected during his job as longshoreman in the industrial port. For sure, globalization and easier way to travel have contributed to the emergence of specific parasitic diseases in novel geographical areas and in workers normally considered not at risk. Third, the presence of thrombosis in the left portal vein. Because of abscess compression and mass effect on adjacent structures, extrinsic obstruction and subsequent reduced blood flow combined with the inflammatory environment due to the ongoing infection can lead to vein thrombosis, in agreement with Virchow's triad. Thrombosis of inferior and/or intrahepatic vena cava is a very rare complication of ALA only described in single case reports regarding patients born in endemic areas or with well-determined source of infection. Thrombosis of the portal vein and/or its ramifications is extremely rare but can be possible too. As suggested in literature, antibiotic therapy coupled with percutaneous drainage is the mainstay of management. Specifically, percutaneous drainage should be performed when abscess are larger than 4 cm. Moreover, percutaneous drainage alone in giant pyogenic liver abscess has been demonstrated to be a safe and sufficient treatment with a very low rate of complications. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of left portal vein thrombosis consequent to ALA in a patient who lives in a Western Country without any obvious risk factor. In conclusion, in developed countries, clinicians should be aware of ALA as a potential diagnosis in cases of fever of unknow origin and unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotic-therapy, especially in patients with history of travels, high-risk behavior and, interestingly, jobs like worker in ports, airports and frontiers, not commonly considered at risk for amoebic infections.

### Endoscopic management of liver abscesses and cysts that communicate with intrahepatic bile ducts [^f543873f]. Endoscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

The formation of a communication between liver abscesses or cysts and intrahepatic bile ducts is an uncommon cause of significant bile leak. Surgical management of biliary fistulas is associated with high morbidity and mortality. We performed a prospective study of endoscopic management of this type of biliary fistula.

Patients and Methods

We studied 26 patients who had either liver abscesses or hepatic cysts that had ruptured into the intrahepatic bile ducts. The presence of a biliary fistula was suspected by jaundice and/or by the appearance of bile in percutaneous drainage effluent from a liver abscess and was confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Once the route of the fistula between the liver abscess or cyst and the intrahepatic bile duct had been defined by cholangiography, patients underwent treatment by sphincterotomy, and either biliary stenting or nasobiliary drainage. Nasobiliary drains or biliary stents (both 7 Fr) were placed according to standard techniques. Nasobiliary drains were removed when bile leakage stopped and closure of the fistula was confirmed by cholangiography; stents were removed after an interval of 4–6 weeks.

Results

Of a total of 525 patients with hepatic abscesses or cysts who were seen over a 5-year period, there were 26 patients who developed a demonstrable communication between liver abscesses (n = 20; 16 amebic, four pyogenic) or hydatid cysts (n = 6) and intrahepatic bile ducts (right intrahepatic bile ducts in 22 patients, left intrahepatic bile ducts in four patients). We performed either sphincterotomy with insertion of a nasobiliary drain (n = 20) or sphincterotomy with biliary stenting (n = 6). The fistulas healed in all patients after a mean time of 4 days (range 2–20 days) after endoscopic treatment. We were able to remove the nasobiliary drainage catheters and stents 6–34 days after their placement.

Conclusions

In this case series, endoscopic therapy appears to be an effective mode of treatment for biliary fistulas complicating liver abscesses and cysts.

### Treatment of liver abscess: prospective randomized comparison of catheter drainage and needle aspiration [^c7f4622e]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical presentation, and to investigate the effectiveness of continuous catheter drainage in comparison to needle aspiration in the treatment of liver abscesses.

Methods

This is a prospective randomized comparative study of 60 patients, presented in outpatient and emergency department at the hospital, randomized equally into two groups, percutaneous needle aspiration and pigtail catheter drainage. The effectiveness of either treatment was measured in terms of duration of hospital stay, days to achieve clinical improvement, 50% reduction in abscess cavity size and total/near total resolution of abscess cavity. Independent t-test was used to analyze these parameters.

Results

The success rate was significantly better in catheter drainage group (P = 0.006). The patients in pigtail catheter drainage group showed earlier clinical improvement (P = 0.039) and 50% decrease in abscess cavity volume (P = 0.000) as compared to those who underwent percutaneous needle aspiration.

Conclusion

Percutaneous catheter drainage is a better modality as compared to percutaneous needle aspiration especially in larger abscesses which are partially liquefied or with thick pus.

### Pyogenic abscess after hepatic artery embolization: a rare but potentially lethal complication [^768a63a8]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hepatic artery embolization (HAE) is used commonly to treat liver tumors or hemorrhage. Infectious complications are rare but carry high rates of morbidity and mortality. Identification of clinical factors associated with postembolization abscess may improve management and outcome.

Materials and Methods

Clinical and pathologic variables of patients treated with HAE were collected and analyzed to determine the etiology, incidence, and outcome of pyogenic hepatic abscess.

Results

From January 1998 to January 2010, 971 patients underwent 2,045 HAE procedures. Fourteen patients developed a pyogenic hepatic abscess after embolization, for an overall rate of 1.4%. Thirty-four patients (4%) had a history of bilioenteric anastomosis (BEA) and 21 patients (2%) lacked a competent sphincter of Oddi because of the presence of a biliary stent (n = 19) or a previous sphincterotomy (n = 2). Eleven of the 34 patients with a BEA (33%) and two of 21 patients with an incompetent sphincter (10%) developed abscesses, in contrast to only one abscess (0.05%) among the 916 patients with apparently normal sphincters (0.1%; odds ratio, 437.6; 95% CI, 54.2–3,533; P < .0001). Gram-negative and Gram-positive aerobes were the most common bacteria isolated after drainage. Percutaneous drainage was the initial management strategy in all patients; two patients (14%) required subsequent surgical drainage and hepatectomy, and three (21%) died.

Conclusions

Pyogenic hepatic abscess is rare after HAE. A history of BEA or an incompetent sphincter of Oddi caused by a biliary stent or previous sphincterotomy substantially increases the likelihood of this highly morbid and potentially fatal complication.

### Sonographically guided percutaneous catheter drainage versus needle aspiration in the management of pyogenic liver abscess [^211152e6]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) and to compare PCD with percutaneous needle aspiration in the management of liver abscess.

Subjects and Methods

Sixty patients with pyogenic liver abscess were randomly assigned to two groups in a prospective study. Antibiotics were administered for 10 days, starting the day of the beginning of percutaneous treatment. One group was treated with sonographically guided PCD and the other group with repeated percutaneous needle aspiration. Percutaneous needle aspiration was attempted a maximum of three times. Lack of response to the third aspiration was considered failure of treatment; these patients were treated with PCD but were not included in the PCD group for analysis. Patient demographics, duration of hospital stay, treatment outcome, and complications were analyzed.

Results

Percutaneous needle aspiration was successful in 20 (67%) of the 30 patients after one (n = 12), two (n = 7), or three (n = 1) aspirations. PCD was curative in all 30 patients after one (n = 24) or two (n = 6) procedures. All abscesses 50 mm or less in longest diameter were successfully managed, 10 by percutaneous needle aspiration and 12 by PCD. None of patients in the percutaneous needle aspiration group with multiloculated abscesses (n = 5) was successfully treated. Hospital stay did not differ significantly between the groups. There were no complications related to the procedure.

Conclusion

PCD is more effective than percutaneous needle aspiration in the management of liver abscess. Percutaneous needle aspiration can be used as a valid alternative for simple abscesses 50 mm in diameter or smaller.

Liver cyst infection in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease — management is as follows: Start antibiotic treatment, then within < 48 hours after initiation of antibiotics percutaneous drainage of infected liver cysts may be reasonable when there is isolation of pathogens that are unresponsive to antibiotic therapy from a cyst aspirate, immunocompromise, large infected hepatic cysts (> 8 cm), or hemodynamic instability and/or signs of sepsis; in the case of deep cysts for which percutaneous drainage is not feasible, surgical drainage may be necessary. If initial risk factors are absent, perform evaluation of response to antibiotics at 48–72 hours; a clinical response to antibiotics is expected within 48–72 hours and can be monitored with clinical parameters in combination with laboratory evaluations (i.e. CRP and leukocyte count). If Temperature < 38.0°C or 100.4°F /decrease in CRP, continue antibiotics for ≥ 4 weeks. If Persistent temperature ≥ 38.0°C or 100.4°F /stabilization or increase in CRP, assess Percutaneous cyst drainage possible?; if yes, Percutaneous drainage, and if no, Surgical drainage. Infected liver cysts that do not respond to 48–72 hours of antibiotic treatment should be evaluated further, and placement of a percutaneous drain should be considered for failure to improve, worsening symptoms, or presence of the risk factors listed, and the drain should be kept in place until drainage stops.

### AASLD AST practice guideline on adult liver transplantation: diagnosis and management of graft-related complications [^a8702c5d]. Liver Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Biliary strictures after liver transplantation — management and escalation are outlined as follows: The cost for stricture resolution has been demonstrated to be 25% less with self-expandable metal stents than with multiple plastic stents. Drainage via percutaneous trans-hepatic route is typically reserved for patients with complex strictures, bile ducts unable to be traversed by ERCP, or in LT recipients with Roux-en-Y reconstructions that make endoscopic access to the biliary tree challenging. In recipients with non-anastomotic biliary stricture and/or intrahepatic bilomas or biliary casts, a percutaneous biliary drain is often required. Surgical revision is typically the last resort for anastomotic biliary stricture refractory to endoscopic or percutaneous interventions, with a limited role in patients with multiple or proximal non-anastomotic biliary strictures. Persistent or progressive biliary strictures or diffuse ischemic cholangiopathy leading to complications such as cholangitis, hepatic abscesses and graft dysfunction may require re-LT.

### Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of pyogenic liver abscess in people 65 years or older versus people under 65: a retrospective study [^262ec274]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) is defined as a collection of pus surrounded by a fibrous layer of tissue in the liver. Reported incidence in the literature ranges from 2 to 86 cases per 100,000 hospital admittances/year. However, PLA has doubled in incidence in the most recent decades for several reasons: immunosuppressive treatments in cancer patients and/or transplant recipients, the use of invasive techniques to manage hepatobiliary disease, and greater diagnostic efficacy through imaging techniques. Moreover, some studies point to a possible relationship with colon cancer.

Modern diagnostic techniques allow more exact positioning of the PLA, which has facilitated the development of therapeutic techniques such as drainage or aspiration. PLA is associated with high morbidity and mortality; however, these have decreased thanks to early detection and the development of different treatments, ranging from antibiotics to image-guided drainage/aspiration procedures. Despite these advances, studies still estimate a mortality rate of 2 to 31%.

The microorganisms most commonly responsible for PLA are Klebsiella pneumoniae followed by Escherichia coli. In addition, diverse series have described the recent appearance of rarer multi-resistant germs such as K. pneumoniae or E. coli producers of beta-lactamases or multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Advanced age is an increasingly important factor for both the prognosis and the severity of numerous pathologies, but few studies describe the clinical features in the elderly compared to younger patients. Thus, this study was conceived to fill that gap in knowledge; it aims to analyse the clinical, epidemiological, microbiological and prognostic differences of PLAs in older (≥ 65 years of age) versus younger patients (< 65 years).

### Hepatic artery embolization for neuroendocrine tumors: postprocedural management and complications [^926166d6]. The Oncologist (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There is scant evidence to guide the management of patients after hepatic artery embolization (HAE). We examined length of stay (LOS), laboratory patterns, medication usage, morbidity, and mortality of patients hospitalized after HAE for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors.

Methods

Data were abstracted retrospectively from electronic medical records on LOS, liver function tests (LFTs), i.v. antibiotics, analgesia, peak temperature, bacteremia, hepatic abscess formation, carcinoid crisis, and metastatic burden on cross-sectional imaging.

Results

In 2005–2009, 72 patients underwent 174 HAEs for carcinoid and islet cell tumors. The median LOS was 4 days (range, 1–8 days). There was no correlation between peak LFTs and tumor burden. Declines in LFTs were not uniform before hospital discharge; 25%, 37%, 30%, 53%, and 67% of patients were discharged before their respective aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total and direct bilirubin levels began to decline, with no readmissions for acute hepatic failure. The median i.v. analgesia dose was 60 mg oral morphine equivalents (range, 3–1,961 mg). Pre-HAE i.v. antibiotics were administered in 99% of cases; post-HAE fever occurred in 37% of patients, with no documented bacteremia. One patient developed a hepatic abscess after HAE. There were two carcinoid crises. The single in-hospital death was associated with air in the portal veins.

Conclusions

The duration and intensity of in-hospital care following HAE should be managed on an individual basis. A downward trend in LFTs is not required before discharge. Modest use of i.v. analgesia suggests that many patients could exclusively receive oral analgesics. Given the rarity of serious complications, hospital stays could be shortened, thereby reducing costs and nosocomial risks.

### Purulent pericarditis and septic shock secondary to a hepatic-pericardial fistula in a patient with complex oncologic and cardiac history [^942eb2a7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatic-pericardial fistulas are extremely rare complications typically arising from hepatic abscesses, trauma, or invasive procedures. These fistulas can lead to clinical manifestations such as pericarditis, cardiac tamponade, and septic shock. We report a case of purulent pericarditis and septic shock secondary to a hepatic-pericardial fistula in a patient with complex cardiac and oncologic history.

Case presentation

A 76-year-old man with a history of pancreatic, renal cell and prostate cancer presented with acute chest pain and dyspnea. Initial investigations revealed a moderate pericardial effusion and a suspicious hepatic lesion. The patient developed cardiac tamponade and underwent emergency pericardiocentesis, draining 750 mL of purulent fluid. A CT-guided biopsy confirmed a hepatic abscess with fistulization to the pericardium. Despite antibiotic therapy and drainage procedures, the patient's condition deteriorated, resulting in septic shock and death.

Discussion

This case highlights the challenges in managing hepatic-pericardial fistulas, particularly in patients with significant comorbidities. Bacteroides fragilis was identified as the causative pathogen, which underscores the importance of timely identification and management of these rare infections. Early surgical intervention and targeted antibiotic therapy are critical, although prognosis remains poor in patients with compromised cardiovascular and respiratory status.

Conclusion

Hepatic-pericardial fistulas, though rare, should be considered in patients with unexplained pericarditis or septic shock, particularly in the presence of hepatic abscesses. Early recognition, multidisciplinary management, and individualized treatment are essential to improve outcomes.

### Oral vs intravenous antibiotics for patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess: a randomized, controlled noninferiority study [^3a8fa402]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess (KLA) is emerging worldwide due to hypermucoviscous strains with a propensity for metastatic infection. Treatment includes drainage and prolonged intravenous antibiotics. We aimed to determine whether oral antibiotics were noninferior to continued intravenous antibiotics for KLA.

Methods

This noninferiority, parallel group, randomized, clinical trial recruited hospitalized adults with liver abscess and K. pneumoniae isolated from blood or abscess fluid who had received ≤ 7 days of effective antibiotics at 3 sites in Singapore. Patients were randomized 1:1 to oral (ciprofloxacin) or intravenous (ceftriaxone) antibiotics for 28 days. If day 28 clinical response criteria were not met, further oral antibiotics were prescribed until clinical response was met. The primary endpoint was clinical cure assessed at week 12 and included a composite of absence of fever in the preceding week, C-reactive protein < 20 mg/L, and reduction in abscess size. A noninferiority margin of 12% was used.

Results

Between November 2013 and October 2017, 152 patients (mean age, 58.7 years; 25.7% women) were recruited, following a median 5 days of effective intravenous antibiotics. A total of 106 (69.7%) underwent abscess drainage; 71/74 (95.9%) randomized to oral antibiotics met the primary endpoint compared with 72/78 (92.3%) randomized to intravenous antibiotics (risk difference, 3.6%; 2-sided 95% confidence interval, -4.9% to 12.8%). Effects were consistent in the per-protocol population. Nonfatal serious adverse events occurred in 12/72 (16.7%) in the oral group and 13/77 (16.9%) in the intravenous group.

Conclusions

Oral antibiotics were noninferior to intravenous antibiotics for the early treatment of KLA.

### Mixed pyogenic and tuberculous liver abscess: clinical suspicion is what matters [^f90dc922]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a rare cause of liver abscess, even in country like India where it is a very common infection. Moreover, tubercular liver abscess (TLA) is the most unusual pattern of hepatic tuberculosis. We report an unusual case of liver abscess in an immune-competent patient presenting only with weight loss. On investigation, initially it appeared pyogenic, but later turn out to be a mixed infection with tuberculosis. He responded well to antibiotic and antitubercular drugs. A mixed pyogenic and TLA is very uncommon. We conclude that, tuberculosis should be suspected in liver abscess, especially in the absence of typical features and failure to respond to antibiotics.

Patient management algorithm, final outcomes

The patient population, morbidity, mortality, and management algorithm are described in Figure 1. The causes of failure of NOM included complications in 14 patients in the initial NOM group (11.4%, 14/122). The f-NOM group included 6 patients, and the s-NOM group included 8 patients. Of the 6 patients in the f-NOM, 1 presented with BSI with persistent hemorrhage and atrial fibrillation attack, 1 with a history of liver cirrhosis showing re-bleeding after splenic angioembolization, 1 had splenic abscess with profound sepsis after splenic angioembolization, 2 showed reduced hemoglobin levels despite active resuscitation and hepatic angioembolization, and 1 showed unstable hemodynamics with concomitant BHSI and lung contusion. Complications, including re-bleeding (n = 2), liver abscess (n = 2), empyema (n = 1), intra-abdominal abscess (n = 2), and intestinal obstruction (n = 1), were successfully treated conservatively in the remaining 8 patients in the s-NOM group. Six patients in the immediate OP group developed complications, including sepsis (n = 1), the formation of intra-abdominal abscess (n = 3), hepatic abscess (n = 1), and biloma (n = 1), which were also successfully treated conservatively.

Figure 1
NOM was initially applied in 81.3% of all patients with high-grade blunt hepatic and/or splenic injuries with a failure rate of 4.9%. NOM: non-operative management; BAT: blunt abdominal trauma; ICU: intensive care unit; OR: operation room.

In addition, there were 10 deaths, including 4 in the s-NOM group, 2 in the f-NOM group, and 4 in the immediate OP group. Of the 4 patients in the s-NOM group, 3 died of intracranial hemorrhage and 1 died of severe lung contusion. Of the 4 patients in the immediate OP, 1 with grade V BHI died of persistent shock postoperatively, 1 with BHI and pelvis fracture died of massive transfusion-related coagulopathy, 1 with BHI and mesentery tear died of liver cirrhosis, and 1 with BSI died of intracranial hemorrhage. Of the 2 patients in the f-NOM group, 1 with concomitant BHSI died of severe lung contusion (ISS:34) on the second postoperative day, and 1 with grade IV BSI (ISS:38) and post angioembolization re-bleeding died of liver cirrhosis 6 days postoperatively.

Objectives

The optimal treatment duration for pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) is still a matter of debate, with no comparative study to date. The present study aimed to compare short and long treatment duration in hospitalized adult patients with PLA.

Methods

We retrospectively included patients with PLA between 2010 and 2022. Exposure was defined as short (≤ 30 days) or long (> 30 days) antibiotic regimen. We applied the target trial framework with cloning, censoring and weighting. Primary outcome was difference in relapse-free survival 90 days after antibiotic initiation. We defined a non-inferiority margin of 10%.

Results

Of 429 patients with PLA, 259 had a short and 170 a long observed treatment duration. A total of 118 events were observed. The weighted risk difference (RD) in relapse-free survival between long and short treatment arm was -0.4% (95% CI: -5.9 to 4.9%), meeting the non-inferiority margin. In undrained patients, the RD was -5.0% (95% CI: -15 to 5.7%), while among drained patients, the RD was 4.6% (95% CI: -4.4 to 13.5%) in favor of short duration, achieving statistical significance for non-inferiority for drained patients only. For overall survival, the weighted RD was -1.1% (95% CI: -5.9 to 3.4%), and for relapse, -0.2% (95% CI: -7.0 to 6.3%).

Conclusion

In our study, an antibiotic course of ≤ 30 days did meet the non-inferiority threshold of 10% at 90 days compared to longer durations for relapse-free survival. Non-inferiority was also met in the subgroup of drained patients but not in undrained patients.

### WHO guidelines for the treatment of patients with cystic echinococcosis [^375f3665]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for echinococcosis, more specifically with respect to management of hepatic cysts, WHO 2025 guidelines recommend to consider performing percutaneous treatment combined with albendazole in patients with uncomplicated hepatic cyst types CE1 or CE3a > 10 cm. Consider performing PAIR over standard catheterization or surgery. Avoid using PAIR if biliary communication is present.

Pyogenic and amebic liver abscesses

Hepatic abscesses may be secondary to fungal, bacterial, or amebic infections. Pyogenic abscesses represent the vast majority of these abscesses with Escherichia coli and Clostridium species being the common causative agents. Solitary hepatic abscesses are often cryptogenic with no clear-cut source to be identified. CT typically shows a hypoattenuating cystic lesion with surrounding parenchymal edema (Fig. 7). This parenchymal edema is a very useful sign for differentiating pyogenic abscesses from cystic metastases. However, it should also be noted that some solitary liver abscesses may present as mostly solid lesions with no identifiable underlying risk factor. Without perilesional edema and typical septations, liver abscess may be difficult to recognize (Fig. 8). Also, the presence of fever is not a universal feature of liver abscesses, further complicating diagnosis. The absence of centrally progressing contrast enhancement on delayed phase images and progressive enhancement in the outermost layer corresponding to the fibroinflammatory capsule of the abscess may be helpful for differentiating mostly solid appearing pyogenic abscesses from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. It is also difficult to differentiate necrotic liver tumors from abscesses. Nodularity in the internal surface of the lesion wall, focal calcifications within the lesion, and the absence of perilesional edema favors necrotic neoplasm over an abscess. Follow-up imaging after empirical treatment for liver abscess may also be implemented as an alternative approach for differential diagnosis. However, morphological changes may also be observed during the natural course of the disease without any therapeutic intervention. In patients where no diagnosis could be achieved in a noninvasive manner, percutaneous biopsy may be utilized for definitive treatment planning.

Liver abscesses.

Fifteen patients (32.6%) had liver abscesses: in 40% in the right hepatic lobe alone and 60% had a bilateral involvement. Multifocal microabscesses (mean maximum diameter of 4.4 mm) were identified by ERCP in 12/15 patients, which mainly appeared as small round clusters of contrast medium along the bile ducts (Figure 6 b). 7/15 patients had larger liver abscesses also situated along the bile ducts, which had a median maximum diameter of 20 mm (IQR 15.0–31.0). These larger abscesses were also detectable by other imaging techniques (CT, PET-CT, and MRI) (Figure 6). In all 15 patients with liver abscesses, multiple blood cultures had been obtained during the ICU stay, and 14 patients had bile cultures. The most commonly identified pathogens in bile cultures were Enterococcus faecium (12/14) and Candida spp. (12/14), followed by Klebsiella spp. (4/14). The median LT-free survival was 173 days in patients with peribiliary abscesses compared with 380 days in those without abscesses, but the difference was not significant. Patients with liver abscesses had worse survival rates than those of patients without abscess (31% vs 52% at 12 months; n.s.) (Supplementary Digital Content, see Figure S3).

Ductographic signs of post–COVID-19 cholangiopathy.

Ductography revealed the following changes: multiple ribbon-like intraductal filling defects (biliary casts), weak and sometimes indistinct (shadowy) contrast enhancement of the bile ducts, spotty and irregular contrast distribution within the ducts, long-distance irregularities of duct contour, lacunar contrast penetration/cavitation toward the parenchyma, biloma formation, and irregular narrowing of the bile ducts (Figure 3).

A follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan 1 month later showed resolution of the abscess and decreased biliary dilatation (Fig. 4). The cystoduodenostomy stents were removed, while the biliary stent was left in place. After review by the multidisciplinary team, the patient underwent robot-assisted right hepatectomy, which revealed an intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct with high grade dysplasia. The patient showed significant symptom improvement post-surgery.

In conclusion, chronic biliary strictures can lead to cholangitis and hepatic abscesses. EUS-guided drainage is a safe and effective approach, which may be useful alone or with ERCP, for managing liver abscesses and as a bridge to surgery in complex biliary conditions.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^fdbaa7d4]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) — management of infected liver cysts: Empirical antibiotic treatment of liver cyst infections should target gram-negative bacteria in the Enterobacteriaceae family and should be initiated with a third-generation intravenous (i.v.) cephalosporin with or without a fluoroquinolone; after clinical stabilization, i.v. therapy can be switched to an oral fluoroquinolone, with adjustment according to culture results when available. Duration of antibiotic therapy should be ≥ 4 weeks for liver cyst infection. Percutaneous drainage of infected liver cysts < 48 hours after initiation of antibiotics may be reasonable when there is isolation of pathogens that are unresponsive to antibiotic therapy from a cyst aspirate, immunocompromise in the patient, large infected hepatic cysts (> 8 cm), or hemodynamic instability and/or signs of sepsis. Infected liver cysts that do not respond to 48–72 hours of antibiotic treatment should be evaluated further, placement of a percutaneous drain should be considered for failure to improve, worsening symptoms, or presence of the risk factors listed, the drain should be kept in place until drainage stops, and in the case of deep cysts for which percutaneous drainage is not feasible, surgical drainage may be necessary.

### Development of amoebic liver abscess in early pregnancy years after initial amoebic exposure: a case report [^36ef6565]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Infection with Entamoeba histolytica and associated complications are relatively rare in developed countries. The overall low prevalence in the Western world as well as the possibly prolonged latency period between infection with the causing pathogen and onset of clinical symptoms may delay diagnosis of and adequate treatment for amoebiasis. Amoebic liver abscess (ALA) is the most common extraintestinal manifestation of invasive amoebiasis. Pregnancy has been described as a risk factor for development of invasive amoebiasis and management of these patients is especially complex.

Case Presentation

A 30-year-old Caucasian woman in early pregnancy presented to our emergency department with abdominal pain alongside elevated inflammatory markers and liver function tests. Travel history revealed multiple journeys to tropic and subtropic regions during the past decade and a prolonged episode of intermittently bloody diarrhea during a five month stay in Indonesia seven years prior to admission. Sonographic and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 5×4 cm hepatic abscess. After ultrasound-guided transcutaneous liver drainage, both abscess fluids and blood cultures showed neither bacterial growth nor microscopic signs of parasitic disease. Serological testing confirmed an infection with Entamoeba histolytica, which was treated with metronidazole, followed by eradication therapy with paromomycin. Subsequent clinical, laboratory and imaging follow-up exams showed regression of the ALA. In addition, the pregnancy completed without complications and a healthy baby boy was born 7 months after termination of treatment.

Conclusions

This case of invasive amoebiasis in early pregnancy outside of endemic regions and several years after exposure demonstrates the importance of broad differential diagnostics in the context of liver abscesses. The complex interdisciplinary decisions regarding the choice of imaging techniques as well as interventional and antibiotic therapy in the context of pregnancy are discussed. Furthermore, we present possible explanations for pregnancy as a risk factor for an invasive course of amoebiasis.
