## Question

What are the specific benzodiazepines that carry the highest risk of congenital malformations?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which specific benzodiazepines carry the highest risk of congenital malformations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any benzodiazepine shows a consistent, clinically meaningful teratogenic signal across high-quality evidence. Then, I should verify whether any individual agents stand out in meta-analyses, registries, or large cohorts. Next, I will examine confounding by indication and polytherapy effects that could inflate risk for certain drugs. Finally, I will reconcile older case reports with contemporary data and translate this into practical, agent-specific guidance, including what to avoid and what to prefer if a benzodiazepine is necessary in pregnancy.

> Let me first confirm the overarching signal from high-level evidence. Multiple meta-analyses and large cohort studies indicate that benzodiazepines as a class are not associated with a significant increase in major congenital malformations, including with first-trimester exposure, although some analyses show very small, possibly non-causal associations that could reflect confounding by indication [^d375b794] [^6336887f] [^d72f3719].

> Wait, let me verify whether any individual benzodiazepine emerges as particularly teratogenic. I initially thought diazepam might be the highest-risk agent based on older case reports and animal data, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; more recent, better-controlled human data have not confirmed a consistent teratogenic pattern for diazepam, and FDA labeling for diazepam reflects uncertainty rather than a established human teratogenic risk, so I should correct that assumption and avoid over-attributing risk to diazepam specifically [^c8be33e8] [^271ed22e] [^5608d0e7].

> I need to check for any signals tied to specific agents. Observational case-control data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study raised isolated concerns for alprazolam with anophthalmia/microphthalmia and esophageal atresia, and for lorazepam with pulmonary valve stenosis, but these were based on very few exposed cases and wide confidence intervals, so they should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive; importantly, these signals have not been consistently replicated in larger, better-adjusted cohorts [^ccbb1b35].

> Let me consider antiseizure benzodiazepines, where the literature is more granular. Clonazepam has been studied in epilepsy registries and cohorts; pooled estimates show low absolute malformation rates around 2–3% and no consistent excess risk versus controls, though confidence intervals are wide due to small numbers, so I should be cautious but not overstate risk for clonazepam monotherapy [^a5928f37] [^f7a1f0cc]. Clobazam has been flagged in a network meta-analysis as having a signal for increased major congenital malformations, but wait, I should double-check the certainty; the analyses were underpowered, confidence intervals were very wide, and the signal has not been confirmed in high-quality prospective cohorts, so this remains a weak, uncertain signal rather than established teratogenicity [^a0123eb1].

> Next, I should review confounding and polytherapy effects. Several studies show that combined first-trimester exposure to benzodiazepines and antidepressants is associated with a modest increase in overall malformations, but this association attenuates or disappears in analyses that better control for confounding by indication and familial factors, suggesting that the combination effect, if real, is small and likely influenced by the underlying maternal condition and polypharmacy rather than a direct teratogenic effect of benzodiazepines alone [^d375b794] [^2dd6d240] [^5fadfc68].

> I will now examine dose, timing, and agent selection considerations. Late-pregnancy exposure carries well-described neonatal risks such as sedation, hypotonia, respiratory depression, and neonatal withdrawal, which is why guidelines recommend minimizing or tapering benzodiazepines before delivery when feasible; this is a perinatal/neonatal risk rather than a congenital malformation risk, but it materially affects agent choice and timing in pregnancy [^65d7a51f] [^c58ca24e]. If a benzodiazepine is necessary, lorazepam is often preferred due to lack of active metabolites and lower fetal accumulation, whereas agents with long half-lives or multiple active metabolites may increase neonatal effects; alprazolam is commonly discouraged in pregnancy because of high addictive potential and challenging withdrawal, not because of proven teratogenicity [^c58ca24e] [^65d7a51f].

> But wait, what if the question is about absolute risk and practical counseling. Contemporary registry and cohort data suggest that first-trimester benzodiazepine monotherapy is not associated with a clinically important increase in major malformations, with absolute risks remaining close to background population risk of about 2–4%, though very small relative increases cannot be entirely excluded due to residual confounding; this supports individualized risk–benefit discussions rather than blanket avoidance when clinically indicated [^d72f3719] [^d375b794] [^6336887f].

> Putting this together, I should conclude that no specific benzodiazepine has established, high-credibility evidence of a uniquely high teratogenic risk compared with others in the class. Weak, inconsistent signals exist for some agents in small or observational datasets, but these have not been confirmed in larger, well-controlled studies, and class-wide malformation risk appears low to negligible with monotherapy exposure. Therefore, there is no single benzodiazepine that can be reliably labeled as having the highest malformation risk, and decisions should prioritize minimizing exposure, using the lowest effective dose, avoiding polypharmacy when possible, and preferring shorter-acting agents without active metabolites if treatment is necessary during pregnancy [^d375b794] [^6336887f] [^c58ca24e] [^65d7a51f].

---

Based on current evidence, **no specific benzodiazepine is clearly associated with a higher risk of congenital malformations** than others [^d375b794]. Early reports linked diazepam and chlordiazepoxide to oral clefts, but more recent, better-controlled studies have not confirmed a consistent teratogenic signal for these or other benzodiazepines [^c8be33e8] [^d72f3719]. If benzodiazepines are needed, use the lowest effective dose, avoid first-trimester exposure when possible, and prefer agents with shorter half-lives and no active metabolites (e.g. lorazepam) [^c58ca24e] [^65d7a51f]. The main concern is neonatal sedation and withdrawal with late-pregnancy exposure, not structural malformations [^65d7a51f].

---

## Historical evidence and early studies

Early studies suggested possible teratogenic risks with benzodiazepines, particularly diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, including oral clefts and other congenital anomalies [^c8be33e8]. However, these studies often had methodological limitations, such as small sample sizes, lack of control for confounding factors, and reliance on self-reported exposure data [^2f72c8c4].

---

## Recent evidence and meta-analyses

Recent meta-analyses and large cohort studies have provided more robust evidence regarding benzodiazepine use in pregnancy:

- **Meta-analysis (2019)**: Found no significant association between benzodiazepine exposure during pregnancy and congenital malformations overall (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99–1.30) or with first-trimester exposure specifically (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.93–1.25) [^d375b794].

- **Cardiac malformations**: No significant association was found between benzodiazepine exposure and cardiac malformations (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.98–1.65) [^d375b794].

- **Combined exposure**: Concurrent use of benzodiazepines and antidepressants during pregnancy was associated with a modestly increased risk of congenital malformations (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.09–1.80), suggesting confounding by indication or drug–drug interactions [^d375b794].

---

## Specific benzodiazepines and their risks

While no specific benzodiazepine has been conclusively identified as having a higher risk of congenital malformations, some agents have been studied more extensively:

| **Benzodiazepine** | **Evidence regarding congenital malformations** |
|-|-|
| Diazepam | Early studies suggested possible increased risk of oral clefts, but recent evidence does not confirm a consistent association [^c8be33e8] [^d375b794] |
| Chlordiazepoxide | Similar to diazepam, early concerns have not been corroborated by recent high-quality studies [^d375b794] |
| Lorazepam | No clear association with congenital malformations identified in recent studies [^d72f3719] [^13cd05d0] |
| Alprazolam | No clear association with congenital malformations identified in recent studies [^806fcee0] |
| Clonazepam | Limited data, but no consistent signal for increased malformation risk [^a5928f37] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize caution when prescribing benzodiazepines during pregnancy, primarily due to risks of neonatal sedation, respiratory depression, and withdrawal symptoms rather than congenital malformations [^65d7a51f]. If benzodiazepines are deemed necessary, clinicians are advised to:

- **Use the lowest effective dose**: Minimize exposure and duration of therapy [^65d7a51f].

- **Avoid first-trimester exposure**: When possible, to minimize potential risks [^notfound].

- **Prefer agents with shorter half-lives and no active metabolites**: Such as lorazepam, to reduce fetal accumulation and neonatal effects [^c58ca24e].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

In summary, **no specific benzodiazepine has been conclusively associated with a higher risk of congenital malformations** than others [^d375b794]. The primary concern with benzodiazepine use in pregnancy is neonatal sedation, respiratory depression, and withdrawal symptoms, particularly with late-pregnancy exposure [^65d7a51f]. Clinicians should use benzodiazepines cautiously, employing the lowest effective dose, avoiding first-trimester exposure when possible, and preferring agents with shorter half-lives and no active metabolites.

### Benzodiazepine use during pregnancy alone or in combination with an antidepressant and congenital malformations: systematic review and meta-analysis [^d375b794]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To summarize the effects of antenatal benzodiazepine exposure as monotherapy and in combination with antidepressants on the risk of congenital malformations.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to June 30, 2018, using controlled vocabulary and keywords (eg, prenatal, benzodiazepines, malformation).

Study Selection

English-language cohort studies with prospectively collected data on the risk of malformations in benzodiazepine-exposed and -unexposed offspring were evaluated. 23,909 records were screened, 56 studies were assessed for eligibility, and 8 studies were included.

Data Extraction

Quality was assessed by 2 independent reviewers and data extracted. Random-effects models were used for outcomes (≥ 3 studies). Subanalyses examined effect of potential moderators including study quality and timing of exposure, among others.

Results

Prenatal benzodiazepine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations (odds ratio [OR] = 1.13; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.30, 8 studies, n = 222/5,195 exposed and 64,335/2,082,467 unexposed), including with first trimester exposure specifically (OR = 1.08; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.25, P = 0.33; 5 studies, n = 181/4,331 exposed and 64,308/2,081,463 unexposed). There was no significant association with cardiac malformation following exposure (OR = 1.27; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.65, P = 0.07; 4 studies, n = 61/4,414 exposed and 19,260/2,033,402 unexposed). However, concurrent use of benzodiazepine and antidepressants during pregnancy was associated with a significantly increased risk of congenital malformations (OR = 1.40; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.80, P = 0.008; 3 studies).

Conclusions

Benzodiazepine exposure during pregnancy does not appear to be associated with congenital malformations or with cardiac malformations specifically. There may be an increased risk of congenital malformations when benzodiazepines are used in conjunction with antidepressants, suggesting that caution with this combination is warranted.

### Gestational exposure to benzodiazepines and Z-hypnotics and the risk of major congenital malformations, ectopic pregnancy, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes [^6336887f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

A small proportion of women with anxiety, insomnia, and other conditions may require benzodiazepines or z-hypnotics intermittently or daily sometime during pregnancy. This article provides an update on pregnancy outcomes associated with pre-gestational or gestational exposure to benzodiazepines and z-hypnotics based on results from 2 meta-analyses, 2 registry-based studies, and 2 large retrospective cohort studies. In summary, the meta-analyses found that exposure was associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, induced abortion, preterm birth, low birth weight, small for gestational age, low Apgar scores at 5 min, and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Whereas meta-analyses and registry studies found that first trimester exposure to benzodiazepines and/or z-hypnotics was not associated with increased risk of congenital malformations, a nationwide observational study with 10 times as many exposed pregnancies as in all the previous studies combined found that first trimester exposure to benzodiazepines was associated with a small but statistically significantly increased risk of overall malformations as well as, specifically, cardiac malformations; in this study, analyses that examined the potential role of confounding by indication suggested that the adverse findings may not have been due to confounding. Finally, a large observational study found that exposure to benzodiazepines in the 90 days before conception was associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy; in this study, as well, the findings were consistent in analyses that examined possible confounding by indication. In no reviewed study could residual confounding be ruled out. The take-home message is that benzodiazepine and z-drug exposure before and during pregnancy is associated with many adverse gestational outcomes, but it is unclear to what extent the findings are due to exposure to drugs vs exposure to the indication for treatment. Therefore, all treatment decisions need to be tailored to context and shared between health care professionals, patients, and their caregivers.

### Concomitant use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines during pregnancy and associated risk of congenital malformations: a population-based cohort study in Taiwan [^2dd6d240]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Background

Despite the frequent co-administration of antidepressants and benzodiazepines, the association between such concomitant use during pregnancy and the risk of congenital malformations remains inadequately explored. This study aims to examine the association between concomitant use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines during the first trimester and organ-specific congenital malformations.

Methods

We conducted a population-based cohort study using Taiwan's National Birth Certificate Application database, the Maternal and Child Health database, and Taiwan's National Health Insurance database. Pregnant people aged 15–50 years with singleton births between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2018, were included. Use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines was defined as at least one prescription during the first trimester, and concomitant use was defined as the overlapping prescription of both drugs with an overlapping prescription period. The primary outcomes were overall congenital malformations and eight organ-specific malformations, consisting of the nervous system, heart, respiratory system, oral cleft, digestive system, urinary system, genital system, and limb malformations. Logistic regression models with propensity score fine stratification weighting approach were used to control for measured confounders. Analyses controlling for confounding by indication and sibling comparison analyses were done to address unmeasured confounders. No individuals with lived experience participated in the research or writing process.

Findings

The cohort included 2634021 singleton pregnancies, and 8599 (0·3%) individuals were concomitant users of antidepressants and benzodiazepines during the first trimester (mean age at delivery was 31·8 years [SD 5·2] for pregnancies with exposure to antidepressants and benzodiazepines vs 30·7 years [SD 4·9] for pregnancies without exposure). All study participants were female, and information about ethnicity was not available. Absolute risk of overall malformations was 3·81 per 100 pregnancies with exposure, compared with 2·87 per 100 pregnancies without exposure. The propensity score-weighted odds ratios (weighted ORs) did not suggest an increased risk for overall malformations (weighted OR 1·10, 95% CI 0·94–1·28), heart defects (1·01, 0·83–1·23), or any of the other organ-specific malformations, except for digestive system malformations, for which the weighted OR remained statistically significant after adjustment (1·63, 1·06–2·51). The absence of an increased risk for overall congenital malformations associated with concomitant use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines was supported by the analyses controlling for confounding by indication and sibling-matched comparisons.

Interpretation

The findings of this study suggest that the concomitant use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines during the first trimester is not associated with a substantial increase in risk for most malformation subtypes. However, considering other potential adverse effects of using both medications concomitantly, a thorough assessment of the risks and benefits is crucial for clinical decision making.

### Benzodiazepine exposure in pregnancy and risk of major malformations: a critical overview [^2f72c8c4]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Benzodiazepines (BDZs) safety profiles in pregnancy suggest that the risk of major malformations (MMs) cannot be considered simply as a "class effect". The aim of this paper was to review and update the available literature on the risks of MMs in women exposed to BDZs in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Methods

PubMed was searched for English-language articles, from January 2001 to November 2011, introducing as keywords "teratogens", " major malformation", "foetus", "infant", "newborn", "pregnancy", in conjunction with "benzodiazepines" as a keyword or BDZ generic name as text words.

Results

Twelve studies were selected for the review. BDZ exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy seems not to be associated with an increasing risk of congenital MMs. Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide should be considered drugs of first choice.

Conclusions

Data published in the last 10 years did not indicate an absolute contraindication in prescribing BDZs during the first gestational trimester. In any case, studies analyzed suffer from a number of methodological limitations such as lack of careful report of BDZ patterns of use in pregnancy, possible influences of recall bias, lack of controlling for confounding factors and lack of data concerning possible MMs in aborted fetuses.

### Gestational exposure to benzodiazepines, 2: the risk of congenital malformations examined through the prism of compatibility intervals [^c6b44db9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

A recent meta-analysis of the major malformation risk after gestational exposure to benzodiazepines identified 8 prospective cohort studies with 5,195 exposed and 2,082,467 unexposed women. Benzodiazepine exposure was not associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk of total malformations (8 studies) or cardiac malformations (4 studies). The malformation risk was not significantly increased after specifically first trimester exposure, either (5 studies). However, there was a significant increase in risk associated with combined first trimester exposure to benzodiazepines and antidepressants (3 studies). The authors of the meta-analysis interpreted their findings based on the conventional P < .05 cutoff for statistical significance. However, when the confidence intervals (CIs) associated with the pooled odds ratios (ORs) were examined, it was evident that almost the entire range of values in the CIs for total malformations and for cardiac malformations was compatible with a population value for the OR that indicated increased risk (OR > 1.00). Importantly, the CI for the first trimester exposure analysis was somewhat better distributed around the null (OR = 1.00), suggesting a lower likelihood of increased risk. All ORs were very low to low in value, indicating a very small increase in the absolute risk. Besides explaining how CIs may be interpreted as compatibility intervals, this article reminds readers that associations identified even in meta-analyses of cohort studies do not indicate a causal effect because confounding by indication can never be ruled out in observational research designs. A reasonable conclusion, therefore, is that gestational exposure to benzodiazepines is a marker of risk for cardiac and total malformations, and, importantly, that first trimester exposure to benzodiazepines may not be associated with much increase in risk, if at all.

### A review of sleep-promoting medications used in pregnancy [^0ccd07e8]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Approximately 4% of adults who have symptoms of insomnia resort to various hypnotic or sedating medications for acute symptom relief. Although typically a common practice for nonpregnant adults, this is not the case for the thousands of pregnant women who also report substantial sleep issues. Unfortunately, a paucity of randomized controlled trials in this population, scant empiric evidence regarding the appropriateness of prescribing options, and the concern of subsequent teratogenicity restricts the ability of clinicians to make informed decisions. We synthesized the current research regarding hypnotics and sedating medications used (both on- and off-label) during pregnancy and their association with adverse outcomes. Medications that we investigated included benzodiazepines, hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists, antidepressants, and antihistamines. Overall, the examined studies showed no correlation of increased risk of congenital malformations. However, benzodiazepines and hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists may increase rates of preterm birth, low birthweight, and/or small-for-gestational-age infants. The small number of studies and the small number of subjects prohibit any definitive interpretation regarding the consequences of the use of hypnotic or sedating medications in pregnancy. Additional case reports, randomized clinical trials, and epidemiologic studies are needed urgently.

### Monotherapy treatment of epilepsy in pregnancy: congenital malformation outcomes in the child [^f7a1f0cc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Dose is a key feature of teratogenic malformation risk (Brent 2004). Data from EURAP 2018 is the most reliable to investigate dose associations due to its large number of CBZ‐exposed pregnancies and its low risk of bias on the domain of outcome measurement. It demonstrates a dose‐related risk for CBZ with doses over 700 mg/d carrying a higher risk, although even their lower dose group had a high level of risk in comparison to children exposed to LTG (EURAP 2018).

Clonazepam (CZP)

Data relating to the use of monotherapy clonazepam during pregnancy and child major malformation risk is substantially limited with fewer than 150 pregnancies reported across both cohort and routine health record studies. The generated prevalence reported here was 2.1% (95% CI 0.2 to 17.3%) to 2.5% (95% CI 0.0 to 131.8) but the confidence intervals were very wide, due to the limited data. When compared to other ASMs, however, a lower risk was identified in comparison to VPA exposure, with a risk difference of 9%. Due to the current limited data available, no firm conclusion can be made currently whether CZP is associated with an increased risk in comparison to control children.

### Lorazepam (Loreev xr) [^b16233b7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to LOREEV XR during pregnancy. Health care providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications at 1-866-961-2388 or by visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/pregnancyregistry.

Risk Summary

Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data). In animal studies, administration of lorazepam during the organogenesis period of pregnancy resulted in increased incidences of fetal malformations at doses greater than those used clinically. Data for benzodiazepines suggest the possibility of increased neuronal cell death and long-term effects on neurobehavioral function based on findings in animals following prenatal or early postnatal exposure at clinically relevant doses (see Data).

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

### Gestational exposure to benzodiazepines, 3: clobazam and major congenital malformations [^a0123eb1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Clobazam is a 1,5-benzodiazepine that has been approved for use, in various parts of the world, as an add-on treatment for seizure disorders and as a treatment for anxiety. Pharmacoepidemiological data from different countries show that a small percentage of women with epilepsy (WWE) receive clobazam during pregnancy. Surprisingly, there has been little to no discussion in literature on the teratogenicity of clobazam. A network meta-analysis published in 2017 found a markedly elevated rate of overall and specific major congenital malformations (MCMs) with clobazam; whereas statistical significance was not established in any analysis, the 95% compatibility intervals did suggest increased risk. In the same meta-analysis, however, the risk with clobazam was not elevated in polytherapy. Indications of increased MCM risk also emerged in data from India and Sri Lanka. In all studies, the exposure numbers were small and information on trimester of exposure was unavailable. Given the nature of the data, adjustment for confounding would not have been possible. It is concluded that there appears to be a signal for an increased risk of MCMs in the infants of WWE who use clobazam during pregnancy. This signal merits examination in data that exist in national registers and pregnancy registries.

### Diazepam (Valium) [^c8be33e8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy

An increased risk of congenital malformations and other developmental abnormalities associated with the use of benzodiazepine drugs during pregnancy has been suggested. There may also be non-teratogenic risks associated with the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy. There have been reports of neonatal flaccidity, respiratory and feeding difficulties, and hypothermia in children born to mothers who have been receiving benzodiazepines late in pregnancy. In addition, children born to mothers receiving benzodiazepines on a regular basis late in pregnancy may be at some risk of experiencing withdrawal symptoms during the postnatal period.

Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater (approximately eight times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD = 1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m2basis). Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. Rodent studies have indicated that prenatal exposure to diazepam doses similar to those used clinically can produce long-term changes in cellular immune responses, brain neurochemistry, and behavior.

In general, the use of diazepam in women of childbearing potential, and more specifically during known pregnancy, should be considered only when the clinical situation warrants the risk to the fetus. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Patients should also be advised that if they become pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant they should communicate with their physician about the desirability of discontinuing the drug.

Labor and Delivery

Special care must be taken when Valium is used during labor and delivery, as high single doses may produce irregularities in the fetal heart rate and hypotonia, poor sucking, hypothermia, and moderate respiratory depression in the neonates. With newborn infants it must be remembered that the enzyme system involved in the breakdown of the drug is not yet fully developed (especially in premature infants).

Nursing Mothers

Diazepam passes into breast milk. Breastfeeding is therefore not recommended in patients receiving Valium.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^c58ca24e]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy and breastfeeding — benzodiazepine (BZD) use, tapering, and agent selection are addressed with specific guidance: The CPG recommends clinicians discuss the risks and benefits of BZD use and discontinuation for the maternal–fetal dyad with pregnant patients, considering each patient's unique needs and engaging in shared decision-making to determine whether to taper, and care should ideally be coordinated between the clinician managing the BZD taper and the prenatal care provider. BZD use in pregnancy has been found to be associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, and low birth weight, while antenatal exposure to BZDs is not associated with major congenital malformations; approximately 20 to 40% of neonates exposed in late pregnancy develop neonatal withdrawal. Lorazepam is generally preferred in pregnancy and lactation due to its lack of active metabolites and low relative infant dose (RID), but if a patient is stable on another BZD, it is not typically necessary to require them to switch; clinicians should consider transitioning to lorazepam for pregnant patients currently taking alprazolam. In general, breastfeeding is not contraindicated in the presence of BZD use, and the CPG recommends that clinicians encourage breastfeeding to help reduce potential symptoms of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS); clinicians may consider consulting with specialists in reproductive psychiatry or providing referrals if available.

### Diazepam oral solution (concentrate) (diazepam) [^271ed22e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to psychiatric medications, including diazepam during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/pregnancyregistry/.

Risk Summary

Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data).

Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater (approximately eight times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD = 1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m2basis). Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis.

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

### Risk of major malformations in infants after first-trimester exposure to benzodiazepines: results from the Massachusetts general hospital national pregnancy registry for psychiatric medications [^d72f3719]. Depression and Anxiety (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Perinatal anxiety affects 20% of women, and untreated maternal mental illness can cause deleterious effects for women and their children. Benzodiazepines are commonly used to treat anxiety disorders. The reported risk of congenital malformations after in utero benzodiazepine exposure has been inconsistent.

Methods

The Massachusetts General Hospital National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications prospectively enrolls pregnant women with psychiatric illness who take one or more psychiatric medications. Participants are interviewed twice during pregnancy and at 12 weeks postpartum. Women taking any benzodiazepine during the first trimester of pregnancy were compared with a group of women taking psychiatric medication(s) other than benzodiazepines during pregnancy.

Results

A total of 1053 women were eligible for this analysis; N = 151 women who had taken a benzodiazepine during the first trimester, and the comparison group was N = 902 women. There were 5 (3.21%) major malformations in the exposure group and 32 (3.46%) in the comparison group (odds ratio 0.92; 95% confidence interval 0.35–2.41).

Conclusion

This ongoing pregnancy registry offers reassurance that benzodiazepines do not appear to have major teratogenic effects. The precision of relative risk estimate will improve as the number of participants increases. This and other pregnancy registries will better inform the reproductive safety of benzodiazepines.

### Prevalence of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-related drugs exposure before, during and after pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^276d8c65]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Maternal use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy is common and has increased over the last decades. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we studied the literature to estimate the worldwide use of benzodiazepines before, during and after pregnancy, which could help to estimate benzodiazepine exposure and to prioritize and guide future investigations.

Methods

We systematically searched Embase, Medline Ovid, Web of Science and Cochrane Central up until July 2019 for studies reporting on benzodiazepine use before (12 months), during and after pregnancy (12 months). Random effects meta-analysis was conducted to calculate pooled prevalence estimates, as well as stratified according to substantive variables.

Results

We identified 32 studies reporting on 28 countries, together reporting on 7,343,571 pregnancies. The worldwide prevalence of benzodiazepine use/prescriptions during pregnancy was 1.9% (95%CI 1.6%-2.2%; I 2 97.48%). Highest prevalence was found in the third trimester (3.1%; 95%CI 1.8%-4.5%; I 2 99.83%). Lorazepam was the most frequently used/prescribed benzodiazepine (1.5%; 95%CI 0.5%-2.5%; I 2 99.87%). Highest prevalence was found in Eastern Europe (14.0%; 95%CI 12.1%-15.9%; I 2 0.00%).

Limitations

All analyses revealed considerable heterogeneity.

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis confirmed that benzodiazepine use before, during and after pregnancy is prevalent. The relatively common use of benzodiazepines with possible risks for both mother and (unborn) child is worrying and calls for prescription guidelines for women, starting in the preconception period. Given the substantial proportion of children exposed to benzodiazepines in utero, future research should continue to study the short- and long-term safety of maternal benzodiazepine use during pregnancy and to explore non-pharmacological alternative treatments.

### Clobazam [^26793eed]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

 Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression, hypotonia, and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to clobazam during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor neonates exposed to clobazam during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Data

 Human Data

Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these findings.

### Monotherapy treatment of epilepsy in pregnancy: congenital malformation outcomes in the child [^bd3c7f36]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is evidence that certain antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are teratogenic and are associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. The majority of women with epilepsy continue taking AEDs throughout pregnancy; therefore it is important that comprehensive information on the potential risks associated with AED treatment is available.

Objectives

To assess the effects of prenatal exposure to AEDs on the prevalence of congenital malformations in the child.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (September 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 11), MEDLINE (via Ovid) (1946 to September 2015), EMBASE (1974 to September 2015), Pharmline (1978 to September 2015), Reprotox (1983 to September 2015) and conference abstracts (2010–2015) without language restriction.

Selection Criteria

We included prospective cohort controlled studies, cohort studies set within pregnancy registries and randomised controlled trials. Participants were women with epilepsy taking AEDs; the two control groups were women without epilepsy and women with epilepsy who were not taking AEDs during pregnancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently selected studies for inclusion. Five authors completed data extraction and risk of bias assessments. The primary outcome was the presence of a major congenital malformation. Secondary outcomes included specific types of major congenital malformations. Where meta-analysis was not possible, we reviewed included studies narratively.

Main Results

We included 50 studies, with 31 contributing to meta-analysis. Study quality varied, and given the observational design, all were at high risk of certain biases. However, biases were balanced across the AEDs investigated and we believe that the results are not explained by these biases. Children exposed to carbamazepine (CBZ) were at a higher risk of malformation than children born to women without epilepsy (N = 1367 vs 2146, risk ratio (RR) 2.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20 to 3.36) and women with untreated epilepsy (N = 3058 vs 1287, RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.19). Children exposed to phenobarbital (PB) were at a higher risk of malformation than children born to women without epilepsy (N = 345 vs 1591, RR 2.84, 95% CI 1.57 to 5.13). Children exposed to phenytoin (PHT) were at an increased risk of malformation compared with children born to women without epilepsy (N = 477 vs 987, RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.12 to 5.03) and to women with untreated epilepsy (N = 640 vs 1256, RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.42 to 4.08). Children exposed to topiramate (TPM) were at an increased risk of malformation compared with children born to women without epilepsy (N = 359 vs 442, RR 3.69, 95% CI 1.36 to 10.07). The children exposed to valproate (VPA) were at a higher risk of malformation compared with children born to women without epilepsy (N = 467 vs 1936, RR 5.69, 95% CI 3.33 to 9.73) and to women with untreated epilepsy (N = 1923 vs 1259, RR 3.13, 95% CI 2.16 to 4.54). There was no increased risk for major malformation for lamotrigine (LTG). Gabapentin (GBP), levetiracetam (LEV), oxcarbazepine (OXC), primidone (PRM) or zonisamide (ZNS) were not associated with an increased risk, however, there were substantially fewer data for these medications. For AED comparisons, children exposed to VPA had the greatest risk of malformation (10.93%, 95% CI 8.91 to 13.13). Children exposed to VPA were at an increased risk of malformation compared with children exposed to CBZ (N = 2529 vs 4549, RR 2.44, 95% CI 2.00 to 2.94), GBP (N = 1814 vs 190, RR 6.21, 95% CI 1.91 to 20.23), LEV (N = 1814 vs 817, RR 5.82, 95% CI 3.13 to 10.81), LTG (N = 2021 vs 4164, RR 3.56, 95% CI 2.77 to 4.58), TPM (N = 1814 vs 473, RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.40 to 3.95), OXC (N = 676 vs 238, RR 3.71, 95% CI 1.65 to 8.33), PB (N = 1137 vs 626, RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.29, PHT (N = 2319 vs 1137, RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.71) or ZNS (N = 323 vs 90, RR 17.13, 95% CI 1.06 to 277.48). Children exposed to CBZ were at a higher risk of malformation than those exposed to LEV (N = 3051 vs 817, RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.29) and children exposed to LTG (N = 3385 vs 4164, RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.76). Children exposed to PB were at a higher risk of malformation compared with children exposed to GBP (N = 204 vs 159, RR 8.33, 95% CI 1.04 to 50.00), LEV (N = 204 vs 513, RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.04 to 5.00) or LTG (N = 282 vs 1959, RR 3.13, 95% CI 1.64 to 5.88). Children exposed to PHT had a higher risk of malformation than children exposed to LTG (N = 624 vs 4082, RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.94) or to LEV (N = 566 vs 817, RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.85); however, the comparison to LEV was not significant in the random-effects model. Children exposed to TPM were at a higher risk of malformation than children exposed to LEV (N = 473 vs 817, RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.85) or LTG (N = 473 vs 3975, RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.94). There were no other significant differences, or comparisons were limited to a single study. We found significantly higher rates of specific malformations associating PB exposure with cardiac malformations and VPA exposure with neural tube, cardiac, oro-facial/craniofacial, and skeletal and limb malformations in comparison to other AEDs. Dose of exposure mediated the risk of malformation following VPA exposure; a potential dose-response association for the other AEDs remained less clear.

Authors' Conclusions

Exposure in the womb to certain AEDs carried an increased risk of malformation in the foetus and may be associated with specific patterns of malformation. Based on current evidence, LEV and LTG exposure carried the lowest risk of overall malformation; however, data pertaining to specific malformations are lacking. Physicians should discuss both the risks and treatment efficacy with the patient prior to commencing treatment.

### Comparative safety of anti-epileptic drugs during pregnancy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of congenital malformations and prenatal outcomes [^9b7a9f3c]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The results in subgroup NMA when restricting to observational studies only (2 case-control and 75 cohort studies, 34,966 cases, 48 treatments; τ 2 = 0.03; 95% CrI, 0.00–0.13) were in agreement with NMA. The sensitivity analysis restricting to cohort studies (75 studies, 34,667 cases, 48 treatments; τ 2 = 0.02; 95% CrI, 0.00–0.11) found comparable results with NMA, but clonazepam plus valproate was marginally not statistically significant (OR, 12.780; 95% CrI, 0.974–68.810). Similar results were also observed with the Schmitz model (1 RCT, 2 case-control, and 75 cohort studies, 35,016 cases, 48 treatments; τ 2 = 0.30; 95% CrI, 0.00–3.95), but carbamazepine versus control was not statistically significant (OR, 1.34; 95% CrI, 0.27–5.02) similar to the results obtained from the RCT (1 study, 50 cases, 3 treatments).

### Diazepam (Libervant) [^5608d0e7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression, hypotonia, and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to LIBERVANT during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor neonates exposed to LIBERVANT during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Data

Human Data

Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects.

Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these findings.

Animal Data

Diazepam has been shown to produce increased incidences of fetal malformations in mice and hamsters when given orally at single doses of 100 mg/kg or greater (approximately 13 times a human dose of 0.6 mg/kg/day or greater on a mg/m2basis). Cleft palate and exencephaly are the most common and consistently reported malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis.

In published animal studies, administration of benzodiazepines or other drugs that enhance GABAergic neurotransmission to neonatal rats has been reported to result in widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing brain at plasma concentrations relevant for seizure control in humans. The window of vulnerability to these changes in rats (postnatal days 0–14) includes a period of brain development corresponding to that taking place during the third trimester of pregnancy in humans.

### Maternal use of antiepileptic agents during pregnancy and major congenital malformations in children [^bb557e38]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Is maternal use of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy associated with major congenital malformations in children?

Bottom Line

Certain antiepileptic drugs were associated with increased rates of congenital malformations (eg, spina bifida, cardiac anomalies). Lamotrigine (2.31% in 4195 pregnancies) and levetiracetam (1.77% in 817 pregnancies) were associated with the lowest risk and valproate was associated with the highest risk (10.93% in 2565 pregnancies) compared with the offspring of women without epilepsy (2.51% in 2154 pregnancies).

### Alprazolam [^806fcee0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to alprazolam tablets during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Other Psychiatric Medications at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/othermedications/.

Risk Summary

Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines during the later stages of pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and neonatal withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Considerations)]. Overall available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to alprazolam have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions

Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to benzodiazepines during pregnancy and labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, withdrawal, and feeding problems and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Data

Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco, and other medications, have not confirmed these findings. At this time, there is no clear evidence that alprazolam exposure in early pregnancy can cause major birth defects. Neonates exposed to benzodiazepines during the late third trimester of pregnancy or during labor have been reported to exhibit sedation and neonatal withdrawal symptoms.

Information sources

An experienced librarian developed the search strategies in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials. The MEDLINE search strategy was peer-reviewed by another librarian using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies checklist, and the final version is provided in our protocol. The literature search was initially conducted from inception until March 18, 2014, and a rapid update was conducted on December 15, 2015. Reference lists of all included studies and relevant reviews were scanned. Unpublished studies were sought by locating relevant conference abstracts and contacting authors of included studies and AED manufacturers.

Study selection and data collection

After the team conducted two pilot-tests of the eligibility criteria among 10 reviewers (12% disagreements), pairs of reviewers screened each title/abstract independently and conflicts (6%) were resolved through discussion. Subsequently, three level 2 screening pilots (26% disagreements) occurred, as well as three data abstraction pilots. The same process was followed for potentially relevant full-text articles (16% conflicts) and data abstraction. Authors were contacted for studies published in the last 10 years to clarify unclear or missing data.

The 'no AED use' arms were only included if the control group had the same indication as the active arm in the study (e.g. both had epilepsy). The malformation rates were expressed on a basis of livebirths plus stillbirths, based on the number of pregnant women enrolled in the study.

Appraisal of methodological quality and risk-of-bias

Two reviewers independently appraised quality using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The comparison-adjusted funnel plot was used to assess publication bias and small-study effects for outcomes including at least 10 studies.

In the comparison-adjusted funnel plot, the overall treatment effect for each comparison was estimated under the fixed-effect meta-analysis model and its difference from the study-specific treatment effect versus the study-specific standard error was plotted. All AEDs were ordered from oldest to newest according to their international market approval date. The comparison-adjusted funnel plot does not account for correlations induced by multi-arm trials, which may possibly cause overestimation and mask funnel plot asymmetry. To surmount most correlations in multi-arm trials, only data points corresponding to the study-specific basic parameters (treatment comparisons with common comparator) were plotted. For this, the control group was considered the common comparator or, if this was missing, the oldest treatment comparator was used against the remaining AEDs of the corresponding study.

Animal Data

Reproductive studies in animals were performed in mice, rats, and two strains of rabbits. Occasional anomalies (reduction of tarsals, tibia, metatarsals, malrotated limbs, gastroschisis, malformed skull, and microphthalmia) were seen in drug-treated rabbits without relationship to dosage. Although all of these anomalies were not present in the concurrent control group, they have been reported to occur randomly in historical controls. At doses of 40 mg/kg and higher, there was evidence of fetal resorption and increased fetal loss in rabbits which was not seen at lower doses.

Midazolam did not cause adverse effects to the fetus at doses of up to 1.85 times the human induction dose. All doses produced slight to moderate ataxia. The high dose produced a 5% decrease in maternal body weight gain compared to control.

### Gestational opioid exposure and risk of congenital malformations… [^259984f7]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Three minor anomalies in the musculoskeletal system that occurred in high frequencies and were associated with opioid exposure in trimester 2 or 3 were plagiocephaly, polydactyly, and other specified congenital deformities of the hip. Of those exposed to prescription opioids in trimester 2 or 3, a total of 45 infants were diagnosed with these 3 anomalies and 30 of these infants had plagiocephaly. Adjusted results showed that a higher risk of these musculoskeletal anomalies was linked to a high-dose maternal opioid exposure in trimesters 2 and 3. Hydrocodone use in trimester 2 and oxycodone use in trimester 3 were associated with these 3 anomalies. Consistent with teratology theory, 42 our study suggests that minor congenital malformations in the musculoskeletal system are significantly associated with maternal opioid dispensing during the second or third trimester in a dose-dependent manner.

Three anomalies that were disproportionately high in infants with prenatal opioid exposure in the second or third trimester were plagiocephaly, polydactyly, and other specified congenital deformities of the hip. The musculoskeletal system appears to be the third most common organ system involved in congenital malformations, preceded by the circulatory system and genitourinary system. 43–45 Infants with deformational plagiocephaly exhibited a higher rate of developmental delay and cognitive. Previous studies have reported an association between gestational opioid analgesia and major congenital malformations. Broussard et al8 reported that opioids were associated with various congenital heart malformations, spina bifida, and gastroschisis. Källén and colleagues52, 53 found associations of severe congenital malformations, cardiovascular defects, and clubfoot with opioids, including tramadol.

Hydrocodone, oxycodone, and codeine use in trimester 2 or 3 were related to a higher risk of malformations in the musculoskeletal system. Although these findings are based on a small number of outcome events, hydrocodone, oxycodone, tramadol, and codeine in general showed higher risks of congenital malformations and toxic effects in the fetus.

### Remimazolam besylate (Byfavo) [^72b09b32]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data).

In animal studies, reduced fetal weights but no evidence of malformations or embryofetal lethality were noted in a study in which pregnant rabbits were treated intravenously with 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 30 mg during organogenesis. Adequate rodent reproductive and developmental toxicology studies have not been completed to fully evaluate the effects of BYFAVO.

Published studies in pregnant primates demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity during the period of peak brain development increases neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain of the offspring when used for longer than 3 hours. There are no data on pregnancy exposures in primates corresponding to periods prior to the third trimester in humans (see Data).

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression, hypotonia, and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to BYFAVO during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^9ed7cede]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy — antipsychotics and benzodiazepines: "The relative safety of administering first-generation antipsychotics, especially trifluoperazine and perphenazine, during pregnancy is supported by a large database (300)." In contrast, "The data regarding second-generation antipsychotics consist only of case reports and case series totaling fewer than 100 children for any individual drug except clozapine, for which the total approaches 150 children." Regulatory risk categorization is stated: "The FDA classifies all second-generation antipsychotics as pregnancy risk Category C ("Risk cannot be ruled out"), except clozapine, which is classified as Category B ("No evidence of risk in humans")." For benzodiazepines, "Benzodiazepines are apparently not associated with a significant risk of somatic teratogenesis, but the risk of neurobehavioral effects is unclear because of conflicting reports (300, 302)," and practice advice includes that "The reviewers recommend tapering these drugs before delivery when possible and using benzodiazepines in FDA Category C (i.e., clonazepam) or those with less potential for fetal accumulation (i.e., lorazepam and oxazepam)."

### Patterns of psychotropic medicine use in pregnancy in the United States from 2006 to 2011 among women with private insurance [^c6f28718]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

A common methodological limitation to all studies examining outcomes of prescription drug use during pregnancy is confounding by the underlying indication for the medicine use and other systematic differences at baseline affecting both treatment decisions and outcomes. This is likely to be especially important for women who have multiple mental health disorders, as their outcomes may be confounded by their comorbid condition, and they may be exposed to more than one psychotropic medication. Thus, examining the use of one category of psychotropic medicine during pregnancy is unlikely to present a complete picture of the pharmacologic exposure of the infant or the mental health of the pregnant woman. Risks to the infant may also be higher with exposure to more than one class of psychotropic medicine. Oberlander et al. found higher risks of congenital heart defects among infants whose mothers were using both SSRI antidepressants and benzodiazepines during pregnancy. Thus, understanding the complete picture of exposures to psychotropic medicines during pregnancy is important.

In this study we aim to quantify the rate of pregnancy related exposures to categories of psychotropic medicines stratified according to the primary indication for use (antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, and psychostimulants), trimester of pregnancy, trends over time and region, and indication for use. We are especially interested in the proportion of women using different classes of drugs who initiate use during pregnancy, versus ongoing exposures among established users. We also examined the use of medicines from more than one category during pregnancy (e.g. an antidepressant and an anxiolytic). Defining how commonly psychotropic medicines are used during pregnancy, which psychotropic medicines are most often prescribed, what conditions are most commonly treated with psychotropic medicines, and how psychotropic conditions are managed during pregnancy will help define new research priorities in this field.

Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression, hypotonia, and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to midazolam during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor neonates exposed to midazolam during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

 Data

 Human Data

Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these findings.

 Animal Data

Pregnant rats were treated with midazolam using intravenous doses of 0.2, 1, and 4 mg/kg/day (0.09, 0.46, and 1.85 times the human induction dose of 0.35 mg/kg based on body surface area comparisons) during the period of organogenesis (Gestation Day 7 through 15). Midazolam did not cause adverse effects to the fetus at doses of up to 1.85 times the human induction dose. All doses produced slight to moderate ataxia. The high dose produced a 5% decrease in maternal body weight gain compared to control.

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to psychiatric medications, including XANAX, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/.

Risk Summary

Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Clinical Considerations)]. Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data).

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Limited data from published literature reports the presence of alprazolam in human breast milk. There are reports of sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk. The effects of alprazolam on lactation are unknown.

Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including sedation and withdrawal symptoms in breastfed infants, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with XANAX.

### Comparative safety of anti-epileptic drugs during pregnancy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of congenital malformations and prenatal outcomes [^f9039ad6]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Our protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42014008925) and published in an open-access journal (Additional file 1). Our NMA conforms to the ISPOR guidance and PRISMA-NMA (Additional file 2).

Eligibility criteria

Pregnant women taking AEDs for any indication were eligible. Studies reporting on the following AEDs as monotherapy or polytherapy of any dose were included: first-generation (carbamazepine, clobazam, clonazepam, ethosuximide, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, valproate) and newer-generation (marketed after 1990; gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, vigabatrin). The comparators were placebo, no AED treatment (women not exposed to AED but with the same indications for their use), or other AEDs alone or in combination. Papers judged to include data from the same patients were excluded from the analysis to avoid double-counting. Companion reports of included studies were used for supplementary information only.

The primary outcomes were the incidence of overall and specific types of major CM, which were defined as malformations present from birth with surgical, medical, functional, or cosmetic importance. When studies also reported on major CM cases that were diagnosed prenatally and resulted in elective terminations, these were included in the CM analysis. For specific CM types, the six most frequently occurring in the literature were selected, namely cardiac, cleft lip/palate, club foot, hypospadias, inguinal hernia, and undescended testes (boys only). The secondary outcomes of interest were the incidence of combined fetal losses, prenatal growth retardation, preterm birth, and minor CMs (i.e. any CM that did not qualify as a major CM; Additional file 3: Appendix A). The "combined" fetal loss types outcome includes total fetal losses reported as well as studies that only report on one type of fetal loss (e.g. stillbirths). Randomized clinical trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and observational studies with a control group examining the effects of AEDs on infants and children (≤ 12 years of age) who were exposed to AEDs in utero were included. No language or other restrictions were employed.

### Temazepam civ (temazepam) [^1b706836]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Benzodiazepines may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide during the first trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in several studies. Transplacental distribution has resulted in neonatal CNS depression following the ingestion of therapeutic doses of a benzodiazepine hypnotic during the last weeks of pregnancy.

Reproduction studies in animals with temazepam were performed in rats and rabbits. In a perinatal-postnatal study in rats, oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day resulted in increasing nursling mortality. Teratology studies in rats demonstrated increased fetal resorptions at doses of 30 and 120 mg/kg in one study and increased occurrence of rudimentary ribs, which are considered skeletal variants, in a second study at doses of 240 mg/kg or higher. In rabbits, occasional abnormalities such as exencephaly and fusion or asymmetry of ribs were reported without dose relationship. Although these abnormalities were not found in the concurrent control group, they have been reported to occur randomly in historical controls. At doses of 40 mg/kg or higher, there was an increased incidence of the 13th rib variant when compared to the incidence in concurrent and historical controls.

Temazepam is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Patients should be instructed to discontinue the drug prior to becoming pregnant. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered.

### Monotherapy treatment of epilepsy in pregnancy: congenital malformation outcomes in the child [^d204eace]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Whilst CBZ, PB, PHT, TPM and VPA are associated with an increase in the risk of major malformation, the level of risk varies between the four ASMs. For example, CBZ showed a lower overall major malformation risk rate than PB and VPA, and a lower risk for specific major malformation types compared to some ASMs (e.g. PB or TPM). All ASMs, regardless of their own association with an increased risk, carried a lower risk than VPA‐exposure which had the highest prevalence from both cohort (9.8%) and routine health record data (9.7%). LTG remains the lowest risk ASM with adequate cohort size (N = > 4700 pregnancies from cohort studies and N = 2502 from routine health record studies). LTG does appear to have a dose effect, as do CBZ, PB and VPA. The number of LEV‐exposed pregnancies remains more limited than LTG but, in direct comparison, there is currently no significant difference between these two ASMs, and LEV‐exposed children have a lower overall major malformation risk than CBZ, VPA and PHT. TPM exposure was associated with a higher overall major malformation risk in comparison to LTG, but not other ASMs; this finding may be due to relatively small numbers of participants in the TPM studies and only a few malformation events. TPM exposure, however, was associated with higher specific risks of oro‐facial, craniofacial, skeletal and limb malformations in comparison to LTG, LEV, CBZ, but not in comparison to the two control groups; but specific major malformation data were limited for the control cohorts.

There remains limited information for GBP, OXC, TPM and ZNS and other 'newer' medications. The evidence for each ASM monotherapy is summarised below.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^13cd05d0]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

The perinatal period

The only systematic study of catatonia in the perinatal period is a retrospective chart review of 200 women consecutively admitted to hospital with postpartum psychosis, which suggests that the condition may be prevalent in women with severe mental illness in the postnatal period: 40 women (20%) were assessed as having catatonic signs. The literature in other perinatal groups with psychiatric or medical illnesses does not allow prevalence estimates.

In pregnancy, many potential complications of persistent catatonia place the mother and child at exceptionally high risk. These include venous thrombosis and thromboembolism, dehydration, malnutrition, incontinence, infections, communication difficulties, impaired co-operation with assessments and investigations, and impairment of capacity. Postnatally, the mother's ability to breastfeed and to care and bond with her infant are key concerns.

The sections that follow describe the risks that the two main treatments for catatonia, lorazepam and ECT, may pose to the mother and the child. More details about the general principles of use of psychotropic medications in the perinatal period may be found in the BAP guidance on this topic

The reproductive safety of lorazepam in the perinatal period

Research on the reproductive safety of benzodiazepines remains at an early stage, and studies more typically evaluate benzodiazepines as a group, rather than individual agents. In a meta-analysis of cohort studies of exposure to benzodiazepines, found a trend towards increased risks for total (n = 5195) and cardiovascular (n = 4414) malformations with the lower end of the 95% CI nearly achieving significance.reported in a nationwide cohort study of 3.1 million pregnancies with a larger sample of benzodiazepine exposures (n = 40,846), using propensity scores to account for a large number of potential confounders and several sensitivity analyses, that first trimester exposure to benzodiazepines was associated with a very small increased risk of overall congenital malformations (adjusted relative risk (aRR): 1.09; 95% CI: 1.05–1.13) and specifically, heart defects (adjusted RR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.10–1.21). A risk of oral clefts, reported by several previous studies, was not confirmed. There were differences between compounds and lorazepam was not associated with significant effects (aRR for overall congenital malformations 1.00, CI: 0.85–1.18; aRR for cardiovascular malformations 1.14, CI: 0.93–1.40).

The median baseline risk of hypospadias in the control group (no AED exposure) across all studies was 0.000 (interquartile range, 0.000–0.015; Additional file 3: Appendix K). The NMA for hypospadias included 1 RCT, 1 case-control, and 29 cohort studies, 12,365 cases, and 31 AEDs plus control, with 7% of comparisons reaching statistical significance (Additional file 3: Appendices J, L, and N). Gabapentin (OR, 16.54; 95% CrI, 2.50–121.70), clonazepam (OR, 6.17; 95% CrI, 1.17–24.80), primidone (OR, 5.92; 95% CrI, 1.01–23.77), and valproate (OR, 2.58; 95% CrI, 1.24–5.76) were associated with statistically significantly more cases developing hypospadias compared to control (Fig. 6b).

Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/pregnancyregistry/

Risk Summary

Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data).

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression, hypotonia, and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to Halcion during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor neonates exposed to HALCION during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

### Clonazepam [^02545960]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacodynamic Interactions:

The CNS-depressant action of the benzodiazepine class of drugs may be potentiated by alcohol, narcotics, barbiturates, nonbarbiturate hypnotics, antianxiety agents, the phenothiazines, thioxanthene and butyrophenone classes of antipsychotic agents, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and the tricyclic antidepressants, and by other anticonvulsant drugs.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:

Carcinogenesis

Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with clonazepam.

Mutagenesis

The data currently available are not sufficient to determine the genotoxic potential of clonazepam.

Impairment of Fertility

In a two-generation fertility study in which clonazepam was given orally to rats at 10 and 100 mg/kg/day, there was a decrease in the number of pregnancies and in the number of offspring surviving until weaning. The lowest dose tested is approximately 5 and 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and 4 mg/day for panic disorder, respectively, on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis.

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, such as clonazepam, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to recommend that pregnant women taking clonazepam enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or online at http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.

Risk Summary

Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome, and Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data).

Administration of clonazepam to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in developmental toxicity, including increased incidences of fetal malformations, at doses similar to or below therapeutic doses in patients (see Animal Data). Data for other benzodiazepines suggest the possibility of long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function in animals following prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines at clinically relevant doses.

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

### Carisoprodol, gaba (prazolamine) [^712cf24b]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
8.1 Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C.

8.1 Pregnancy: Category Pregnancy C.

There are no data on the use of Carisoprodol Tablets during human pregnancy. Animal studies indicate that carisoprodol crosses the placenta and results in adverse effects on fetal growth and postnatal survival. The primary metabolite of carisoprodol, meprobamate, is an approved anxiolytic. Retrospective, post-marketing studies do not show a consistent association between maternal use of meprobamate and an increased risk for particular congenital malformations. Teratogenic effects: Animal studies have not adequately evaluated the teratogenic effects of carisoprodol. There was no increase in the incidence of congenital malformations noted in reproductive studies in rats, rabbits, and mice treated with meprobamate. Retrospective, post-marketing studies of meprobamate during human pregnancy were equivocal for demonstrating an increased risk of congenital malformations following first trimester exposure. Across studies that indicated an increased risk, the types of malformations were inconsistent. Nonteratogenic effects: In animal studies, carisoprodol reduced fetal weights, postnatal weight gain, and postnatal survival at maternal doses equivalent to 1–1.5 times the human dose (based on a body surface area comparison). Rats exposed to meprobamate in utero showed behavioral alterations that persisted into adulthood. For children exposed to meprobamate in utero, one study found no adverse effects on mental or motor development or IQ scores. Carisoprodol Tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.

### Comparative safety of anti-epileptic drugs during pregnancy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of congenital malformations and prenatal outcomes [^13abe2c2]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Our study has some limitations worth noting. First, we did not incorporate differences in drug dosages of the AEDs because this information was rarely reported across the included studies, although a dose-response relationship has been observed for these agents. For instance, a potential modification of the estimated treatment effects may occur if the doses vary considerably across treatment indications, and accounting for the fact that certain AEDs were more widely utilized in other conditions, while some AEDs are almost exclusively used for epilepsy. Second, the paucity of available data is a limitation; many polytherapies were informed by only a few studies and patients, and many studies included zero events in all arms for the specific CMs and were excluded from those analyses. This impacted the treatment group risk across studies; for example, the median risk of the major congenital anomalies per treatment ranged between 0% and 24%. The lack of adequate knowledge of risks for multiple AEDs impacts the NMA results. This affected the SUCRA estimates, which showed several polytherapies with high OR estimates, but with extremely wide CrIs. For example, in overall major CMs, nine polytherapies had SUCRA curve estimates above 74%, but these all had wide CrIs (95% CrI with shorter length, 28–96%; 95% CrI with wider length, 0–100%) potentially due to the small number of patients (range, 3–21) and studies (range, 1–2) informing these interventions (Additional file 3: Appendix K). Indeed, a simulation study assessing the ranking probability for a treatment of being the best in NMA with a different number of studies per comparison, suggested that the probability of being the best may be biased in favor of treatments with a smaller number of studies. Additionally, another study indicated that the SUCRA curve values might be unreliable. As such, our SUCRA curve values need to be interpreted in conjunction with the ORs and 95% CrIs. Third, quality of reporting of the identified observational studies may have introduced bias; 81% did not control for important cofounders, such as maternal age and epilepsy type and severity, and 59% had large attrition rates. Further, some registries measured CMs and there is a risk that may not have consistently collected data on different types of fetal losses (e.g. stillbirths). However, studies were internally consistent across arms with respect to what was reported. The inclusion of observational studies adds on the evaluation of the safety profile of AED treatments and offers the opportunity to generalize evidence. Fourth, despite no evidence of inconsistency, the assessment of transitivity for most treatment effect modifiers suggested that there was an imbalance in the different levels of quality appraisal across treatment comparisons and most outcomes, which may affect NMA results. A possible approach to address this in a future study would be the use of individual patient data in NMA, to allow for adjustment of the relative treatment effects from the observational studies utilizing patient level covariates. This would also aid decision-making to allow tailoring management to individual patient characteristics. Fifth, although adjusted funnel plots suggested no evidence of publication bias and small-study effects, asymmetry may have been masked given several studies compared multiple arms. To reduce the majority of correlations induced by multi-arm studies, we plotted data points corresponding to the study-specific basic parameters. Additionally, babies born every day are exposed to AEDs and although we searched extensively for grey (i.e. difficult to locate or unpublished) literature, we may have missed unpublished data relevant to our research question. Sixth, the strength of evidence in most NMAs may be low due to the small number of studies compared to the number of treatments included in each network. However, the predictive intervals suggested that our results are robust, overall. Seventh, we combined data across study designs to determine how AEDs behave in the 'real world'. However, this may have introduced heterogeneity in our analyses. We used the naïve approach and the Schmitz et al. model to combine different study designs, as well as sensitivity analyses on observational and cohort studies separately, and all approaches suggested similar results. Although RCTs are considered to be the gold standard of evidence, we included observational studies in our analyses due to the dearth of available RCTs.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression, hypotonia and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to clonazepam during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor neonates exposed to clonazepam during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome).

Data

[Enter Generic Section here]

Human Data

Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects.

Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these findings.

Animal Data

In three studies in which clonazepam was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses of 0.2, 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis, a similar pattern of malformations (cleft palate, open eyelid, fused sternebrae and limb defects) was observed at all doses, in a low, non-dose-related incidence. The lowest dose tested is less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and similar to the MRHD of 4 mg/day for panic disorder, on a mg/m2basis. Reductions in maternal weight gain occurred at doses of 5 mg/kg/day or greater and reduction in embryofetal growth occurred in one study at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day.

No adverse maternal or embryofetal effects were observed in mice or rats following oral administration of clonazepam during organogenesis of doses up to 15 or 40 mg/kg/day, respectively (4 and 20 times the MRHD of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and 20 and 100 times the MRHD of 4 mg/day for panic disorder, respectively, on a mg/m2basis).

Data for other benzodiazepines suggest the possibility of adverse developmental effects (long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function) in animals following prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines.

### Monotherapy treatment of epilepsy in pregnancy: congenital malformation outcomes in the child [^a5928f37]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

2.1 All major malformations

The prevalence of major malformations (any type) in cohort studies for children exposed to clonazepam (CZP) (N = 95), based on data from four studies, was 2.1% (95% CI 0.2 to 17.3). The prevalence of major malformations in routine health record studies for children exposed to CZP (N = 161), based on data from one study, was 2.5% (95% CI 0.0 to 131.8).

2.1.1 CZP versus no medication (in women without epilepsy): cohort studies

Pooled results from two cohort studies suggested no evidence of a difference in risk (RR 2.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 13.94; I² = 0%), with children exposed to CZP (N = 65) experiencing comparable rates of major malformations to control children (N = 504) (Analysis 2.1). The RD also suggested no difference in the level of risk (RD 0.02, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.07; I² = 0%) (Analysis 2.1).

2.1.2 CZP versus no medication (in women with epilepsy): cohort studies

Pooled findings from three cohort studies suggested no evidence of a difference in risk (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.21 to 5.42; I² = 0%), with children exposed to CZP (N = 31) experiencing comparable rates of major malformations to control children (N = 524) (Analysis 2.1). The RD also suggested no difference in the level of risk (RD ‐0.03, 95% CI ‐0.11 to 0.04; I² = 0%) (Analysis 2.1).

2.1.3 CZP versus no medication (in women without epilepsy): routine health record studies

One study suggested no evidence of a difference in risk (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.18 to 2.77; I² = NA (not available)) with children exposed to CZP (N = 113) experiencing comparable rates of major malformations to control children (N = 369,267).

### Opioid and benzodiazepine dispensing and co-dispensing patterns among commercially insured pregnant women in the United States, 2007–2015 [^d465b4c2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The use and co-use of opioids and benzodiazepines may pose significant health risks to pregnant women. Opioid use during pregnancy is associated with obstetric complications like spontaneous abortions and preeclampsia, as well as adverse birth outcomes such as neural tube defects, gastroschisis, and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). While benzodiazepines may have health benefits that outweigh their risks, evidence on the safety of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy is mixed. Some studies report that benzodiazepine use during pregnancy is associated with preterm birth, low birth weight, as well as congenital malformations, while other studies have found no impact of in-utero exposure to benzodiazepines on birthweight or neurodevelopment. The co-use of opioids and benzodiazepines in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of maternal overdose and mortality, increased risk and severity of NAS, and longer newborn hospital stays.

The prevalence of opioid dispensing during pregnancy in the United States (U.S.) is well understood. Most recently, a study analyzing a nationally representative sample of commercially insured women reported a decreasing trend in opioid dispensing during pregnancy (14.9% in 2005 to 12.9% in 2011). However, the overall prevalence of dispensing was observed to be high at an average of 14.4% across the study period.

In contrast to opioids, the epidemiology of benzodiazepine dispensing during pregnancy has been less explored. The National Birth Defects Prevention Study, conducted across 10 U.S. states between 1997 and 2011, found that the prevalence of self-reported benzodiazepine use during pregnancy was rare (0.8%). Another study, in a commercially insured population, reported the prevalence of anxiolytic (benzodiazepine or Z-drug) dispensing during pregnancy to be 3.9% between 2006 and 2011. These prior studies have limited generalizability because of the clinically unique and/or geographically distinct study samples used, or are estimates of overall anxiolytic prescribing and not specifically of benzodiazepines.

### Comparative safety of anti-epileptic drugs during pregnancy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of congenital malformations and prenatal outcomes [^733a563c]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

To assess the impact of small studies, we conducted a NMA restricted to studies including more than 300 cases. We included 13 cohort studies, 27,227 cases, and 22 treatments (τ 2 = 0.03; 95% CrI, 0.00–0.17), and the sensitivity analysis suggested that carbamazepine plus phenytoin plus valproate was associated with statistically significantly more cases developing major CMs compared to control (OR, 20.77; 95% CrI, 1.72–154.20), whereas clonazepam plus valproate (OR, 11.65; 95% CrI, 0.82–71.86) did not statistically differ from the control. The sensitivity analysis for low risk-of-bias in the comparability of cohorts item on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, including 10 observational studies, 21,622 cases, and 31 treatments (τ 2 = 0.03; 95% CrI, 0.00–0.21), suggested that only phenobarbital (OR, 2.22; 95% CrI, 1.12–4.08), topiramate (OR, 1.89; 95% CrI, 1.10–3.24), and valproate (OR, 2.77; 95% CrI, 1.92–4.09) were statistically significantly different from the control. When restricting to low risk-of-bias for the adequacy of follow-up of cohorts (k = 35, n = 20,122; τ 2 = 0.05; 95% CrI, 0.00–0.22), phenytoin plus primidone (OR, 2.58; 95% CrI, 0.46–9.77), phenytoin plus valproate (OR, 1.90; 95% CrI, 0.23–8.94), and topiramate (OR, 1.59; 95% CrI, 0.63–3.40) were no longer statistically significantly different from zero.

Prenatal growth retardation

The median baseline risk of prenatal growth retardation in the control group (no AED exposure) across all studies was 0.047 (interquartile range, 0.024–0.100; Additional file 3: Appendix K). The NMA for prenatal growth retardation included 16 cohort studies, 18,117 children, 22 AEDs plus control, with 8% of comparisons reaching statistical significance (Fig. 3c; Additional file 3: Appendices A, J and L). Clobazam (OR, 4.47; 95% CrI, 1.60–11.18), topiramate (OR, 2.64; 95% CrI, 1.41–4.63), and phenobarbital (OR, 1.88; 95% CrI, 1.07–3.32) were associated with statistically significantly more children experiencing prenatal growth retardation than control (Fig. 5a).

### Use of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy and risk of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth: population based cohort study [^b984ab06]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical implications and conclusion

Women with epilepsy who take antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy had no increased risk of spontaneous abortion. We had limited data to study still birth, but the overall and absolute risk was low. The data support that pregnant women with epilepsy can continue antiepileptic drug treatment as the risk of fetal death is low. However, our study indicates that women with epilepsy treated with a high dose of antiepileptic drug might have an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, especially when using high doses of valproate, clonazepam, and carbamazepine.

Our study supports the view that antiepileptic drug treatment in pregnancy should aim at the lowest possible dose, but also bearing in mind that antiepileptic drug treatment in pregnancy is associated with potential harmful effects on the developing fetus, including congenital malformations and adverse effects on neurodevelopment.

### Association of prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines with development of autism spectrum and attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorders [^e3879b75]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is exposure to benzodiazepines in utero associated with development of autism spectrum or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders?

Findings

This cohort study of 1 516 846 children found that, after adjusting for possible confounders and accounting for possible parental genetic or familial factors, benzodiazepine exposure during pregnancy was not associated with increased risks of neurodevelopmental disorders.

Meaning

Knowledge of outcomes among offspring associated with prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines can help inform their use during pregnancy.

### Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide (Librax) [^0aabcfa6]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression, hypotonia and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to Librax, which contains a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride), during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor neonates exposed to Librax during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly (see WARNINGS, Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome).

Data

Human Data

Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol. Tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these findings.

Animal Data

Oral daily doses of 2.5 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride with 1.25 mg/kg clidinium bromide or 25 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride with 12.5 mg/kg clidinium bromide (0.6 and 6.1 times, respectively, the maximum recommended clinical dose for both drugs, based on body surface area) were administered to rats in a reproduction study through two successive matings. In the first mating, no significant differences were noted between the control or the treated groups, with the exception of a slight decrease in the number of animals surviving during lactation among those receiving the highest dosage. In the second mating, similar results were obtained except for a slight decrease in the number of pregnant females and in the percentage of offspring surviving until weaning. No congenital anomalies were observed in both matings in either the control or treated groups.

### Caution: benzodiazepines in pregnancy and risk of adverse perinatal outcomes [^533db1b9]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Despite mounting data from epilepsy pregnancy registries and other observational studies examining the association of anti-seizure medications with fetal malformations, neurodevelopmental outcomes and perinatal outcomes, large gaps in this literature exist for many specific medications. Furthermore, data on perinatal adverse outcomes including stillbirth, preterm birth, and small for gestational age (SGA) are especially sparse. Benzodiazepines are prescribed in epilepsy as continuous antiseizure medications, intermittently for seizure clusters, or occasionally for anxiety symptoms, and the literature in epilepsy on perinatal outcomes for this class of medications is extremely limited. Some data exist for continuously prescribed clonazepam and clobazam from a Danish population-based study, but evidence is almost nonexistent for other benzodiazepines in epilepsy, such as lorazepam and diazepam, or as needed benzodiazepines.

While it would be ideal to have more data specifically in epilepsy on perinatal outcomes with benzodiazepines, the recent Taiwanese population-based study by Meng et alis an important addition to the general literature on perinatal outcomes of benzodiazepine use in pregnancy, with potential implications for epilepsy care. This well-designed study examined the association of maternal benzodiazepine or Z-hypnotic (zolpidem, zaleplon, zopiclone, eszopiclone) prescription in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy with stillbirth, preterm birth, and SGA among singleton pregnancies. In the main analysis, the unexposed group included pregnant women with no such prescriptions from 30 days prior to estimated last menstrual period through early pregnancy, and propensity score fine stratification weighting was done to control for confounders. Additional study designs were used to address different types of confounding, including: (1) to address potential confounding by indication for the prescription: control group of those who had discontinued these types of medications, and analyses restricted to those with specific, related diagnoses, (2) sibling-matched controls to address potential unmeasured confounders, and (3) paternal negative control design to evaluate for additional residual confounding. Subgroup analyses also separately examined short- and long-acting benzodiazepines and individual medications, and risks were also explored for late pregnancy or first trimester prescriptions.

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^65d7a51f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine use in pregnancy — third-trimester management notes that tapering off of or avoiding use in the third trimester is often recommended, although the absolute risk for NICU admission is low (133/1,000, 95% CI 71–274). Case reports exist of neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal after in utero exposure, including the risk of neonatal seizure, although this is also uncommon, and it is also critical to consider the risks of a taper for the pregnant individual and the fetus. Clinically significant risks include dependence, withdrawal, and misuse; for these reasons, their use as a first-line treatment for anxiety disorders is not recommended. If benzodiazepines are prescribed, the lowest effective dose should be used, and for those with hepatic disease or preeclampsia, benzodiazepines that bypass first-pass metabolism (eg, lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam) should be preferentially selected. Alprazolam should be avoided due to its high addictive potential and heightened risk of acute withdrawal symptoms after cessation. If started, experts recommend continuing the benzodiazepine as needed for 2–4 weeks, until a response to the SSRI has been achieved; the benzodiazepine can then be tapered by 25–50% per week, and abrupt cessation is not recommended due to the risk of withdrawal.

Regarding specific circumstances for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to administer benzodiazepines and barbiturates as the preferred medications for the treatment of pregnant patients with AWS. Recognize that while there is a risk of teratogenicity during the first trimester, these risks appear small and are balanced against the risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and potential consequences to both mother and fetus should severe maternal alcohol withdrawal develop.

### Birth defects after prenatal exposure to antiepileptic drugs [^5827416e]. The Lancet: Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

Background

Exposure to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the first trimester of pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of major congenital anomalies (MCAs) in offspring. Most of the studies, however, have been fraught with methodological shortcomings, and differences in ascertainment methods and classifications prevent meaningful data pooling. Individual studies lacked the statistical power to assess comparative risks associated with specific AEDs.

Recent Developments

Several larger-scale studies, including collaborative multinational registries, have been set up to compare MCA risks associated with different treatments, including newer generation AEDs. Results have largely been consistent with the notion that monotherapy with the most commonly used AEDs is associated with an increase in risk of MCAs by two to three times, and that the magnitude of risk increases in offspring exposed to polytherapy. Available evidence does not suggest that epilepsy per se is associated with a major increase in the risk of MCAs. Almost all studies have suggested that exposure to valproic acid is associated with a greater incidence of MCAs than other AEDs. Valproic acid is also the only AED for which a dose-dependency has been confirmed in several studies: the increase in risk of MCAs, compared with other AEDs, is especially evident at doses above 800–1000 mg/day. Data from the North American registry have suggested that phenobarbital may also have a higher teratogenic risk compared with AEDs other than valproic acid, but evidence remains inconclusive. Information about effects on fetuses of newer generation AEDs other than lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine is scant. Although teratogenic effects of lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine have not been established with certainty, none of the investigations to date identified any statistically significant difference in rates of MCAs between infants exposed to lamotrigine or oxcarbazepine and infants exposed to carbamazepine. In the case of lamotrigine, moreover, a positive correlation between maternal dose and rates of MCAs has been identified. WHERE NEXT? Collaborative pregnancy registries worldwide are at work to fill remaining gaps in knowledge. Issues to be addressed include the comparative risks associated with phenobarbital, with low-dose valproic acid, with newer generation AEDs, and with specific AED combinations; the influence of potential confounders; and the interaction of AED-associated risks with other risk factors, such as genetic profiles. Large scale studies may also clarify whether individual AEDs differ in their ability to cause specific anomalies. Finally, studies are urgently needed to investigate other potential adverse effects of AED exposure, with special reference to effects on postnatal intellectual development.

### Risk of major congenital malformations associated with the use of methylphenidate or amphetamines in pregnancy [^6deb7236]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The use of prescription psychostimulants during pregnancy has been increasing in recent years. One large and 3 small studies have recently examined the risk of major congenital malformations following the use of methylphenidate and amphetamines during the first trimester of pregnancy. The broad findings of these studies are that first trimester gestational exposure to methylphenidate or amphetamines is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations but the associations are no longer statistically significant after adjusting analyses for confounding variables; that first trimester exposure to amphetamines is not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations; and that first trimester exposure to methylphenidate may increase the risk of cardiovascular malformations. A closer look at the data on the last-mentioned finding, however, suggests that the statistical significance of the finding is in doubt and that even if the finding is statistically significant, it is probably not clinically significant. Furthermore, all the findings emerged from observational studies that cannot exclude confounding by indication and other sources of confounding. A reasonable conclusion, therefore, is that there is no evidence, at present, to suggest that methylphenidate and amphetamines are teratogenic. Nevertheless, because absence of evidence of risk is not evidence of absence of risk, the benefits of continuing psychostimulant medication during pregnancy should be weighed against potential risks in an individualized and shared decision-making process.

### Clonazepam (Klonopin) [^a8b7988b]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Carcinogenesis

Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with clonazepam.

Mutagenesis

The data currently available are not sufficient to determine the genotoxic potential of clonazepam.

Impairment of Fertility

In a two-generation fertility study in which clonazepam was given orally to rats at 10 and 100 mg/kg/day, there was a decrease in the number of pregnancies and in the number of offspring surviving until weaning. The lowest dose tested is approximately 5 and 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and 4 mg/day for panic disorder, respectively, on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis.

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, such as Klonopin, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to recommend that pregnant women taking Klonopin enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or online at http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.

Risk Summary

Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome, and Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data).

Administration of clonazepam to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in developmental toxicity, including increased incidences of fetal malformations, at doses similar to or below therapeutic doses in patients (see Animal Data). Data for other benzodiazepines suggest the possibility of long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function in animals following prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines at clinically relevant doses.

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression, hypotonia and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to Klonopin during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor neonates exposed to Klonopin during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome).

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^bef05694]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Perinatal anxiety disorders — benzodiazepine use and safety are characterized by the following guidance: ACOG recommends that benzodiazepines be avoided or prescribed sparingly as a treatment for perinatal anxiety; if benzodiazepines are prescribed, they should preferably be prescribed transiently as a bridge until SSRIs, SNRIs, or psychotherapy achieve their expected response, and they are not recommended as first-line treatment for the treatment of anxiety disorders, with avoidance particularly prudent in the setting of a history of substance use disorder; other agents, such as hydroxyzine, can be used as an adjuvant treatment, particularly for the acute management of associated insomnia. Benzodiazepines are often used to manage acute symptoms until the benefits of SSRIs or SNRIs are achieved in the setting of moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms or when first-line options have not been effective, and in these settings obstetric care professionals should consult with or refer to a perinatal mental health subspecialist because psychotherapy has a stronger evidence base for anxiety treatment than benzodiazepines do. Although their use as primary treatment for anxiety is not recommended due to their side effects and addictive potential, benzodiazepines have a limited but overall relatively reassuring perinatal safety profile, with earlier observational data suggesting an association between first-trimester benzodiazepine exposure and cleft lip or palate not confirmed by more recent studies; meta-analytic data demonstrate associations between pregnancy benzodiazepine exposure and ectopic pregnancy and early-pregnancy benzodiazepine exposure and spontaneous abortion, and exposure during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of neonatal sedation, decreased muscle tone, respiratory compromise, and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission.

### Association of gestational opioid exposure and risk of major and minor congenital malformations [^fc68d714]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that prenatal exposure to prescription opioids in the first trimester is not associated with major birth defects. In the second and third trimesters, it is associated with a higher risk of minor congenital malformations in a dose-dependent manner. Weighing risks and benefits before prescribing opioid drugs to pregnant women or women of childbearing age (in case of unintended pregnancy) could help reduce harm to the fetus. Further investigation in observational studies with larger study cohorts and basic science research with animal models are warranted to provide further support.

### Teratogenicity and antiseizure medications [^472bce3d]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

We need to expand our knowledge, so that our management of women with epilepsy can continue to evolve. Although the pace of progress in the last 2 decades exceeds the prior 150 years, it remains painfully slow for those women requiring antiseizure medications who want to have healthy children, and for their physicians trying to maximize pregnancy outcomes and avoid the lifelong consequences of malformations and diminished developmental outcomes in the children of women with epilepsy. Recommendations for new approaches to expediate obtaining the necessary knowledge and avoid exposing more children needlessly include a national reporting system for congenital malformations, ongoing routine meta-analyses of cohort studies to detect teratogenic signals earlier, monitoring of antiseizure medication (AED) prescription practices and folate use in women to determine whether additional educational efforts are needed, routine preclinical testing of all new AEDs for neurodevelopmental effects, and improved basic and clinical research funding to fully delineate risks and the underlying mechanisms of antiseizure medication-induced teratogenesis.

### Risk of major congenital malformations and exposure to antiseizure medication monotherapy [^9e8d69ee]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This updated analysis includes 2485 more prospective pregnancies (34%) than our 2018 analysisand adds 8 more years of follow-up for treatment changes and related risk implications. To our knowledge, this was the largest published cohort among epilepsy and pregnancy registries, permitting more precise estimation of the teratogenic risk associated with commonly used ASMs and other variables. The risk was lowest for levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and lamotrigine, and a dose dependency was identified for valproate, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. In contrast with our earlier analysis, which included fewer lamotrigine-exposed pregnancies (2514 vs 3584 currently), we did not detect any dose dependency for lamotrigine.

Our multivariable analysis included 13 comparisons of the risk of MCMs between levetiracetam and other ASM exposures, 9 within-drug comparisons, 17 other comparisons across ASMs, and 16 comparisons with non-ASM covariates (Table 3). One important finding was that even at the lowest doses (≤ 650 mg per day) valproate was associated with a higher teratogenic risk compared with levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and oxcarbazepine — but not topiramate. The lowest doses of carbamazepine (≤ 700 mg per day) were associated with a higher risk than levetiracetam, whereas intermediate doses of carbamazepine (> 700–1000 mg per day) were also associated with higher risk compared with lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine. Phenobarbital doses up to 60 mg per day were not associated with higher risk than levetiracetam, but the CIs were wide.

### Use of benzodiazepine medications during pregnancy… stacks… [^ccbb1b35]. stacks.cdc.gov (2019). Medium credibility.

Details Alternative Title: Birth Defects Res Personal Author: Description: Background Benzodiazepine medications can be used to treat anxiety, a condition affecting 15% of women of childbearing age in the United States. Studies have shown conflicting results for the association between benzodiazepine use during pregnancy and birth defects. Methods We analyzed 1997–2011 data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, a multisite, population-based case–control study. We assessed the prevalence of and factors associated with benzodiazepine use in pregnancy among mothers of live-born infants without a birth defect. We used logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between specific birth defects and benzodiazepine use; we estimated crude odds ratios for defect categories with 3–4 exposed cases. Results Exposure to benzodiazepines during pregnancy was rare. Benzodiazepine use was more common among control mothers who were ≥ 30 years, non-Hispanic white, had more education, smoked, and took antidepressant medication. We observed significantly elevated ORs for any benzodiazepine and Dandy–Walker malformation; for alprazolam and anophthalmia or microphthalmia and esophageal atresia or stenosis; and lorazepam and pulmonary valve stenosis, but sample sizes were limited and therefore CIs were wide. Conclusions Our findings suggest that benzodiazepines use is rare and may be associated with risk for certain birth defects. However, these results need replication and should be interpreted with caution. Subjects: Source: Birth Defects Res. 111: 613–620 Pubmed ID: 30891943.

### Intrauterine exposure to carbamazepine and specific congenital malformations: systematic review and case-control study [^41b338f5]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Carbamazepine is one of the most commonly used antiepileptic drugs in Europe among women of childbearing age. Several cohort studies have evaluated the risk of major congenital malformations associated with carbamazepine, and it seemed to be less teratogenic than valproic acid. Although around 3000 pregnancies with recorded carbamazepine exposure have been described in the literature, each individual study on its own is too small to have the statistical power to detect risks for specific congenital malformations compared with other antiepileptic drugs.

The EUROCAT (European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies) Antiepileptic Study Database, which was set up for a study of lamotrigine, covered 3 881 592 births and contains 131 registrations of malformation in pregnancy outcomes exposed to carbamazepine monotherapy, more than in any other published study. This enabled the examination of risks of specific major congenital malformations associated with carbamazepine monotherapy.

We reviewed and combined studies on carbamazepine to identify indications of increased risks of specific malformations after intrauterine exposure to carbamazepine monotherapy in the first trimester of pregnancy. We tested these indications, or prior hypotheses, in a case-control study using two control groups of malformations.

### Risk of major congenital malformations and exposure to antiseizure medication monotherapy [^469c7018]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study provided essential information for physicians considering treatment options for WWE of childbearing potential, taking into consideration dose as well as type of ASM. Results suggest that exposure to levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and oxcarbazepine was associated with a low risk of MCMs and, in particular, a risk lower than that associated with the lowest dose category of valproate. We also identified a dose-dependent teratogenic risk associated with valproate, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital but not for lamotrigine. Although small numbers call for caution, the observation that a low dose of phenobarbital (≤ 60 mg per day) was not associated with an increased risk compared with any other ASM is particularly relevant for resource-limited settings, where phenobarbital may be the only affordable ASM. Most importantly, we observed major changes in the pattern of ASM prescription over time, resulting in a prominent decline in the overall prevalence of MCMs. Considering that there are up to 12 million WWE of childbearing potential worldwide and that additional women are exposed to ASMs for other indications, a 39% decline in the prevalence of MCMs in their offspring has major public health implications. Continued monitoring of teratogenic outcomes by registries and health databases is needed to assess the safety of prenatal exposure to newer generation ASMs. In addition to MCMs, other potential adverse consequences of prenatal ASM exposure, such as neurodevelopmental disorders, are equally important for treatment decisions and also require further investigation in future studies.

### Caution: benzodiazepines in pregnancy and risk of adverse perinatal outcomes [^4b6f06bc]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Work by Meng et al also raises further questions about risk of medication exposure during different timeframes within pregnancy, raising concern that risk of stillbirth and preterm birth may be higher with late second trimester and third trimester exposure than early pregnancy. In the North American Pregnancy Registry, adverse perinatal outcomes also appeared more likely with third trimester exposure, as risk of SGA with topiramate exposure through the third trimester was more than double the risk if topiramate was stopped before the third trimester. Later in pregnancy, there is increased placental transfer and thus potential greater fetal accumulation of medications, which may be particularly risky for medications with risk of adverse perinatal outcomes including stillbirth and SGA. This, together with the risks elucidated under limited prescribing duration of the benzodiazepines studied, may be reason for caution among epileptologists regarding use of benzodiazepines for cluster management during pregnancy. This poses questions for consideration about whether alternative cluster management approaches such as added doses of lower-risk continuous anti-seizure medications such as levetiracetam may be appropriate in pregnancy instead of benzodiazepines, especially for patients with seizure types that are not tonic–clonic.

Clearly, further work in this area would be ideal in epilepsy given that the overall cohort of greater than 2.5 million pregnancies included well below 1% women with epilepsy, even in the exposed group. However, it is worth noting that no future epilepsy cohort study will ever be able to include > 10 000 exposures to these or other less-commonly prescribed but relevant medications in epilepsy. This study is an opportunity for the epilepsy field to consider potential risk implications and management approaches to reduce risk well before epilepsy specific–literature would provide this information. Similar opportunities for earlier information about potential risk with medications used in epilepsy and other conditions may exist, for example via larger scale, methodologically rigorous studies on risks associated with pregabalinand gabapentinto complement existing data on very small numbers of exposures currently available in the epilepsy literature. Future attention to non-epilepsy literature on this topic may be warranted, along with collaborations among different specialties to analyze perinatal outcome risk data for medications used across different indications. With regard to specific future study of adverse perinatal outcomes of benzodiazepines, more detailed dosing and duration of treatment data is needed to bring further clarity to potential risks and define implications for clinical management. In the meanwhile, epileptologists may want to consider increased caution with benzodiazepine use in pregnancy.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^0a6bbabe]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for benzodiazepine use disorder, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, AAFP/AAN/AANP/AAPA/AAPP/ACMT/ACOG/AGS/APA/ASAM 2025 guidelines recommend to weigh the risks and benefits for the maternal-fetal dyad when considering continued benzodiazepine prescribing or tapering for pregnant patients.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and venlafaxine in early pregnancy and risk of birth defects: population based cohort study and sibling design [^4f30dffd]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Depression is common in pregnancy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most frequently used antidepressants in pregnant women, with as many as 3% of such women in Europe and 4–10% in North America receiving these drugs.

The results of previous studies assessing the risk of birth defects after use of SSRIs in pregnancy have been conflicting. Most consistently reported were cardiovascular birth defects. One studyfound an increased risk of cardiovascular defects with combined use of SSRIs or venlafaxine and benzodiazepines. Increased risks of anal atresia, hypospadias, clubfoot, limb reduction defects, craniosynostosis, omphalocele, gastroschisis, and cystic kidneyshave also been reported with use of SSRIs in early pregnancy, but less consistently. A few studies reported no increased risk of congenital birth defects associated with use of SSRIs in pregnancy.

Venlafaxine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used increasingly as an alternative to SSRIs. Recently, a case-control study from the United States, based on 77 exposed cases and 14 exposed controls, reported that use of venlafaxine in early pregnancy was associated with several types of birth defects, with odds ratios ranging from 1.5 to 6.3.

Limitations of previous studies include uncertain information on drug use, recall bias from self reports, limited information on confounding factors, and low statistical power. Larger studies are necessary for more definitive conclusions about particular types of birth defects and associations with specific drugs, rather than classes of drugs.

The Nordic countries, representing a total population of about 26 million people, have similar nationwide registers of births and dispensed drugs, enabling large studies on the effects of rare drug exposures during pregnancy on birth defects. We performed a population based cohort study and a sibling controlled analysis within five Nordic countries to assess predefined and previously reported associations between exposure to individual SSRIs or venlafaxine in the first trimester and the risk of specific birth defects, with emphasis on cardiovascular defects, adjusting for important covariates such as familial factors.

### Risks of 23 specific malformations associated with prenatal exposure to 10 antiepileptic drugs [^591147fd]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the association between exposure to monotherapy with 10 different antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during the first 2 months of pregnancy and the risk of 23 major congenital malformations (MCMs).

Methods

This nationwide cohort study, based on the French health care databases, included all pregnancies ≥ 20 weeks and ending between January 2011 and March 2015. Women were considered to be exposed when an AED had been dispensed between 1 month before and 2 months after the beginning of pregnancy. The reference group included pregnant women with no reimbursement for AEDs. MCMs were detected up to 12 months after birth (24 months for microcephaly, hypospadias, and epispadias). Odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for potential confounders for MCMs with at least 5 cases. Otherwise, we calculated crude ORs with exact confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

The cohort included 1,886,825 pregnancies, 2,997 of which were exposed to lamotrigine, 1,671 to pregabalin, 980 to clonazepam, 913 to valproic acid, 579 to levetiracetam, 517 to topiramate, 512 to carbamazepine, 365 to gabapentin, 139 to oxcarbazepine, and 80 to phenobarbital. Exposure to valproic acid was associated with 8 specific types of MCMs (e.g., spina bifida, OR 19.4, 95% CI 8.6–43.5), and exposure to topiramate was associated with an increased risk of cleft lip (6.8, 95% CI 1.4–20.0). We identified 3 other signals. We found no significant association for lamotrigine, levetiracetam, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and gabapentin.

Conclusions

These results confirm the teratogenicity of valproic acid and topiramate. Because of the small numbers of cases and possible confounding, the other 3 signals should be interpreted with appropriate caution.

### Gestational exposure to benzodiazepines, 1: the risk of spontaneous abortion examined through the prism of research design [^96d293c8]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

A recent, large, case-control study found that, after adjusting for measured confounds, early gestational exposure to benzodiazepines was associated with a nearly doubled odds of spontaneous abortion. The risks differed little between pregnancies exposed to short- and long-acting benzodiazepines. The risks were elevated for all benzodiazepines for which data were adequate for analysis. The risks were higher with higher daily doses. These findings indicate that early gestational exposure to benzodiazepines is a marker for the risk of spontaneous abortion. These findings are not evidence for a cause-effect relationship because analyses in studies such as this can adjust for only measured confounds; therefore, unmeasured, inadequately measured, and unknown confounds will continue to contaminate the interpretation of findings. It follows, therefore, that replication of the study with the same study design using data extracted from other databases will serve no purpose. So, innovative research designs should be considered, such as the examination of risk associated with benzodiazepine exposure in the year before pregnancy, examination of risk in previously unexposed pregnancies, examination of risk in discordant sibling pairs, and examination of risk associated with paternal exposure. Such research designs have the potential to indirectly partially address unmeasured and unknown confounds, including those related to genetics and the family environment.

### Use of antiseizure medications early in pregnancy and the risk of major malformations in the newborn [^ea440c0a]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Maternal use of first-generation antiseizure medications (ASMs), such as valproate and phenobarbital, increases the risk of congenital malformations in offspring. Second-generation ASMs, such as lamotrigine and levetiracetam, pose less risk to fetal development, although topiramate seems to increase the risk of oral clefts. Less is known about the safety of newer second-generation ASMs during pregnancy including oxcarbazepine, zonisamide, and lacosamide. The aim of this study was to quantify the relative risk of major malformations in offspring after maternal use of specific ASMs early in pregnancy, with special interest in second-generation ASMs.

Methods

The study population included pregnant women who enrolled in the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry between 1997 and 2023. Data on ASM use and maternal characteristics were collected through phone interviews at enrollment, at 7 months of gestation, and within 3 months after delivery. Malformations were confirmed by medical records and adjudicated by a dysmorphologist. The risk of major malformations was estimated among infants exposed to specific ASMs in monotherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were estimated with logistic regression models.

Results

A total of 7,311 participants taking an ASM as monotherapy during the first trimester were eligible for analysis. The mean age was 30 years. The risk of major malformations was 2.1% (52/2,461) for lamotrigine, 2.0% (26/1,283) for levetiracetam, 2.8% (32/1,132) for carbamazepine, 5.1% (26/510) for topiramate, 2.8% (12/423) for phenytoin, 9.2% (31/337) for valproate, 1.5% (5/327) for oxcarbazepine, 1.5% (4/270) for gabapentin, 1.3% (3/228) for zonisamide, 6.0% (12/200) for phenobarbital, 3.2% (2/62) for pregabalin, and 0% (0/88) for lacosamide. Compared with lamotrigine, the RR was 5.1 (95% CI 3.0–8.5) for valproate, 2.9 (1.4–5.8) for phenobarbital, and 2.2 (1.2–4.0) for topiramate. Topiramate was specifically associated with a higher risk of cleft lip.

Discussion

Results confirm the association between maternal use of valproate, phenobarbital, and topiramate early in pregnancy and a higher risk of major malformations in the infant compared with lamotrigine. However, they do not support meaningful risk elevation for levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, or zonisamide. Relative risk estimates for lacosamide and pregabalin are still imprecise.

### Association of first trimester prescription opioid use with congenital malformations in the offspring: population based cohort study [^f0b86144]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Overall, our findings suggest that prescription opioids used in early pregnancy are not associated with a substantial increase in risk for most of the malformation types considered, although clinicians should be aware of the potential for a small increase in the risk of oral clefts and counsel patients about this risk. The results inform the selection of analgesic drugs for women who are pregnant and women of reproductive age who might inadvertently become pregnant.

### Association of in utero antipsychotic medication exposure with risk of congenital malformations… [^1ed7b609]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Among the most prevalent exposure-outcome combinations, adjusted relative risks were generally close to the null. One exception was olanzapine exposure and oral cleft; however, estimates varied across sensitivity analyses. Among moderately prevalent combinations, increased risks were observed for gastroschisis and other specific brain anomalies after atypical antipsychotic exposure and for cardiac malformations after chlorprothixene exposure. While the association direction was consistent across sensitivity analyses, confidence intervals were wide, prohibiting firm conclusions.

Conclusions and Relevance In this study, considering the evidence from primary and sensitivity analyses and inevitable statistical noise for very rare exposure-outcome combinations, in utero antipsychotic exposure generally was not meaningfully associated with an increased risk of malformations. The observed increased risks of oral clefts associated with olanzapine, gastroschisis, and other specific brain anomalies with atypical antipsychotics and cardiac malformations with chlorprothixene requires confirmation as evidence continues to accumulate. The risk of any major congenital malformation was 4. 3% among atypical antipsychotic exposed and
3. 1% among typical antipsychotic exposed, with risks ranging from 1. 8% to
5. 5%, depending on the specific antipsychotic drug. For example, the aRR was 2. 4 for perphenazine and the risk of hydrocephaly was
2. 2 for ziprasidone and gastroschisis and 2. 0 for olanzapine and anorectal atresia/stenosis.

### Safety of in utero exposure to buprenorphine + naloxone vs buprenorphine alone… [^a85e2d0d]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

eFigure 1. Illustration of the Exposure Definitions for Malformation Outcomes and Other Neonatal and Maternal Outcomes eFigure
2. Absolute and Relative Risk Estimates of Congenital Malformations Overall and Individual Organ-Specific Malformation Types Among Pregnancies with Exposure to Buprenorphine+Naloxone as Compared to Buprenorphine Alone in the First Trimester. Crude and PS-Weighted Analyses. bBecause cardiac malformations represent the largest organ system–specific malformation group and are the leading cause of congenital malformation–associated infant morbidity and death, 29 only results for this specific group are shown here. Results for all other organ system–specific malformation groups are shown in eTable 6 in Supplement 1.

In addition to major congenital malformation as a composite outcome and cardiac malformation as the most common malformation group and the leading cause of congenital malformation–associated infant morbidity and mortality, 29 we considered 13 organ system–specific malformation groups. Quiz Ref IDThe absolute risk of major congenital malformations was 5. 2% among buprenorphine/naloxone–exposed pregnancies vs
5. 0% among those exposed to buprenorphine alone, resulting in a crude RR of 1. 03 and a weighted RR of 0.
95. For cardiac malformations, the RR attenuated slightly from 1. 13 to

1. 06 after confounding adjustment. Results for major congenital malformations and cardiac malformations were robust to variations in assumptions in sensitivity analyses. The E-value assessment suggested that unmeasured confounding is unlikely to completely explain the observed lower risk for neonatal abstinence syndrome, NICU admission, and SGA when comparing those exposed to buprenorphine/naloxone with buprenorphine alone.

### Monotherapy treatment of epilepsy in pregnancy: congenital malformation outcomes in the child [^0a4e2f27]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Gabapentin dose

The investigation of GBP dose and its potential association with an increased rate of malformations is limited due to the relatively small number of pregnancies where data are currently available. The US Medicaid Registers is the most reliable data source currently available. The study authors did not find that malformation risk increased with dose according to tertiles of the first and the highest prescribed daily dose filled. Doses of 600 mg/d through to 900 mg/d (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.24, P = 0.98) or doses above 900 mg/d (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44, P = 0.15) were not associated with a risk above the baseline risk. The largest cohort study of GBP‐exposed pregnancies was from the North American Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register (N = 145) and no association between increasing dose and increased malformation risk was identified in this study. The participant numbers in other included studies of GBP were too small to investigate any effect of dose size and MCM risk.

Levetiracetam

The prevalence of major malformations (any type) in cohort studies for children exposed to levetiracetam (LEV) (N = 1242), based on data from 11 studies, was 2.6% (95% CI 1.6 to 4.4). The prevalence of major malformations in routine health record studies for children exposed to LEV (N = 248), based on data from two studies, was 2.8% (95% CI 0.0 to 321.9).

### Teratogenesis, perinatal, and neurodevelopmental outcomes after in utero exposure to antiseizure medication: practice guideline from the AAN, AES, and SMFM [^ea7d47f2]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Antiseizure medications and major congenital malformations (MCMs) — Recommendation 3 Statements specify the following: Clinicians must counsel their patients with epilepsy that the birth prevalence of any MCM in the general population is approximately 2.4%–2.9% (Level A). Clinicians must consider using lamotrigine, levetiracetam, or oxcarbazepine in PWCEP when appropriate to minimize the risk of MCMs (Level A). Clinicians must avoid the use of valproic acid in PWCEP to minimize the risk of MCMs (composite outcome) or NTDs, if clinically feasible (Level A). Clinicians must counsel PWCEP who are treated with, or are considering starting, valproic acid that the risk of any MCM is the highest with valproic acid as compared with other ASMs (Level A). To reduce the risk of cardiac malformations, clinicians must avoid the use of phenobarbital in PWCEP, if clinically feasible (Level A). To reduce the risk of oral clefts, clinicians should avoid the use of phenobarbital and topiramate in PWCEP, if clinically feasible (Level B). To reduce the risk of urogenital and renal malformations, clinicians should avoid the use of valproic acid in PWCEP, if clinically feasible (Level B). To enable early detection and timely intervention of MCMs, obstetricians should recommend fetal screening for MCMs for PWCEP who are treated with any ASM during pregnancy (Level B). To enable early detection and timely intervention of congenital heart defects, obstetricians should recommend screening cardiac investigations for the fetus among PWCEP who are treated with phenobarbital during pregnancy (Level B).

### Perception of drug teratogenicity among general practitioners and specialists in obstetrics / gynecology: a regional and national questionnaire-based survey [^4b867dec]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Generally, our results demonstrate a better understanding of teratogenic potential that otherwise reported in the literature. In a Spanish study from 2001, perception of malformation rates following in utero exposure were acetaminophen (5%), amoxicillin (6%), metoclopramide (14%), benzodiazepines (10%), warfarin (53%), etretinate (96%), and thalidomide (82%) among 104 physicians. Damase-Michel et al. found perception of malformation rates for acetaminophen (20%), amoxicillin (14%), metoclopramide (37%), bromazepam (28%), warfarin (59%), isotretionin (89%), and thalidomide (92%) among 103 GP in a French region. Contrary to these rather substantial overestimations, 74 Norwegian GP, assigned low values (below 1.5 using a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10) for teratogenic risk perception for metoclopramide, acetaminophen and pivmecillinam, while escitalopram was rated 3.7. In a recent Brazilian study, more than 50% of GP and obstetricians asked (total n = 80) had a perceived risk of congenital malformations of more than 5% associated to first-trimester exposure to antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepine and anticonvulsants. Serious overestimation of teratogenic risks associated with radiography and CT-scan during early pregnancy by GP and OB/GYN has also been reported. The overall reasonable risk estimates from the responders in our study may to some extent be attributed to selection bias (see study limitations below), but dissemination of relevant information in a systematic and useable form is likely a contributing factor. The by far most commonly used Danish drug information resource by health care professionals was completely restructured in 2005 with respect to pregnancy and lactation recommendations. This Danish online analogue to the Physicians' Desk Reference has since 2005 implemented a transparent and uniform algorithm, which provides the clinician with information on the level of scientific evidence; risk estimations and a clinical recommendation (see Additional file 3 for a translation of these principles).

### Gynecologic management of adolescents and young women with seizure disorders: ACOG committee opinion, number 806 [^61e010f2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Pregnancy risk with antiepileptic drug exposure — although nonmedicated pregnant patients with epilepsy have a fetal malformation rate similar to the general population, fetal antiepileptic drug exposure is associated with a twofold to threefold increased risk of major congenital malformations, with even higher rates reported with valproate or polytherapy use. Thirty percent of patients with seizure disorders do not use highly effective contraception, raising concern given their higher risk of having offspring with fetal malformations.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and venlafaxine in early pregnancy and risk of birth defects: population based cohort study and sibling design [^5fadfc68]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this large multinational population based study including over 2.3 million births from the Nordic countries, exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in utero was associated with a 13% increased prevalence of major birth defects and a 15% increased prevalence of cardiac defects in a covariate controlled analysis. However, we found no increased prevalence in the sibling controlled analyses, suggesting that the small observed increased risk when including mothers and their infants in the analyses could be explained by familial related factors or other lifestyle related factors not adjusted for. Similarly, each specific SSRI increased the prevalence of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction defects, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.40 to 2.54, whereas no association was found in the sibling controlled analysis (0.71, 0.28 to 1.78). No significant association was found between venlafaxine and birth defects.

Comparisons with other studies

Some of the births in our study have been included in previous national studies. The observed increased prevalence of overall major birth defects in association with exposure to SSRIs was lower than the 21–30% increased risk reported in previous Danish studies, but extends the findings from a previous Finnish study reporting no substantial increased risk of overall birth defects. In our data, SSRI use was associated with an increased prevalence of cardiovascular defects; mainly driven by a 30% increase after exposure to paroxetine or fluoxetine, which is an effect of similar size to that reported from databases in the United Kingdomand the United States. Previous studies reporting risks of birth defects in association with the combined use of SSRIs and benzodiazepines included small numbers of exposed infants, with ambiguous findings. Our study showed no increased risk of birth defects with combined use of these drugs.

### Intrauterine exposure to carbamazepine and specific congenital malformations: systematic review and case-control study [^f64ed170]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To identify specific major congenital malformations associated with use of carbamazepine in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Design

A review of all published cohort studies to identify key indications and a population based case-control study to test these indications.

Setting

Review of PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase for papers about carbamazepine exposure in the first trimester of pregnancy and specific malformations, and the EUROCAT Antiepileptic Study Database, including data from 19 European population based congenital anomaly registries, 1995–2005.

Participants

The literature review covered eight cohort studies of 2680 pregnancies with carbamazepine monotherapy exposure, and the EUROCAT dataset included 98075 registrations of malformations covering over 3.8 million births.

Main Outcome Measures

Overall prevalence for a major congenital malformation after exposure to carbamazepine monotherapy in the first trimester. Odds ratios for malformations with exposure to carbamazepine among cases (five types of malformation identified in the literature review) compared with two groups of controls: other non-chromosomal registrations of malformations and chromosomal syndromes.

Results

The literature review yielded an overall prevalence for a major congenital malformation of 3.3% (95% confidence interval 2.7 to 4.2) after exposure to carbamazepine monotherapy in the first trimester. In 131 registrations of malformations, the fetus had been exposed to carbamazepine monotherapy. Spina bifida was the only specific major congenital malformation significantly associated with exposure to carbamazepine monotherapy (odds ratio 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 5.3) compared with no antiepileptic drug), but the risk was smaller for carbamazepine than for valproic acid (0.2, 0.1 to 0.6). There was no evidence for an association with total anomalous pulmonary venous return (no cases with carbamazepine exposure), cleft lip (with or without palate) (0.2, 0.0 to 1.3), diaphragmatic hernia (0.9, 0.1 to 6.6), or hypospadias (0.7, 0.3 to 1.6) compared with no exposure to antiepileptic drugs. Further exploratory analysis suggested a higher risk of single ventricle and atrioventricular septal defect.

Conclusion

Carbamazepine teratogenicity is relatively specific to spina bifida, though the risk is less than with valproic acid. Despite the large dataset, there was not enough power to detect moderate risks for some rare major congenital malformations.

### An update on maternal medication-related embryopathies [^a0207bbe]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

There is a general perception that any exposure to medication during pregnancy poses a potential risk to the fetus. Most available data about teratogenic drugs is derived from animal studies, case reports, or cohort studies. As a result, counseling women and their partners about the safety of drugs during pregnancy can be difficult due to limited information about efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and teratogenicity of some drugs. However, this should always be done in the context of weighing up potential teratogenic risks with the perinatal risks of an untreated medical or psychiatric condition. Ideally, this counseling should occur prior to a planned pregnancy so that medications and treatment of chronic medical conditions can be optimized. It is important that clinicians providing antenatal care are able to confidently manage women including utilizing appropriate resources. This paper aims at reviewing a selected (non-exhaustive) list of the most commonly prescribed medications considered significant human teratogens and provides recommendations for pre-conception and antenatal counseling.

### Metformin exposure in first trimester of pregnancy and risk of all or specific congenital anomalies: exploratory case-control study [^3fe5b0b9]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design

We did an exploratory case-control study using malformed controls, using the EUROmediCAT central database. The use of malformed controls was initially proposed for birth defect epidemiology as a method of controlling for maternal recall bias (box 1). It is used in EUROmediCAT to control for the source of drug exposure data and because data on non-malformed controls are not available.

Box 1
Case-control studies using malformed controls

In a case-control study, a group of patients who have the disease of interest (cases) and a group who do not have the disease (controls) are selected, and the proportion with the exposure of interest in each group is compared.

In a case-control study using malformed controls, commonly used for congenital anomaly studies, a group of babies with a particular congenital anomaly of interest (cases) and a group who have different congenital anomalies (controls) are selected. This design is particularly suitable for investigating the specificity of association between specific malformations and specific exposures, rather than the overall risk of malformation.

Case-control studies using malformed controls were initially proposed to overcome maternal "recall bias."Although this is not an problem for EUROmediCAT drug exposure data, which are mainly collected from prospective medical/maternity records, it is also a useful design when comparable data on non-malformed controls are not available.

The main potential disadvantage of using malformed controls is "teratogen non-specificity bias."This is where a teratogen causes many different malformations, some of which are included in the control group leading to an underestimation of risk. This can be avoided by excluding from the controls any malformation previously associated in the literature with the exposure in question and including a wide range of malformations in the control group, as no known teratogen increases the risk of all malformations to the same extent. An additional approach is to specify a control group of genetic syndromes, which cannot have been caused by environmental teratogens, but as their numbers are small this reduces statistical power.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^e24ab947]. DoD/VA (2023). High credibility.

Bipolar disorder — teratogenic anticonvulsants in individuals of childbearing potential: We recommend against valproate, carbamazepine, or topiramate in the treatment of bipolar disorder in individuals of child-bearing potential, noting that the harms of potential teratogenic effects outweighed potential benefit and that we recommend against their use in individuals of childbearing potential. Providers should establish whether the individual is sexually active, pregnant, or might become sexually active or pregnant and discuss the potential risks of specific medications and untreated bipolar disorder in pregnancy. Supporting statements include that "epidemiological data suggest that there might be an association between the use of carbamazepine during pregnancy and congenital malformations, including spina bifida" and that "topiramate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman" with "increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts) and for being small for gestational age." The recommendation is categorized as Reviewed, New-added, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low.

### Headaches in pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 3 [^4362ced5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Interventions for prevention of headaches in pregnancy — this table lists recommendations and potential risks for specific options. Memantine is not currently recommended in pregnancy and has no published human pregnancy data. Onabotulinum-toxin A is not recommended for episodic migraines nor tension-type headaches in pregnancy and advises balancing risks and benefits for chronic migraines, with limited data in pregnancy. Topiramate is not recommended in pregnancy; stop before attempting pregnancy, with potential risks including fetal death or spontaneous abortion, fetal growth restriction, cleft lip or palate, and other major congenital anomalies. Valproic acid is not recommended in pregnancy; stop before attempting pregnancy; it can be considered during lactation with adequate contraception, with risks including fetal death, spontaneous abortion, major congenital malformations, cleft lip or palate, developmental delays, and autism/ dyspraxia. Melatonin has insufficient evidence to support efficacy and limited data in pregnancy. Lifestyle interventions such as stress-reduction measures, avoidance of triggers, adequate sleep, adequate hydration, acupuncture, and cognitive behavioral therapy have insufficient evidence to support efficacy and no known risks.

### Comparative risk of major congenital malformations with eight different antiepileptic drugs: a prospective cohort study of the EURAP registry [^2b1e57e6]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence for the comparative teratogenic risk of antiepileptic drugs is insufficient, particularly in relation to the dosage used. Therefore, we aimed to compare the occurrence of major congenital malformations following prenatal exposure to the eight most commonly used antiepileptic drugs in monotherapy.

Methods

We did a longitudinal, prospective cohort study based on the EURAP international registry. We included data from pregnancies in women who were exposed to antiepileptic drug monotherapy at conception, prospectively identified from 42 countries contributing to EURAP. Follow-up data were obtained after each trimester, at birth, and 1 year after birth. The primary objective was to compare the risk of major congenital malformations assessed at 1 year after birth in offspring exposed prenatally to one of eight commonly used antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate, and valproate) and, whenever a dose dependency was identified, to compare the risks at different dose ranges. Logistic regression was used to make direct comparisons between treatments after adjustment for potential confounders and prognostic factors.

Findings

Between June 20, 1999, and May 20, 2016, 7555 prospective pregnancies met the eligibility criteria. Of those eligible, 7355 pregnancies were exposed to one of the eight antiepileptic drugs for which the prevalence of major congenital malformations was 142 (10·3%) of 1381 pregnancies for valproate, 19 (6·5%) of 294 for phenobarbital, eight (6·4%) of 125 for phenytoin, 107 (5·5%) of 1957 for carbamazepine, six (3·9%) of 152 for topiramate, ten (3·0%) of 333 for oxcarbazepine, 74 (2·9%) of 2514 for lamotrigine, and 17 (2·8%) of 599 for levetiracetam. The prevalence of major congenital malformations increased with the dose at time of conception for carbamazepine (p = 0·0140), lamotrigine (p = 0·0145), phenobarbital (p = 0·0390), and valproate (p < 0·0001). After adjustment, multivariable analysis showed that the prevalence of major congenital malformations was significantly higher for all doses of carbamazepine and valproate as well as for phenobarbital at doses of more than 80 mg/day than for lamotrigine at doses of 325 mg/day or less. Valproate at doses of 650 mg/day or less was also associated with increased risk of major congenital malformations compared with levetiracetam at doses of 250–4000 mg/day (odds ratio [OR] 2·43, 95% CI 1·30–4·55; p = 0·0069). Carbamazepine at doses of more than 700 mg/day was associated with increased risk of major congenital malformations compared with levetiracetam at doses of 250–4000 mg/day (OR 2·41, 95% CI 1·33–4·38; p = 0·0055) and oxcarbazepine at doses of 75–4500 mg/day (2·37, 1·17–4·80; p = 0·0169).

Interpretation

Different antiepileptic drugs and dosages have different teratogenic risks. Risks of major congenital malformation associated with lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and oxcarbazepine were within the range reported in the literature for offspring unexposed to antiepileptic drugs. These findings facilitate rational selection of these drugs, taking into account comparative risks associated with treatment alternatives. Data for topiramate and phenytoin should be interpreted cautiously because of the small number of exposures in this study.

### Association of prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines with development of autism spectrum and attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorders [^2d184972]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

After adjusting for possible confounders and accounting for possible parental genetic or wider familial factors, this cohort study found no evidence that benzodiazepine exposure during pregnancy was associated with increased risks of ASD or ADHD among offspring. Our results challenge current assumptions of a potential association of neurodevelopmental disorders with maternal benzodiazepine use before or during pregnancy. Better identification of maternal mental health concerns, as well as possible interventions or provisions of guidance to build better nurturing and raising environments for newborns at risk, may be relevant to the prevention of adverse outcomes of neurodevelopmental disorders.

### Teratogenesis, perinatal, and neurodevelopmental outcomes after in utero exposure to antiseizure medication: practice guideline from the AAN, AES, and SMFM [^6035d45a]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Antiseizure medications and major congenital malformations (MCMs) rationale identifies baseline risk and drug-specific associations. The unadjusted birth prevalence of any MCM among children born to people without epilepsy is approximately 2.4%–2.9%. Among ASMs with sufficient exposures, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and oxcarbazepine have the lowest unadjusted birth prevalence in monotherapy (3.1%, 3.5%, and 3.1%, respectively), while valproic acid has the highest unadjusted birth prevalence (9.7%). Valproic acid is associated with the highest unadjusted birth prevalence of neural tube defects (1.4%); phenobarbital with cardiac malformations (4.4%); phenobarbital and topiramate with oral cleft and cleft palate (2.2% and 1.4% respectively); and valproic acid with urogenital (1.2%) and renal (1.4%) malformations. A detailed anatomical ultrasound of the fetus can enable earlier diagnosis of MCMs.

### Monotherapy treatment of epilepsy in pregnancy: congenital malformation outcomes in the child [^546bf402]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

In comparison to other ASMs, in the meta‐analyses reported here, children exposed to VPA were at an increased risk of major malformation compared with children exposed to CBZ, CZP, GBP, LEV, LTG, TPM, OXC, PB and PHT, with the ZNS group being non‐significant but too being small to make a reliable comparison. The increased risk associated with VPA exposure ranged from 4% to 9%, depending on the comparator ASM.

At the specific malformation level, children exposed to VPA were at an increased risk of neural tube malformation compared with the children exposed to CBZ, LEV, LTG and PHT. We did not note any increase in the specific malformation type analyses compared to children exposed to GBP, OXC, PB or TPM, but this is most likely due to limited data. However, we found an increased rate of cardiac malformation compared to CBZ, LEV, LTG, TPM, PHT and an equal cardiac risk in comparison to the increased risk for PB‐exposed children. Oro‐facial cleft and craniofacial malformations were also significantly more common in the children exposed to VPA compared with children exposed to CBZ, LEV and LTG. There was no difference in the rate of oro‐facial cleft or craniofacial malformations compared with TPM, PB or PHT, but these are found to carry their own risks of this malformation type (US Medicaid Registers). Finally, skeletal or limb malformations in children exposed to VPA compared with children exposed to CBZ, LEV, LTG or PHT were significantly higher. All specific malformation comparisons that the data compared with CZP, GBP, ZNS and OXC were too limited for conclusions to be made.

### Obstetric toxicology: teratogens [^613c2ac7]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The emergency physician frequently encounters women who seek care because of pregnancy- and nonpregnancy-related complaints. Many medications are safe for use during pregnancy, including several that are listed as potential teratogens based on the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) pregnancy classification; but it is important that the emergency physician know and recognize which drugs can be given in pregnancy and which drugs are absolutely contraindicated. Expert resources should be identified and used because the FDA's classification of drugs based on pregnancy risk does not represent the most up-to-date or accurate assessment of a drug's safety.

Discussion

Optimal management of women with epilepsy (WWE) during their child bearing years and pregnancy presents a clinical conundrum, even in developed countries as treatment with certain AEDs during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations. While possible teratogenicity should be a concern when commencing AEDs in all women of childbearing age, preplanned pregnancies with pre-conceptional folic acid are advised to minimize risk during pregnancy. Avoiding sodium valproate that carries the highest risk of teratogenicity and commencement of minimum effective dose of monotherapy are encouraged pre-conceptionally. Although lamotrigine is considered relatively safe in pregnancy it is not readily available for patients in state hospitals in Sri Lanka. Carbamazepine monotherapy is also considered to have a comparatively lower risk of teratogenicity, while sodium valproate carries the highest risk of teratogenicity with 5.4 to 20.3% reported major congenital malformations or death with significantly increased risk at doses more than 600 mg/day. The greatest attributable risk has been observed at doses more 1000 mg/day.

### Monotherapy treatment of epilepsy in pregnancy: congenital malformation outcomes in the child [^02448695]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis

We employed both fixed‐effect and random‐effects meta‐analyses to synthesise the data. We presented the primary outcome (major congenital malformations) and the secondary outcome of specific malformations as a risk ratio (RR). Within certain comparisons, we have also presented the risk differences (RD) for both primary outcome (overall malformation rate). In the event that we deemed meta‐analysing inappropriate (e.g. presence of clinical heterogeneity), we applied a narrative form to the review, discussing all comparisons according to the findings presented within the studies.

Comparisons carried out included:

specific ASM monotherapy group versus controls on major congenital malformations;
specific ASM monotherapy group versus controls on specific major congential malformation types;
specific ASM monotherapy group versus specific ASM monotherapy group on major congential malformations;
specific ASM monotherapy group versus specific ASM monotherapy group on specific major congential malformations.

We stratified each comparison by control group, comparator group and study design to ensure appropriate combination of study data. For example, cases reported in a national pregnancy and epilepsy register may also be represented in epidemiological datasets of routine health data which covers the same region or a case in an administrative insurance database may also have been reported to a national epilepsy and pregnancy register and therefore data were not combined across these different data sources.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

Subgroup analysis was stratified by ASM and type of control or comparator group. When heterogeneity was present across outcomes, we carried out a random‐effects analysis. We examined differences between analyses and reported the appropriate analysis.

Sensitivity analysis

We adopted a cautious approach to combining data extracted from different types of study, and also where different comparator groups were included as outlined in Measures of treatment effect. Additionally, we only included studies where over 70% of the cohort were women taking ASMs for the treatment of epilepsy. This was due to the heterogeneity around doses prescribed, across women taking ASMs for different conditions. This decision is supported by the findings of Hernandez Diaz and colleagues (US Medicaid Registers) who found that differences in the dose of topiramate prescribed for women with epilepsy compared to women prescribed it for other conditions altered the risk of oro‐facial anomalies.

### Idiopathic generalized epilepsy: misunderstandings, challenges, and opportunities [^3b8c9c1e]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Before conception, women should be counseled to allow for patient-provider shared decision-making regarding key aspects of care. Preconception counseling should include ASM and strategies to reduce risks: folate supplementation (1–4 mg daily), reducing ASM number and dose if possible, and interactions between ASMs and contraceptives. Among children whose mothers took high-dose folate (mean, 4.3 mg) during pregnancy, one study found a > 2.5-fold risk of cancer.

All ASMs are have potential teratogenic risk: lowest for levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and oxcarbazepine (approximately 1%–3% risk of major congenital malformations; ∼ 0%–1% higher than the general population). Topiramate, carbamazepine, and phenytoin have higher risk (∼3%–5%) while phenobarbital (∼6%) and valproate (∼7%–10%) are those with highest risk. The low teratogenicity of lamotrigine and levetiracetam make them first-line ASMs for women with IGE of reproductive age. At low-to-modest doses, their risk is similar to controls for major congenital malformations: lamotrigine (2.3%), levetiracetam (1.8%) vs women without epilepsy (1.5%–2.5%).

Teratogenic ASM risks correlate with number and dose of medications. Four ASMs with dose-dependent risks for major congenital malformations are valproate (> 1,450 mg/d: 25.2%; 650–1,449 mg/d: 11.3%; ≤ 650 mg/d: 6.3%), phenobarbital (> 130 mg/d: 11.7%; 80–129 mg/d: 6.2%; ≤ 80 mg/d: 2.7%), carbamazepine (> 700 mg/d: 7.2%; ≤ 700 mg/d: 4.5%), and lamotrigine (> 325 mg/: 4.3%; ≤ 325 mg/d: 2.5%).

### Practice guideline update summary: pharmacologic treatment for pediatric migraine prevention: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^d028daef]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Counseling for patients of childbearing potential — risk counseling notes that topiramate and valproate have well-demonstrated teratogenic effects, especially when used in polytherapy, and valproate use during pregnancy is also associated with developmental disorders in offspring; an FDA black box warning regarding fetal risk from valproate use exists as of the time of this guideline. It further states that topiramate at a daily dose of 200 mg or less does not interact with oral combined hormonal contraceptives; however, at higher doses it can have drug interactions that decrease their effectiveness, and that the risk of major congenital malformation in offspring of women with epilepsy taking antiepileptics is possibly decreased by folic acid supplementation. Clinically, clinicians must consider the teratogenic effect of topiramate and valproate in their choice of migraine prevention therapy recommendations to patients of childbearing potential (Level A).

Maternal use of certain drugs during pregnancy can result in transient neonatal signs consistent with withdrawal or acute toxicity or cause sustained signs consistent with a lasting drug effect. In addition, hospitalized infants who are treated with opioids or benzodiazepines to provide analgesia or sedation may be at risk for manifesting signs of withdrawal. This statement updates information about the clinical presentation of infants exposed to intrauterine drugs and the therapeutic options for treatment of withdrawal and is expanded to include evidence-based approaches to the management of the hospitalized infant who requires weaning from analgesics or sedatives.

### Intrauterine exposure to carbamazepine and specific congenital malformations: systematic review and case-control study [^967d98b3]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

The apparent specificity of effect of carbamazepine for spina bifida, compared with valproic acid, with a much larger range of effects, might be a useful biological clue in elucidating the underlying teratogenic mechanism. It is also possible that spina bifida is in part related to the underlying epilepsy rather than the drug used, though our results show that the drug used at least affects the level of risk of spina bifida. In this large population based study, we carried out a direct comparison between the risks for specific malformations associated with carbamazepine monotherapy compared with valproic acid monotherapy. A limitation in our comparison of risks between exposure to different types of antiepileptic drug was that we did not have the information to adjust for type of epilepsy, frequency of seizures, used of folic acid, and dose of the antiepileptic drug.

Conclusions and policy implications

Although most antiepileptic drugs taken during pregnancy significantly increase the risk for one or more specific fetal malformations, the occurrence of these malformations is nevertheless rare. Most exposed pregnancies result in a baby without malformation. The best option regarding antiepileptic drug treatment can be chosen only on an individual basis by the woman and neurologist before pregnancy, weighing the benefits of epilepsy control against the risk of teratogenicity. In this study we have confirmed that carbamazepine is less teratogenic than valproic acid. A Cochrane review found no evidence to support the belief that valproic acid is superior to carbamazepine for generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Therefore, we agree with the recent recommendation of the American Academy of Neurology to avoid valproic acid in pregnancy if possible. Our literature review gives a 3.3% risk of major malformations with carbamazepine monotherapy, and our case-control study shows that the major concern is a moderately increased risk of spina bifida. This should to help in decision regarding whether carbamazepine should be the antiepileptic drug of choice in pregnancy.

### Comparative risk of major congenital malformations with 8 different antiepileptic drugs: a prospective cohort study of the EURAP registry [^2751f8b0]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

Teratogenesis of 8 Antiepileptic Drugs in Multinational Experience Tomson T, Battino D, Bonizzoni E, Craig J, Lindhout D, Perucca E, Sabers A, Thomas SV, Vajda F for the EURAP Study Group. Lancet Neurol. 2018;17(6):530–538.

Background

Evidence for the comparative teratogenic risk of antiepileptic drugs is insufficient, particularly in relation to the dosage used. Therefore, we aimed to compare the occurrence of major congenital malformations following prenatal exposure to the 8 most commonly used antiepileptic drugs in monotherapy.

Methods

We did a longitudinal, prospective cohort study based on the EURAP international registry. We included data from pregnancies in women who were exposed to antiepileptic drug monotherapy at conception, prospectively identified from 42 countries contributing to EURAP. Follow-up data were obtained after each trimester, at birth, and 1 year after birth. The primary objective was to compare the risk of major congenital malformations assessed at 1 year after birth in offspring exposed prenatally to 1 of 8 commonly used antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate, and valproate) and, whenever a dose dependency was identified, to compare the risks at different dose ranges. Logistic regression was used to make direct comparisons between treatments after adjustment for potential confounders and prognostic factors.

Findings

Between June 20, 1999, and May 20, 2016, 7555 prospective pregnancies met the eligibility criteria. Of those eligible, 7355 pregnancies were exposed to 1 of the 8 antiepileptic drugs for which the prevalence of major congenital malformations was 142 (10·3%) of 1381 pregnancies for valproate, 19 (6·5%) of 294 for phenobarbital, 8 (6·4%) of 125 for phenytoin, 107 (5·5%) of 1957 for carbamazepine, 6 (3·9%) of 152 for topiramate, 10 (3·0%) of 333 for oxcarbazepine, 74 (2·9%) of 2514 for lamotrigine, and 17 (2·8%) of 599 for levetiracetam. The prevalence of major congenital malformations increased with the dose at time of conception for carbamazepine (P = 0.0140), lamotrigine (P = 0.0145), phenobarbital (P = 0.0390), and valproate (P < .0001). After adjustment, multivariable analysis showed that the prevalence of major congenital malformations was significantly higher for all doses of carbamazepine and valproate as well as for phenobarbital at doses of more than 80 mg/d than for lamotrigine at doses of 325 mg/d or less. Valproate at doses of 650 mg/d or less was also associated with increased risk of major congenital malformations compared with levetiracetam at doses of 250 to 4000 mg/d (odds ratio [OR]: 2.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1·30–4·55; P = 0.0069). Carbamazepine at doses of more than 700 mg/d was associated with increased risk of major congenital malformations compared to levetiracetam at doses of 250 to 4000 mg/d (OR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.33–4.38; P = 0.0055) and oxcarbazepine at doses of 75 to 4500 mg/d (OR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.17–4.80; P = 0.0169).

Interpretation

Different antiepileptic drugs and dosages have different teratogenic risks. Risks of major congenital malformation associated with lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and oxcarbazepine were within the range reported in the literature for offspring unexposed to antiepileptic drugs. These findings facilitate rational selection of these drugs, taking into account comparative risks associated with treatment alternatives. Data for topiramate and phenytoin should be interpreted cautiously because of the small number of exposures in this study.
