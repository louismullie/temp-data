## Question

When is aspirin indicated for primary prevention

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when aspirin is indicated for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and scope of "primary prevention". Then, I should verify the highest-quality guideline sources and their age-based recommendations. Next, I will examine the risk–benefit balance from contemporary trials and meta-analyses. After that, I need to check special populations such as diabetes, older adults, and those on statins. Finally, I will translate this into a practical decision framework and dosing recommendation, and I should double-check for any nuances I might miss along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope so I don't conflate primary and secondary prevention. Primary prevention refers to adults without established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, meaning no prior MI, stroke, TIA, or symptomatic PAD, and the question is whether low-dose aspirin reduces first events enough to outweigh bleeding risk in this group [^bf7fc85b] [^4c5b8280].

> Next, I should review the most authoritative, up-to-date recommendations. The 2022 USPSTF gives a C recommendation for adults aged 40 to 59 years with a 10-year CVD risk of 10% or higher to consider low-dose aspirin after shared decision-making, and a D recommendation against initiating aspirin for primary prevention in adults 60 years or older, citing no net benefit and increased bleeding risk [^f4ab48b0] [^42288971]. Hold on, I should verify the age threshold; yes, the USPSTF explicitly lowered the lower bound to 40 years and advises against starting at 60 or older [^f4ab48b0].

> I will now examine the ACC/AHA 2019 guideline, which aligns closely. They give a Class IIb recommendation for selective use of low-dose aspirin in adults 40 to 70 years at higher ASCVD risk but not at increased bleeding risk, and a Class III Harm recommendation against routine use in adults older than 70 years or in anyone at increased bleeding risk, reflecting the narrow benefit–harm margin in modern practice [^593397cc] [^2ad05700]. Wait, let me verify the exact wording; yes, "use infrequently" and "not routine" are emphasized, reinforcing caution [^6a7cf321].

> Now, I need to check the evidence base that drove these changes. Contemporary large RCTs — ARRIVE, ASCEND, and ASPREE — consistently show either no significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events or only modest reductions that are offset by increased major bleeding, including gastrointestinal and intracranial hemorrhage, leading to neutral or harmful net clinical benefit in primary prevention populations [^da4688ce] [^df14b899]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the magnitude. Meta-analytic data show a small absolute reduction in cardiovascular events but a larger absolute increase in major bleeding, with number needed to treat around 265 for events prevented and number needed to harm around 210 for major bleeding, underscoring the narrow margin [^df14b899].

> Let me consider diabetes specifically, because older guidance sometimes favored aspirin in diabetes. Initially, I thought the ADA still broadly endorsed aspirin for primary prevention in diabetes, but wait, I should double-check the timing. The 2010 ADA/AHA/ACCF position endorsed aspirin for higher-risk adults with diabetes, yet more recent analyses and guidelines, informed by ASCEND and subsequent data, emphasize that the net benefit is uncertain or unfavorable in many patients with diabetes due to bleeding, so decisions should be individualized and generally prioritize statins and blood pressure control first [^e35f7508] [^da4688ce]. I should confirm that the relative benefit appears similar to non-diabetic populations but absolute benefits are small and bleeding risk is higher, reinforcing caution [^6411592b].

> I need to ensure I account for the modern risk landscape. In the statin era, baseline ASCVD risk is lower, so the absolute benefit of aspirin is smaller, while bleeding risk remains unchanged, shifting the balance toward harm in many patients; this helps explain why recent trials show attenuated cardiovascular benefits compared with older eras when risk factors were less aggressively managed [^c7cb3d9a] [^73e59db8]. But wait, what if the patient is on a statin already? Does that negate any aspirin benefit? The data suggest that statin therapy reduces baseline risk, thereby diminishing the absolute benefit of aspirin, which is why guidelines still prioritize statins and lifestyle over aspirin in primary prevention [^73e59db8].

> Next, I should review practical decision-making steps. I should confirm age first: if the patient is 60 years or older, I should not initiate aspirin for primary prevention. If 40 to 59 years, I should calculate the 10-year CVD risk using a validated estimator and proceed only if risk is 10% or higher, the patient has low bleeding risk, and is willing to take daily aspirin after discussing the small net benefit and bleeding risks. If under 40, evidence is insufficient and routine use is not recommended [^f4ab48b0] [^42288971]. Hold on, I should verify bleeding risk factors that tilt the balance: prior GI bleed, peptic ulcer disease, age over 70, CKD, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, or concomitant NSAIDs, steroids, DOACs, or warfarin are reasons to avoid aspirin for primary prevention [^801ef748].

> I should double-check dosing. Across trials and guidelines, low-dose aspirin in the 75 to 100 mg daily range is used for primary prevention, with 81 mg daily being the most common U.S. dose; higher doses increase bleeding without improving efficacy in this setting, so I should avoid doses above 100 mg daily for primary prevention [^4c5b8280] [^7f4fe3b9]. Let me reconsider whether enteric coating changes risk; while enteric coating may reduce gastric irritation, it does not eliminate bleeding risk, so I should not rely on coating to justify use when bleeding risk is present [^notfound].

> For patients already taking aspirin, I need to ensure we don't abruptly stop therapy without context. The USPSTF advises that those currently on aspirin should discuss continuation with their clinician, and many experts consider discontinuation around age 75 as the net benefit wanes and bleeding risk rises, though this should be individualized and coordinated, especially if aspirin was started for other indications or the patient prefers to continue after counseling [^503855ba] [^f4ab48b0]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should confirm that this applies to primary prevention only; yes, secondary prevention indications are different and generally favor continued aspirin unless contraindicated [^notfound].

> Putting this together, my final, clinically actionable answer is as follows: aspirin is rarely indicated for primary prevention and should be considered only in carefully selected adults aged 40 to 59 years with a 10-year CVD risk of 10% or higher, low bleeding risk, and after shared decision-making that weighs a modest cardiovascular benefit against a meaningful bleeding risk. Routine initiation is not recommended for adults 60 years or older or for anyone at increased bleeding risk, and statins, blood pressure control, and lifestyle remain first-line strategies [^f4ab48b0] [^593397cc] [^4c5b8280].

---

Aspirin is **not routinely indicated** for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [^2fe76394]. It may be considered only for **select adults aged 40–70 years** [^f4ab48b0] with **≥ 10% 10-year ASCVD risk** [^42288971] who are not at increased bleeding risk, after shared decision-making [^4c5b8280]. Aspirin is **not recommended** for adults ≥ 60 years [^f4ab48b0] or for anyone with increased bleeding risk [^593397cc]. The net benefit is small [^df14b899], with a modest reduction in ischemic events offset by increased major bleeding [^da4688ce]; therefore, prioritize lifestyle, blood pressure control, and statins first [^4c5b8280].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| USPSTF 2022 | - Individualize for adults 40–59 years with ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk and low bleeding risk [^f4ab48b0] [^42288971] <br/> - Do not initiate ≥ 60 years [^f4ab48b0] |
| ACC/AHA 2019 | - Consider low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg) for select adults 40–70 years at higher ASCVD risk and low bleeding risk [^593397cc] [^2ad05700] <br/> - Do not use routinely > 70 years or if bleeding risk is increased [^593397cc] |
| ESC 2021 | - Do not use routinely for primary prevention [^notfound] <br/> - Consider only in very-high-risk patients with low bleeding risk |

---

## Evidence summary

- **Benefits**: Modest reduction in nonfatal MI and ischemic stroke [^df14b899], especially in higher-risk patients [^notfound].
- **Harms**: Increased major bleeding (GI and intracranial) [^df14b899], particularly in older adults or those with bleeding risk factors [^8ebb971d].
- **Net benefit**: Small at best [^df14b899]; neutral or harmful in many modern primary prevention populations [^c7cb3d9a].

---

## Specific populations

- **Diabetes**: No clear net benefit; individualize based on risk and bleeding profile [^da4688ce] [^34cb1f30].
- **Elderly**: Increased bleeding risk; avoid initiation ≥ 60 years [^f4ab48b0] [^da4688ce].
- **Low-risk individuals**: Do not use; harms outweigh benefits [^a84b21db].

---

## Clinical decision-making

Use a **shared decision-making** approach that incorporates patient preferences, calculates ASCVD risk [^42288971], and assesses bleeding risk [^801ef748]. Prioritize lifestyle, blood pressure control, and statins before considering aspirin [^4c5b8280].

---

## Practical approach

- **Calculate ASCVD risk**: Use pooled cohort equations [^notfound].
- **Assess bleeding risk**: History of GI bleeding, peptic ulcer, age > 70, CKD, anticoagulant use, thrombocytopenia [^801ef748].
- **Discuss**: Small absolute benefit vs bleeding risk; document decision [^12576d66].
- **If used**: Low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg daily) [^4c5b8280].

---

Aspirin is **not routine** for primary prevention [^2fe76394]. Reserve it for carefully selected, higher-risk adults aged 40–70 years with low bleeding risk, after shared decision-making, and prioritize other preventive therapies first [^f4ab48b0].

### Would you recommend aspirin to this patient for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^40b3e751]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading cause of death in the United States. Reducing ASCVD risk through primary prevention strategies has been shown to be effective; however, the role of aspirin in primary prevention remains unclear. The decision to recommend aspirin has been limited by the difficulty clinicians and patients face when trying to balance benefits and harms. In 2016, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force addressed this issue by determining the risk level at which prophylactic aspirin generally becomes more favorable, recommending aspirin above a risk cut point (> 10% estimated ASCVD risk). In 2019, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued a guideline on the primary prevention of CVD that recommends low-dose aspirin might be considered for the primary prevention of ASCVD among select adults aged 40 to 70 years who are at higher ASCVD risk but not at increased risk for bleeding. Here, 2 experts discuss how to apply this guideline in general and to a patient in particular while answering the following questions: How do you assess ASCVD risk, and what is the role, if any, of the coronary artery calcium score?; At what risk threshold of benefits and harms would you recommend aspirin or not?; and How do you help a patient come to a decision about starting or stopping aspirin therapy?

### Do clinicians recommend aspirin to patients for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease? [^ce6f5057]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) released updated guidelines in 2009 recommending aspirin to prevent myocardial infarction among at-risk men and stroke among at-risk women.

Objective

Our aim was to examine clinician aspirin recommendation among eligible persons based on cardiovascular risk scores and USPSTF cutoffs.

Design

We used across-sectional analysis of a current nationally representative sample.

Participants

Participants were aged 40 years and older, and in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2011–2012).

Main Measures

We determined aspirin eligibility for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention for each participant based on reported and assessed cardiovascular risk factors. We assessed men's risk using a published coronary heart disease risk calculator based on Framingham equations, and used a similar calculator for stroke to assess risk for women. We applied the USPSTF risk cutoffs for sex and age that account for offsetting risk for gastrointestinal hemorrhage. We assessed clinician recommendation for aspirin based on participant report.

Results

Among men 45–79 years and women 55–79 years, 87% of men and 16% of women were potentially eligible for primary CVD aspirin prevention. Clinician recommendation rates for aspirin among those eligible were low, 34% for men and 42% for women. Rates were highest among diabetics (63%), those 65 to 79 years (52%) or those in poor health (44%). In contrast, aspirin recommendation rates were 76% for CVD secondary prevention. After accounting for patient factors, particularly age, eligibility for aspirin prevention was not significantly associated with receiving a clinician's recommendation for aspirin (AOR 0.99%; CI 0.7–1.4).

Conclusions

Despite an "A recommendation" from the USPSTF for aspirin for primary prevention of CVD, the majority of men and women potentially eligible for aspirin did not recall a clinical recommendation from their clinician.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: an update of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^43328d23]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are leading causes of death in the United States. In 2002, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommended that clinicians discuss aspirin with adults who are at increased risk for coronary heart disease.

Purpose

To determine the benefits and harms of taking aspirin for the primary prevention of myocardial infarctions, strokes, and death.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and Cochrane Library (search dates, 1 January 2001 to 28 August 2008), recent systematic reviews, reference lists of retrieved articles, and suggestions from experts.

Study Selection

English-language randomized, controlled trials (RCTs); case-control studies; meta-analyses; and systematic reviews of aspirin versus control for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were selected to answer the following questions: Does aspirin decrease coronary heart events, strokes, death from coronary heart events or stroke, or all-cause mortality in adults without known CVD? Does aspirin increase gastrointestinal bleeding or hemorrhagic strokes?

Data Extraction

All studies were reviewed, abstracted, and rated for quality by using predefined USPSTF criteria.

Data Synthesis

New evidence from 1 good-quality RCT, 1 good-quality meta-analysis, and 2 fair-quality subanalyses of RCTs demonstrates that aspirin use reduces the number of CVD events in patients without known CVD. Men in these studies experienced fewer myocardial infarctions and women experienced fewer ischemic strokes. Aspirin does not seem to affect CVD mortality or all-cause mortality in either men or women. The use of aspirin for primary prevention increases the risk for major bleeding events, primarily gastrointestinal bleeding events, in both men and women. Men have an increased risk for hemorrhagic strokes with aspirin use. A new RCT and meta-analysis suggest that the risk for hemorrhagic strokes in women is not statistically significantly increased.

Limitations

New evidence on aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD is limited. The dose of aspirin used in the RCTs varied, which prevented the estimation of the most appropriate dose for primary prevention. Several of the RCTs were conducted within populations of health professionals, which potentially limits generalizability.

Conclusion

Aspirin reduces the risk for myocardial infarction in men and strokes in women. Aspirin use increases the risk for serious bleeding events.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: advances in diagnosis and treatment [^38ac614c]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Clinical decision making regarding the appropriate use of aspirin for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events is complex, and requires an individualized benefit to risk assessment.

Objective

To review advances in the individualized assessment for ASCVD and bleeding risk, and to provide an update of the randomized clinical trial evidence that examined the use of aspirin for primary prevention (primarily for ASCVD, and secondarily for colorectal cancer). The recently released 2016 US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations are discussed, as well as the role of ASCVD risk, age, sex, and aspirin dose/formulation in clinical decision making.

Evidence Review

We performed a detailed review of peer-reviewed publications that were identified through searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database through 2016 using the literature search terms "aspirin", "primary prevention", "cardiovascular disease", "mortality", "cancer". Bibliographies from these references as well as meta-analyses of these randomized clinical trials were also reviewed.

Findings

Evidence from a total of 11 trials involving more than 118 000 patients is available to guide clinical decision making for aspirin use in the primary prevention of ASCVD. Clinicians should balance the benefit to risk ratio and the individual's preferences, calculating the 10-year ASCVD risk and evaluating risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding, to facilitate a safer and more personalized approach to appropriate selection of candidates for low-dose aspirin (75 to 81 mg/d) for the primary prevention of ASCVD, with secondary considerations for reducing colorectal cancer risk when taken for longer periods (> 10 years). Both the net ASCVD benefit and the bleeding risk of aspirin therapy increased as the absolute ASCVD risk increased, but the net benefits generally exceeded the risks at higher baseline ASCVD risk (≥ 10% ASCVD 10-year risk). The Aspirin-Guide is a clinical decision making support tool (app for mobile devices) with internal risk calculators to help clinicians with this dual assessment by calculating the ASCVD risk and the bleeding risk in the individual patient, and incorporating age- and sex-specific guidance based on randomized trial results.

Conclusions and Relevance

Balancing the benefit of ASCVD reduction with the risk of bleeding from low-dose aspirin is difficult but essential for informed decision making and achieving a net clinical benefit from aspirin for primary prevention. This is facilitated by a free and readily available evidence-based clinical decision support tool.

### Usefulness of aspirin for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^c7961121]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aspirin use in the prevention of cardiovascular events has been a mainstay of treatment for decades. However, the use of aspirin in primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has recently come under scrutiny. Several recent studies have evaluated the use of aspirin in primary prevention and the results suggest that in many patients the risks may outweigh the benefits. Closer examination of these trials suggests that the use of aspirin therapy for primary prevention may have a role but likely needs a more tailored approach and that caution is needed in prescribing aspirin for primary prevention. In conclusion, in this article we review the evolving evidence for aspirin in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

### Revisiting the role of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^ee3b497e]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is the cornerstone of the antithrombotic management of patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but major guidelines provide conflicting recommendations for its use in primary prevention. Findings from recent randomized trials totaling > 47000 patients called into question the net clinical benefits of aspirin in primary prevention for 3 key populations: patients with diabetes mellitus, community-dwelling elderly individuals, and patients without diabetes mellitus who are at intermediate risk for atherosclerotic events. In the context of increasing emphasis on the use of other treatments for primary prevention in patients with moderate-high future risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the efficacy and safety of aspirin for primary prevention has become uncertain. Key unresolved questions regarding the role of aspirin in primary prevention include the optimal drug formulation, dosing schedule, weight-based dose selection, and interplay between sex and treatment response. In the current era, most patients without established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease should not be prescribed aspirin. Rather, aggressive management of comorbidities tailored to the expected cardiovascular risk needs to be emphasized. In this context, informed shared decision making between clinicians and patients regarding the use of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events is a suitable and laudable approach. In this article, we revisit the role of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases by critically reviewing the key scientific literature, highlight key areas of uncertainties for future research, and propose a decisional framework for clinicians to support prescription of aspirin in primary prevention.

### Recent evidence examining efficacy and safety of aspirin for primary cardiovascular disease prevention [^d11b1707]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Data on aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are conflicting and changing as new trials are published on the subject.

Objective

To review recent data evaluating the efficacy and safety of aspirin for primary prevention of CVD.

Data Sources

Articles evaluating aspirin for primary prevention of CVD were gathered using a MEDLINE search with the keywords aspirin review, aspirin peripheral artery disease, aspirin stroke, aspirin coronary artery disease, aspirin diabetes, aspirin primary prophylaxis, and aspirin elderly. Primary literature published from January 2008 through November 2018 was reviewed. Additional references were identified from a review of citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized clinical trials that reported on aspirin for primary CVD prevention were included. In all, 10 publications met the inclusion criteria. The authors individually compared and contrasted the results from each publication.

Data Synthesis

The evidence for primary CVD prevention using aspirin varies widely. Previous analyses identified a benefit to aspirin use in certain populations, and current guidelines reflect this. However, new studies published in the past 10 years call the historically identified benefit of aspirin into question and force us to reexamine which patients, if any, are indicated for aspirin for primary prevention of CVD. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This review provides a thorough discussion on the evidence behind aspirin for primary prevention of CVD.

Conclusion

Based on current evidence, aspirin is not recommended for primary prevention of CVD.

### Aspirin in primary prevention: what changed? A critical appraisal of current evidence [^88380e84]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aspirin has been the mainstay of both secondary and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease for half a century. In 2018, 3 trials showed a modest reduction in cardiovascular outcomes that appeared counterbalanced by the risk of clinically significant bleeding. The latest ACC/AHA primary prevention guidelines downgraded their recommendation for aspirin use in primary prevention to that of physician preference. Despite the consistent and robust evidence previously supporting the use of aspirin in cardiovascular disease prevention, little discussion has been given to mechanisms or analytic explanations for this revision of recommendations. In this review, we explore 3 possible mechanisms that may have contributed to the alteration of our perception of aspirin's role in primary prevention. These include changes in the population potentially using aspirin in primary prevention, changes in cardiovascular disease and its presentation, and changes in aspirin itself. Here we present a translational look at knowledge gaps that should be addressed to better guide contemporary aspirin use in primary prevention. In conclusion, based on these considerations, the current recommendations might be improved by recalibration of the cardiovascular risk threshold above which aspirin should be recommended for primary prevention, including the incorporation of newer risk assessment modalities such as calcium scoring. A second enhancement would be developing a bleeding risk calculator to support clinicians' assessment of risk vs benefit. The use of enteric-coated aspirin vs noncoated aspirin should also be reassessed.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: a summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^c18e10a7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The use of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease events in patients without a history of cardiovascular disease is controversial.

Purpose

To examine the benefits and harms of aspirin chemoprevention.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966 to May 2001).

Study Selection

1) Randomized trials at least 1 year in duration that examined aspirin chemoprevention in patients without previously known cardiovascular disease and 2) systematic reviews, recent trials, and observational studies that examined rates of hemorrhagic strokes and gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to aspirin use.

Data Extraction

One reviewer read and extracted data from each included article and constructed evidence tables. A second reviewer checked the accuracy of the data extraction. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

Data Synthesis

Meta-analysis was performed, and the quantitative results of the review were then used to model the consequences of treating patients with different levels of baseline risk for coronary heart disease. Five trials examined the effect of aspirin on cardiovascular events in patients with no previous cardiovascular disease. For patients similar to those enrolled in the trials, aspirin reduces the risk for the combined end point of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease (summary odds ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.87]). Aspirin increased the risk for hemorrhagic strokes (summary odds ratio, 1.4 [CI, 0.9 to 2.0]) and major gastrointestinal bleeding (summary odds ratio, 1.7 [CI, 1.4 to 2.1]). All-cause mortality (summary odds ratio, 0.93 [CI, 0.84 to 1.02]) was not significantly affected. For 1000 patients with a 5% risk for coronary heart disease events over 5 years, aspirin would prevent 6 to 20 myocardial infarctions but would cause 0 to 2 hemorrhagic strokes and 2 to 4 major gastrointestinal bleeding events. For patients with a risk of 1% over 5 years, aspirin would prevent 1 to 4 myocardial infarctions but would cause 0 to 2 hemorrhagic strokes and 2 to 4 major gastrointestinal bleeding events.

Conclusions

The net benefit of aspirin increases with increasing cardiovascular risk. In the decision to use aspirin chemoprevention, the patient's cardiovascular risk and relative utility for the different clinical outcomes prevented or caused by aspirin use must be considered.

### Aspirin therapy in primary cardiovascular disease prevention: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology working group on thrombosis [^4be90980]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Although the use of oral anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists) has been abandoned in primary cardiovascular prevention due to lack of a favorable benefit-to-risk ratio, the indications for aspirin use in this setting continue to be a source of major debate, with major international guidelines providing conflicting recommendations. Here, we review the evidence in favor and against aspirin therapy in primary prevention based on the evidence accumulated so far, including recent data linking aspirin with cancer protection. While awaiting the results of several ongoing studies, we argue for a pragmatic approach to using low-dose aspirin in primary cardiovascular prevention and suggest its use in patients at high cardiovascular risk, defined as ≥ 2 major cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) projected per 100 person-years, who are not at increased risk of bleeding.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease? [^bbc7c0ce]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality.1 For example, in 2000, it accounted directly for around 2 million deaths in the European Union. Worldwide, many people take aspirin daily in the belief that doing so helps to prevent CVD. This approach is established for the secondary prevention of recurrent vascular events. However, there has been some uncertainty about the place of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.6 In particular, there have been doubts about whether any benefits of aspirin in people with no history of CVD outweigh the risks (e.g. the fact that long-term low-dose aspirin therapy almost doubles the likelihood of gastrointestinal haemorrhage). Here we consider the place of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention of CVD.

### The rise and fall of aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^2fe76394]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Aspirin is one of the most frequently used drugs worldwide and is generally considered effective for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. By contrast, the role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is controversial. Early trials evaluating aspirin for primary prevention, done before the turn of the millennium, suggested reductions in myocardial infarction and stroke (although not mortality), and an increased risk of bleeding. In an effort to balance the risks and benefits of aspirin, international guidelines on primary prevention of cardiovascular disease have typically recommended aspirin only when a substantial 10-year risk of cardiovascular events exists. However, in 2018, three large randomised clinical trials of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease showed little or no benefit and have even suggested net harm. In this narrative Review, we reappraise the role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, contextualising data from historical and contemporary trials.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in the 21Century: a review of the evidence [^c9be4b4e]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aspirin (ASA) is the most commonly prescribed antiplatelet agent. Although the evidence for efficacy of aspirin for secondary prevention of ischemic events in patients with established cardiovascular disease is strong, its role in primary prevention has been subject of controversies over the past decades. In fact, historical trials have shown only modest benefit in terms of reduction of ischemic events, mostly myocardial infarction and to a lesser extent stroke, and only at the expense of an increased risk of bleeding. These observations have led to divergent recommendations from professional societies on the use of ASA for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease manifestations. However, recent results from three trials of primary prevention have shown either no benefit or modest benefit on combined ischemic end points, without any impact on hard cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or stroke, accompanied by an increased risk of bleeding. Overall, this translated into neutral net benefit or even harm with the use of aspirin in patients with no overt cardiovascular disease. These results have accordingly led to a downgrade in the current recommendations on the use of ASA for primary prevention. This article provides an overview on the current evidence on the use of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Aspirin

Unlike secondary prevention, data regarding the use of aspirin in the primary prevention of ASCVD is equivocal. Most early data came from the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration, which evaluated 95 456 patients from 6 clinical trials. Treatment with aspirin was associated with a small reduction in serious vascular events but carried a small increase in the rates of major gastrointestinal and extracranial bleeding. More recently, other studies have called into question the value of aspirin in primary prevention. – Finding an appropriate balance between preventing vascular events and exposing individuals to an increased bleeding risk with aspirin therapy remains an area of active research.

Current ACC/AHA guidelines recommend the use of low‐dose aspirin for primary prevention, as listed in Table 3. Because guideline recommendations and data vary, –, treatment with aspirin should be individualized based on the patient's risk–benefit profile.

### Aspirin for primary prevention: a challenging decision [^5ae955ab]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a challenging issue for clinicians, patients, and health policy makers. Even with the availability of multiple randomized trials and several high‐quality systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, significant debate remains about which patients, if any, should be offered aspirin for primary prevention. – The main US guideline‐issuing organizations, including the US Preventive Services Task Force and the American Heart Association, have made recommendations in favor of aspirin use for primary prevention in people with increased CVD risk who are not at high risk for aspirin's adverse effects. – Others have recommended against aspirin use for most patients without a prior history of CVD events. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a statement reaffirming that "[it] has reviewed the available data and does not believe the evidence supports the general use of aspirin for primary prevention of a heart attack or stroke."

Much of the debate about aspirin's use for primary prevention centers on 2 key issues: (1) how to integrate information on potential benefits derived from multiple trials that were performed in heterogeneous populations, that used a range of doses of aspirin, and that were conducted in the context of differing availability of other effective interventions, such as statins; and (2) how to assess whether the potential benefits outweigh the known harms of aspirin, including gastrointestinal bleeding and, less commonly but more seriously, hemorrhagic stroke. Most analyses accept the general concept that aspirin will be more clearly indicated for people at higher CVD risk because even a modest reduction in relative risk of CVD events would offer net benefit after taking into account aspirin's effects on bleeding.

The potential stakes of the aspirin decision are enormous. Decisions about aspirin for primary prevention could apply to the more than 100 million US adults aged 40 to 75 years. CVD remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this age group and results in more than $200 billion in direct and indirect care costs. Cost‐effectiveness analyses have suggested that aspirin, if modestly effective for CVD prevention, could extend lives and reduce health care costs, particularly in higher‐risk patients. – An analysis by the Prevention Priorities Project ranks aspirin near the top of all preventive services in terms of cost‐effectiveness and ability to reduce burden of suffering. Alternatively, if the downsides of aspirin exceed its benefits (overall or in people below a certain level of CVD risk), widespread use could cause large amounts of morbidity and deflect health resources from better uses.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: time for a platelet-guided approach [^f4919421]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

Highlights

Aspirin is an antiplatelet therapy drug and has been shown to protect against atherothrombosis while increasing the risk of major bleeding.
The recent United States Preventive Services Task Force guidelines on aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease reflect this clinical tradeoff as well as the persistent struggle to define a population that would benefit from prophylactic aspirin therapy.
Reliable methods for quantifying platelet activity, including light transmission aggregometry and platelet transcriptomics, could be considered to identify individuals at elevated (platelet mediated) cardiovascular risk.
Clinical studies are needed to investigate whether a platelet-guided precision-based medicine approach will identify individuals who will benefit (eg, benefit > risk) with aspirin for the prevention of a first heart attack or stroke.

In October 2021, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued a draft statement updating its guidelines on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The USPSTF recommends the following: (1) low-dose aspirin should not be initiated for primary prevention in individuals ages 60 years or older, and (2) initiation of low-dose aspirin should be considered on an individualized basis in adults aged 40 to 59 years with a 10-year CVD risk of ≥ 10%. With the update, the USPSTF no longer recommends routine aspirin prescription for primary CVD prevention in any population, a position consistent with the most recent guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association, and the European Society of Cardiology. The shift reflects a longstanding struggle to identify a population in which aspirin's clinical benefit for primary CVD prevention exceeds its bleeding risk.

Table 1.
A summary of recent guidelines for aspirin for primary prevention

Although guidelines regarding aspirin use for primary prevention continue to become more conservative, the implementation of these guidelines as part of routine patient care remains uncertain. Overutilization of aspirin has been a long-recognized problem, suggesting a need for active intervention to improve guideline-concordant care. This is especially important because 25% to 45% of adults aged > 40 years use aspirin for primary prevention. Meta-analyses of the available data suggest that millions of patients may be at risk of net harm from unnecessary aspirin therapy.

To improve the appropriate use of aspirin for primary prevention, we sought to determine the prevalence and correlates of guideline-concordant aspirin use among adults in a community care setting now several years after the publication of the updated guidelines. Specifically, we examined patient characteristics, aspirin indications, prescribing physicians, and perceived risks and benefits.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^4c5b8280]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — aspirin prophylaxis recommendations and dosing — In recent trials, the estimated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk has exceeded observed risk during follow-up, supporting a lower class of recommendation with removal of a specific PCE threshold; accordingly, a Class IIb recommendation remains more suitable than a Class III recommendation for adults 40 to 70 years of age. Given the narrow balance of benefits and harms, there is limited justification to use aspirin at doses > 100 mg daily for primary prevention; meta-analyses suggest the ASCVD risk benefit for low-dose aspirin is equivalent to that for high-dose aspirin, but the bleeding risk is higher with high-dose aspirin, and low-dose prophylactic aspirin may be best justified among persons at high ASCVD risk who cannot achieve optimal control of other ASCVD risk factors.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^f4ab48b0]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF aspirin use for primary prevention — Implementation specifies to consider the patient's age. For adults aged 40 to 59 years, estimate CVD risk using a CVD risk estimator and, in patients whose estimated CVD risk is 10% or greater, use shared decision-making to inform the decision about initiating aspirin. For patients initiating aspirin use, it would be reasonable to use a dose of 81 mg/d. For adults 60 years or older, do not initiate aspirin for primary prevention of CVD. For potential discontinuation, for patients who are eligible and choose to start taking aspirin, the benefits become smaller with advancing age, and data suggest that clinicians and patients should consider stopping aspirin use around age 75 years.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^42288971]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: For adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use should be an individual one; evidence indicates that the net benefit of aspirin use in this group is small, and persons who are not at increased risk for bleeding and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily are more likely to benefit (C recommendation). For adults 60 years or older, the USPSTF recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD (D recommendation). The target population is adults 40 years or older without signs or symptoms of CVD or known CVD who are not at increased risk for bleeding. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk has a small net benefit, and concludes with moderate certainty that initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 60 years or older has no net benefit.

### Role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^da4688ce]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

The benefits of aspirin therapy for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease clearly outweigh the risks of bleeding, and low-dose aspirin is uniformly recommended in this setting. However, no clear consensus exists about whether, and if so in whom, aspirin therapy is appropriate for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Three trials of low-dose aspirin versus placebo in three populations at increased risk of myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke in the absence of established cardiovascular disease were reported in 2018. The ASPREE trial in elderly people was terminated early for futility because aspirin had no effect on disability-free survival but significantly increased the risk of major haemorrhage and, unexpectedly, all-cause mortality. In the ASCEND trial in patients with diabetes mellitus and no evidence of vascular disease, aspirin significantly reduced serious vascular events but increased major bleeding. In the ARRIVE trial in people with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease, aspirin had no effect on major cardiovascular events but increased gastrointestinal bleeding. The aim of this Review is to place these new results in the context of previous evidence on aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and to appraise whether the new evidence is likely to enable the more targeted use of aspirin in particular individuals for whom the net benefit is both clinically worthwhile and statistically definite.

### Potential impact of the 2019 ACC / AHA guidelines on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease recommendations on the inappropriate routine use of aspirin and aspirin use without a recommended indication for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in cardiology practices: insights from the NCDR PINNACLE registry [^83e21d4a]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Aspirin is recommended in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for secondary prevention. In patients without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and not at high 10-year risk, there is no evidence aspirin reduces adverse cardiovascular events and it could increase bleeding. The 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines on Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease state that aspirin may be considered for primary prevention (class IIb) in patients 40 to 70 years that are at higher risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and that routine use of aspirin should be avoided (class III:Harm) for patients > 70 years. We examined the frequency of patients on aspirin for primary prevention that would have been considered unindicated or potentially harmful per the recent guideline where aspirin discontinuation may be beneficial.

Methods

To assess the potential impact, within the National Cardiovascular Disease Registry Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence Registry, we assessed 855366 patients from 400 practices with encounters between January 1, 2018 and March 31, 2019, that were receiving aspirin for primary prevention. We defined inappropriate use as the use of aspirin in patients < 40 or > 70 years and use without a recommended indication as use of aspirin in patients 40 to 70 years with low, borderline, or intermediate 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. Frequency of inappropriate use and use without a recommended indication were calculated and practice-level variation was evaluated using the median rate ratio.

Results

Inappropriate use occurred in 27.6% (193674/701975) and use without a recommended indication in 26.0% (31810/122507) with significant practice-level variation in inappropriate use (predicted median practice-level rate 33.5%, interquartile range, 24.1% to 40.8%; median rate ratio, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.67–1.76]).

Conclusions

Immediately before the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines on Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease, over one-fourth of patients in this national registry were receiving aspirin for primary prevention inappropriately or without a recommended indication with significant practice-level variation. These findings help to determine the potential impact of guideline recommendations on contemporary use of aspirin for primary prevention.

### Effects of changing guidelines on prescribing aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events [^9b2c1e7a]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The use of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increasingly being questioned. Aspirin may not benefit this population and may increase the risk of major bleeding events. Data support aspirin use in patients with known CVD.

Methods

This is a secondary analysis of de-identified electronic health record (EHR) data from 131,050 individuals with known CVD or elevated risk for CVD as determined by diagnostic, demographic, and clinical data collected from 33 primary care practices in 11 different clinical organizations across 6 states. The percentage of the population of each cohort with aspirin recorded on their medication list, created through risk base analysis, was observed across 4 time periods.

Results

From 2007 to 2011, aspirin usage reflected in the EHR increased for the entire population and for each individual high-risk diagnosis. The percentage of the population initiating aspirin therapy for primary prevention within a year of diagnosis of CVD risk factors or CVD "equivalency" increased between 2007 and 2011. Among those with a new diagnosis of CVD, aspirin usage also steadily increased over the 4-year period, indicating no negative impact from new negative primary prevention studies.

Conclusions

Primary care clinicians have a central role in providing evidence-based preventive services and should integrate revised information into their practice to improve outcomes. Even with new evidence against the use of aspirin for primary prevention, it is difficult to change beliefs about the effectiveness and safety of aspirin, as reflected in the behavior of physicians and patients.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: a systematic evidence review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^2b33e247]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States.

Purpose

To update a systematic review about the benefits of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in adults aged 40 years or older and to evaluate effect modification in subpopulations.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 2008 to January 2015), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

Study Selection

Two investigators independently reviewed 3396 abstracts and 65 articles according to prespecified criteria. All included trials evaluated aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.

Data Extraction

Two investigators assessed study quality; data were abstracted by 1 reviewer and checked by a second.

Data Synthesis

Two good-quality and 9 fair-quality randomized, controlled trials were identified. In analyses of all doses, aspirin reduced the risk for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) (relative risk [RR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.87]) but not nonfatal stroke; aspirin showed little or no benefit for all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. Benefits began within the first 5 years. Older adults achieved greater relative MI reduction, but no other effect modifications were found in analyzed subpopulations. In trials with aspirin doses of 100 mg or less per day, the reduction in nonfatal MI benefit persisted (absolute risk reduction, 0.15 to 1.43 events per 1000 person-years) and a 14% reduction in nonfatal stroke benefit was noted, but no benefit was found for all-cause mortality (RR, 0.95 [CI, 0.89 to 1.01]) or cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.97 [CI, 0.85 to 1.10]).

Limitation

Evidence for aspirin in primary prevention is heterogeneous and limited by rare events and few credible subgroup analyses.

Conclusion

The beneficial effect of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD is modest and occurs at doses of 100 mg or less per day. Older adults seem to achieve a greater relative MI benefit.

### Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: current knowledge and future research needs [^af9edc47]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In secondary prevention, among a very wide range of survivors of prior occlusive cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and those suffering acute myocardial infarction (MI) or occlusive stroke, aspirin decreases risks of MI, stroke, and CVD death. In these high risk patients, the absolute benefits are large and absolute risks are far smaller so aspirin should be more widely prescribed. In contrast, in primary prevention, aspirin reduces risks of first MI but the evidence on stroke and CVD death remain inconclusive. Based on the current totality of evidence from predominantly low risk subjects where the absolute benefits is low and side effects the same as in secondary prevention, any decision to prescribe aspirin for primary prevention should be an individual clinical judgment by the healthcare provider that weighs the absolute benefit in reducing the risk of a first MI against the absolute risk of major bleeding. If the ongoing trials of intermediate risks subjects show net benefits then general guidelines may be justified with several caveats. First, any decision to use aspirin should continue to be made by the healthcare provider. Second, therapeutic lifestyle changes and other drugs of life saving benefit such as statins should be considered with aspirin as an adjunct, not alternative. The more widespread and appropriate use of aspirin in primary prevention is particularly attractive, especially in developing countries where CVD is emerging as the leading cause of death. In addition, aspirin is generally widely available over the counter and is extremely inexpensive.

### Low-dose aspirin in primary prevention: cardioprotection, chemoprevention, both, or neither? [^b2ea0e2a]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin has been shown to be effective in preventing about one-fifth of atherothrombotic vascular complications (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death) in a meta-analysis of 16 secondary prevention trials in patients with previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient cerebral ischaemia. This corresponds to an absolute reduction of about 10–20 per 1000 patients in the yearly incidence of non-fatal events, and to a smaller, but still definite, reduction in vascular death. Against this benefit, the absolute increase in major extracranial bleeding complications [mostly, gastrointestinal (GI)] is 20- to 50-fold smaller, depending on age and sex. Hence, for secondary prevention, the benefits of antiplatelet therapy substantially exceed the risks. For primary prevention, the balance between vascular events avoided and major bleeds caused by aspirin is substantially uncertain because the risks without aspirin, and hence the absolute benefits of antiplatelet prophylaxis, are at least an order of magnitude lower than in secondary prevention. The aim of this article is to review the updated evidence for the efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention and to discuss additional health benefits resulting from prolonged antiplatelet therapy in apparently healthy people at low average risk of vascular events.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in people with diabetes: a position statement of the American diabetes association, a scientific statement of the American Heart Association, and an expert consensus document of the American college of cardiology foundation [^e35f7508]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

In 2007, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the American Heart Association (AHA) jointly recommended that aspirin therapy (75–162 mg/day) be used as a primary prevention strategy in those with diabetes at increased cardiovascular risk, including those who are over 40 years of age or who have additional risk factors (family history of CVD, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or albuminuria). These recommendations were derived from several older trials that included relatively small numbers of patients with diabetes. Results of two recent randomized controlled trials of aspirin performed specifically in patients with diabetes raised questions about the efficacy of aspirin for primary prevention in diabetes.

Because of the scope of the problem of CVD in patients with diabetes and the conflicting evidence about the efficacy of aspirin for primary prevention in people with diabetes, the ADA, AHA, and the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) convened a group of experts to review and synthesize the available evidence and use this information to create updated recommendations. The group considered and organized this report around the following questions:
What is the evidence regarding aspirin to prevent initial cardiovascular events in people with diabetes?
How can we reconcile the results of the different primary prevention trials?
What are the risks of aspirin, and are these similar or different for people with diabetes compared to those without?
What do we know about the recommended dosage or dosage range?
How can we integrate potential benefits and risks of aspirin to determine which patients with diabetes should receive aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events?
What are the needs for future research?

### Guideline concordance of aspirin use for primary prevention in adult outpatients [^d889d643]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Aspirin has an established role in the secondary prevention of CVD, as the antithrombotic benefit is generally considered to be greater than the added risk of bleeding. The use of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD, however, has been a longstanding source of debate, with shifting perspectives over the years. Most recently in 2022, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended an individualized approach to aspirin initiation in patients aged 40 to 59, and against initiation in adults ≥ 60 years. These recommendations rely partially on modeling data that suggest a net harm when starting aspirin with advancing age. As the net benefit likely decreases in a similar way for patients who already take aspirin, data suggest that it is reasonable to consider stopping around age 75.

The recent USPSTF guidelines (2022) largely echo the 2019 recommendations from the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA), which recommend against using primary prevention aspirin on a routine basis for adults > 70 years old or those at increased risk of bleeding. They report that aspirin can be considered for adults aged 40 to 70 who have increased CVD risk but do not have increased bleeding risk. Both of these updated guidelines reflect findings from recent large, randomized control trials such as Aspirin to Reduce Risk of Initial Vascular Events, A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes, and Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly, which together suggest that the potential benefits of aspirin for primary prevention of CVD may be offset by increased bleeding. Both Raber et aland Khan et aleffectively summarize the trial data and meta-analyses that inform the latest aspirin guidelines. With significant advances in blood pressure control, smoking cessation, and lipid management, it is possible that there is a diminished role for primary prevention aspirin use in modern health care. Indeed, other international guidelines have come to similar conclusions on primary prevention aspirin use (Table 1).

### Contemporary primary prevention aspirin use by cardiovascular disease risk: impact of US preventive services task force recommendations, 2007–2015: a serial, cross-sectional study [^38874046]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. 1 Reductions in CVD morbidity and mortality have been achieved by reducing risk factor exposure with lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions, including use of aspirin. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 Aspirin has been demonstrated to prevent a first myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke among individuals at high risk 12, 13 and to be cost‐effective. 16, 17 It also decreases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events and death among individuals who have already experienced an MI or stroke. 14, 15

Regular aspirin use for primary prevention (PP) of CVD has been evaluated in multiple well‐designed clinical trials. In 1989, the Physician's Health Study reported a 44% reduction in risk of a first MI for male participants who received aspirin. 12 Regular aspirin use led to a 24% reduction in risk for ischemic stroke in women as demonstrated in the Women's Health Study in 2005. 13 These studies and others 18, 19, 20 led the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2009 to develop a class A recommendation for PP aspirin use in men aged 45 to 79 years and women aged 55 to 79 years for whom CVD ischemic event prevention outweighs bleeding risk. 21 This recommendation provided a distinctly favorable recommendation for aspirin use compared with the 2002 statement. The 2009 recommendation also offered specific benefit/risk guidance tables to facilitate the use of aspirin for PP, compared with the 2002 statement, which only recommended a discussion between clinicians and patients at increased risk for CVD ischemic events. Contemporary studies of PP aspirin use in low‐risk cohorts (eg, the Japanese Primary Prevention Project 22) have since demonstrated similar reductions in a first MI. A recent systematic review analyzed 11 PP aspirin trials completed in the past 3 decades. The meta‐analysis demonstrated a significant 22% reduction in nonfatal MI (relative risk, 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71–0.87). 23

Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

5. How can we integrate potential benefits and harms of aspirin to determine which patients with diabetes should or should not receive aspirin for the primary prevention of CV events?

Based on the currently available evidence, aspirin appears to have a modest effect on cardiovascular events (RR reduction of ∼10%), with the absolute decrease in events depending on the underlying CVD risk (those with higher baseline risk should have greater absolute benefit). The main adverse effects appear to be an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. The excess risk may be as high as 1–5 per 1,000 per year in real-world settings. In adults with CVD risk greater than 1% per year, the number of CVD events prevented will be similar to or greater than the number of bleeding events induced, although the events considered (MI, stroke, and gastrointestinal bleeding) do not have equal effects on long-term health. We have developed recommendations based on these data.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^fc023f96]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF aspirin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) states: For adults aged 40 to 59 years with an estimated 10% or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in this group should be an individual one (Grade: C). For adults 60 years or older, do not initiate aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD (Grade: D). This applies to adults 40 years or older without signs or symptoms of CVD or known CVD and who are not at increased risk for bleeding.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^24f32dd6]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF aspirin use for primary prevention — Updates and burden highlight that the USPSTF currently recommends considering initiating aspirin in persons with an estimated 10% or greater CVD risk at a younger age: 40 years instead of 50 years, and there is a new recommendation not to initiate aspirin in adults 60 years or older for primary prevention, while the evidence is unclear whether aspirin use reduces the risk of colorectal cancer incidence or mortality. The burden statement notes that CVD is the leading cause of mortality in the US, accounting for more than 1 in 4 deaths, and each year an estimated 605 000 Americans have a first heart attack and about 610 000 experience a first stroke.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^8ebb971d]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF aspirin for primary prevention — net benefit by age and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk: The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk has a small net benefit, and that initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 60 years or older has no net benefit. Adequate evidence indicates low-dose aspirin has a small benefit to reduce risk for cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke) in adults 40 years or older at increased CVD risk, with absolute benefit increasing with higher 10-year CVD risk and greater lifetime benefit when started at a younger age; however, aspirin increases the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and hemorrhagic stroke, with harms small overall but increasing in older age groups, particularly in adults older than 60 years.

### Aspirin with or without statin in Individuals without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across risk Categories [^73e59db8]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The role of aspirin in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains controversial. In 2019, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommended considering prophylactic low-dose aspirin only among asymptomatic individuals at high risk of ASCVD events, low bleeding risk, and age < 70 years (IIb). In 2021, the European Society of Cardiology primary prevention guidelines endorsed a similar recommendation. More recently, the updated United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2022 guidelines recommended individualizing low-dose aspirin only among adults aged 40 to 59 years, if their 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 10% and they have low bleeding risk (Class C). In contrast, the guidelines recommend against the use of aspirin among adults ≥ 60 years (Class D). These recommendations stem from a USPSTF meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials demonstrating a significant reduction in major ASCVD events with aspirin at the cost of higher rates of major bleeding.

Statin is used as first-line therapy for the primary prevention of ASCVD due to cardiovascular benefits. Most randomized evidence favoring aspirin in primary prevention was conducted in the pre-statin era, whereas statin therapy use was more frequent at baseline in recent trials. For instance, the proportion of participants on a statin in ASPREE (Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly), ARRIVE (Aspirin to Reduce Risk of Initial Vascular Events), and ASCEND (A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes)trials were 65%, 43%, and 75%, respectively. Since statin therapy would mitigate baseline ASCVD risk, lower cardiovascular effects of aspirin in post-statin era trials might be attributable to the higher use of statin therapy. Furthermore, given a much more favorable risk-benefit profile, most patients considered for ASCVD risk reduction in current clinical practice would be expected to be on baseline statin therapy before entertaining a decision on possible aspirin initiation.

Prior studies, did not explore the potential impact of statin therapy on the net risk/benefit ratio of aspirin therapy. Therefore, this meta-analysis investigated the relative and absolute effects of aspirin in adults without ASCVD, stratified by statin use across different ASCVD risks.

### Use of aspirin for primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention in the United States, 2011–2012 [^2f37b205]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. In 2010, CVDs killed over 700 000 Americans, and accounted for 29.4% of total deaths. Moreover, CVD accounts for a significant portion of the financial burden of medical care, costing > $312.6 billion in healthcare spending and lost productivity in 2010. Aspirin therapy is a prevention measure that can reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke, and is recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force to prevent heart attack and ischemic stroke. Aspirin is used as a primary prevention measure to aid in the prevention of a first occurrence of CVD. – It can also be used as a secondary prevention measure among individuals who have experienced a heart attack or stroke to prevent additional cardiovascular events. The American Heart Association recommends the use of low‐dose aspirin daily for people at high risk of a heart attack and regular use of low‐dose aspirin for heart attack survivors.

A variety of studies have examined whether individuals at risk of having a heart attack in the United States were taking aspirin. – However, many of these studies failed to ascertain whether a person was recommended to take aspirin by their physician or whether they were taking it on their own initiative. Thus, these studies may be not an accurate assessment of physician recommendations for aspirin use. Further, much of the past research has used various risk factors to determine whether people were at high risk of CVD, rather than using the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) as recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force in 2009, the 2010 American Diabetes Association/American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology recommendations, and the 2008 American College of Chest Physician guidelines.

Prevention of CVD events is particularly important, and understanding physician recommendations for aspirin therapy is critical for delivering quality health care. Our current understanding of who is being encouraged to take aspirin for CVD prevention is limited. We sought to evaluate patient use of aspirin and reported physician recommendations of aspirin therapy for CVD prevention, in a nationally representative sample.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^bf7fc85b]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the US, accounting for more than 1 in 4 deaths. Each year, an estimated 605 000 people in the US have a first myocardial infarction and an estimated 610 000 experience a first stroke.

Objective

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on the effectiveness of aspirin to reduce the risk of CVD events (myocardial infarction and stroke), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in persons without a history of CVD. The systematic review also investigated the effect of aspirin use on colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality in primary CVD prevention populations, as well as the harms (particularly bleeding) associated with aspirin use. The USPSTF also commissioned a microsimulation modeling study to assess the net balance of benefits and harms from aspirin use for primary prevention of CVD and CRC, stratified by age, sex, and CVD risk level.

Population

Adults 40 years or older without signs or symptoms of CVD or known CVD (including history of myocardial infarction or stroke) who are not at increased risk for bleeding (eg, no history of gastrointestinal ulcers, recent bleeding, other medical conditions, or use of medications that increase bleeding risk).

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk has a small net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 60 years or older has no net benefit.

Recommendation

The decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual one. Evidence indicates that the net benefit of aspirin use in this group is small. Persons who are not at increased risk for bleeding and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily are more likely to benefit. (C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults 60 years or older. (D recommendation).

### Aspirin for primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention as baseline risk increases: a meta-regression analysis [^16c279a3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Aspirin has long had a role in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); however, recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have challenged this practice. Despite this, aspirin is still commonly recommended for high-risk primary prevention. We tested the hypothesis that aspirin is more efficacious for the primary prevention of ASCVD as the baseline risk increases.

Methods

RCTs that compared aspirin with control for primary prevention and evaluated ASCVD (composite of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke) and major bleeding were included. Rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. A regression analysis was performed using the ASCVD event rate in the control arm of each RCT as the moderator.

Results

Twelve RCTs were identified with 963,829 patient-years of follow-up. Aspirin was associated with a reduction in ASCVD (4.7 vs 5.3 events per 1000 patient-years; RR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79–0.92). There was increased major bleeding among aspirin users (2.5 vs 1.8 events per 1000 patient-years; RR 1.41; 95% CI, 1.29–1.54). Regression analysis found no relationship between the log RR of ASCVD or major bleeding and rate of ASCVD in the control arm of each RCT.

Conclusion

Aspirin is associated with a reduction in ASCVD when used for primary prevention; however, it is unlikely to be clinically significant given the increase in bleeding. More importantly, aspirin's treatment effect does not increase as ASCVD risk increases, as many hypothesize. There is no suggestion from these data that use of aspirin for higher-risk primary prevention patients is beneficial.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing patients with and without diabetes [^266d7144]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The negative results of two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have challenged current guideline recommendations for using aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events among patients with diabetes. We therefore sought to determine if the effect of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events and mortality differs between patients with and without diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus since their inceptions until November 2008 for RCTs of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events. Blinded pairs of reviewers evaluated studies and extracted data. Random-effects meta-analysis and Bayesian logistic regression were used to estimate the ratios of relative risks (RRs) of outcomes of interest among patients with and without diabetes. A 95% CI that crosses 1.00 indicates that the effect of aspirin does not differ between patients with and without diabetes.

Results

Nine RCTs with moderate to high methodological quality contributed data to the analyses. The ratios of RRs comparing the benefit of aspirin among patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes for mortality, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke were 1.12 (95% CI 0.92–1.35), 1.19 (0.82–1.17), and 0.70 (0.25–1.97), respectively.

Conclusions

Whereas estimates of benefit among patients with diabetes remain imprecise, our analysis suggests that the relative benefit of aspirin is similar in patients with and without diabetes.

### Prevention. aspirin in primary prevention – good news and bad news [^89372398]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

The balance of benefits and risks of aspirin in primary prevention is far less clear than in secondary prevention; further data from randomized trials of individuals at intermediate cardiovascular risk are needed. Decisions about aspirin in primary prevention should be made on a case-by-case basis, and general guidelines are not justified.

### Aspirin in primary prevention: It is time to start stepping away [^51b93c13]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is one of the most widely used drugs in medicine. While the benefits in secondary prevention have long been clear, the risk-benefit calculus in primary prevention is far less straightforward. Several randomized controlled trials conducted in the 1980s and 1990s showed cardiovascular benefits of aspirin in primary prevention, but more recent studies have called this benefit into question. One potential explanation for this discrepancy is that in the more recent era of statin therapy for primary prevention, the absolute risk of the population — and therefore, the absolute benefit of aspirin — has been reduced. Understanding the impact of aspirin therapy in patients on concomitant statins is highly relevant to current clinical practice and yet has been underexplored.

In this issue of JACC: Advances, Khan et aladdress this important question by assessing the impact of aspirin with and without statin therapy in patients without known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The authors performed a meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials of aspirin (at least 75 mg every other day) in adults without ASCVD. The primary outcomes were fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) and major bleeding requiring transfusion or hospitalization or leading to death. These outcomes were assessed in patients at various ASCVD risk categories based on the Cholesterol treatment Trialist's Collaboration framework, ranging from very low risk of an event (< 5%) to very high risk (≥ 30%).

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in people with diabetes: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^34cb1f30]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Aspirin is recommended by key guideline agencies for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in people with diabetes, although with some inconsistencies (see web extra on bmj.com). Existing recommendations are primarily based on indirect evidence extrapolated from large trials of populations at high risk of cardiovascular events. Evidence supporting the efficacy of aspirin therapy in trials of only people with diabetes is scant. A previous meta-analysis (287 trials, 135 000 participants) on the efficacy of antiplatelet therapy in the prevention of major cardiovascular events found a clear benefit of aspirin overall, but no statistically significant benefit in the subgroup of only people with diabetes (nine trials, 5126 participants). No significant reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events with low dose aspirin compared with placebo was found in three additional trials published after that meta-analysis.

Reactions of many in the scientific and clinical community to the results of the most recent trials have been mixed, some arguing for definite proof on the lack of aspirin's efficacy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events, others raising claims that data are still inconclusive and more trials are warranted. The persisting uncertainties form the basis of our meta-analysis of trials on the benefits and harms of aspirin in people with diabetes and no pre-existing cardiovascular disease.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis with a particular focus on subgroups [^dc35986b]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In the general population, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's guideline recommends aspirin for patients based on age and prediction tools such as the 10-year cardiovascular disease calculator. Importantly, these recommendations are given with a moderate evidence level (B and C). The 2019 ACC/AHA guidelines acknowledge the controversy of aspirin in primary prevention of CVD, but state that aspirin might be considered in selected adults aged 40 to 70 who are at higher CV risk but at no increased bleeding risk. Additionally, two cost-utility analyses suggest a clear benefit of aspirin. However, the ESC guidelines on CVD prevention do not recommend the general use of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Limitations

The main limitation is that some studies did not differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. In such cases, the total of "all strokes" was included. The primary endpoint and follow-up periods also differed between some studies; we have adjusted for this in the sensitivity analyses. Another limitation of this meta-analysis was the use of heterogeneous definitions of major bleeding. One study used the GUSTO bleeding classification; most others used a prespecified composite of bleeding events such as GI bleeding and major extracranial bleeding and defined their severity by hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, surgery, transfusion requirement, or fatality. The severity and definition of GI bleeding events were often not further detailed.

Furthermore, some trials included in our meta-analysis were performed several decades ago. Since then, there may have been changes in medical standards, the prevalence of risk factors, and access to early diagnostic services.

### Contemporary primary prevention aspirin use by cardiovascular disease risk: impact of US preventive services task force recommendations, 2007–2015: a serial, cross-sectional study [^cb4432de]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Appropriate Aspirin Use

Aspirin use is effective in preventing first heart attacks and strokes, although at the cost of an increased risk of bleeding events. A 2012 meta‐analysis of the net benefit of aspirin to prevent vascular events reported a 31% excess in nontrivial bleeding (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.14–1.50). 42 Yet, there is not an identical health impact of a heart attack or stroke and a reversible, nonfatal bleeding event. Thus, "appropriate aspirin use" could be defined as prescription of aspirin to prevent a first cardiovascular ischemic event, when benefit is greater than risk, as informed by patient preferences. To achieve this clinical goal requires thoughtful discussion by an informed clinician who engages an informed "at‐risk" patient, on the individual level.

Clinicians may be concerned about "inappropriate" aspirin use in populations with low CVD risk. 43 In this study, 41% of individuals with a 10‐year CVD risk of < 10% used aspirin and 33% of those with CVD risk < 5% used aspirin. This high prevalence of aspirin use may reflect a lack of consensus on which patients might benefit from aspirin use as reflected by the differing recommendations released by various guideline committees. The 2009 recommendations used different risk thresholds based on age and sex, thus many people with 5% to 10% risk would have met the qualifications for aspirin use. Interestingly, the pattern of aspirin use in the group with 5% to 10% risk was the same as the other risk categories, with a slight decline in aspirin use during the years following the 2009 recommendations. These methods are unable to account for people taking aspirin for pain relief or any other noncardiovascular indication. It also cannot assess individual preference when ascribing value to CVD prevention versus bleeding risk. Thus, it is not possible to discern whether such use in low CVD risk populations is "inappropriate."

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^fa93a606]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF recommendation update — primary prevention aspirin in adults states that the USPSTF recommends that the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual one and recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults 60 years or older. The USPSTF concluded that the evidence is inadequate that low-dose aspirin use reduces CRC incidence or mortality.

### A statin a day to keep the doctor away? Comparing aspirin and statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^e09ae1f2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

For the primary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) disease, aspirin reduces the risk for major vascular events by approximately 15% to 20% with an absolute reduction of approximately 0.1%. Major bleeding occurs at an excess of approximately 2 cases per 1000 patient-years with aspirin therapy. For primary prevention, statin therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of CV events by approximately 30% to 40% with an absolute reduction of 1% to 2%. Rhabdomyolysis is rare, with an incidence of 3.4 cases per 100 000 patient-years. Compared with aspirin, statins have a more favorable risk-to-benefit profile for primary prevention.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: time for a platelet-guided approach [^0e1a4753]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The new USPSTF recommendations are important as guidelines for clinical decision-making and a formalized reflection of the multi-decade struggle to define the role of aspirin in primary CVD prevention. Traditional platelet-agnostic trial design methods have repeatedly failed to refine clinical practice while the burden of CVD is persistent. Thus, a new model for the study of aspirin in primary CVD prevention is needed. A platelet-focused approach appears prudent given the centrality of platelets in CVD pathogenesis, thrombosis, and hemostasis, aspirin's well-characterized antiplatelet mechanism, and the successful adoption of biomarker-led approaches in other areas of CVD prevention. Shifting to this new model will require well-designed trials to prospectively investigate the associations between baseline platelet phenotype, CV risk factors, low-dose aspirin therapy, and longitudinal clinical outcomes. We are optimistic that, in the near future, we will use precision-guided antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of a first heart attack or stroke.

### Cost-effectiveness of a statewide campaign to promote aspirin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^4095aa7a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, are the leading causes of disability and death in the United States. 1 In 2010, these 2 conditions accounted for 29.4% of total deaths. 2 The economic consequences of CVD are immense, with estimated annual costs of $315 billion in 2010, including $193 billion in direct medical care spending and $122 billion in lost future productivity. 3 In 2009–2010, about 47% of US adults had at least 1 of 3 risk factors for CVD, including uncontrolled high blood pressure, uncontrolled high cholesterol, or current smoking. 4 Prevalence of CVD risk factors and cardiovascular health also exhibit considerable variation across the United States, 5 suggesting potential value from implementing geographically targeted prevention strategies.

Primary prevention interventions aim to reduce the likelihood of initial cardiovascular ischemic events. Such efforts typically include programs and policies to decrease risk factor exposure. Successful examples include smoking cessation programs and increased use of hypertension and cholesterol‐lowering medications. 6, 7 One effective evidence‐based primary prevention approach is based on use of low‐dose aspirin as a targeted pharmacologic risk‐reduction intervention. Demonstration of the efficacy of aspirin for primary prevention of CVD was achieved in a series of large randomized clinical trials. 8, 9 In a meta‐analysis of primary prevention trials, there was a 12% relative risk (RR) reduction in nonfatal cardiovascular events achieved with aspirin use among healthy adults. 10 A substantial 50% reduction in first myocardial infarctions was documented within the most recent Japanese Primary Prevention Project. 11

In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended increased aspirin use to improve the primary prevention of CVD events in men 45 to 79 years old and women 55 to 79 years old in whom benefit outweighs risk. 12 The low‐dose aspirin recommendation was reinforced by inclusion in the American Heart Association's primary prevention guidelines, 13, 14 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Healthy People 2020 plan, 15 and recently, as part of the "Million Hearts" initiative of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 16 To date, these recommendations have not been actively included in most national or regional prevention efforts. Thus, a major clinical care gap exists in the use of aspirin for primary prevention. 17, 18, 19

### USPSTF updates recommendation on aspirin to prevent… [^441f86fa]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Based on a review of the evidence, the task force said whether to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults ages 40 to 59 years with a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual decision. The task force also said current evidence indicates that the net benefit of aspirin use in this population is small, and that the people most likely to benefit are those who are not at increased risk for bleeding and are willing to take low-dose aspirin on a daily basis. This is a "C" recommendation. The final recommendation replaces and markedly differs from the task force's previous recommendation statement on the topic, which was published in April 2016.

In the 2016 statement, the USPSTF recommended initiating low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD and colorectal cancer in adults ages 50 to 59 who had a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk, were not at increased risk for bleeding, had a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and were willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years. The task force also stated that the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and colorectal cancer in adults ages 60 to 69 with a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual one; that individuals in this group who were not at increased risk for bleeding, had a life expectancy of at least 10 years and were willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years were more likely to benefit; and that people who placed a higher value on the potential benefits than the potential harms might choose to initiate low-dose aspirin.

A draft version of the recommendation statement was posted on the USPSTF website for public comment from Oct. 12, 2021, to Nov. 8, 2021. In response to numerous comments, the task force emphasized that the focus of the recommendation is the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD, not other indications. The task force also reiterated that the recommendation only applies to people who do not have a history of CVD, signs or symptoms of CVD, or other conditions for which aspirins may be indicated. People who are currently taking aspirin and have questions about why they are taking it and whether to continue or discontinue aspirin use are strongly encouraged to discuss these questions with their clinician; people currently taking aspirin should.

### Association of aspirin use for primary prevention with cardiovascular events and bleeding events: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^df14b899]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The role for aspirin in cardiovascular primary prevention remains controversial, with potential benefits limited by an increased bleeding risk.

Objective

To assess the association of aspirin use for primary prevention with cardiovascular events and bleeding.

Data Sources

PubMed and Embase were searched on Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials from the earliest available date through November 1, 2018.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials enrolling at least 1000 participants with no known cardiovascular disease and a follow-up of at least 12 months were included. Included studies compared aspirin use with no aspirin (placebo or no treatment).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were screened and extracted independently by both investigators. Bayesian and frequentist meta-analyses were performed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary cardiovascular outcome was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The primary bleeding outcome was any major bleeding (defined by the individual studies).

Results

A total of 13 trials randomizing 164 225 participants with 1 050 511 participant-years of follow-up were included. The median age of trial participants was 62 years (range, 53–74), 77 501 (47%) were men, 30 361 (19%) had diabetes, and the median baseline risk of the primary cardiovascular outcome was 9.2% (range, 2.6%-15.9%). Aspirin use was associated with significant reductions in the composite cardiovascular outcome compared with no aspirin (57.1 per 10 000 participant-years with aspirin and 61.4 per 10 000 participant-years with no aspirin) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89 [95% credible interval, 0.84–0.95]; absolute risk reduction, 0.38% [95% CI, 0.20%-0.55%]; number needed to treat, 265). Aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding events compared with no aspirin (23.1 per 10 000 participant-years with aspirin and 16.4 per 10 000 participant-years with no aspirin) (HR, 1.43 [95% credible interval, 1.30–1.56]; absolute risk increase, 0.47% [95% CI, 0.34%-0.62%]; number needed to harm, 210).

Conclusions and Relevance

The use of aspirin in individuals without cardiovascular disease was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events and an increased risk of major bleeding. This information may inform discussions with patients about aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events and bleeding.

### Primary care providers should prescribe aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease based on benefit-risk ratio, not age [^46055ffa]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent guidelines restricted aspirin (ASA) in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) to patients < 70 years old and more recent guidance to < 60. In the most comprehensive prior meta-analysis, the Antithrombotic Trialists Collaboration reported a significant 12% reduction in CVD with similar benefit-risk ratios at older ages. Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, four trials were added to an updated meta-analysis. ASA produced a statistically significant 13% reduction in CVD with 95% confidence limits (0.83 to 0.92) with similar benefits at older ages in each of the trials. Primary care providers should make individual decisions whether to prescribe ASA based on benefit-risk ratio, not simply age. When the absolute risk of CVD is > 10%, benefits of ASA will generally outweigh risks of significant bleeding. ASA should be considered only after implementation of therapeutic lifestyle changes and other drugs of proven benefit such as statins, which are, at the very least, additive to ASA. Our perspective is that individual clinical judgements by primary care providers about prescription of ASA in primary prevention of CVD should be based on our evidence-based solution of weighing all the absolute benefits and risks rather than age. This strategy would do far more good for far more patients as well as far more good than harm in both developed and developing countries. This new and novel strategy for primary care providers to consider in prescribing ASA in primary prevention of CVD is the same as the general approach suggested by Professor Geoffrey Rose decades ago.

### Primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^e8eef82b]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This guideline focuses on long-term administration of antithrombotic drugs designed for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, including two new antiplatelet therapies.

Methods

The methods of this guideline follow those described in Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines in this supplement.

Results

We present 23 recommendations for pertinent clinical questions. For primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, we suggest low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/d) in patients aged > 50 years over no aspirin therapy (Grade 2B). For patients with established coronary artery disease, defined as patients 1-year post-acute coronary syndrome, with prior revascularization, coronary stenoses > 50% by coronary angiogram, and/or evidence for cardiac ischemia on diagnostic testing, we recommend long-term low-dose aspirin or clopidogrel (75 mg/d) (Grade 1A). For patients with acute coronary syndromes who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement, we recommend for the first year dual antiplatelet therapy with low-dose aspirin in combination with ticagrelor 90 mg bid, clopidogrel 75 mg/d, or prasugrel 10 mg/d over single antiplatelet therapy (Grade 1B). For patients undergoing elective PCI with stent placement, we recommend aspirin (75–325 mg/d) and clopidogrel for a minimum duration of 1 month (bare-metal stents) or 3 to 6 months (drug-eluting stents) (Grade 1A). We suggest continuing low-dose aspirin plus clopidogrel for 12 months for all stents (Grade 2C). Thereafter, we recommend single antiplatelet therapy over continuation of dual antiplatelet therapy (Grade 1B).

Conclusions

Recommendations continue to favor single antiplatelet therapy for patients with established coronary artery disease. For patients with acute coronary syndromes or undergoing elective PCI with stent placement, dual antiplatelet therapy for up to 1 year is warranted.

### Use of aspirin for primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention in the United States, 2011–2012 [^41da2ef2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, patients report nonideal rates of being recommended to take aspirin. High‐risk patients who are not receiving the recommendation are put at increased risk of CVD events. Low‐risk patients are exposed to adverse risk with unnecessary use of aspirin based upon a physician's recommendation. It is clear that quality of care for primary prevention falls far short of ideal. Further research on clinical decision support systems and interventions designed to reinforce the use of appropriate risk calculation is necessary to ensure that patients receive appropriate preventive care.

### Aspirin for primary prevention: a challenging decision [^12576d66]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

The findings of Mainous and colleagues suggest that recommendations about aspirin use for primary prevention continue to vary considerably and do not necessarily reflect a clear risk‐based approach, at least based on the thresholds examined. Given the lack of consensus in the recommendations about who should be offered aspirin, this is not surprising.

Several limitations preclude a deeper understanding of decision making about aspirin in this sample. First, the investigators did not have access to information about some elements of medical history (eg, prior gastrointestinal bleeding) or current medication use that would help define each person's bleeding risk and potentially affect net benefit determination. Similarly, we do not know whether the risk of adverse effects was discussed; prior work suggests that such information often is not discussed in encounters about preventive care. Second, the decision to create only 2 risk groups makes it unclear whether aspirin use in the lower risk group is in a range of risk that would be a "close call" (in which case patient preference–based decision making is indicated) or whether they are at such low risk that aspirin use represents "overuse" that should be actively discouraged. Finally, we do not know whether the respondents' use (or nonuse) was informed and preference concordant; such information is necessary to evaluate the quality of decision making overall.

Despite these limitations, the analysis by Mainous and colleagues presents the most up‐to‐date analysis of aspirin use for primary prevention and suggests, at least indirectly, the need for better decision‐making processes. Given the uncertainty about aspirin's effects and the differences in how people may assess the beneficial and adverse consequences of aspirin use, providers and patients should routinely discuss aspirin use within the context of an overall strategy for CVD prevention that is tailored to the patient's CVD risk. Such discussions should include (quantitative) information on the potential benefits (prevention of CVD events) and harms (mainly gastrointestinal bleeding) of aspirin. Patients should be offered the opportunity to express their values and preferences about the potential outcomes, and a mutual decision should be reached with the understanding that it can, and should be, revisited periodically. Decision aids are available to assist with such discussions and have been shown to be effective in helping patients reach informed decisions.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: time for a platelet-guided approach [^1cc33bec]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

Alternative Approaches to Primary CVD Prevention

The recent USPSTF update on aspirin use, which reflects the evidence to date and is in line with guidelines from major national and international heart societies, suggests either (1) aspirin should have no regular role in primary CVD prevention, or (2) we must adopt a new approach to identify individuals who will benefit from prophylactic aspirin use. Given aspirin's favorable antithrombotic properties, we advocate for the latter proposition and point to the paradigm guiding use of other primary CVD prevention therapies as a model for future aspirin use (Figure 2). Antihypertensives are recommended for primary CVD prevention when hypertension is diagnosed in conjunction with elevated CVD risk. The dosing and number of antihypertensives are titrated to achieve a blood pressure goal, reflecting evidence that blood pressure level and CVD risk are directly correlated. In short, the initiation and titration of antihypertensive therapy are guided by the measurement of a biomarker, blood pressure, with direct relevance to the medication's mechanism of action. While guidelines for primary CVD prevention with statins are more complex, they remain closely linked to a relevant biomarker, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). Indications for statin initiation emphasize LDL-C level, age, diabetes, or familial hypercholesterolemia, CVD risk, and other risk-enhancing factors. Even when therapy is initiated absent an LDL-C trigger, the regimen may be guided by serial LDL-C measurements, reflecting evidence that the net value of LDL-C lowering increases with the degree of reduction. Moreover, the favorable safety profile of statins means that they are typically of net value in individuals at even moderate CVD risk.

Figure 2.
Approaches to pharmacological primary cardiovascular disease prevention. Primary preventive antihypertensive and statin therapy are prescribed after a cardiovascular risk assessment and the measurement of a biomarker related to the drug class's primary mechanism of action. In contrast, primary preventive aspirin therapy is prescribed after cardiovascular risk assessment alone and is not guided by any related biomarker. CV indicates cardiovascular; and LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

In contrast, guidelines directing the use of aspirin for primary CVD prevention do not consider a mechanism-related biomarker. This is as previous primary CVD prevention trials of aspirin therapy enrolled subjects based on age alone or age and CVD risk and did not use measures of platelet activity. The absence of a platelet biomarker in these trials is notable, as both the risk (excess bleeding) and benefit (protection against thrombosis) of aspirin reflect the drug's platelet-inhibitory effects. Though the measurement of platelet activity in response to P2Y 12 inhibition among individuals on dual antiplatelet therapy (P2Y 12 inhibitor and aspirin) did not improve clinical outcomes in prospective randomized secondary prevention trials, studies were limited by analyzing only ADP-induced platelet activity and small sample size with inadequate power. We propose a different approaching — measuring the platelet phenotype at baseline to identify individuals at particular risk for platelet-mediated events, for example, MI and stroke. It stands to reason that adding this measurement of baseline platelet activity to traditional CV risk assessment may be the key to developing better aspirin use practices. This leads to the question of how best to measure platelet activity.

Conclusions

In response to recent trials, aspirin use has decreased for primary prevention, both among older adults as advised by guideline changes, but also younger adults at elevated risk, which needs further study. Aspirin use for secondary prevention also reduced which needs to be evaluated in the context of P2Y12 use. Physicians must continually ensure their patients are informed and on appropriate prevention regimens.

### Aspirin for primary prevention-time to rethink our approach… [^55512715]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Thus, early guidelines recommended low-dose aspirin only for individuals with high CVD risk when the benefit would exceed the risk. Over time, larger trials investigating the benefit vs risk of low-dose aspirin were designed in individuals with higher CVD risk, including older adults, individuals with diabetes, and individuals with subclinical CVD. 4 Despite the enrollment of individuals with higher risk, the results were consistent: the clinical benefit of aspirin was marginal and, in most individuals, the benefit was offset by the excess risk of bleeding. Based on cumulative data, the US Preventive Services Task Force updated its 2016 recommendations on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD.

5 The 2022 USPSTF recommendations6-8 suggest that the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD in adults ages 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual one, and recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults aged 60 years or older. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association recommend that low-dose aspirin use might be considered for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic CVD among select adults ages 40 to 70 years at higher CVD risk but not at increased risk of bleeding. 1 Low-dose aspirin use is not recommended on a routine basis for primary prevention of CVD in adults older than 70 years, or among adults of any age who are at increased risk of bleeding.

The European Society of Cardiology suggests that among individuals at very high CVD risk, low-dose aspirin may be considered for primary prevention. 9 The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on aspirin use.
10. A precision medicine approach holds promise to improve the identification of individuals who may benefit from the use of aspirin for primary prevention of CVD. Pharmacologic therapy traditionally used for primary prevention consists of lipid-lowering therapy with statins, blood pressure–lowering therapy, glucose-lowering therapy, and antiplatelet therapy with aspirin. 1 Traditionally, statins are recommended for the primary prevention of CVD in individuals with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels or those determined to be at sufficient CVD risk after a patient-clinician risk discussion.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis with a particular focus on subgroups [^bff5769f]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acetylsalicylic acid (commonly referred to as "aspirin") is an antithrombotic agent that inhibits platelets by irreversibly acetylating the serine residue of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) in platelets with subsequently reduced levels of prothrombotic thromboxane A 2 (TxA 2). In patients with known cardiovascular disease (CVD), the potential for aspirin to reduce further cardiovascular (CV) events significantly outweighs the risks of major bleeding and thus aspirin has since become a mainstay in secondary prevention of CVD. However, in primary prevention, its role is still under debate. This is due to an as yet unclear balance between the benefits and risks of aspirin treatment in patients without a diagnosed atherosclerotic disease.

Previously published meta-analyses have indicated that aspirin significantly reduced myocardial infarction (MI) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) without an impact on stroke and CV- or all-cause death. Furthermore, an increased risk of major bleeding events under aspirin strongly outweighed the benefits of aspirin treatment in primary prevention. As a result, the current guidelines on CVD prevention from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) do not recommend antiplatelet therapy in patients free of overt CVD. On the contrary, the recently published 2019 ACC/AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease states that aspirin might be considered in selected adults aged 40 to 70 who are at higher CV risk but at no increased bleeding risk. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends initiation of aspirin treatment depending on age and 10-year CVD risk.

Recently, three major trials (ARRIVE, ASCEND, and ASPREE) evaluating the use of aspirin in primary prevention of CVD were published. The ARRIVE trial enrolled patients with moderate to high cardiovascular risk, the ASCEND trial patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) only, and the ASPREE trial elderly patients. Only the ASCEND trial showed a significant reduction in the rate of major adverse CV events, but the effect was, once again, accompanied by a significant increase in major bleeding. Using the three recently published trials, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis with a particular focus on subgroups in order to potentially characterize patient populations with a more favorable benefit-risk ratio.

### The primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^f9191aa4]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

The following chapter devoted to antithrombotic therapy for chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see the "Grades of Recommendation" chapter by Guyatt et al in this supplement, CHEST 2008; 133[suppl]:123S-131S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE)-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) we recommend daily oral aspirin (75–100 mg) [Grade 1A]. For patients with an aspirin allergy, we recommend clopidogrel, 75 mg/d (Grade 1A). For patients who have received clopidogrel and are scheduled for coronary bypass surgery, we suggest discontinuing clopidogrel for 5 days prior to the scheduled surgery (Grade 2A). For patients after myocardial infarction, after ACS, and those with stable CAD and patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), we recommend daily aspirin (75–100 mg) as indefinite therapy (Grade 1A). We recommend clopidogrel in combination with aspirin for patients experiencing ST-segment elevation (STE) and NSTE-ACS (Grade 1A). For patients with contraindications to aspirin, we recommend clopidogrel as monotherapy (Grade 1A). For long-term treatment after PCI in patients who receive antithrombotic agents such as clopidogrel or warfarin, we recommend aspirin (75 to 100 mg/d) [Grade 1B]. For patients who undergo bare metal stent placement, we recommend the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel for at least 4 weeks (Grade 1A). We recommend that patients receiving drug-eluting stents (DES) receive aspirin (325 mg/d for 3 months followed by 75–100 mg/d) and clopidogrel 75 mg/d for a minimum of 12 months (Grade 2B). For primary prevention in patients with moderate risk for a coronary event, we recommend aspirin, 75–100 mg/d, over either no antithrombotic therapy or vitamin K antagonist (Grade 1A).

Conclusions

PP aspirin use did not temporally increase in a large primary care population following the release of the 2009 USPSTF recommendations. Aspirin use was observed to increase with CVD risk and is highly prevalent in a high‐risk population but may be underused in those with a 10% to 20% 10‐year risk of CVD. As the 2016 USPSTF aspirin PP recommendations are considered for national dissemination, specific interventions to inform patients and health professionals should be implemented in primary care settings to improve PP aspirin use.

### Aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular… [^7f4fe3b9]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Overall, the USPSTF determined that the greatest net benefit to be gained is by adults aged 50 to 59 years whose 10-year CVD risk is 10% or greater. The USPSTF recommends that persons in this age and risk group start taking aspirin. Adults aged 60 to 69 years may also benefit from starting aspirin use, although the net benefit is smaller due to the increased risk for GI bleeding and decreased benefit in CRC prevention in this age group. TREATMENT AND DOSAGE The optimal dose of aspirin to prevent CVD events is not known. Primary prevention trials have demonstrated benefits with various regimens, including doses of 75 and 100 mg per day and 100 and 325 mg every other day. A dose of 75 mg per day seems as effective as higher doses. The risk for GI bleeding may increase with the dosage. A pragmatic approach consistent with the evidence is to prescribe 81 mg per day, which is the most commonly prescribed dose in the United States.

Although the optimal timing and frequency of discussions about aspirin therapy are unknown, a reasonable approach may be to assess CVD and bleeding risk factors starting at age 50 years and periodically thereafter, as well as when CVD and bleeding risk factors are first detected or change. SUGGESTIONS FOR PRACTICE REGARDING THE I STATEMENTS Potential Preventable Burden. Evidence from primary prevention trials on the benefits of initiating aspirin use in adults younger than 50 years is limited. The potential benefit is probably lower than in adults aged 50 to 69 years because the risk for CVD events is lower. 8 Adults younger than 50 years who have an increased 10-year CVD risk may gain significant benefit from aspirin use; how much benefit is uncertain. Evidence on the benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use in older adults is limited.

Many adults aged 70 years or older are at increased risk for CVD because of their age. They have a high incidence of MI and stroke; thus, the potential benefit of aspirin could be substantial. Current Practice. Nearly 40% of U. S. adults older than 50 years use aspirin for the primary or secondary prevention of CVD. 5 A study of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data assessed how common aspirin use is for the primary prevention of CVD and whether physicians recommend it or patients start it on their own.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in people with diabetes: a position statement of the American diabetes association, a scientific statement of the American Heart Association, and an expert consensus document of the American college of cardiology foundation [^87d46d5f]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The effect of aspirin for primary prevention of CVD events in adults with diabetes is currently unclear. Trials to date have reached mixed results, but overall suggest that aspirin modestly reduces risk of cardiovascular events. More research is needed to better define the specific effects of aspirin in diabetes, including any sex-specific differences. For now, we recommend the following:
Low-dose (75–162 mg/day) aspirin use for prevention is reasonable for adults with diabetes and no previous history of vascular disease who are at increased CVD risk (10 year risk of CVD events over 10%) and who are not at increased risk for bleeding (based on a history of previous gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer disease or concurrent use of other medications that increase bleeding risk, such as NSAIDS or warfarin). Those adults with diabetes at increased CVD risk include most men over age 50 years and women over age 60 years who have one or more of the following additional major risk factors: smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, family history of premature CVD, and albuminuria. (ACCF/AHA Class IIa, Level of Evidence B) (ADA Level of Evidence C)
Aspirin should not be recommended for CVD prevention for adults with diabetes at low CVD risk (men under age 50 years and women under 60 years with no major additional CVD risk factors; 10-year CVD risk under 5%) as the potential adverse effects from bleeding offset the potential benefits. (ACCF/AHA Class III, Level of Evidence C) (ADA Level of Evidence C)
Low-dose (75–162 mg/day) aspirin use for prevention might be considered for those with diabetes at intermediate CVD risk (younger patients with one or more risk factors, or older patients with no risk factors, or patients with 10-year CVD risk of 5–10%) until further research is available.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in people with diabetes: a position statement of the American diabetes association, a scientific statement of the American Heart Association, and an expert consensus document of the American college of cardiology foundation [^246b6c68]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among patients with diabetes is substantial. Individuals with diabetes are at two- to fourfold increased risk of cardiovascular events compared with age- and sex-matched individuals without diabetes. In diabetic patients over the age of 65 years, 68% of deaths are from coronary heart disease (CHD) and 16% are from stroke. A number of mechanisms for the increased cardiovascular risk with diabetes have been proposed, including increased tendency toward intracoronary thrombus formation, increased platelet reactivity, and worsened endothelial dysfunction.

The increased risk for cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with diabetes has led to considerable interest in identifying effective means for cardiovascular risk reduction. Aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients with myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke (secondary prevention). The Food and Drug Administration has not approved aspirin for use in primary prevention, and its net benefit among patients with no previous cardiovascular events is more controversial, for both patients with and without a history of diabetes. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently updated its recommendation about aspirin use for primary prevention. The Task Force recommended encouraging aspirin use in men age 45–79 years and women age 55–79 years and not encouraging aspirin use in younger adults. They did not differentiate their recommendations based on the presence or absence of diabetes.

3. What are the potential harms of aspirin, and are these similar or different for people with diabetes compared to those without?

The major adverse effects of aspirin therapy include intracranial bleeding (hemorrhagic stroke) and extracranial bleeding, principally gastrointestinal. Based on data from primary and secondary prevention trials conducted in mixed populations of patients with and without diabetes, low-dose aspirin appears to be associated with an absolute risk of hemorrhagic stroke of ∼1 in 10,000 people annually. Analyses that examined the primary prevention trials separately have reached similar results. These hemorrhagic strokes are incorporated in the estimate of the effect of aspirin on all strokes considered above in question 2.

For extracranial (mainly gastrointestinal) bleeding, aspirin use is associated with a 54% increase in risk based on meta-analysis of the six primary prevention trials (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.30–1.82). The absolute increase in risk was on the order of 3 in 10,000 per year in mainly middle-aged adults enrolled in the aspirin primary prevention trials. The ATT collaboration authors found that several risk factors for CVD also increased the risk for extracranial bleeding from aspirin, suggesting that those at higher CVD risk are also at higher risk for aspirin-related adverse effects. Those with diabetes taking aspirin experienced a 55% increased risk (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.13–2.14) compared with those without diabetes. Since the primary prevention trials used by the ATT collaboration and by this meta-analysis excluded patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease, the risk calculations for bleeding cannot be extended to that population.

Notably, the absolute excess risk of gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin is likely higher among free-living older adults, with rates of 1–10 per 1,000 annually reported in a large cohort study. While evidence supports that use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) can decrease the risk of recurrent aspirin-related gastrointestinal bleeding, it is not clear whether routine use of a PPI is cost-effective or should be recommended for primary prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — aspirin risk stratification and age cautions — Prior U.S. guidelines recommended prophylactic aspirin only in the setting of elevated ASCVD risk, for example using risk estimators like the PCE or specific ASCVD risk factors, and historical meta-regression shows observed ASCVD risk tracks reasonably well with baseline-estimated ASCVD risk, whereas observed bleeding risk on aspirin is less well correlated. Scenarios associated with increased bleeding risk include a history of previous gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer disease or bleeding from other sites, age > 70 years, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, CKD, and concurrent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, direct oral anticoagulants, and warfarin. Post hoc analysis of older trials suggests the benefit–risk ratio for prophylactic aspirin generally becomes more favorable at > 10% estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, but prophylactic aspirin in primary-prevention adults > 70 years of age is potentially harmful and difficult to justify for routine use.

### A meta-analysis of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in the context of contemporary preventive strategies [^c7cb3d9a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases remains controversial, particularly in the context of contemporary aggressive preventive strategies.

Methods

Relevant randomized clinical trials were included, and risk ratios (RRs) were calculated using random-effects models. Additional moderator analyses were performed to compare the pooled treatment effects from recent trials (those reported after the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program Third Adult Treatment Panel were published in 2001; thus, conducted on the background of contemporary preventive strategies) to the results of older trials.

Results

Data from 14 randomized controlled trials involving 164,751 patients were included. Aspirin use decreased myocardial infarction risk by 16% compared with placebo (RR 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75–0.94); however, in the moderator analyses, aspirin was not associated with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction in recent trials, but was in older trials (P-interaction = .02). Overall, aspirin use significantly increased the occurrence of major bleeding (RR 1.49; 95% CI, 1.32–1.69) and hemorrhagic stroke (RR 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01–1.54). In moderator analyses, the risk of major bleeding (P-interaction = .12) or hemorrhagic stroke (P-interaction = .44) with aspirin was not significantly different between the older and new trials. Differences between aspirin and placebo in the risks for all-cause stroke, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality were not found.

Conclusions

In the context of contemporary primary prevention guidelines, the effect of aspirin on myocardial infarction risk was significantly attenuated, whereas its major bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke complications were retained. Therefore, in contemporary practice, routine use of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events may have a net harmful effect.

### Identifying and reducing inappropriate aspirin use in primary care [^eacb2d97]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

In 2002, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended the consideration of aspirin chemoprevention for patients at high risk for CVD, specifically men aged 40 years and older, postmenopausal women and younger patients with risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and tobacco use. The American Heart Association (AHA) supported this recommendation but specifically recommended aspirin 75–160 mg daily in patients with a 10-year cardiovascular risk of at least 10%. Similarly, the 2003 update to the Standards of Medical Care for Patients with Diabetes Mellitus recommended aspirin therapy for all adult patients with diabetes and macrovascular disease, with consideration for patients aged 40 years and older with diabetes and one other cardiovascular risk factor.

Results from the Women's Health Study in 2005 led to an update to the AHA guideline 2007 that recommended aspirin therapy for high-risk women aged 65 and older. In 2009, the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration (ATT) completed a meta-analysis of six primary prevention studies evaluating aspirin in patients without diabetes with no history of occlusive disease who had been taking aspirin for at least 2 years. This meta-analysis demonstrated a 12% proportional reduction in major cardiovascular events, particularly non-fatal MI. These findings fueled further updates to USPSTF and AHA recommendations and the development of guideline recommendations from the American College of Chest Physicians. The 2016 USPSTF update took a more detailed approach, outlining recommendations for specific age groups based on the calculated 10-year CVD risk. Low-dose aspirin was recommended for adults aged 50–59 with a CVD risk of at least 10%. For adults aged 60–69 with a CVD risk of at least 10%, clinicians were encouraged to assess risk factors to make an informed decision about aspirin use. These guidelines were widely followed in clinical practice until 2018, following the publication of the Aspirin to Reduce Risk of Initial Vascular Events (ARRIVE), A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes (ASCEND) and Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) studies.

### USPSTF recommends against initiating aspirin for… [^fa1d669c]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Should primary care clinicians recommend low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults 60 years or older. Bottom Line In this updated review, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD in adults 60 years or older. The USPSTF recommends shared decision-making regarding the initiation of low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD in adults 40 to 59 years of age with a 10% or greater risk of CVD and without an increased risk of bleeding. Synopsis The USPSTF found adequate evidence that low-dose aspirin used for the primary prevention of CVD reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events. There is no high-quality evidence, however, that low-dose aspirin reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality or all-cause mortality.

Evidence remains uncertain for a benefit of reducing the risk of colorectal cancer. Potential harms include a significant risk of major bleeding events, with increasing risk proportional to increasing age. New recommendations include considering aspirin for high-risk individuals at 40 years of age instead of 50 and no longer recommending aspirin for primary prevention in adults 60 years or older. For patients already taking aspirin or choosing to start taking aspirin, the USPSTF recommends stopping aspirin at approximately 75 years of age. The American Heart Association recommends shared decision-making regarding the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD in high-risk adults 40 to 70 years of age who do not have an increased risk of bleeding.

### Contemporary primary prevention aspirin use by cardiovascular disease risk: impact of US preventive services task force recommendations, 2007–2015: a serial, cross-sectional study [^4b9c23e3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Other national cardiovascular health organizations, including the American Heart Association, the American Stroke Association, and the American Diabetes Association, have also released positive recommendations to guide healthcare professionals on the appropriate use of aspirin for PP of cardiovascular ischemic events. 24, 25, 26, 27 Thus, within this time frame, primary care clinicians were offered strong published support for PP aspirin use, in the absence of a national dissemination plan and easy‐to‐use aspirin prescriptive clinical tools.

Since the publication of the 2009 USPSTF recommendation, examination of the appropriateness of aspirin use (defined as benefit greater than risk) in a primary care outpatient population has been limited. Descriptions of PP aspirin use in this population have not previously been published in association with measurements of individual 10‐year CVD risk.

The current investigation was thus designed to: (1) evaluate the temporal trends in PP aspirin use in a large, primary care–based population over a 9‐year period (2007–2015); (2) evaluate these trends in subgroups with lower to high CVD risk; (3) compare PP and secondary prevention aspirin treatment intensity; and (4) define the prevalence of selected contraindications to PP aspirin use. We hypothesized that PP aspirin use would increase after publication of the 2009 USPSTF recommendation, particularly in intermediate‐ and high‐risk populations. We also hypothesized that low‐risk patients might experience a lower aspirin exposure after the 2009 USPSTF publication.

The recently updated 2016 USPSTF aspirin PP recommendation statement 28 advises use of low‐dose aspirin for the PP of CVD and colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 69 years who have a 10% or greater 10‐year CVD risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low‐dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years (B and C recommendations). Improved effectiveness of the updated 2016 national aspirin use PP guidelines can be informed by evaluation of past aspirin use trends in real‐world practice.

### Carotid ultrasound-based plaque score for the allocation of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease events: the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis and the atherosclerosis risk in communities study [^3d5bb2e7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The role of aspirin in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events is currently controversial. Since 2018, 3 landmark randomized controlled trials, and 2 large meta‐analyses, have suggested a limited benefit of low‐dose aspirin for the primary prevention of ASCVD events, which on average is offset by an increased risk of bleeding, particularly in older individuals and in those at higher baseline hemorrhagic risk. Still, in the largest primary prevention meta‐analysis available to date, a significant 12% relative risk reduction in ASCVD events was observed for aspirin. Given these updated data, the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Associationand 2021 European Society of Cardiology guidelinesfor primary prevention convey a tentative IIb recommendation for aspirin therapy among: (1) "select adults 40 to 70 years of age who are at higher ASCVD risk but not at increased bleeding risk," and (2) "patients with type 2 diabetes at high or very high ASCVD risk in the absence of clear contraindications." However, it remains unclear how clinicians should best identify patients who are likely to derive a net benefit from aspirin therapy in routine primary prevention. For example, the United States Preventive Services Task Force provides only a grade C recommendation to initiate low‐dose aspirin for adults 40 to 59 years of age with a 10‐year ASCVD risk of > 10% using the pooled cohort equations risk calculator, stating that the net benefit of aspirin in this group may be small. However, a key limitation with the pooled cohort equations and similar risk calculators (eg, Framingham Risk Score) are that they are heavily reliant on age and therefore may overestimate risk in middle‐aged to older adults, which has implications for defining the aspirin‐eligible patient population.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing patients with and without diabetes [^6411592b]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Implications

Our inferences should be considered in the context of proposed criteria to evaluate the validity of a subgroup effect. Good evidence of a valid subgroup effect results from testing few a priori hypotheses based on strong biological rationale. The extent to which this is true for the diabetes subgroup analyses reported in the literature is unclear to us. Our analyses, however, do not support other criteria for a valid subgroup effect. We found that differences in aspirin treatment effect between patients with and without diabetes, both between and within RCTs, were inconsistent and of small magnitude. Thus, the current best evidence suggests that the efficacy of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes is similar to that in patients without diabetes.

The decision to use aspirin for primary prevention in individual patients with diabetes remains a complex issue. Ultimately, the decision to use aspirin for an individual patient should consider the advantages and disadvantages of this preventive treatment given the patient's context and preferences. We suggest first estimating the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease. Multiplying this estimate by 0.88 (12% relative risk reduction with the use of aspirin based on data from the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaborative) would provide the revised 10-year risk estimate for a patient using aspirin. This should be presented alongside the risk of major gastrointestinal and extracranial bleeds with and without aspirin. A patient decision aid could present these data to help patients and clinicians consider the relative merits and downsides of aspirin use, as was done recently for use of statin therapy in patients with diabetes.

Summary

While there are insufficient data among patients with diabetes to conclusively show a benefit of aspirin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events, our data suggest, but do not confirm, that the relative benefit of aspirin is similar in patients with and without diabetes. Additional evidence from RCTs and individual-patient-data meta-analyses may help to further clarify this issue.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^a84b21db]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Aspirin for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) — evidence and bleeding risk: In adults < 40 years of age, there is insufficient evidence to judge the risk–benefit ratio of routine aspirin; although "routine use is not recommended in these settings," there is also insufficient evidence to comment on whether physicians might discuss prophylactic aspirin with adults < 40 years of age or > 70 years of age. As inferred from the first recommendation, there is "no justification for the routine administration of low-dose aspirin" among adults at low estimated ASCVD risk; in the ARRIVE trial the observed average 10-year ASCVD risk was < 10%, and "the overall benefits of prophylactic aspirin by intention-to-treat were negligible." Accumulated data "support avoiding prophylactic aspirin" when bleeding risk factors are present, including "a history of previous gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer disease or bleeding at other sites, age > 70 years, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, chronic kidney disease (CKD)," and concurrent use of agents that increase bleeding risk such as "nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, direct oral anticoagulants, and warfarin."

### Use of aspirin for primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention in the United States, 2011–2012 [^e339b3bb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Aspirin use has been shown to be an effective tool in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention among high-risk patients. The patient-reported physician recommendation for aspirin as preventive therapy among high- and low-risk patients is unknown.

Methods and Results

We conducted an analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011–2012 to examine the use of aspirin for CVD prevention. Patients without previously diagnosed CVD were classified into high and low risk based on their Framingham Risk Score (10-year coronary heart disease risk). Among patients without previously diagnosed CVD, 22.5% were classified as high risk. Of the high-risk individuals, 40.9% reported being told by their physician to take aspirin, with 79.0% complying. Among those who were at low risk, 26.0% were told by their physician to take aspirin, with 76.5% complying. Logistic regression analysis indicated that age, access to a regular source of care, education, and insurance status were significant predictors of patient-reported physician recommendations for aspirin use for primary prevention. Among high-risk patients, age, race, and insurance status were significant predictors of reported recommendations for aspirin use. Among low-risk patients, age, education, obesity, and insurance status were significant predictors of reported recommendations for aspirin use.

Conclusions

Patient reports indicate nonideal rates of being told to take aspirin, for both high- and low-risk patients for primary prevention. Clinical decision support tools that could assist physicians in identifying patients at risk may increase patient reports of physician recommendations for aspirin use.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^484e8362]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Recommendations

Consider aspirin therapy (75–162 mg/day) as a primary prevention strategy in those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes at increased cardiovascular risk (10-year risk > 10%). This includes most men > 50 years of age or women > 60 years of age who have at least one additional major risk factor (family history of CVD, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or albuminuria). (C)
There is not sufficient evidence to recommend aspirin for primary prevention in lower risk individuals, such as men < 50 years of age or women < 60 years of age without other major risk factors. For patients in these age-groups with multiple other risk factors, clinical judgment is required. (C)
Use aspirin therapy (75–162 mg/day) as a secondary prevention strategy in those with diabetes with a history of CVD. (A)
For patients with CVD and documented aspirin allergy, clopidogrel (75 mg/day) should be used. (B)
Combination therapy with ASA (75–162 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) is reasonable for up to a year after an acute coronary syndrome. (B)

ADA and the American Heart Association (AHA) have, in the past, jointly recommended that low-dose aspirin therapy be used as a primary prevention strategy in those with diabetes at increased cardiovascular risk, including those who are over 40 years of age or those with additional risk factors (family history of CVD, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or albuminuria). These recommendations were derived from several older trials that included small numbers of patients with diabetes.

Aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients with previous MI or stroke (secondary prevention). Its net benefit in primary prevention among patients with no previous cardiovascular events is more controversial, both for patients with and without a history of diabetes. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently updated its evidence base and recommendations about aspirin use for primary prevention. The Task Force recommended encouraging aspirin use in men 45–79 and women 55–79 years of age and not encouraging aspirin use in younger adults and did not differentiate based on the presence or absence of diabetes.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) primary prevention trials by age — evidence adequacy across age groups is summarized as follows: Trials included large numbers of younger and older adults, with "almost 22 000 participants younger than 50 years and more than 37 000 participants 70 years or older," and "most trials with age subanalyses did not find a statistically significant difference in the relative effect of aspirin on CVD outcomes by age." The USPSTF "concluded that evidence on the benefits of aspirin on CVD outcomes was adequate for all groups, including adults aged 40 to 49 years and adults 70 years or older."

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: time for a platelet-guided approach [^89060ee8]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

Aspirin protects against atherothrombosis while increasing the risk of major bleeding. Although it is widely used to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD), its benefit does not outweigh its risk for primary CVD prevention in large population settings. The recent United States Preventive Services Task Force guidelines on aspirin use to prevent CVD reflect this clinical tradeoff as well as the persistent struggle to define a population that would benefit from prophylactic aspirin therapy. Past clinical trials of primary CVD prevention with aspirin have not included consideration of a biomarker relevant to aspirin's mechanism of action, platelet inhibition. This approach is at odds with the paradigm used in other key areas of pharmacological CVD prevention, including antihypertensive and statin therapy, which combine cardiovascular risk assessment with the measurement of mechanistic biomarkers (eg, blood pressure and LDL [low-density lipoprotein]-cholesterol). Reliable methods for quantifying platelet activity, including light transmission aggregometry and platelet transcriptomics, exist and should be considered to identify individuals at elevated cardiovascular risk due to a hyperreactive platelet phenotype. Therefore, we propose a new, platelet-guided approach to the study of prophylactic aspirin therapy. We think that this new approach will reveal a population with hyperreactive platelets who will benefit most from primary CVD prevention with aspirin and usher in a new era of precision-guided antiplatelet therapy.

### Antiplatelet therapy for every diabetic person? [^a20a649c]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The more recent data have also led scientific societies to review existing guidelines. Until 2009, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended low doses of aspirin for primary prevention in any individual aged ≥ 40 years or with additional CV risk factors. In 2010, the recommendation has been changed, with the identification of individuals with a 10-year risk of CVD events over 10% as candidates for primary prevention. The ADA further specifies that this includes the vast majority of men aged > 50 years and women aged > 60 years with an additional risk factor. The same recommendation was recently made by a panel convened by the ADA, the American Heart Association, and the American College of Cardiology Foundation. On the other hand, opposite conclusions were reached by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, which considered existing evidence as insufficient to recommend the use of aspirin for primary prevention in individuals with diabetes. The Canadian Diabetes Association also acknowledged the substantial uncertainty surrounding the role of aspirin, leaving the prescription of the drug to individual clinical judgment.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing patients with and without diabetes [^530ceaf1]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes, and the population burden of cardiovascular disease attributed to diabetes appears to be increasing. Several guidelines, including those of the American Diabetes Association, recommend aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes. Given that trials of aspirin for primary prevention have enrolled too few patients with diabetes, guideline panels have applied indirect evidence from other high-risk groups to formulate this recommendation. In contrast, other guidelines such as those of the European Society of Cardiology and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the most recent U.S. Preventive Services Task Force provide no specific recommendations regarding the use of aspirin in patients with diabetes.

The best available estimate of the effect of aspirin comes from the most recent study from the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaborative, an individual-level meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported a 12% reduction in the rate ratio of serious vascular events in patients with diabetes randomized to aspirin prophylaxis, although this finding was not statistically significant (rate ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.67–1.15). However, this meta-analysis did not include data from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) nor two recent primary prevention RCTs, the Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis With Aspirin for Diabetes (JPAD) and the Prevention of Progression of Arterial Disease and Diabetes (POPADAD) studies. Results from both JPAD and POPADAD, however, were imprecise and unable to exclude a reduction in the risk for their composite end points of up to 42 and 24%, respectively.

We, therefore, set out to conduct a systematic review of RCTs of aspirin for primary prevention in patients with diabetes to 1) estimate the efficacy of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events among patients with diabetes and 2) estimate the extent to which the effect of aspirin differs in patients with and without diabetes.

### AHA / ADA vs. ESC / EASD recommendations on aspirin as a primary prevention strategy in people with diabetes: how the same data generate divergent conclusions [^36b2386a]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Recently, major scientific societies in Europe and USA have issued guidelines on diabetes and cardiovascular (CV) disease. The conclusions of the two panels of experts regarding the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of CV disease in individuals with diabetes are totally divergent. The US statement recommends the use of aspirin for primary prevention in all individuals aged > 40 or with additional risk factors. In contrast, in the European guidelines there is no mention of aspirin for the primary prevention of myocardial infarction or CV death, while it is recommended for the prevention of stroke. Both recommendations seem mainly based on extrapolations from data on other high-risk groups, rather than on a comprehensive review of pertinent data. Actually, a body of evidence suggests that the efficacy of aspirin in patients with diabetes is substantially lower than in individuals without diabetes. Nevertheless, existing knowledge is mainly derived from dated trials, including small numbers of patients, and hardly representing current strategies for the management of CV risk factors. The high level of uncertainty regarding the balance between benefits and risks of aspirin therapy have important implications for clinical practice, auditing activities, and the design and conduct of randomized clinical trials.

### Aspirin use and misuse for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases [^2a0b92f5]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Daily aspirin use for primary cardiovascular disease prevention is common among adults. Numerous clinical trials observe reduced cardiovascular disease with regular low-dose aspirin. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2016 published guidelines for aspirin use, but controversy exists about the side effects, and overuse or underuse may be common despite the guidelines. Using the Task Force recommendations, this paper describes the prevalence of appropriate aspirin use and physician advice in a population sample.

Methods

A random sample of men and women (aged 50–69 years) living in the Upper Midwest in 2017–2018 were surveyed, collecting demographic data, health history, and aspirin use. Appropriate primary prevention with aspirin was defined as having ≥ 10% cardiovascular disease risk (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking) with daily or every other day aspirin use. Those with prevalent cardiovascular disease were labeled as secondary prevention.

Results

A total of 1,352 adults were surveyed (697 women, 655 men). The criteria for secondary prevention were fulfilled in 188 participants, and these were eliminated from the analysis. In the remaining group, aspirin was indicated in 32.9% (383 of 1,164). Among those, 46.0% (176 of 383) were appropriate users, and 54.0% (207 of 383) were nonusers despite indications. Overuse, where aspirin is not indicated, was common at 26.9% (210 of 781). Discussion with a physician, although reported in 29% of subjects, was associated with some improvement in the appropriate use but also with overuse and underuse.

Conclusions

Aspirin use for primary cardiovascular disease prevention is common. However, many adults are medicating without indication (overuse) or are not using aspirin despite guidelines (underuse).

### A pathophysiologic primary prevention review of aspirin administration to prevent cardiovascular thrombosis [^2d1aa675]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Cardiovascular disease is the leading metabolic cause of mortality in the United States. Among current therapies, low-dose aspirin has been shown to reduce cardiovascular thrombosis. However, aspirin also causes major complications (hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding). The American Heart Association recommends that aspirin only be prescribed for "high-risk" individuals. No guidelines are available as to the duration of aspirin therapy.

Methods

A reasonable approach to aspirin administration is to determine the appropriateness of aspirin therapy based on the pathophysiology of coronary artery thrombosis. It suggests that the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score be used as the basis for determining "high risk". This score was shown to accurately predict future cardiovascular events. The greater the CAC score, the greater the extent of coronary artery atherosclerotic plaque and future cardiovascular risk.

Results

A CAC score > 400 places an individual at very-high 10-year risk for an atherosclerotic event. Since aggressive medical therapy initiates stabilization of unstable atherosclerotic plaques within 1 month and reversal within 2 years, this treatment significantly reduces the risk of the individual for a cardiovascular event. Thus, most individuals aged < 75 years with a CAC score of > 400 should receive aspirin therapy for a maximum of 2 years.

Conclusion

Utilization of a CAC score greatly simplifies the decision of whom to treat with aspirin and for what duration. Importantly, focusing on two factors (hemorrhage and plaque stabilization) is easily understood by both the physician and the patient.

Abbreviations

CAC = coronary artery calcium; CVD = cardiovascular disease; LDL = low-density lipoprotein; OCT = optical coherence tomography.

### Aspirin dose for prevention of cardiovascular disease in diabetics [^9e8b48c4]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a specific dose of aspirin can be recommended for prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes.

Data Source

Biomedical literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1990-February 2002). Key terms included diabetes, cardiovascular protection, and aspirin.

Data Synthesis

Pharmacologic and clinical studies focusing on the dose-response relationship of aspirin therapy were reviewed. Evidence supports the benefit of low-dose aspirin therapy in reducing vascular events in secondary and primary prevention trials in various patient populations; however, some studies suggest larger doses of aspirin may be needed in certain patients.

Conclusions

Review of the evidence does not support a particular dose of aspirin for cardiovascular protection in diabetic patients. Clinical guidelines recommend aspirin therapy in the range of 81–325 mg/d. However, due to an increased prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and disturbances in coagulation in diabetic patients, the dose of aspirin for prevention of cardiovascular disease in these individuals may be different from that in other populations and requires further evaluation.
