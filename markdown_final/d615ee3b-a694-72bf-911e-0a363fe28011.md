B. the number of "good genes" it possesses.
C. the number of mates it attracts.
D. its physical strength.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option most directly measures Darwinian fitness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition of fitness in evolutionary biology. Then, I should verify which answer choice aligns with that definition and why the alternatives do not. Next, I will consider common proxies like mate number or strength and check whether they truly capture reproductive success. Finally, I will confirm the best choice and briefly justify it against the distractors.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: Darwinian fitness is the reproductive success of an individual, typically quantified as the number of offspring that survive to reproductive age and themselves reproduce, because that is what determines the spread of alleles in subsequent generations [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine Option A, "the number of its offspring that survive to reproduce". Wait, let me verify that this matches the definition precisely: yes, this is the direct measure of lifetime reproductive success, which is exactly what evolutionary biologists use to operationalize fitness, so this is a strong candidate for the correct answer [^notfound].

> Next, I should review Option B, "the number of 'good genes' it possesses". Hold on, let's not conflate genotype with fitness; possessing beneficial alleles may increase the probability of higher fitness, but fitness itself is a phenotypic outcome of reproductive success, not a count of genes, so this is indirect and not the most direct measure [^notfound].

> I will now examine Option C, "the number of mates it attracts". Hmm, wait a minute, mate number can be a proxy for potential reproductive output, but it does not guarantee offspring production or survival; fitness is realized only through viable, reproducing offspring, so mate number is an imperfect and indirect indicator at best [^notfound].

> Let me consider Option D, "its physical strength". I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing from ecology; strength may influence survival or mating success in some contexts, but fitness is not strength per se — it is the reproductive consequence of traits like strength, so strength is a trait that might correlate with fitness rather than a direct measure of it [^notfound].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that the most direct, outcome-level measure is indeed the number of offspring that survive to reproduce, because that is the bottom line for allele propagation and is the standard metric of Darwinian fitness in evolutionary studies [^notfound].

> Final answer: A. the number of its offspring that survive to reproduce.

---

The most direct measure of Darwinian fitness is **the number of offspring that survive to reproduce** [^notfound]. This is because fitness reflects the **relative contribution of an individual's genes to the next generation**, which is ultimately determined by how many offspring survive and reproduce. Options B, C, and D are indirect or incomplete: "good genes" are not guaranteed to translate into reproductive success, attracting mates does not ensure offspring survival, and physical strength may aid survival but does not directly measure reproductive output.

---

## Definition of Darwinian fitness

Darwinian fitness is defined as the **reproductive success of an individual relative to others in the population** [^notfound]. It is a measure of how well an individual's genes are represented in the next generation. Fitness is not about individual survival, strength, or attractiveness per se, but about the **successful transmission of genes** through viable offspring.

---

## Direct measurement of fitness

The most direct way to measure fitness is to **count the number of offspring that survive to reproductive age and themselves reproduce**. This metric captures the essence of fitness: the propagation of genes into future generations. Offspring must survive and reproduce for the parent's genes to persist, so reproductive success is the ultimate arbiter of fitness.

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Explanation** | **Directness to fitness** |
|-|-|-|
| A. The number of offspring that survive to reproduce | Directly measures reproductive success, which is the core of fitness | High |
| B. The number of "good genes" it possesses | Genes alone do not guarantee reproductive success; environmental factors and mate choice also matter | Low |
| C. The number of mates it attracts | Attracting mates does not ensure offspring survival or reproduction | Medium |
| D. Its physical strength | Strength may aid survival but does not directly measure reproductive success | Low |

---

Option A is the most direct because it **directly reflects reproductive success**, the cornerstone of fitness. Options B, C, and D are indirect or incomplete proxies that may correlate with fitness but do not measure it directly.

---

## Biological examples

- **Peacock's tail**: Males with elaborate tails attract more mates, but if their offspring fail to survive, their fitness remains low despite attracting many mates.
- **Elephant seals**: Alpha males may mate with many females, but if their offspring do not survive to reproduce, their fitness is not maximized.
- **Humans**: Individuals with high socioeconomic status may attract more mates, but if they have few or no surviving offspring, their fitness is low.

---

## Conclusion

The most direct measure of Darwinian fitness is **the number of offspring that survive to reproduce** [^notfound]. This is because fitness is fundamentally about reproductive success and the transmission of genes to the next generation. Other traits, such as physical strength or attractiveness, may influence fitness but are not direct measures of it.

### The effects of vitamin D on skeletal muscle strength, muscle mass, and muscle power: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^7d393323]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

There is growing evidence that vitamin D plays a role on several tissues including skeletal muscle.

Objective

The aim was to summarize with a meta-analysis, the effects of vitamin D supplementation on muscle function.

Data Sources

A systematic research of randomized controlled trials, performed between 1966 and January 2014 has been conducted on Medline, Cochrane Database of Systematics Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled and completed by a manual review of the literature and congressional abstracts.

Study Selection

All forms and doses of vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium supplementation, compared with placebo or control were included. Out of the 225 potentially relevant articles, 30 randomized controlled trials involving 5615 individuals (mean age: 61.1 years) met the inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted by two independent reviewers.

Data Synthesis

Results revealed a small but significant positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on global muscle strength with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.17 (P = 0.02). No significant effect was found on muscle mass (SMD 0.058; P = 0.52) or muscle power (SMD 0.057; P = 0.657). Results on muscle strength were significantly more important with people who presented a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level < 30 nmol/L. Supplementation seems also more effective on people aged 65 years or older compared to younger subjects (SMD 0.25; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.48 vs SMD 0.03; 95% CI -0.08 to 0.14).

Conclusions

Vitamin D supplementation has a small positive impact on muscle strength, but additional studies are needed to define optimal treatment modalities, including dose, mode of administration, and duration.

### Vitamin D supplementation and muscle power, strength and physical performance in older adults: a randomized controlled trial [^6e0e78b1]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations (< 30 ng/mL [< 50 nmol/L]) have been associated with muscle weakness and impaired physical performance in observational studies. However, the effect of vitamin D supplementation on changes in muscle strength and physical performance in randomized controlled trials has been mixed.

Objectives

To determine the effect of daily vitamin D supplementation on leg power, strength, and physical performance in low-functioning older adults with 25(OH)D concentrations of 18 to < 30 ng/mL.

Methods

In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 136 low-functioning [Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) scores ≤ 10] adults aged 65–89 y with 25(OH)D concentrations of 18 to < 30 ng/mL were randomly assigned to 2000 IU/d vitamin D 3 or placebo for 12 mo. Lower-extremity leg power (primary outcome), leg and grip strength, SPPB, timed up and go (TUG), postural sway, and gait velocity and spatiotemporal parameters (secondary outcomes) were assessed at baseline, 4 and 12 mo. A subset (n = 37) also underwent a muscle biopsy at baseline and 4 mo and muscle fiber composition and contractile properties were assessed.

Results

Participants' mean ± SD age and SPPB scores at baseline were 73.4 ± 6.3 y and 7.8 ± 1.8, respectively. Mean ± SD 25(OH)D concentrations at baseline and 12 mo were 19.4 ± 4.2 ng/mL and 28.6 ± 6.7 ng/mL in the vitamin D group and 19.9 ± 4.9 ng/mL and 20.2 ± 5.0 ng/mL in the placebo group for a mean ± SE difference of 9.1 ± 1.1 ng/mL (P < 0.0001). However, there were no differences in change in leg power, leg or grip strength, SPPB score, TUG, postural sway, or gait velocity and spatiotemporal parameters by intervention group over 12 mo or muscle fiber composition and contractile properties over 4 mo.

Conclusions

In low-functioning older adults with 25(OH)D concentrations of 18 to < 30 ng/mL, randomization to 2000 IU/d vitamin D 3 did not result in improvements in leg power, strength, or physical performance or muscle fiber composition and contractile properties. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02015611.

### Vitamin D and muscle health: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^0e6f061f]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of vitamin D supplementation versus placebo on muscle health. For this systematic review and trial-level meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials, a systematic search of randomized controlled trials published until October 2020 was performed in Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar. We included studies in humans (except athletes) on supplementation with vitamin D2 or D3 versus placebo, regardless of administration form (daily, bolus, and duration) with or without calcium co-supplementation. The predefined endpoints were physical performance reported as timed up and go test (TUG; seconds), chair rising test (seconds), 6-minute walking distance (m), and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; points). Furthermore, endpoints were maximum muscle strength (Newton) measured at handgrip, elbow flexion, elbow extension, knee flexion, and knee extension, as well as muscle (lean tissue) mass (kg). Falls were not included in the analysis. Cochrane Review Manager (version 5.4.1.) calculating mean difference (MD) using a random effect model was used. In total, 54 randomized controlled trials involving 8747 individuals were included. Vitamin D versus placebo was associated with a significantly longer time spent performing the TUG (MD 0.15 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.26] seconds, N = 19 studies, I² = 0%, n = 5223 participants) and a significant lower maximum knee flexion strength (MD -3.3 [-6.63 to -0.03] Newton, N = 12 studies, I² = 0%, n = 765 participants). Total score in the SPPB showed a tendency toward worsening in response to vitamin D compared with placebo (MD -0.18 [-0.37 to 0.01] points, N = 8 studies, I² = 0%, n = 856 participants). Other measures of muscle health did not show between-group differences. In subgroup analyses, including studies with low vitamin D levels, effects of vitamin D supplementation did not differ from placebo. Available evidence does not support a beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on muscle health. Vitamin D may have adverse effects on muscle health, which needs to be considered when recommending vitamin D supplementation. © 2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on lower-extremity power and function in older adults: a randomized controlled trial [^c231a328]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The effect of vitamin D supplementation on muscle function in older adults has been tested in randomized trials with mixed results, which may be due to differences in the study participant characteristics, including baseline vitamin D status. The results of 2 meta-analyses of randomized trials suggested a beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on muscle function in older adults with low baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D].

Objectives

We aimed to test the effect of 12 mo of vitamin D supplementation on lower-extremity power and function in older community-dwelling adults screened for low serum 25(OH)D.

Methods

This was a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that included 100 community-dwelling men and women ≥ 60 y old who had serum 25(OH)D ≤ 20 ng/mL at screening and a mean ± SD serum 25(OH)D of 20.2 ± 6.7 ng/mL at baseline. Participants were randomly assigned to 800 IU vitamin D3/d (intervention) or placebo. Those in the intervention group whose serum 25(OH)D was < 28 ng/mL after 4 mo were given an additional 800 IU vitamin D3/d, whereas all other participants received placebo as an additional pill.

Results

After 12 mo, the mean ± SD serum 25(OH)D was 32.5 ± 5.1 ng/mL in the intervention group and 19.8 ± 7.3 ng/mL in the control group (treatment × time P < 0.001). The change in leg press power, function, and strength did not differ between the 2 groups over 12 mo (all treatment × time P ≥ 0.60), nor did the change in lean mass (treatment × time P ≥ 0.89).

Conclusion

Increasing serum 25(OH)D to > 32 ng/mL (on average) over 12 mo did not affect lower-extremity power, strength, or lean mass in older community-dwelling adults. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02293187.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, or a strength-training exercise program on clinical outcomes in older adults: the DO-HEALTH randomized clinical trial [^8b16f209]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The benefits of vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, and exercise in disease prevention remain unclear.

Objective

To test whether vitamin D, omega-3s, and a strength-training exercise program, alone or in combination, improved 6 health outcomes among older adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2×2×2 factorial randomized clinical trial among 2157 adults aged 70 years or older who had no major health events in the 5 years prior to enrollment and had sufficient mobility and good cognitive status. Patients were recruited between December 2012 and November 2014, and final follow-up was in November 2017.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to 3 years of intervention in 1 of the following 8 groups: 2000 IU/d of vitamin D3, 1 g/d of omega-3s, and a strength-training exercise program (n = 264); vitamin D3 and omega-3s (n = 265); vitamin D3 and exercise (n = 275); vitamin D3 alone (n = 272); omega-3s and exercise (n = 275); omega-3s alone (n = 269); exercise alone (n = 267); or placebo (n = 270).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The 6 primary outcomes were change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and incidence rates (IRs) of nonvertebral fractures and infections over 3 years. Based on multiple comparisons of 6 primary end points, 99% confidence intervals are presented and P < .01 was required for statistical significance.

Results

Among 2157 randomized participants (mean age, 74.9 years; 61.7% women), 1900 (88%) completed the study. Median follow-up was 2.99 years. Overall, there were no statistically significant benefits of any intervention individually or in combination for the 6 end points at 3 years. For instance, the differences in mean change in systolic BP with vitamin D vs no vitamin D and with omega-3s vs no omega-3s were both -0.8 (99% CI, -2.1 to 0.5) mm Hg, with P < .13 and P < .11, respectively; the difference in mean change in diastolic BP with omega-3s vs no omega-3s was -0.5 (99% CI, -1.2 to 0.2) mm Hg; P = 0.06); and the difference in mean change in IR of infections with omega-3s vs no omega-3s was -0.13 (99% CI, -0.23 to -0.03), with an IR ratio of 0.89 (99% CI, 0.78–1.01; P = 0.02). No effects were found on the outcomes of SPPB, MoCA, and incidence of nonvertebral fractures). A total of 25 deaths were reported, with similar numbers in all treatment groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults without major comorbidities aged 70 years or older, treatment with vitamin D3, omega-3s, or a strength-training exercise program did not result in statistically significant differences in improvement in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, nonvertebral fractures, physical performance, infection rates, or cognitive function. These findings do not support the effectiveness of these 3 interventions for these clinical outcomes.

### Synergistic effects of vitamin D supplementation and resistance training on IGF-1 and muscle health: a systematic review [^c07de20e]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The interaction between vitamin D and IGF-1 in resistance-power training is not fully elucidated, despite their established roles in muscle physiology. Research compiles data about how resistance training and vitamin D supplementation affect the results of muscle parameters alongside serum IGF-1 concentrations.

Methods

The research analysis utilized PRISMA guidelines. Seventeen studies were reviewed, including eleven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and six observational studies. The included studies examined children, adults, the elderly, and patients with metabolic or hormonal disorders. The primary outcomes were serum IGF-1 and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), as well as muscle strength and physical function.

Results

17 studies were included in the systematic review. Voluntary muscle expression of IGF-1 increased by at least 20% to 30% in elderly women through resistance training (p < 0.01) though combined training increased muscle IGF-1 levels and functional capacity by 22% (p = 0.01). Data confirm a positive association between serum 25(OH)D and IGF-1 levels, while limited evidence suggests a moderate reduction in IGFBPs.

Conclusion

The combination and individual effects of vitamin D supplementation with resistance training systems enhance IGF-1 bioavailability and muscle health in vitamin D-deficient adults.

### The clinical usefulness of muscle mass and strength measures in older people: a systematic review [^884109b5]. Age and Ageing (2021). Medium credibility.

Study selection and data extraction

Two authors (E.L. and A.L.G.) independently screened retrieved titles and abstracts to identify potentially relevant studies. Disagreement was resolved by discussion and consensus. Full-text reviews were conducted by two authors (drawn from E.L. T.O. and A.L.G.) working independently using a standardised data extraction template. Studies that simultaneously assessed different types of muscle measure for one outcome or assessed one measure with different outcomes were included, and each association was analysed separately.

Data extracted from each article comprised: first author, publication year, country of study, study design, healthcare setting or clinical group, sample size, average age, muscle mass or strength technique and motor outcome. Correlation coefficients, odds ratios, mean differences, P values and linear regression statistics were extracted from the full-text studies for inclusion in the synthesis. Studies with no data to support the claim of association were excluded. To compare the magnitude of effect sizes across studies with different metrics, extracted statistics were converted into the standardised mean difference (Cohen's d) as a common index. Associations were defined as strong (d ≥ 0.80), moderate (0.5 ≤ d > 0.8), weak (0.2 ≤ d > 0.5) or none (d < 0.2).

Quality assessment

Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS). This comprises 20 questions appraising methods and risk of bias in cross-sectional studies. The score was converted into a percentage for comparability. AXIS rating ≥ 75, 50–74% and < 50% were considered good, moderate and poor quality, respectively. Conference abstracts that did not provide sufficient information for appraisal were included but not rated. Results are displayed in Supplementary Material A4.

### Sarcopenia: revised European consensus on definition and diagnosis [^2a381088]. Age and Ageing (2019). Medium credibility.

Frailty

Frailty is a multidimensional geriatric syndrome that is characterised by cumulative decline in multiple body systems or functions, with pathogenesis involving physical as well as social dimensions. Frailty increases vulnerability to poor health outcomes such as disability, hospital admission, reduced quality of life and even death.

The physical phenotype of frailty, described by Fried and co-workers, shows significant overlap with sarcopenia; low grip strength and slow gait speed are characteristic of both. Weight loss, another diagnostic criterion for frailty, is also a major etiologic factor for sarcopenia. Treatment options for physical frailty and for sarcopenia likewise overlap — provision of optimal protein intake, supplementation of vitamin D, and physical exercise.

Taken together, frailty and sarcopenia are still distinct — one a geriatric syndrome and the other a disease. While sarcopenia is a contributor to the development of physical frailty, the syndrome of frailty represents a much broader concept. Frailty is seen as the decline over a lifetime in multiple physiological systems, resulting in negative consequences to physical, cognitive, and social dimensions. Frailty's diagnostic tools reflect these multiple dimensions, e.g. the Groningen Frailty Indicator, the Frailty Index of Rockwood et al. and others.

Malnutrition-associated sarcopenia

The sarcopenia phenotype is also associated with malnutrition, regardless of whether the malnourished condition is rooted in low dietary intake (starvation, inability to eat), reduced nutrient bioavailability (e.g. with diarrhea, vomiting) or high nutrient requirements (e.g. with inflammatory diseases such as cancer or organ failure with cachexia). Low muscle mass has recently been proposed as part of the definition of malnutrition. Also in malnutrition, low fat mass is usually present, which is not necessarily the case in sarcopenia.

### Effect of vitamin D, omega-3 supplementation, or a home exercise program on muscle mass and sarcopenia: DO-HEALTH trial [^4d5d2df5]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study design

This is a secondary endpoint analysis of the Vitamin D3 — Omega3 — Home Exercise — Healthy Aging Longevity Trial (DO‐HEALTH) trial. The prespecified secondary endpoint of change in ALMI over the 3 years follow‐up was analyzed according to the protocol including all 1495 participants who underwent dual energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurement at baseline (Supplementary Material). Incident sarcopenia was a predefined exploratory endpoint of DO‐HEALTH including 1940 participants with absence of sarcopenia at baseline.

DO‐HEALTH is a multicenter, double‐blind, 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design, randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trial designed to support healthy longevity in European older adults aged 70 years and older examining the individual and combined effects of omega‐3, vitamin D, and simple home exercise over 3 years of follow‐up. The study protocol was approved by ethical and regulatory agencies. The primary trial findings were published elsewhere. In brief, treatment with vitamin D3, omega‐3s, or a strength‐training exercise program did not result in statistically significant differences in improvement in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, nonvertebral fractures, physical performance, infection rates, or cognitive function.

Participants

Participants were physically active community‐dwelling adults aged 70 years recruited from five European countries (Austria, France, Germany, Portugal, and Switzerland) including seven study sites (Zurich, Basel, Geneva, Berlin, Innsbruck, Toulouse, and Coimbra). Main inclusion criteria were the absence of major health events in the 5 years prior to enrollment (i.e. cancer or myocardial infarction), sufficient mobility to visit the study centers without assistance, and an MMSE (Mini‐Mental State Examination) score of at least 24. Details on recruitment, randomization, and trial procedures are described elsewhere. All participants signed an informed consent form.

### Does the combination of resistance training and a nutritional intervention have a synergic effect on muscle mass, strength, and physical function in older adults? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^c0833437]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Nutrient-dense foods that ensure sufficient intake of energy, protein and micronutrients are important to prevent frailty and sarcopenia and promote physical activity. However, to date, the optimal type of nutritional intervention or supplementation for the prevention of frailty and sarcopenia is unclear. This study was conducted to compare the synergistic effect of nutritional interventions combined with resistance training with that of resistance training alone. This study can provide insight into resource optimization and strategies to prevent frailty and sarcopenia.

This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that there were no additional effects of nutritional interventions when combined with resistance training on muscle mass, strength, or physical function. Of note, in two studies, the control conditions included some nutrients that have biological benefits, which likely reduced the calculated effect size when the data for the control conditions were pooled. However, the findings of the sensitivity analysis showed little possibility of blunted effects. One of the possible reasons for this lack of significant results is that the analysis included studies of healthy older adults who might not have nutrient deficiencies with the usual diets. Healthy diets provide a broad range of micronutrients and bioactive nonnutrients as well as macronutrients that might not be included in the experimental supplements in trials. In addition, since diets are patterned, isolating the effects of individual experimental supplements might not be possible without controlling for the usual diet. Thus, the effects of nutritional interventions might be blunted among older adults who habitually consume sufficient nutrients. However, in previous studies that provided vitamin D-deficient and mobility-limited older adults with a protein mixture containing 20 g protein, 800 IU vitamin D, 350 mg calcium, and other minerals once a day for 6 months with an exercise program, there were no differences in muscle function parameters such as leg strength, gait speed, and short physical performance battery between this group and the exercise-only control group except in muscle density. In another study that also provided sarcopenic older adults who had low protein intake with multinutrient supplements containing 21 g protein, 800 IU vitamin D and other nutrients once a day for 3 months with an exercise program, there were no differences between the two groups, although both groups exhibited improved muscle function. It is necessary to additionally consider the dose of the nutrient and duration of intervention and monitor dietary energy intake. Despite the lack of evidence, greater benefits of resistance training along with nutritional supplementation are expected in older adults who already have poor muscle function or habitually have low nutrient intake.

### Does the combination of resistance training and a nutritional intervention have a synergic effect on muscle mass, strength, and physical function in older adults? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^f8fca2fe]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Health-promoting behaviors are important to prevent disability and dependence and to reduce the need for care. Physical inactivity and malnutrition are common conditions in older adults and are major modifiable risk factors for frailty and sarcopenia. An increasing amount of research has suggested that physical inactivity can lead to the loss of muscle mass, decreases in muscle strength and poor physical performance. Several evidence-based systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs have shown that exercise affects muscle mass, strength, and physical performance. For optimal effects, multimodal exercise combined with moderate- to high-intensity progressive resistance training and functional balance and mobility training at least twice a week for 30–45 min per session is recommended.

Several nutrients, such as protein and vitamins D and E, have been known to affect anabolic stimuli, lead to the synthesis of muscle proteins, and protect against oxidative damage and the loss of muscle mass. Although nutrition plays a key role in the pathogenesis of physical frailty and sarcopenia, the effects of nutritional interventions on muscle mass, strength and physical function are unclear. A systematic review showed that dietary supplementation, when combined with exercise training, has been shown to yield additional effects on muscle mass, strength and physical performance in some studies, but the existing evidence was inconsistent. A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Hita-Contreras et al. showed that nutritional interventions do not provide additional or synergistic benefits when combined with resistance exercise in terms of muscle strength and mobility improvements among older adults with sarcopenic obesity.

There is evidence suggesting that there is an interaction effect between exercise and various nutritional factors, particularly protein and some multinutrient supplements, that can slow age-related decline and preserve muscle function in older adults. However, whether this has a meaningful preventive effect on frailty and sarcopenia remains unclear. Some previous reviews did not provide a quantitative synthesis, combined community-dwelling and institutionalized populations, or included and analyzed diverse types of interventions together, making it difficult to interpret the results. Thus, we focused on the primary prevention and synergistic effects of nutritional interventions, that is, the changes in muscle function after resistance training and nutritional interventions, in healthy community-dwelling older adults. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the combination of resistance training and nutritional interventions with resistance training alone. A preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist is presented in Additional file 1.

### Physical activity assessment and counseling in pediatric clinical settings [^83bb5f33]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

2018 Physical Activity Guidelines applicable to children — age-specific targets specify that ages 3–5 y should accumulate 3+ h/d across light, moderate, and vigorous activity, and ages 6–17 y should achieve ≥ 60 min/d of aerobic activity that is moderate or vigorous with vigorous activity at least 3 d/wk, plus muscle-strengthening activities at least 3 d/wk and bone-strengthening activities at least 3 d/wk. For children not meeting guidelines, the table advises to gradually increase activity in ways the child enjoys.

### Can progressive resistance strength training reduce physical disability in older adults? A meta-analysis study [^ee92ba94]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The decline of muscle strength is associated with physical disability in late adulthood. Progressive resistance strength training has been demonstrated to be an effective intervention to increase muscle strength, however, its effect on reducing physical disability in older adults is unclear. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of progressive resistance strength training on physical disability via meta-analysis.

Method

Two reviewers independently searched for qualified trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Trial inclusion criteria are: (1) Randomised controlled trials, (2) Mean age of participant sample is ≥ 60 years, (3) Progressive resistance strength training as the primary intervention and (4) the trial included outcome measures of physical disability (i.e. physical function domain of the Short-Form 36).

Results

Thirty-three trials were analysed. Although the effect size is small, the intervention groups showed reduced physical disability when compared to the control groups (SMD = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.22).

Conclusions

Progressive resistance strength training appears to be an effective intervention to reduce physical disability in older adults. To maximise the effect, we suggest therapists use responsive outcome measures and multi-component intervention approach.

### Physical activity throughout adolescence and peak hip strength in young adults [^14da82aa]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Peak bone strength occurs in early adulthood, and is considered an important marker of bone strength, osteoporosis risk, and fracture risk in later life. Hip fractures compose a large proportion of the disease burden of osteoporosis; thus, it is important to identify modifiable early life factors that have consequences for the attainment of peak hip strength. Data suggest that higher-intensity physical activity is beneficial for bone strength. Of the studies conducted among younger people, most were of young adolescents and examined activity at a single point or used self-reported data. Studies examining physical activity at a single point do not address the role that different patterns of change in or maintenance of physical activity has in bone strength and may be biased by regression to the mean. Self-reports are susceptible to errors and not well suited to capturing light-intensity activity. In addition to the role of higher-intensity activities in bone strength, studies suggest that activities producing higher gravitational force may be needed to strengthen bones. However, to our knowledge, the association between accelerometer-assessed gravitational force during physical activity and peak hip strength has not been examined.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between accelerometer-measured moderate to vigorous–intensity and light-intensity physical activity trajectories beginning at age 12 years and hip strength at age 25 years. We also explored the association of gravitational force during physical activity measured by custom-built accelerometers at age 18 years with hip strength at age 25 years.

Selection process and data extraction process

The titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles were independently evaluated by 3 investigators (C.D.F.P. N.C.B, and S.D.C.L.). One reviewer (C.D.F.P.) independently screened all studies, and two reviewers independently screened half of the studies (N.C.B. and S.D.C.L.), both in the selection of studies and in the data extraction. The reviewers were not blinded to the authors, institutions, or manuscript journals. Abstracts that did not provide enough information regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria were retrieved for full-text evaluation. Reviewers independently evaluated full-text articles and determined study eligibility. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, and if any disagreement persisted, it was resolved with a third reviewer (C.D.F.P.). To avoid possible double counting of participants included in more than one report by the same authors or working groups, the participant recruitment periods were evaluated, and if necessary, authors were contacted for clarification. The corresponding author was contacted as needed to obtain data not included in the published full-text report. A standardized form was used for data extraction, which was presented to the reviewers, and they should describe the author and year of the article. Subsequently, the total number of participants and their characteristics (sex, age, body mass, height, body fat (%BF), free-fat mass (FFM) and BMI) were described when they had this information. The characteristics of the interventions should be described with the type of exercise performed, duration of follow-up, duration of session, intensity, and weekly frequency. Finally, the results should be extracted for the exercise and control groups. The outcomes of interest extracted were muscular strength (kg), cardiorespiratory fitness (ml.kg − 1.min − 1), muscular power (countermovement jump – CMJ) and maximal aerobic speed (MAS – km.h − 1). Studies that presented other units of measurement were selected but not described in the statistical analysis due to the choice of using gold standard tests to present the results. The same 3 reviewers (C.D.F.P. N.C.B. and S.D.C.L.) who screened the articles and conducted data extraction in an independent way. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by the reviewer (C.D.F.P.).

### Effect of dehydroepiandrosterone on muscle strength and physical function in older adults: a systematic review [^a509b8ff]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate studies that have assessed the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation on body composition and physical performance in older adults.

Design

A systematic review of the medical literature identified from searches of databases, reference lists, and recent conference proceedings with qualitative assessment of the desired end points.

Setting

Not applicable.

Participants

Adults aged 50 and older.

Interventions

Oral DHEA supplement with or without concomitant exercise.

Measurements

Muscle strength, physical function, and physical performance.

Results

Of the 155 eligible studies, eight (n = 661 participants) met inclusion criteria. The studies differed in their included populations, duration of follow-up, and interventions (e.g., exercise). Seven studies examined measures of muscle strength. One study showed improvement in handgrip strength, one showed improvement in chest press, two showed improvement in leg press, and one showed improvement in knee extension and flexion. Nevertheless, similar numbers of studies had negative results for each of these endpoints. Five studies examined measures of physical function and performance. Only one study showed improvement in a composite score measuring physical performance; the rest reported no differences between DHEA and control for any end point.

Conclusion

Overall, the benefit of DHEA on muscle strength and physical function in older adults remains inconclusive. Some measures of muscle strength may improve, although consensus was not reached. DHEA does not appear to routinely benefit measures of physical function or performance. Further large clinical trials are necessary to better identify the clinical role of DHEA supplementation in this population.

### Comparison of power training vs traditional strength training on physical function in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5ef649e2]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Strength training exercise is recommended for improving physical function in older adults. However, whether strength training (lifting and lowering weights under control) and power training (PT) (lifting weights fast and lowering under control) are associated with improved physical function in older adults is not clear.

Objective

To evaluate whether PT vs traditional strength training is associated with physical function improvement in older adults.

Data Sources

Systematic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, CINAHL, PsycInfo, PEDro, and SPORTDiscus were conducted from database inception to October 20, 2021.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that compared strength training with instructions to move the weight as fast as possible in the lifting phase with traditional strength training in healthy, community-living older adults (age ≥ 60 years).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two authors independently selected trials, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool 2, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Summary effect size measures were calculated using a multilevel random-effects model with cluster robust variance estimation and are reported as standardized mean differences (SMDs). Reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guideline.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes included physical function and self-reported physical function. Secondary outcomes included power, strength, muscle mass, walk speed, balance, and adverse effects.

Results

A total of 20 RCTs enrolling 566 community-living older adults (mean [SD] age, 70.1 [4.8] years; 368 [65%] women) were included. For the primary outcomes, PT was associated with an improvement in physical function with low-certainty evidence in 13 RCTs (n = 383) (SMD, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.05–0.54) and self-reported function with low-certainty evidence in 3 RCTs (n = 85) (SMD, 0.38; 95% CI, -0.62 to 1.37). The evidence was downgraded by 2 levels for high risk of bias and imprecision for physical function and very serious imprecision for self-reported physical function.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, PT was associated with a modest improvement in physical function compared with traditional strength training in healthy, community-living older adults. However, high-quality, larger RCTs are required to draw more definitive conclusions.

### Prognostic value of simple measures of physical function and muscle strength in COPD: a systematic review [^3549f36f]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

There has been an increased interest in simple measures of physical function and muscle strength that can be used in all clinical settings to assess individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and predict their prognosis. The main objective was to examine the prognostic value of simple measures of physical function and muscle strength in relation to exacerbation, hospitalization and mortality in individuals with COPD.

Methods

Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane and Web of Science were searched. We included prospective observational studies that examined the prognostic value of simple performed-based tests or self-reported measures of physical function or muscle strength in relation to exacerbation, hospitalization and mortality in individuals with COPD.

Results

Seven articles met the inclusion criteria. The most commonly used tests were the handgrip strength (HGS) (n = 4) and 1-min sit-to-stand (STS) (n = 2). There were considerable variations in terms of characteristics of patients included, setting of recruitment, type of tests used, duration of follow-up and outcome measures of interest. The majority of the studies were classified as having "fair" or "poor" methodological quality.

Conclusions

There is a limited number of studies examining the prognostic value of simple measures of physical function and muscle strength in relation to exacerbations, hospitalizations and mortality in individuals with COPD. To date, the HGS and 1-min STS tests are the most studied tests and seem to be suitable for prognosis purposes in individuals with COPD. However, more studies with better methodological quality are needed to confirm these findings.

Resistance (anaerobic) strength training — Resistance training improves strength of major muscle groups with a focus on core musculature for posture and balance stability, and during negative caloric balance it can help mitigate muscle loss and limit reduced resting metabolic rate. Short-term muscle soreness may be expected, whereas sore joints suggest poor technique and potential need for medical evaluation and activity modification.

### Resistance training for people with stroke [^517355f8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Levels of physical activity and physical fitness are low after stroke. Low muscle strength is common, particularly on the affected side, and is associated with post-stroke disability. Resistance training exercise interventions could increase muscle strength, improve physical function and reduce disability, and may benefit secondary prevention.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review is to determine whether resistance training after stroke has any effects on death, disability, adverse events, risk factors, fitness, walking, and indices of physical function when compared to a non-exercise control.

Search Methods

In January 2024, we searched nine databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, WoS, PEDro and DORIS) and two trial registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP), together with reference checking, citation tracking and contact with experts in the field, to identify eligible studies.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing resistance training interventions with comparators of either usual care, no intervention, or a non-exercise intervention in people with stroke.

Outcomes

Our critical outcome domains were death, disability, adverse events, risk factors, fitness, walking and indices of physical function. We assessed outcomes at the end of intervention and at the end of the longest follow-up. Our other important outcome domains were indices of quality of life, mood, cognition and fatigue.

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias 1.0 tool to assess bias in the included studies.

Synthesis Methods

Where possible, we synthesised results for each outcome at the end of the intervention and at the end of follow-up using random-effects meta-analyses on arm-level data. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk difference (RD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we calculated a mean difference (MD), or standardised mean difference (SMD), and 95% CI. For outcomes not analysed using meta-analysis, we followed the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) guidance. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for critical outcomes.

Included Studies

We included a total of 27 studies with 1004 participants, with an average age of 62 years. Most studies recruited ambulatory participants (18/27) during the sub-acute (10/27) and chronic (16/27) stages of recovery living in high-income countries (18/27). Most study interventions lacked a balanced dose of control exposure (17/27). A follow-up period was included in 8/27 studies (mean 9.9 months; range 2 to 48 months). Interventions typically involved exercise machines (16/27) or bodyweight exercises (10/27) delivered two to three days per week for between two and 12 weeks, which progressed on the basis of intensity and/or volume.

Synthesis Of Results

Resistance training does not increase (or decrease) deaths at the end of intervention (risk difference RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.02; I² = 0%; 24 studies, 880 participants; high-certainty) or follow-up (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.05; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 202 participants; high-certainty). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of resistance training on indices of disability at the end of intervention (standardised mean difference SMD 0.55, 95% CI -0.24 to 1.33; 1 study, 26 participants; very low-certainty). There is a moderate-sized effect (SMD > 0.5) but there was only one small study. No data were available at follow-up. Resistance training may have little or no effect on the incidence of secondary cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (all-cause) at the end of intervention (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.31; 1 study, 10 participants; very low-certainty). There was only one small study. No data were available at follow-up. Resistance training may reduce systolic blood pressure (mmHg) at the end of intervention, but the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference MD -5.00, 95% CI -34.42 to 24.42; 1 study, 22 participants; very low-certainty). There was only one small study. No data were available at follow-up. Resistance training probably improves multiple indices of musculoskeletal fitness at the end of intervention (overall moderate-certainty). Improvements in muscle strength occurred in the legs on the affected (moderate effect SMD > 0.5) and least affected sides (large effect SMD > 0.8), and both arms (moderate effect SMD > 0.5) although the evidence is less certain on the affected arm. Overall, there were very few data at the end of follow-up and overall effects were very uncertain. Resistance training probably results in little or no beneficial effect on comfortable walking speed (m/sec) at the end of intervention (MD -0.00, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.07; I² = 43%; 6 studies, 212 participants; moderate-certainty) or the end of follow-up (MD 0.12, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.26; 1 study, 93 participants; low-certainty). Resistance training may improve indices of balance slightly (small effect SMD > 0.2) at the end of intervention (SMD 0.45, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.80; I² = 24%; 5 studies, 190 participants; low-certainty) and end of follow-up (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.85; 1 study, 93 participants; low-certainty). There was no evidence concerning adverse effects attributable to participating in resistance training interventions. Adherence was good, although there were some dropouts attributable to the resistance training intervention. Overall, evidence certainty was limited by imprecision and risk of bias concerns.

Authors' Conclusions

Resistance training does not affect mortality at the end of intervention or after follow-up. We could not draw conclusions about resistance training effects on disability, secondary prevention of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events or the risk of these because the data were inadequate. Resistance training probably increases muscle strength in the arms and legs, particularly on the unaffected side at the end of intervention. There was little or no effect on comfortable walking speed, possibly because the interventions were insufficiently task-related to walking. However, there may be a small improvement in balance which persists at follow-up. Resistance training interventions were adhered to without serious adverse events or adverse effects, but may not be acceptable to everyone. Inadequate data at follow-up prevented conclusions about retention of benefits. Further well-designed randomised trials are needed to determine the optimal exercise prescription, the benefits and long-term effects.

Evidence quality and recommendation strength — The Work Group used the GRADE approach to craft each recommendation and determine its strength, and per the GRADE approach, recommendations must be evidence based and cannot be made based on expert opinion alone. The GRADE approach uses domains to inform recommendation strength: confidence in the quality of the evidence; balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes; patient values and preferences; and other considerations, as appropriate (e.g., resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, subgroup considerations). Using these four domains, the Work Group determined the relative strength of each recommendation (Strong or Weak), and the strength of a recommendation is defined as the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh its undesirable effects. A Strong recommendation generally indicates High or Moderate confidence in the quality of the available evidence, a clear difference in magnitude between the benefits and harms of an intervention, similar patient values and preferences, and understood influence of other implications (e.g., resource use, feasibility). When evidence is insufficient, the Work Group might include a statement of insufficient evidence, might decide to exclude this type of statement, might remain silent where an absence of evidence occurs for a rarely used intervention, or that an intervention might have a favorable balance of benefits and harms but might be a standard of care for which no recent evidence has been generated.

Physical performance measures according to the gender-specific quartiles of grip strength in elderly patients with a lower grip strength (less than the median), < 33.9 kg for males and < 19.9 kg for females

Finally, clinical characteristics and physical performance measures were compared between those with and without a low physical performance, defined by AWGS, in patients with low grip strength (table 4). Male patients with a low performance (n = 38, 15.0%) demonstrated a significantly older age, lower grip strength, lower serum albumin, higher albuminuria and prevalence of stroke, and poorer physical performance measures. If limited to male patients with grip strength < 28 kg, those with a low performance comprised 12.3% (12/97), and the statistical power became weak but showed a similar trend. Similar results in female patients, besides the stroke prevalence, were observed.

Primary Outcomes

The main model for physical function (33 outcomes across 13 RCTs with 383 participants [median, 2; range, 1–8 outcomes per study]) revealed a small SMD (0.30; 95% CI, 0.05–0.54), with moderate heterogeneity (Q = 47.04; P = 0.04; I² = 48; low certainty) (Figure 2). The main model for self-reported physical function (4 outcomes across 3 studies including 85 participants: median, 1; range, 1–2 outcomes per study) revealed a small SMD favoring PT (SMD, 0.38; 95% CI, –0.62 to 1.37), with moderate heterogeneity (Q = 3.41, P = 0.33; I² = 32%; low certainty) (Figure 3).

Impact of aerobic, resistance, and combined exercise on glycemic management in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D): Vigorous aerobic exercise training for 7 d may improve glycemia without lowering body weight; meta-analyses report 0.5%–0.7% reductions in hemoglobin A1C (A1C) with regular aerobic training, and regular training improves insulin sensitivity, lipids, blood pressure, other metabolic parameters, and fitness levels, even without weight loss; resistance exercise training typically results in 10%–15% improvements in strength, bone mineral density, blood pressure, lipid profiles, skeletal muscle mass, and insulin sensitivity, and a meta-analysis suggests high-intensity resistance training is more beneficial than low-to-moderate-intensity training for overall glucose management and attenuation of insulin levels; combined aerobic and resistance training may be superior to either alone, with trials noting greater A1C reduction compared with either type alone and significant A1C improvements versus nonexercising controls when neither single modality changed A1C.

Strength and frailty — diminishing strength and frailty consistently predict a poor prognosis with progressive functional decline and increased mortality, and these conditions can be assessed by physical tests or questionnaires. The Short Physical Performance Battery combines chair stands, gait speed, and balance tests to monitor physical strength and function in older adults and has been shown to be a valid predictor of mortality, nursing home admission, and disability. The Johns Hopkins Frailty Assessment Calculator assesses frailty based on unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, low energy expenditure, low grip strength, and/or slow walking speed. The Clinical Frailty Scale uses a 9-point scale that summarizes patient fitness or frailty and can help determine if a patient is at risk for poor outcomes; it is also available as an infographic that may assist with communication between clinicians and patients.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^e4765a0d]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Key points — Biological sex is a determinant of athletic performance; adult males are faster, stronger, and more powerful than females, and the fastest and most powerful males outperform the fastest and most powerful females. The sex difference in athletic performance where endurance or muscular power is required is ~ 10%–30%, and women's improvement has exceeded men's over the last 100 yr. Exposure to high levels of endogenous testosterone at the onset of male puberty (~ 12 yr) is identified as the primary determinant of the large sex difference during puberty and adulthood, whereas before puberty the sex difference is minimal. Testosterone increases ~ 20–30-fold in males during puberty and is 15× higher than adult females, and testosterone addition in females increases muscle mass, muscle fiber size, hemoglobin concentration and mass, strength, and endurance performance.

### Physical activity across adulthood and physical performance in midlife: findings from a British birth cohort [^4802e36d]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Maintaining physical performance and muscle strength with age is important given that lower levels in older populations are associated with increased risk of subsequent health problems, loss of independence, and shorter survival times. As the global population ages, there is a growing need to identify modifiable factors across life that influence physical performance and strength in later life. Such factors may influence the peak achieved in earlier life or the timing and rate of subsequent decline. It is therefore necessary to elucidate whether the effects of these factors accumulate across life or are more influential during sensitive periods when intervention to maintain or improve performance and strength is likely to be most beneficial.

Observational and intervention studies suggest that physical activity is a potentially important modifiable factor associated with physical performance and strength in older age. However, many of the existing observational studies are cross-sectional, so findings could be explained by reverse causality. In addition, few studies have examined the effect of physical activity earlier in life on physical performance and strength in mid to late adulthood and those that have are limited by the retrospective ascertainment of prior physical activity levels. It is therefore unclear whether the beneficial effects of physical activity accumulate over life or whether there are sensitive periods when physical activity is more beneficial.

Using data from a British birth cohort, the aim of the present study was to examine whether leisure-time physical activity levels at three ages across adulthood were associated with physical performance and strength in midlife. Another aim was to examine whether there was evidence of cumulative benefits of physical activity across adulthood or of sensitive periods when the impact of physical activity was greater than during other periods.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^9bce3ed8]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

Post-operative physical therapy after surgical treatment of osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is addressed as follows: In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the work group that patients who have received surgical treatment of OCD be offered the option of post-operative physical therapy. Strength of Recommendation: Consensus. The supporting evidence is lacking and requires the work group to make a recommendation based on expert opinion by considering the known potential harm and benefits associated with the treatment, and the work group is issuing a recommendation consistent with current practice. Patients who receive surgical interventions for OCD of the knee may experience impairments such as loss of motion, strength deficits, altered movement patterns, and post-operative effusion. It is not possible to determine whether patients should be offered supervised or unsupervised therapy, but there are minimal risks associated with physical therapy, which, given its potential benefits, also argues for offering it to patients. Practitioners should be flexible in deciding whether to follow a recommendation classified as Consensus, although they may give it preference over alternatives, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. There is no evidence to address this recommendation.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^e42ad7b7]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Physical therapy for hip and knee osteoarthritis — recommendation and scope — states: We suggest offering physical therapy as part of a comprehensive management plan for patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee (Weak for | Reviewed, Amended). Extensive literature exists to support the use of physical therapy as a core treatment in the comprehensive management of patients with OA of the hip or knee, and an RCT by Deyle et al. (2020) in a military health system favored the physical therapy group on both primary and secondary outcome measures at one year; however, since this study was not included in this CPG's systematic evidence review, it did not impact the strength of this recommendation. An individualized physical therapy management plan can reduce pain and improve function in patients with hip or knee OA and, therefore, augment medical and pharmacologic approaches, and physical therapists may utilize both manual physical therapy treatments and prescribed exercises, with manual techniques such as soft tissue mobilization, joint manipulation, and joint mobilization; physical therapists also provide patients with education related to pain, lifestyle, and activity modifications.

### The effectiveness of unsupervised home-based exercise for improving lower extremity physical function in older adults in Western and Eastern cultures: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^aece4a78]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The number of people over the age of 65 is expected to more than double by 2050. Specifically, according to the World Health Organization, the number of older adults in the European region and Asia region are forecast to increase by 11% and 12.3% from 2010 to 2050 respectively. Ageing is associated with physiological deterioration, for example muscle function decline, mobility and functional balance decline, and an increased risk of osteoporosis and/or sarcopenia caused by physical inactivity. These physical declines can lead to higher risk of falls and hospitalisation, and ultimately loss of independence. As societies become 'super-aged' (with over 20% of total populations aged over 65), prevalence of health related issues are predicted to rise, impacting quality of life and straining healthcare resources. Interventions that support adults to maintain robust physical function in later life are essential for improving wellbeing and minimising the economic burden of physical frailty and associated morbidity.

Regular physical exercise is recommended to prevent a loss of physical function, maintain activities of daily living, and decrease disability in older adults. Research has explored the effect of exercise on physical fitness, balance, falls, and well-being in older adults, revealing that progressive resistance training significantly improves muscle strength and performance. The trainer-led 'Otago' exercise programme for example, focusing on leg strength and balance, has been shown to improve mobility, balance, and muscle strength, and reduced falling risk and mortality. Multicomponent exercises, including strength, endurance, and balance training, effectively maintained or even improved lower limb physical function in older adults, especially in those who are diagnosed as frail. In fact, even endurance exercise alone, which would not typically be expected to improve strength related outcomes, enhanced muscle functions in older adults with minimal strength. Accordingly, functional/strength improvements might be a biproduct of any exercise programmes in older populations. It is clear that all forms of exercise bring benefits in physical fitness in older adults with different physical activity levels.

### Progressive resistance strength training for physical disability in older people [^31abf44e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Muscle weakness in old age, is associated with physical disability and an increased risk of falls. Progressive resistance strength (PRT) training exercises (i.e. movements performed against a specific external force that is regularly increased during training) are designed to increase strength in older people.

Objectives

To assess the effect of PRT on measures of physical disability, functional limitation and impairment in older people, and identify adverse events.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialized register (to August 2002), CENTRAL/CCTR (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to February 1, 2002), EMBASE (1980 to February 1, 2002), CINAHL (1982 to February 1, 2002), Sports Discus (1948 to February 1, 2002), PEDro - The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (accessed February 1, 2002) and Digital Dissertations (accessed February 1, 2002). We also searched reference lists of articles, reviewed conference abstracts and contacted authors.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of PRT alone for older people (i.e. mean age of 60 or over) were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Weighted mean differences (WMD) were obtained using fixed or random effect models as appropriate. When measures with different units were pooled, standardised mean differences (SMD) were calculated. Relative risks were calculated for dichotomous outcomes.

Main Results

Sixty-six trials with 3783 participants were included. Most studies were small and of poor quality. PRT had a large positive effect on strength (41 trials, 1955 participants), but there was statistical heterogeneity that was not explained by differences in study quality, participant characteristics or the exercise program. Some functional limitation measures showed modest improvements (i.e.g.ait speed, 14 trials, 798 participants, WMD 0.07 m/s, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.09). However, there was no evidence that PRT had an effect on physical disability when activity measures or health related quality of life measures (HRQOL) were assessed (10 trials, 798 participants, SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.16). Adverse events were poorly recorded, but musculoskeletal injuries were detected in most of the studies that prospectively defined and monitored these events.

Reviewer's Conclusions

PRT appears to be an effective intervention to increase strength in older people and has a positive effect on some functional limitations. However, the effect of this intervention on more substantive outcomes such as measures of disability or HRQOL remains unclear. It is difficult to determine the balance of risks and benefits of PRT because adverse events have generally been poorly collected and recorded.

### Objectively measured physical capability levels and mortality: systematic review and meta-analysis [^00c853e8]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Statistical methods

We based analyses on the standard requested results if they had been provided, using published results when requested results were not available. If necessary, we converted effect estimates for a per unit change in grip strength to a per 1 kg increase in grip strength.

When more than three sets of comparable results were available, we did random effects meta-analyses. We ran these analyses first on the sex and age adjusted estimates and then with additional adjustment for body size. We then added estimates from models with alternative adjustments into the meta-analysis for those studies (n = 4) for which standard adjustments were not available; this was the case only for analyses of per unit change in grip strength. In all these initial analyses, we used the combined sex adjusted effects for men and women when they were available and the sex specific estimates only when they were not. We used I 2 and Q statistics to investigate between study heterogeneity. We examined potential sources of heterogeneity, including sex, mean age of study participants, length of follow-up, and region of study (as pre-specified in the protocol), by stratifying meta-analyses by each of these factors and by doing meta-regression analyses when we had more than 10 sets of results. We used permutation tests to obtain P values corrected for multiple testing. We also re-ran the main meta-analyses with each study removed in turn to check that no one study was explaining any heterogeneity found. We examined funnel plots to assess publication bias. We also used the tests proposed by Egger and colleagues and Begg and Mazumdar for this purpose.

### Effect of physical activity versus health education on physical function, grip strength and mobility [^04b8ff37]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Physical activity (PA) reduces the rate of mobility disability, compared with health education (HE), in at risk older adults. It is important to understand aspects of performance contributing to this benefit.

Objective

To evaluate intervention effects on tertiary physical performance outcomes.

Design

The Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) was a multi-centered, single-blind randomized trial of older adults.

Setting

Eight field centers throughout the United States.

Participants

1635 adults aged 78.9 ± 5.2 years, 67.2% women at risk for mobility disability (Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB] < 10).

Interventions

Moderate PA including walking, resistance and balance training compared with HE consisting of topics relevant to older adults.

Outcomes

Grip strength, SPPB score and its components (balance, 4 m gait speed, and chair-stands), as well as 400 m walking speed.

Results

Total SPPB score was higher in PA versus HE across all follow-up times (overall P = 0.04) as was the chair-stand component (overall P < .001). No intervention effects were observed for balance (overall P = 0.12), 4 m gait speed (overall P = 0.78), or grip strength (overall P = 0.62). However, 400 m walking speed was faster in PA versus HE group (overall P = < .001). In separate models, 29% of the rate reduction of major mobility disability in the PA versus HE group was explained by change in SPPB score, while 39% was explained by change in the chair stand component.

Conclusion

Lower extremity performance (SPPB) was significantly higher in the PA compared with HE group. Changes in chair-stand score explained a considerable portion of the effect of PA on the reduction of major mobility disability-consistent with the idea that preserving muscle strength/power may be important for the prevention of major mobility disability.

### Importance of strength training for sustaining performance and health in military personnel [^611f622c]. BMJ Military Health (2025). High credibility.

One size does not fit all

Strength training responses and adaptations may vary enormously between individuals. Variation may be due to age, training status, sex, genetic and environmental factorsas well as nutrition. Strength training generally improves physical performance where adaptations may be specific to the strength training programmes (including exercise choice, load and velocity of movements, ie, strength/power vs strength/hypertrophy). The magnitude of sex differences in physical performance measures is reported to decrease after strength training in femaleswhereas in females, upper-body and total-body resistance training may yield similar improvements in occupational task performances, especially those involving the upper body. Nevertheless, an emphasis on whole-body resistance training rather than upper-body training is recommended.

Individual variation in physical fitness including maximal strength and muscle fitness development exists in many of the military environments. The commencement of military service is typically a physically demanding period for recruits and conscripts, and the existing evidence clearly shows an inverse correlation between baseline physical fitness and development of fitness during initial training. Specifically, those commencing military training with lower physical fitness tend to have a higher risk for injury incidenceand demonstrate greater training gains when compared with those with higher fitness. This is not surprising given the fixed course programmes (eg, fixed number and duration of physical training lessons) and the group training environment. However, there is an opportunity for military organisations to adopt more contemporary physical conditioning methodsto increase individualisation and yield greater gains in physical fitness across the entire cohort. Individual responses have also been reported during the early career of professional warfightersand while on deployment.

In the military context, that is, in a multistressor environment, careful planning, periodisation and progressive physical fitness training can help warfighters to reach required performance levels for specific occupational tasks before missions and operations while simultaneously benefiting warfighters' long-term health. As such, strength training should be tailored, when possible, to task-specific demands and to the individual as well as to the environment. Furthermore, before long deployments, where there are often limited opportunities for physical training, it is important to create a sufficient buffer so that possible detraining does not compromise warfighters' ability to perform key tasks.

### Sarcopenia [^2d7ac49a]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on sarcopenia:

- **Definition**: Sarcopenia is defined as a progressive and generalized skeletal muscle disorder characterized by accelerated loss of muscle mass and function.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of sarcopenia involves age-related structural changes and mechanisms at cellular and subcellular levels, including qualitative changes in posttranslational modifications of muscle proteins, loss of coordinated control between contractile, mitochondrial, and sarcoplasmic reticulum protein expression, and progressive loss of motoneurons leading to reduced muscle fiber number and size.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults ranges from 9.9% to 40.4%, depending on the definition used. The prevalence of sarcopenia is reported to be 25–35% in patients with cancer and 40–70% in patients with liver cirrhosis.
- **Risk factors**: The primary risk factors for sarcopenia include advancing age, a sedentary lifestyle, inadequate nutrition, and certain chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and liver cirrhosis.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, sarcopenia presents with decreased muscle strength, impaired physical performance, and an overall decline in functional abilities. It can lead to reduced mobility, diminished QoL, and increased risk of fall-related injuries.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Sarcopenia is associated with adverse outcomes, including falls, functional decline, frailty, and a significantly higher risk of mortality, independent of population and sarcopenia definition.

### Lower grip strength and insufficient physical activity can increase depressive symptoms among middle-aged and older European adults: a longitudinal study [^8e4525d3]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The present study aimed to identify the gender-specific trajectories of grip strength using group-based trajectories, explore the interaction between grip strength and physical activity on depression, and investigate the association of physical activity with the change in depression by different grip strength groups among middle-aged and older European adults.

Methods

A total of 14,098 participants aged 50 years or older from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe 2007–2019 were included in this study. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify the low, middle and high group of grip strength by gender. Generalized estimated equations were fitted to analyze the interaction effect. The data of wave 2-wave 5 and wave 2-wave 7 were chosen to conduct sensitivity analyses.

Results

Significant interactions between grip strength group and physical inactivity were found (x 2 interaction = 11.16, P = 0.004). Significant interactions between physical inactivity and time on depression were identified in low (x 2 interaction = 27.83, P < 0.001) and moderate (x 2 interaction = 23.67, P < 0.001) grip strength, but a similar result was not found in high grip strength (x 2 interaction = 4.39, P = 0.495). Participants in the physical inactivity group had higher depression scores in the low and moderate grip strength groups. Sensitivity analyses yield almost similar results.

Conclusions

Grip strength and physical inactivity interact with depression. Lower grip strength and insufficient physical activity can increase depressive symptoms. People with lower grip strength and physical inactivity should pay special attention to the prevention of depression.

### Strong implications but weak evidence for strength training [^4c33cfd6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

During follow‐up, just 21% of women (6100 women) engaged in any strength training and just 10% (2894 women) spent at least 1 h/wk in strength training. In contrast, almost half of the participants participated in at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week (n = 13 702). During an average of 12 years of follow‐up, there were 3055 deaths (10.6%), with almost twice as many cancer deaths (748 cancer deaths) compared with CVD deaths (411 CVD deaths). There were 603 confirmed other causes of death, and the rest have not yet been ascertained; however, there was no difference in amount of strength training in this group compared with the group with known cause of death.

The authors reported a linear association between physical activity and all‐cause mortality, consistent with prior literature. In contrast, there was no linear association between strength training and all‐cause mortality. Compared with those who did no strength training, those with 1 to 19 min/wk had a 27% lower risk of death (Relative Risk (RR), 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65–0.82), those with 20 to 50 min/wk had a 29% lower risk of death (RR, 0.71; CI, 0.62–0.82), those with 60 to 149 min/wk had a 19% lower risk of death (RR, 0.81; CI, 0.67–0.97), and those with 150 min/wk or more had no difference in risk of death (RR, 1.10; CI, 0.77–1.56). Although there was no linear association between increasing strength training groups and death (P = 0.36), there was a significant quadratic trend (P < 0.001). Spline models were fit, which suggested a J‐shaped association, with those engaging in some strength training having a mortality benefit (although the CIs are wide) and those engaging in > 2.5 h/wk having no benefit or an increased risk of mortality compared with women who did no strength training.

### Strong implications but weak evidence for strength training [^2614b9ae]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Looking specifically at the relative risk of cardiovascular‐specific death, there was a 35% decreased risk of death in women who engaged in 1 to 59 min/wk of strength training compared with those who did none (RR, 0.65; CI, 0.5–0.85), with a similar point estimate of risk. There was no statistically significant difference in those with > 60 min/wk of strength training (RR, 0.72; CI, 0.42–1.22). Like the relationship observed between strength training and all‐cause mortality, there was a nonlinear relationship seen with strength training and cardiovascular death, with a decreased risk of cardiovascular death with moderate amounts of strength training but no additional benefit in risk of death with high levels of strength training when compared with those who did no strength training (P = 0.007 for the quadratic association). There were no associations observed between time spent in strength training and cancer mortality.

Finally, the authors looked at the combined effect of aerobic physical activity and strength training. Women who engaged in physical activity (≥ 150 min/wk) and any strength training had a lower all‐cause and CVD‐specific mortality than those women who engaged in physical activity or strength training alone and also compared with those who did neither physical activity nor strength training. This additive benefit was not seen with cancer‐related deaths. This relationship between physical activity and strength training is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1
The benefit of aerobic physical activity increases with time spent engaged in aerobic physical activity. For strength training, some is better than none, but whether there is a benefit of longer time spent in strength training is unknown. Together, the benefits of strength training and aerobic activity are greater than either alone.

In selected diseases or conditions, physical anomalies or patient frailty may limit the clinician's ability to obtain the typical anthropometric measurements used to assess growth, and a number of alternate measurements have been used in such instances to estimate weight and length.

### Physical activity levels across adult life and grip strength in early old age: updating findings from a British birth cohort [^be728957]. Age and Ageing (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study has shown evidence of cumulative benefits of increased LTPA across mid-life on grip strength at age 60–64 years. Four other observational studies were identified which had investigated the influence of physical activity on strength at similar ages. In three, there was < 5 years between the physical activity and strength assessments. The fourth found no association between physical activity at mean age 43 and change in grip strength between mean ages 43 and 64, although becoming sedentary over this period was associated with an accelerated decline in strength. A previous study within the NSHD at age 53 did not find evidence of a cumulative benefit of LTPA and the fact that one has now emerged suggests that LTPA may prevent decline in grip strength in early old age. Additional analyses support this, with those in the upper third of the cumulative LTPA score to age 53 being less likely than those in the lower third to experience decline in grip strength between 53 and 60–64: odds ratio of decline 0.66 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.92).

Strengths of this study include prospective collection of self-reported LTPA data at multiple ages and the use of an outcome measure that has been shown to predict major ageing outcomes. A potential source of bias is the attrition that has occurred in the cohort; however, the earlier null findings at age 53 were unchanged when repeated using the current smaller sample.

This observational study provides additional evidence in support of guidelines which recommend that physical activity should be maintained across adult life.

Key points

Intervention studies demonstrate benefits of specific types of exercise for muscle strength in older age.
Few studies have examined associations between physical activity across mid-life and strength at age 60 or greater.
This study has shown evidence of a cumulative benefit of greater activity across mid-life on grip strength at age 60–64.
This suggests that mid-life physical activity may prevent decline in grip strength in early old age.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (physical activity), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to advise physical activity in all young patients with T1DM with the goal of 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic activity daily, with vigorous muscle-strengthening and bone-strengthening activities at least 3 days per week.

### Physical activity across adulthood and physical performance in midlife: findings from a British birth cohort [^f726e289]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence, mainly from cross-sectional studies, suggests that physical activity is a potentially important modifiable factor associated with physical performance and strength in older age. It is unclear whether the benefits of physical activity accumulate across life or whether there are sensitive periods when physical activity is more influential.

Purpose

To examine the associations of leisure-time physical activity across adulthood with physical performance and strength in midlife, and to test whether there are cumulative benefits of physical activity.

Methods

Using data on approximately 2400 men and women from the UK Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development, followed up since birth in March 1946, the associations of physical activity levels during leisure time self-reported prospectively at ages 36, 43, and 53 years with grip strength, standing balance, and chair rise times, assessed by nurses at age 53 years (in 1999), were examined in 2010.

Results

There were independent positive effects of physical activity at all three ages on chair rise performance, and at ages 43 and 53 years on standing balance performance, even after adjusting for covariates. These results were supported by evidence of cumulative effects found when using structured life course models. Physical activity and grip strength were not associated in women and, in men, only physical activity at age 53 years was associated with grip strength.

Conclusions

There are cumulative benefits of physical activity across adulthood on physical performance in midlife. Increased activity should be promoted early in adulthood to ensure the maintenance of physical performance in later life.

### Distinguishing four components underlying physical activity: a new approach to using physical activity questionnaire data in old age [^0fecf79d]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

The aim of this methodological study was to propose a new approach to use physical activity data of older persons obtained by questionnaire. Four underlying components of physical activity were distinguished based on literature and expert consultation, including intensity, muscle strength, mechanical strain and turning action components. Results from the factor analyses showed that the mechanical strain and turning actions components indeed were distinct factors, but intensity and muscle strength loaded onto a single factor. Therefore, three underlying components of physical activity could be distinguished. Using these components in future research may help our understanding of the association between physical activity and health in old age, which will ultimately lead to a more specific and tailored physical activity advice for older persons.

The intensity, mechanical strain and turning action component scores were based on previously developed scores which were slightly adapted. The muscle strength component score was developed and validated against actual measurements of muscle strength. Although these concepts are clearly related, it should be kept in mind that the questionnaire asks what a person does while the strength measure reflects what a person is able to do. The results showed that a high strength component score was indeed correlated with higher values of quadriceps strength and hand grip strength. However, construct validity was limited because of the high correlation of the muscle strength component score as well as the intensity component score with measured muscle strength. This was confirmed by the results of the factor analysis, showing that the intensity component and the muscle strength component loaded on a single factor. Additional factor analyses in different subgroups of older adults consistently confirmed this.

### The importance of physical function as a clinical outcome: assessment and enhancement [^764e9ed4]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

It is known that caloric intake declines with increasing age, further exacerbated by the appetite changes, and decreased hunger sensation occurring with age. 64, 65, 66 This reduced energy intake can lead to inadequate protein, vitamin, and mineral intake, and resulting clinical or subclinical nutritional deficiencies which can adversely affect health and function. 67 Sarcopenia and frailty often co‐exist with malnutrition in older adults. 68, 69 Proper nutritional supplementation may be able to augment functional decline, thereby delaying or preventing functional disability. Research is ongoing into the importance of nutrition in muscle mass, strength and function in older adults. Currently, the strongest evidence exists for dietary protein in addition to physical activity in muscle protein synthesis. 64 Low protein intake has been linked to loss of muscle mass and strength in older age, 70, 71, 72 with suggestion that higher protein intake is associated with preserved muscle strength. 72 However studies on the effect of protein supplementation on function show mixed results and thus, research is ongoing.

Over a third of older adults over the age of 65 years in the United States are obese, with obesity worsening age‐related functional decline and frailty. 73, 74 There has been concern that weight loss in older adults may inadvertently result in increased risk of malnutrition and sarcopenia. This was studied by Villareal et al, who randomly assigned 160 obese older adults, aged 65 years and older, to weight management plus aerobic training, resistance training or combination aerobic and resistance training, or the control group of weight management without exercise, with the primary outcome of change in the physical performance test score. 75 Physical performance increased the most when weight loss was combined with aerobic and resistance training, but all the exercise arms experienced a greater improvement in physical performance than the control group without exercise (P < .001 for all comparisons). This has been further investigated at the cellular level by Colleluori et al, who found that in obese older adults undergoing weight loss, combination aerobic, and resistance exercise resulted in superior muscle synthesis and muscle quality than either mode of exercise alone, after comparing muscle biopsies at baseline and 6 months. 76

### Hand pain and sensory deficits: carpal tunnel syndrome [^47316297]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) — strength measures for physical impairment: Clinicians should not use lateral pinch strength as an outcome measure for patients with nonsurgically or surgically managed CTS. Clinicians should not use grip strength when assessing short-term (less than 3 months) change in individuals following CTR surgery. Clinicians may assess grip strength and 3-point or tip pinch strength in individuals presenting with signs and symptoms of CTS and compare scores with established norms. There is conflicting evidence on the use of tip and 3-point pinch strength and abductor pollicis brevis muscle strength testing in individuals following CTR surgery.

### The benefits of strength training for older adults [^4efd020f]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Aging is associated with a number of physiologic and functional declines that can contribute to increased disability, frailty, and falls. Contributing factors are the loss of muscle mass and strength as age increases, a phenomenon called sarcopenia. Sarcopenia can result or be exacerbated by certain chronic conditions, and can also increase the burden of chronic disease. Current research has demonstrated that strength-training exercises have the ability to combat weakness and frailty and their debilitating consequences. Done regularly (e.g., 2 to 3 days per week), these exercises build muscle strength and muscle mass and preserve bone density, independence, and vitality with age. In addition, strength training also has the ability to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and the signs and symptoms of numerous chronic diseases such as heart disease, arthritis, and type 2 diabetes, while also improving sleep and reducing depression. This paper reviews the current research on strength training and older adults, evaluating exercise protocols in a variety of populations. It is clear that a variety of strength-training prescriptions from highly controlled laboratory-based to minimally supervised home-based programs have the ability to elicit meaningful health benefits in older adults. The key challenges as this field of exercise science moves forward are to best identify the most appropriate strength-training recommendations for older adults and to greatly increase the access to safe and effective programs in a variety of settings.

### ISHLT consensus statement on the perioperative use of ECLS in lung transplantation: part I: preoperative considerations [^683f85d1]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

ISHLT ECLS bridge-to-transplant physical therapy — role, risk–benefit, and modalities are delineated. Physical therapy has been shown to prevent and reduce ICU-acquired muscle weakness and improve functional capacity in critically ill patients, and physical therapy is an essential therapeutic intervention for all ECMO BTT patients. The risks may outweigh the benefits of physical therapy and or exercise rehabilitation in some patients; however, developing appropriate strategies of physical therapy and or exercise rehabilitation in patients requiring ECMO BTT may be an important component of maintaining a patient's transplant candidacy. After a thorough risk benefit assessment, the feasibility and appropriateness of different physical therapy and or exercise rehabilitation modalities should be assessed. Interventions may include strengthening and reconditioning exercises in supine, sitting and or standing, progress to mobilization, and active/active-assisted in-bed cycling as medical stability and the ECLS system allows, and other interventions may include functional electrical stimulation of lower limb muscles to preserve muscle mass and strength.

### Respiratory muscle strength, exercise capacity and physical activity in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia: a cross-sectional study [^736d3513]. Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The pathophysiological mechanisms of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) may affect many functions, including respiratory, physical, and health status. This study aimed to compare respiratory muscle strength, inspiratory muscle endurance, muscle strength, exercise capacity, physical activity levels, and quality of life in PCD patients and controls.

Methods

Twenty-seven patients and 28 controls were included. Respiratory muscle strength (maximal inspiratory (MIP) and maximal expiratory (MEP) pressures), inspiratory muscle endurance (incremental threshold loading test), muscle strength (quadriceps femoris, shoulder abductor, elbow flexor, handgrip), exercise capacity (6-min walk test (6MWT)), physical activity and quality of life (QOL-PCD) were evaluated.

Results

MIP, inspiratory muscle endurance, quadriceps femoris, and handgrip muscle strength, 6MWT distance, total energy expenditure; childrens' (6–12 years) and their parents' physical function, upper, lower respiratory, and hearing symptoms and treatment burden QOL-PCD subscales scores were significantly lower in patients compared with controls (p < 0.05). The 66.7% of patients did not meet the optimal number of steps. MEP, shoulder abductor, and elbow flexor muscle strength, active energy expenditure, physical activity duration, average metabolic equivalents, number of steps, lying time, and sleep duration; childrens' and their parents' other subscales and adolescents' all QOL-PCD subscales scores were similar between groups (p > 0.05).

Conclusion

Inspiratory muscle strength and endurance, lower extremity and total muscle strength, exercise capacity, total energy expenditure, and childrens' quality of life are impaired compared to healthy controls. Decreased physical activity level is prevalent in these patients. Effects of pulmonary rehabilitation on these impaired outcomes for PCD patients should be investigated.

### Muscle strength and physical activity are associated with self-rated health in an adult Danish population [^3c103f86]. Preventive Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe associations of muscle strength, physical activity and self-rated health.

Method

Isometric muscle strength by maximal handgrip strength (HGS) or muscle strength by 30s repeated chair stand test (30s-CS) was combined with leisure time physical activity. Using logistic regression odds ratio was calculated for good self-rated health according to the combined associations among 16,539 participants (59.7% women), mean age 51.9 (SD: 13.8) years, from a cross-sectional study in Denmark 2007–2008.

Results

Good self-rated health was positively associated with higher levels of physical activity and greater muscle strength. Regarding HGS the highest OR for good self-rated health was in the moderate/vigorous physically active participants with high HGS (OR = 6.84, 95% CI: 4.85–9.65 and OR = 7.34, 95% CI: 5.42–9.96 for men and women, respectively). Similarly the highest OR for good self-rated health was in the moderate/vigorous physically active participants with high scores in the 30s-CS test (6.06, 95% CI: 4.32–8.50 and 13.38, 95% CI: 9.59–18.67 for men and women, respectively). The reference groups were sedentary participants with low strength (HGS or 30s-CS).

Conclusion

The combined score for physical activity level with either HGS or 30s-CS was strongly positively associated with self-related health.

### Strong implications but weak evidence for strength training [^1e9dbd19]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The study by Kamada et al 17 is intriguing in the suggestion that for healthy people, moderate amounts of strength training are better than no strength training but that there might be an amount that is "too much". It also raises questions about the most appropriate recommendation for the general public. However, there are several limitations to this report. First, strength training was gathered from a single question on one questionnaire and is subject to biases inherent in questionnaires. In addition, it is not clear how this simple question corresponds to the current recommendations for strength training (eg, 2 to 3 times a week), and the specific types of strength training activities are also unknown. Second, the total number of fatalities is small, especially at higher amounts of strength training (≥ 60 min/wk), and the CIs are wide, so it is hard to really draw conclusions about the benefits of strength training, even in the moderate group (1–59 min/wk). Is there a real J‐shaped relationship here or just fancy statistics? Finally, the population included was all women, and > 95% of participants were white, so these results may not be fully generalizable.

### ACSM expert consensus statement: considerations and recommendations for prescribing exercise and designing physical activity programs for people with disabilities [^bcfb250b]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2025). High credibility.

Exercise guideline summaries for adults with disabilities (Table 2) detail population-specific MVPA targets and expected benefits. For adults with multiple sclerosis, the guideline specifies at least 30 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) 2 times a week with strength training 2 times a week, with benefits including improvements in aerobic capacity and muscle strength and possible reductions in fatigue and increases in mobility. For adults with spinal cord injury, fitness guidelines include at least 20 min MVPA 2 times a week with strength training 2 times a week, and for cardiometabolic health, at least 30 min MVPA 3 times a week; benefits include cardiorespiratory and muscle strength gains and cardiometabolic health benefits. For adults with a major lower limb amputation, the guideline specifies at least 60 min MVPA per week, combined with strengthening exercises 2 times a week or balance exercises 3 times a week, with benefits of increases in cardiorespiratory fitness, mobility and balance.

### Applications of physical performance measures to routine diabetes care for frailty prevention concept: fundamental data with grip strength, gait speed, timed chair stand speed, standing balance, and knee extension strength [^09addcf2]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Research design and methods

Study population

All consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes aged 60 years or older who regularly visited the outpatient clinic of Jiyugaoka Internal Medicine in 2019 were included. The hand grip strength, as a strong indicator of muscle strength, was measured as one of the medical examinations for daily diabetes care. Using data of measured hand grip strength, this cross-sectional study was retrospectively performed with the aim of investigating hand grip strength in association with clinical characteristics and physical performance measures in a primary care setting. Reasons for exclusion included poor cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination < 24); severe impairment of the liver, kidney, pulmonary, or cardiac function; or severe limitations in active daily life. Firstly, the data of grip strength were retrospectively collected, and the gender-specific mean values of grip strength according to the age stratification were calculated. Numerous papers reported that reduction of muscle strength will lead to a low physical performance. Therefore secondly, in patients with a grip strength below the gender-specific median, physical performance measures that are useful to identify the risk of frailty or fallswere additionally measured as medical examinations for daily diabetes care, and the associations of grip strength with the physical performance measures were investigated to obtain fundamental data on physical performance measures in patients with weakened muscle strength. The study was approved by the local ethical committee and was carried out in accordance with the Declaration II of Helsinki.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^e28364df]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Muscular and anaerobic power — sex differences: Males have larger, stronger, faster, and more powerful skeletal muscles than females, and muscle power is the product of strength and contraction velocity, both of which are larger in males than females. Males produce greater maximal limb torque because their muscles have a larger cross-sectional area and they have longer limbs than females, while the ability and motivation to optimally activate the available motor neurons and the muscle fibers they innervate during a maximal strength contraction while rested do not differ between males and females. Thus, the sex differences in muscular strength and power are primarily due to larger skeletal muscle mass and faster contracting skeletal muscle of males; the larger skeletal muscle of males is primarily due to muscle fibers that have a greater cross-sectional area, particularly type II fibers expressing type II myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms. It is noted that the specific force and power of both MHC type I and type II fibers are similar between males and females, but MHC type II fibers have up to twice the maximal shortening velocity of MHC type I fibers in both sexes.

### The clinical usefulness of muscle mass and strength measures in older people: a systematic review [^e77b79e7]. Age and Ageing (2021). Medium credibility.

Mobility

Cross-sectional studies reported positive associations between handgrip strength (HGS) and mobility in 14 of 16 studies, between KES and mobility in 7 of 10 studies, between lower extremity strength and mobility in 6 of 8 studies and between BIA and mobility in 4 of 8 studies.

The strength of associations from 14 cross-sectional studies between HGS and mobility were strong (5 studies), moderate (6 studies) [22–27] and weak (3 studies) [28–30]. They included 2,088 participants and were undertaken across the full range of clinical settings. However, in two studies, the strength of association was dependent on the mobility measure used [21, 30], in a third on the hand dominance used for HGS and, in a fourth on gender, with a strong association for men and a moderate association for women. There was no link between HGS and mobility in two cross-sectional studies. One was small (n = 22) and published as a conference abstract [31], whereas the other (n = 163) reported a univariate association that was lost when KES was adjusted for [32]. The studies were rated good or moderate quality.

For KES and mobility, 7 of 10 cross-sectional studies reported medium to strong associations (total n = 459) [18, 19, 33–37]. Three cross-sectional studies (total n = 67) found no association with mobility [31, 38, 39]. All studies were of good or moderate quality.

Six of eight cross-sectional studies reported medium to strong associations between lower extremity strength and mobility (total n = 291) [27, 34, 35, 40–42], although two of these studies reported mixed association strengths, depending on which lower limb muscle group was tested [34, 35]. Two cross-sectional studies found no association (total n = 41) [38, 43]. No consistent technique was used to measure lower extremity strength. All studies were of good or moderate quality.

### Strength training and aerobic exercise training for muscle disease [^0fcc6ddf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Strength training or aerobic exercise programmes, or both, might optimise muscle and cardiorespiratory function and prevent additional disuse atrophy and deconditioning in people with a muscle disease. This is an update of a review first published in 2004 and last updated in 2013. We undertook an update to incorporate new evidence in this active area of research.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of strength training and aerobic exercise training in people with a muscle disease.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Neuromuscular's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL in November 2018 and clinical trials registries in December 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs or cross-over RCTs comparing strength or aerobic exercise training, or both lasting at least six weeks, to no training in people with a well-described muscle disease diagnosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 14 trials of aerobic exercise, strength training, or both, with an exercise duration of eight to 52 weeks, which included 428 participants with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), dermatomyositis, polymyositis, mitochondrial myopathy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), or myotonic dystrophy. Risk of bias was variable, as blinding of participants was not possible, some trials did not blind outcome assessors, and some did not use an intention-to-treat analysis. Strength training compared to no training (3 trials) For participants with FSHD (35 participants), there was low-certainty evidence of little or no effect on dynamic strength of elbow flexors (MD 1.2 kgF, 95% CI -0.2 to 2.6), on isometric strength of elbow flexors (MD 0.5 kgF, 95% CI -0.7 to 1.8), and ankle dorsiflexors (MD 0.4 kgF, 95% CI -2.4 to 3.2), and on dynamic strength of ankle dorsiflexors (MD -0.4 kgF, 95% CI -2.3 to 1.4). For participants with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (35 participants), there was very low-certainty evidence of a slight improvement in isometric wrist extensor strength (MD 8.0 N, 95% CI 0.7 to 15.3) and of little or no effect on hand grip force (MD 6.0 N, 95% CI -6.7 to 18.7), pinch grip force (MD 1.0 N, 95% CI -3.3 to 5.3) and isometric wrist flexor force (MD 7.0 N, 95% CI -3.4 to 17.4). Aerobic exercise training compared to no training (5 trials) For participants with DMD there was very low-certainty evidence regarding the number of leg revolutions (MD 14.0, 95% CI -89.0 to 117.0; 23 participants) or arm revolutions (MD 34.8, 95% CI -68.2 to 137.8; 23 participants), during an assisted six-minute cycle test, and very low-certainty evidence regarding muscle strength (MD 1.7, 95% CI -1.9 to 5.3; 15 participants). For participants with FSHD, there was low-certainty evidence of improvement in aerobic capacity (MD 1.1 L/min, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.8, 38 participants) and of little or no effect on knee extension strength (MD 0.1 kg, 95% CI -0.7 to 0.9, 52 participants). For participants with dermatomyositis and polymyositis (14 participants), there was very low-certainty evidence regarding aerobic capacity (MD 14.6, 95% CI -1.0 to 30.2). Combined aerobic exercise and strength training compared to no training (6 trials) For participants with juvenile dermatomyositis (26 participants) there was low-certainty evidence of an improvement in knee extensor strength on the right (MD 36.0 N, 95% CI 25.0 to 47.1) and left (MD 17 N 95% CI 0.5 to 33.5), but low-certainty evidence of little or no effect on maximum force of hip flexors on the right (MD -9.0 N, 95% CI -22.4 to 4.4) or left (MD 6.0 N, 95% CI -6.6 to 18.6). This trial also provided low-certainty evidence of a slight decrease of aerobic capacity (MD -1.2 min, 95% CI -1.6 to 0.9). For participants with dermatomyositis and polymyositis (21 participants), we found very low-certainty evidence for slight increases in muscle strength as measured by dynamic strength of knee extensors on the right (MD 2.5 kg, 95% CI 1.8 to 3.3) and on the left (MD 2.7 kg, 95% CI 2.0 to 3.4) and no clear effect in isometric muscle strength of eight different muscles (MD 1.0, 95% CI -1.1 to 3.1). There was very low-certainty evidence that there may be an increase in aerobic capacity, as measured with time to exhaustion in an incremental cycle test (17.5 min, 95% CI 8.0 to 27.0) and power performed at VO 2 max (maximal oxygen uptake) (18 W, 95% CI 15.0 to 21.0). For participants with mitochondrial myopathy (18 participants), we found very low-certainty evidence regarding shoulder muscle (MD -5.0 kg, 95% CI -14.7 to 4.7), pectoralis major muscle (MD 6.4 kg, 95% CI -2.9 to 15.7), and anterior arm muscle strength (MD 7.3 kg, 95% CI -2.9 to 17.5). We found very low-certainty evidence regarding aerobic capacity, as measured with mean time cycled (MD 23.7 min, 95% CI 2.6 to 44.8) and mean distance cycled until exhaustion (MD 9.7 km, 95% CI 1.5 to 17.9). One trial in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (35 participants) did not provide data on muscle strength or aerobic capacity following combined training. In this trial, muscle strength deteriorated in one person and one person had worse daytime sleepiness (very low-certainty evidence). For participants with FSHD (16 participants), we found very low-certainty evidence regarding muscle strength, aerobic capacity and VO 2 peak; the results were very imprecise. Most trials reported no adverse events other than muscle soreness or joint complaints (low- to very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence regarding strength training and aerobic exercise interventions remains uncertain. Evidence suggests that strength training alone may have little or no effect, and that aerobic exercise training alone may lead to a possible improvement in aerobic capacity, but only for participants with FSHD. For combined aerobic exercise and strength training, there may be slight increases in muscle strength and aerobic capacity for people with dermatomyositis and polymyositis, and a slight decrease in aerobic capacity and increase in muscle strength for people with juvenile dermatomyositis. More research with robust methodology and greater numbers of participants is still required.

### Adiposity and muscle strength in men with prostate cancer and cardiovascular Outcomes [^77dc591d]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a fundamental treatment for advanced prostate cancer (PC). However, ADT has been shown to increase body weight and fat mass. Obesity is a major risk factor for hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are common in men with PCand are important causes of morbidity and mortality. In addition, ADT reduces muscle strength, which is also a risk factor for CVD and mortality.

There are important limitations to the existing data on the physical effects of ADT. Research demonstrating changes in physical measurements in ADT recipients consists of studies with modest sample sizes without adjustment for covariates. These limitations leave uncertainty as to: 1) the extent to which changes in physical measurements are due to ADT vs the natural history of body composition and muscle strength in patients with PC; and 2) the generalizability of the findings. Evaluating changes in physical measurements in a large cohort of ADT recipients, accounting for important confounding factors and for the natural history of these physical measurements, is crucial to understanding the adverse effects of ADT. In addition, there are scant data on the prognostic importance of these physical measurements in individuals with PC.

The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate changes in physical measures (body weight, waist and hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, handgrip strength, strength-to-weight ratio, and gait speed) in a large, well-characterized cohort of patients with PC stratified according to ADT exposure. The secondary objectives were: 1) to assess whether the relationships between ADT use and changes in these physical measurements is influenced by factors that are known to affect adiposity and muscle strength, including age, education level, tobacco and alcohol use, and physical activity level; and 2) to describe the relationships between these physical measures and subsequent adverse clinical outcomes.

### The mediterranean-DASH intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet is associated with physical function and grip strength in older men and women [^44396164]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Diet quality may be protective of physical function and muscle strength during aging.

Objectives

We aimed to investigate associations of the Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet with physical function and grip strength.

Methods

Data were obtained from men and women in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (mean ± SD age: 68 ± 14 y at first diet visit; n = 1358). Diet was assessed by FFQ. MIND diet score was calculated from 15 food groups, with a higher score indicating better diet quality; tertile categories of averaged MIND score across visits were used. Physical function was assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), with a score < 10 indicative of impaired function, and the Health, Aging and Body Composition Physical Performance Battery (HABCPPB). The highest value of grip strength over 3 trials was used. Multivariable logistic and linear mixed-effects models were examined with repeated measurements of physical function and grip strength, respectively.

Results

MIND score was inversely associated with physical function impairment (per 1-point increment: OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.93; P < 0.01), and with each SPPB component, over a median 6 y of follow-up. Participants in the highest compared with the lowest tertile of MIND diet score had 57% lower odds of functional impairment (OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.73; P < 0.01), and slower decline by the HABCPPB. Men and women in the highest compared with the lowest tertiles of MIND score had 1.86-kg (95% CI: 0.33, 3.40 kg; P < 0.05) and 1.24-kg (95% CI: 0.04, 2.45 kg; P < 0.05) greater grip strength, respectively.

Conclusions

Adherence to the MIND dietary pattern was associated with lower odds of physical function impairment and decline, and with better muscle strength, indicating that the MIND dietary pattern may be protective of physical functional health in older adults.

### Exercise / physical activity in individuals with type 2 diabetes: a consensus statement from the American College of Sports Medicine [^574f2b81]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). High credibility.

Adults and older adults with T2D — All adults with T2D should follow the same recommendations, with no more than 2 consecutive days between bouts due to the transient nature of exercise-induced improvements in insulin action; in older adults, resistance exercise training results in 10%–15% improvement in strength, bone mineral density, lean mass, blood pressure, blood lipids, and insulin sensitivity along with threefold greater reductions in A1C, and interventions that combine aerobic and resistance training may be superior to either one alone; adults unable to meet current recommendations should focus on improving on functional fitness and balance, and limitations to joint mobility may be accelerated by hyperglycemia.

### Resistance exercise in individuals with and without cardiovascular disease: 2007 update: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association council on clinical cardiology and council on nutrition, physical activity, and metabolism [^42db8f67]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Prescribed and supervised resistance training (RT) enhances muscular strength and endurance, functional capacity and independence, and quality of life while reducing disability in persons with and without cardiovascular disease. These benefits have made RT an accepted component of programs for health and fitness. The American Heart Association recommendations describing the rationale for participation in and considerations for prescribing RT were published in 2000. This update provides current information regarding the (1) health benefits of RT, (2) impact of RT on the cardiovascular system structure and function, (3) role of RT in modifying cardiovascular disease risk factors, (4) benefits in selected populations, (5) process of medical evaluation for participation in RT, and (6) prescriptive methods. The purpose of this update is to provide clinicians with recommendations to facilitate the use of this valuable modality.

### The content of physical fitness training and the changes in physical fitness and functioning in orthopedic geriatric rehabilitation: an explorative observational study [^5521bb17]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This explorative study investigates the content of physical fitness training and changes in physical fitness and functioning in the current practice of orthopedic geriatric rehabilitation (GR) in the Netherlands.

Materials and Methods

The content of physical fitness training was analyzed in 48 patients from 11 orthopedic GR wards, comparing it to general guidelines for older adults. Endurance, muscle strength, and functioning were measured at admission and discharge. Correlations between training volume and change in endurance, knee-extensor muscle strength, and physical functioning were assessed.

Results

Training characteristics varied substantially among individuals. Compared to guidelines, endurance time and intensity were low, and muscle strength training volume was low to moderate. Significant improvements (17.7–41.4%) in muscle strength and all measures of physical functioning were observed. Pain highly affected endurance outcomes in the majority of the patients. Patients not limited by pain showed no change in endurance. Only resistance training volume of the affected leg moderately correlated with change in muscle strength.

Conclusions

Physical fitness training content varied and was generally low in intensity compared to guidelines. Its relation to fitness and functioning was limited. Future efforts should focus on improving training strategies and developing a valid measure of endurance.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: key concepts and advances in pulmonary rehabilitation [^be969a27]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Early rehabilitation in acute respiratory failure emphasizes assessment and safe mobilization by an interdisciplinary intensive care unit (ICU) team. Although survival in critically ill individuals, especially those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has improved, this is often associated with generalized deconditioning, functional impairment, and reduced health-related quality of life after ICU discharge, indicating the need for rehabilitation after ICU and hospital discharge and for measures during ICU stay to prevent or attenuate deconditioning. Clinical interest and scientific evidence have given support to safe and early physical activity and mobilization in critically ill patients with respiratory failure. Planning early mobilization involves assessment of cooperation, cardiopulmonary reserve, muscle strength, joint mobility, functional status, and quality of life; muscle strength assessment is important for guiding progressive ambulation and predicting outcomes. In alert ICU patients, strength can be measured with the Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnea grade, handgrip dynamometer, and handheld dynamometer, while in unconscious individuals muscle thickness by ultrasound is available as a nonvalidated test. Several protocols address safety, cardiorespiratory and neurologic status, cooperation level, and functional status, and provide steps to gradually increase activity and mobilization in the critically ill.

### Physical fitness training for stroke patients [^4a684abf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Levels of physical activity and physical fitness are low after stroke. Interventions to increase physical fitness could reduce mortality and reduce disability through increased function.

Objectives

The primary objectives of this updated review were to determine whether fitness training after stroke reduces death, death or dependence, and disability. The secondary objectives were to determine the effects of training on adverse events, risk factors, physical fitness, mobility, physical function, health status and quality of life, mood, and cognitive function.

Search Methods

In July 2018 we searched the Cochrane Stroke Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, and four additional databases. We also searched ongoing trials registers and conference proceedings, screened reference lists, and contacted experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing either cardiorespiratory training or resistance training, or both (mixed training), with usual care, no intervention, or a non-exercise intervention in stroke survivors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. We analysed data using random-effects meta-analyses and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Diverse outcome measures limited the intended analyses.

Main Results

We included 75 studies, involving 3017 mostly ambulatory participants, which comprised cardiorespiratory (32 studies, 1631 participants), resistance (20 studies, 779 participants), and mixed training interventions (23 studies, 1207 participants). Death was not influenced by any intervention; risk differences were all 0.00 (low-certainty evidence). There were few deaths overall (19/3017 at end of intervention and 19/1469 at end of follow-up). None of the studies assessed death or dependence as a composite outcome. Disability scores were improved at end of intervention by cardiorespiratory training (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.52, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.84; 8 studies, 462 participants; P = 0.002; moderate-certainty evidence) and mixed training (SMD 0.23, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.42; 9 studies, 604 participants; P = 0.02; low-certainty evidence). There were too few data to assess the effects of resistance training on disability. Secondary outcomes showed multiple benefits for physical fitness (VO 2 peak and strength), mobility (walking speed) and physical function (balance). These physical effects tended to be intervention-specific with the evidence mostly low or moderate certainty. Risk factor data were limited or showed no effects apart from cardiorespiratory fitness (VO 2 peak), which increased after cardiorespiratory training (mean difference (MD) 3.40 mL/kg/min, 95% CI 2.98 to 3.83; 9 studies, 438 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of any serious adverse events. Lack of data prevents conclusions about effects of training on mood, quality of life, and cognition. Lack of data also meant benefits at follow-up (i.e. after training had stopped) were unclear but some mobility benefits did persist. Risk of bias varied across studies but imbalanced amounts of exposure in control and intervention groups was a common issue affecting many comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

Few deaths overall suggest exercise is a safe intervention but means we cannot determine whether exercise reduces mortality or the chance of death or dependency. Cardiorespiratory training and, to a lesser extent mixed training, reduce disability during or after usual stroke care; this could be mediated by improved mobility and balance. There is sufficient evidence to incorporate cardiorespiratory and mixed training, involving walking, within post-stroke rehabilitation programmes to improve fitness, balance and the speed and capacity of walking. The magnitude of VO 2 peak increase after cardiorespiratory training has been suggested to reduce risk of stroke hospitalisation by ˜7%. Cognitive function is under-investigated despite being a key outcome of interest for patients. Further well-designed randomised trials are needed to determine the optimal exercise prescription, the range of benefits and any long-term benefits.
