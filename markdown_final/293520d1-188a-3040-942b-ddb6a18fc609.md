## Question

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis diagnostic criteria

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnostic criteria for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the modern classification of PAP and why it matters diagnostically. Then, I should verify the first-line noninvasive test and its performance. Next, I will review the role of bronchoalveolar lavage and what constitutes a positive BAL. After that, I need to check when lung biopsy is indicated and what histopathology confirms the diagnosis. I will then consider special populations and secondary causes, including genetic testing. Finally, I should integrate these elements into a practical diagnostic algorithm and explicitly state what constitutes a definitive diagnosis versus a working diagnosis, anchoring to current ERS guidelines and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the disease framework, because diagnostic criteria hinge on etiology. PAP is a syndrome with heterogeneous causes unified by impaired surfactant clearance and alveolar macrophage dysfunction; the predominant form is autoimmune PAP driven by anti–GM-CSF antibodies, with secondary PAP due to macrophage injury or loss, and congenital PAP due to surfactant pathway or GM-CSF receptor mutations, so I need to keep etiologic testing front and center in adults [^048e486f] [^b0b78010].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line diagnostic test in suspected autoimmune PAP. The ERS 2024 guideline recommends obtaining serum anti–GM-CSF autoantibodies in all patients with suspected or confirmed PAP, and multiple sources indicate this test has sensitivity and specificity approaching 100% at a commonly used cutoff of 5 μg/mL, making it the cornerstone noninvasive diagnostic marker for autoimmune PAP; I should confirm that a positive result in the right clinical context essentially establishes the diagnosis without needing tissue in most adults [^a66bec21] [^5f7c912b] [^5e639e82].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the role of bronchoalveolar lavage because not all patients have positive antibodies or classic imaging. BAL remains a key diagnostic modality: the effluent is typically milky or turbid and settles without centrifugation, and cytology shows amorphous eosinophilic, PAS-positive acellular debris with foamy macrophages; the ATS BAL guideline explicitly notes this pattern as supportive of PAP, and ERS recommends including differential cell count, PAS staining, and microbiology in the diagnostic BAL workup, which I should ensure is requested up front [^2349c91e] [^8daecfd3] [^64a0dcd2].

> I should double-check when lung biopsy is actually necessary. ERS advises against routine lung biopsy in suspected PAP; biopsy is reserved for unresolved cases with negative antibodies and atypical BAL or imaging, or when secondary etiologies are suspected. When performed, histology shows alveolar filling with granular eosinophilic, PAS-positive material and preserved architecture, and emerging data suggest Napsin-A immunohistochemistry can increase specificity over PAS alone, which I need to remember for challenging cases [^6ec8c5eb] [^a14cf2f6] [^83cfd1a0].

> Let me consider imaging, because it guides pretest probability and procedural planning. High-resolution CT classically shows a crazy-paving pattern with ground-glass opacities superimposed by smooth interlobular septal thickening, often geographic and sometimes with subpleural sparing; while not pathognomonic, this pattern in the right clinical context strongly supports PAP and should prompt antibody testing and BAL, and I should also recall that fibrotic changes can evolve over time and portend worse outcomes, which influences follow-up strategy [^c7bd86d0] [^aac6ed2f] [^97f77db0].

> Next, I should review special populations and secondary causes, because the diagnostic algorithm diverges. In children, congenital PAP is more prominent, so if antibodies are negative and GM-CSF is elevated, I need to consider GM-CSF receptor gene mutations and broader chILD genetic panels; in adults with negative antibodies, I should evaluate for secondary PAP drivers such as hematologic malignancy, immunodeficiency including GATA2 deficiency, toxic exposures, and infections, aligning with pediatric and adult guidance and host susceptibility statements [^394ab8e3] [^9f0446bc] [^15e0f77c] [^532210c3].

> I will now examine the practical diagnostic algorithm and make sure it aligns with guidelines. In an adult with compatible symptoms and imaging, I should obtain serum anti–GM-CSF antibodies; if positive, autoimmune PAP is diagnosed and I proceed to disease severity assessment and treatment planning. If antibodies are negative, I should perform BAL with PAS staining and microbiology; if BAL is diagnostic, that confirms PAP, and if BAL is nondiagnostic or secondary etiology is suspected, I should consider transbronchial or surgical lung biopsy and targeted evaluation for secondary causes or hereditary disease, reserving biopsy for unresolved cases rather than using it routinely [^a66bec21] [^8daecfd3] [^6ec8c5eb].

> But wait, what if the BAL is clear and PAS-negative despite strong clinical suspicion; I need to ensure I do not anchor prematurely. Atypical presentations occur, and in such cases, lung biopsy may reveal PAP missed by BAL sampling, or an alternative diagnosis may emerge; I should also remember that rare antibody-negative autoimmune PAP and secondary PAP exist, so a negative antibody test does not categorically exclude PAP when BAL and imaging are compelling, prompting reconsideration of biopsy or etiologic reassessment [^cd09a605] [^048e486f].

> Let me synthesize the diagnostic criteria succinctly, and I should confirm each element against the evidence. Definitive diagnosis of autoimmune PAP is established by a compatible clinical-radiologic presentation plus serum anti–GM-CSF autoantibodies at or above the validated threshold, with BAL findings supportive but not strictly required in adults; in the absence of positive antibodies, a definitive diagnosis relies on BAL showing milky fluid with PAS-positive amorphous debris and foamy macrophages, or lung biopsy demonstrating alveolar filling with eosinophilic granular PAS-positive material and preserved architecture, ideally after excluding secondary causes when clinically indicated [^a66bec21] [^2349c91e] [^a14cf2f6] [^048e486f].

> Finally, I should confirm the key takeaways and ensure internal consistency. Modern PAP diagnosis is etiology-driven, with anti–GM-CSF antibodies as the primary noninvasive test in adults, BAL as the pivotal procedure when antibodies are negative or unavailable, and lung biopsy reserved for unresolved or atypical cases; integrating HRCT patterns, BAL cytology, and selective genetic or secondary evaluations yields accurate classification and guides therapy, which is precisely how ERS and contemporary reviews frame the diagnostic approach [^8daecfd3] [^048e486f] [^b0b78010].

---

The diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) relies on a **multimodal approach** that integrates clinical presentation, imaging, and laboratory findings, with **serum anti-GM-CSF antibodies** as the cornerstone for autoimmune PAP [^a66bec21] [^5f7c912b]. High-resolution CT typically shows a **crazy-paving pattern** (ground-glass opacities with superimposed septal thickening) [^c7bd86d0] [^aac6ed2f], and bronchoalveolar lavage reveals milky fluid with PAS-positive, diastase-resistant material and lamellar bodies on electron microscopy [^2349c91e] [^aa3a6a47]. Lung biopsy is reserved for atypical or unresolved cases, showing alveolar filling with eosinophilic, PAS-positive material and preserved architecture [^6ec8c5eb] [^a14cf2f6]. Secondary causes should be excluded, and genetic testing is considered in children or when hereditary PAP is suspected [^9f0446bc] [^15e0f77c].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically present with **progressive exertional dyspnea**, dry cough, and hypoxemia; digital clubbing and hemoptysis are uncommon and suggest complications [^5e639e82]. The disease course is variable, ranging from asymptomatic cases detected on screening to severe respiratory failure [^68b48f74].

---

## Imaging findings

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is the **imaging modality of choice** and typically shows:

- **Crazy-paving pattern**: Bilateral ground-glass opacities with superimposed interlobular septal thickening, often geographic and patchy [^c7bd86d0] [^aac6ed2f].

- **Subpleural sparing**: Less frequent in secondary PAP [^aac6ed2f].

- **Lower lobe predominance**: More common in autoimmune PAP [^aac6ed2f].

- **Fibrosis**: Traction bronchiectasis and honeycombing may develop in advanced disease, indicating worse prognosis [^97f77db0].

---

## Laboratory findings

Serum **anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies** are highly sensitive and specific for autoimmune PAP, with sensitivity and specificity approaching 100% at a cutoff of 5 μg/mL [^5f7c912b] [^5e639e82]. Elevated serum GM-CSF levels suggest hereditary PAP due to GM-CSF receptor mutations [^2defa683] [^15e0f77c].

---

## Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)

BAL is a **minimally invasive procedure** that provides diagnostic material:

- **Appearance**: Milky or turbid fluid that settles without centrifugation [^2349c91e] [^7a2fafca].

- **Cytology**: Amorphous, eosinophilic, PAS-positive, diastase-resistant material; foamy macrophages; and lamellar bodies on electron microscopy [^2349c91e] [^aa3a6a47].

- **Microbiology**: Essential to exclude infections that can mimic or complicate PAP [^8daecfd3].

---

## Histopathology

Lung biopsy is reserved for atypical cases or when BAL is inconclusive. Characteristic findings include **alveolar filling with eosinophilic, PAS-positive material** and preserved alveolar architecture [^a14cf2f6]. Cholesterol clefts and hyaline globules may be present [^a14cf2f6].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and algorithm

A structured diagnostic approach is recommended:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic modality** | **Findings** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Clinical presentation | Progressive dyspnea, cough, hypoxemia |
| 2 | HRCT | Crazy-paving pattern, subpleural sparing, lower lobe predominance |
| 3 | Serum anti-GM-CSF antibodies | Positive (> 5 μg/mL) |
| 4 | BAL | Milky fluid, PAS-positive material, lamellar bodies |
| 5 | Lung biopsy (if needed) | Alveolar filling with eosinophilic, PAS-positive material, preserved architecture |
| 6 | Exclude secondary causes | Hematologic malignancies, immunodeficiencies, infections, environmental exposures |
| 7 | Genetic testing (if suspected) | CSF2RA, CSF2RB mutations |

---

## Differential diagnosis

PAP must be differentiated from other causes of **ground-glass opacities** and **crazy-paving**, including:

- **Pulmonary edema**: Cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic [^62575273].

- **Pneumonia**: Including COVID-19 pneumonia [^58112c36].

- **Alveolar hemorrhage**: Hemosiderin-laden macrophages [^64a0dcd2].

- **Lipoid pneumonia**: History of lipid aspiration, low-attenuation consolidations [^6f7d0080].

- **Interstitial lung diseases**: NSIP, hypersensitivity pneumonitis [^62575273].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Congenital PAP is more common; genetic testing for surfactant pathway and GM-CSF receptor mutations is recommended [^9f0446bc] [^49fb4e8f].

- **Secondary PAP**: Evaluate for underlying hematologic malignancies, immunodeficiencies, infections, and environmental exposures [^9db8fc64] [^394ab8e3].

- **Atypical presentations**: Negative anti-GM-CSF antibodies with typical imaging and BAL findings may represent secondary or hereditary PAP [^cd09a605] [^15e0f77c].

---

## Conclusion

The diagnosis of PAP requires a **multimodal approach**, integrating clinical presentation, HRCT findings, serum anti-GM-CSF antibodies, BAL analysis, and, when necessary, lung biopsy. This structured algorithm ensures accurate diagnosis and guides appropriate management strategies [^8daecfd3] [^048e486f].

### Autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis: clinical course and diagnostic criteria [^a9a5bf1c]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is caused by accumulation of surfactant components in the alveoli and terminal airways. All forms of PAP are caused by insufficient surfactant clearance by alveolar macrophages. Autoimmune PAP, a rare, antibody-mediated disease, that compromises 90% of cases of PAP, is causes by IgG autoantibodies that block GM-CSF effect, a crucial step for macrophage maturation. Alveolar filling may progress to respiratory insufficiency, but the course of the disease is variable. Patients usually complain of dyspnea, mainly with exertion, and cough. Chest CT shows highly suggestive ground grass opacification crossed by heavy septal lines, leading to the typical "crazy paving" appearance. Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals "milky" fluid, containing semisolid remnants of surfactant components, packed as lamellar bodies. The surfactant appears granular and pink on PAS staining, and lung architecture is preserved. These cytological and pathological characteristics are diagnostic for PAP. In addition, a high titer of IgG anti GM-CSF autoantibodies is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis. The trigger for antibodies formation and their role (if any) in regulation GM-CSF activity in the normal state are unknown. Based on the specificity of these characteristics we suggest a structured framework for the diagnosis of Autoimmune PAP. Lung lavage with a large volume of saline is the standard therapy, and is effective in most patients. However, immune-modulatory therapy, by either supplying exogenous GM-CSF, or by inhibiting the CD20+ antibody forming cells, with Rituximab, is also effective in many patients. The precise role of each therapy, alone or in combination, should be systematically studied.

### Shaping the future of an ultra-rare disease: unmet needs in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [^a24fd4b1]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) can be considered the archetype of ultra-rare diseases with a prevalence of under 10 cases per million. We discuss the classification of PAP, the current diagnostic practice and the supplementary role of genetic testing and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signalling in the diagnosis of congenital and hereditary PAP. We report on novel therapeutic approaches such as GM-CSF substitution, stem cell transplantation, pioglitazone, statins and immunomodulation.

Recent Findings

The discovery of new genetic mutations underlying this syndrome raises the question whether the classification should be radically revised in the future. Serum GM-CSF autoantibody is the best diagnostic marker for autoimmune PAP, the most common form, but does not correlate with disease severity. Several circulating biomarkers have been investigated to assess disease activity and predict outcome. Imaging techniques have also enormously evolved and offer new tools to quantify disease burden and possibly drive therapeutic decisions. Promising clinical trials are ongoing and will generate new treatment strategies besides or in addition to whole lung lavage in the next future.

Summary

Despite impressive advances in understanding pathogenesis, PAP remains a rare syndrome with several unanswered questions impacting diagnosis, management and treatment, and, as a result, patients' quality of life.

### Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis: a comprehensive clinical perspective [^0d42fcdc]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a broad group of rare diseases that are defined by the occupation of a lung's gas-exchange area by pulmonary surfactants that are not properly removed. The clinical and radiologic phenotypes among them are very similar. The age of manifestation plays a central role in the differential diagnosis of the almost 100 conditions and provides an efficient path to the correct diagnosis. The diagnostic approach is tailored to identify genetic or autoimmune causes, exposure to environmental agents, and associations with numerous other diseases. Whole-lung lavages are the cornerstone of treatment, and children in particular depend on the expertise to perform such therapeutic lavages. Other treatment options and long-term survival are related to the condition causing the proteinosis.

### Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [^32d79271]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a rare but potentially treatable disease, characterized by impaired surfactant metabolism that leads to accumulation in the alveoli of proteinaceous material rich in surfactant protein and its component. Novel insights from an animal model aided the discovery of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibodies as a pathogenetic mechanism in human pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. The vast majority of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis occurs as an autoimmune disease; less commonly, it is congenital or secondary to an underlying disorder such as infection, hematological malignancy, or immunodeficiency. The subacute indolent course of this disease often delays the diagnosis by months to years. Crazy-paving appearance in a geographic distribution is a characteristic feature of this disease visible on high-resolution computed tomography (CT). A definitive diagnosis, however, requires lung biopsy, which typically shows partial or complete filling of alveoli with periodic-acid-Schiff-positive granular and eosinophilic material in preserved alveolar architecture. Patients with minimal symptoms are managed conservatively, whereas patients with hypoxemia require a more aggressive approach. Whole-lung lavage is the most widely accepted therapy for symptomatic pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Correction of GM-CSF deficiency with exogenous GM-CSF is an alternative therapy. The combination of a systemic treatment (GM-CSF) and a local treatment (whole-lung lavage) augmenting the action of one another is a promising new approach. As the knowledge about this rare disease increases, the role of novel therapies is likely to be better defined and optimized.

### Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis: a comprehensive clinical perspective [^03edbdce]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on pulmonary alveolar proteinosis:

- **Definition**: PAP is a rare disease characterized by the accumulation of pulmonary surfactants in the alveoli resulting from decreased clearance and leading to impaired gas exchange.
- **Pathophysiology**: Defective regulation of pulmonary surfactant in PAP results in surfactant accumulation within alveolar macrophages and alveoli.​​​​​​​​​​​​ It is classified into primary (autoimmune), secondary, and congenital forms.​​​​ In autoimmune PAP, the most common form (90% of cases), GM-CSF autoantibodies inhibit the function of GM-CSF, a cytokine crucial for the differentiation and function of alveolar macrophages. This inhibition leads to defective surfactant catabolism and accumulation of surfactant proteins and lipids within the alveoli. The SFTPB, SFTPC, ABCA3, and TTF1 genes have been implicated in the congenital form of PAP.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidences of autoimmune and secondary PAP are estimated at 0.2–0.49 cases per million person-years and 0.05 cases per million person-years, respectively.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for secondary PAP include hematologic malignancies, lung cancer, glioblastoma, immunodeficiencies, human immunodefociency virus, cytimegalovirus infection, tuberculosis, and inhalation of inorganic dusts.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, PAP presents with progressive exertional dyspnea, dry cough, and constitutional symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Inspiratory crackles and digital clubbing are often present.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of PAP is variable and depends on the underlying cause. Most patients with autoimmune PAP have a disease severity score ≥ 3, and about one-quarter require long-term oxygen therapy and infrequent lavages.

### Alveolar proteinosis syndrome: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^561b8df4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the most recent clinical and basic research literature on pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) as it relates to pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management.

Recent Findings

The discovery of Granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and the alveolar macrophage as critical regulators of surfactant protein and lipid homeostasis has led to significant advances in PAP. Adults affected by PAP have circulating neutralizing anti-GM-CSF antibodies. Reduced localized GM-CSF activity in the lung (from neutralizing anti-GM-CSF antibodies), decreases alveolar macrophage surfactant degradation with surfactant excess and accumulation. Cause, source of antibodies or downstream effects of GM-CSF deficiency is speculative. GM-CSF antibodies above a threshold level have proved to be a useful diagnostic test. Research towards therapy has focused on improving the technique for therapeutic whole lung lavage as well as overcoming effects of neutralizing anti-GM-CSF, which include GM-CSF therapy (systemic and inhaled) and anecdotal reports of anti-B cell therapy. Whereas this approach has been somewhat successful for primary PAP, other causes of PAP (i.e. alveolar macrophage dysfunction, surfactant protein alterations) are still without therapy.

Summary

Understanding of the pathogenesis of PAP has greatly increased in the last decade; study has brought better comprehension of lung biology and recognition of the critical role for GM-CSF and alveolar macrophage in surfactant clearance. Balance between resident immune cell population and normal lung function still needs further study. Resident alveolar macrophages have an essential role in surfactant homeostasis. With this knowledge more effective diagnostic tests (e.g. anti-GM-CSF antibody) and therapies for PAP are under investigation.

### Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in hereditary and autoimmune forms with 2 cases [^e9aabc66]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a respiratory pathology characterized by the accumulation and increase of surfactant-derived material in the lungs. In clinical practice, PAP may present as the primary form, which includes autoimmune and hereditary PAP, or as the secondary form. Diffuse alveolar radiopacities on chest x-ray and the crazy-paving pattern on high-resolution computed tomography are important, although not specific findings for PAP. Bronchoalveolar lavage biopsy is a diagnostic method, and whole-lung lavage remains the criterion standard for the treatment of PAP. Evidence is required regarding treatment with exogenous anti-granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Here, we present a 13-year-old male patient with hereditary PAP and a 15-year-old female patient with autoimmune PAP who presented with complaints of easy fatigability and weakness to emphasize the importance of keeping in mind PAP as a differential diagnosis in patients with respiratory failure findings.

### Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in adults: pathophysiology and clinical approach [^b0b78010]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a diffuse lung disease that results from the accumulation of lipoproteinaceous material in the alveoli and alveolar macrophages due to abnormal surfactant homoeostasis. Identification of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as an indispensable mediator of macrophage maturation and surfactant catabolism was the key discovery leading to the current understanding of the pathogenesis of most forms of PAP. Impaired GM-CSF bioavailability due to anti-GM-CSF autoimmunity is the cause of approximately 90% of adult PAP cases. Abnormal macrophage function due to endogenous or exogenous triggers, GM-CSF receptor defects, and other genetic abnormalities of surfactant production account for the remainder of causes. The usual physiological consequence of PAP is impairment of gas exchange, which can lead to dyspnoea, hypoxaemia, or even respiratory failure and death. Pulmonary fibrosis occurs occasionally in patients with PAP. For patients with moderate to severe disease, whole lung lavage is still the first-line treatment of choice. Supplemental GM-CSF is also useful, but details about indications, choice of agent, and dosing remain unclear. Other therapies, including rituximab, plasmapheresis, and lung transplantation have been described but should be reserved for refractory cases.

### The alveolar lipidome in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. A new target for therapeutic development? [^9db8fc64]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a syndrome (not a single disease) that is characterized by the accumulation of alveolar surfactant and results in hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency/failure, which occurs in a heterogeneous group of clinically and mechanistically distinct disorders categorized (historically) as primary, secondary, or congenital PAP. Primary PAP results from disruption of signaling by GM-CSF (granulocyte–macrophage colony–stimulating factor) and includes autoimmune PAP (caused by GM-CSF autoantibodies) and hereditary PAP (caused by mutations in genes encoding the GM-CSF receptor α and β chains [CSF2RA and CSF2RB, respectively]). Secondary PAP is caused by any one of a number of diverse underlying clinical disorders or conditions that reduce the number and/or function of alveolar macrophages, including myelodysplasia and other hematologic disorders, malignancies, immune deficiency syndromes, chronic inflammatory disorders, drugs, and toxic inhalation exposures. Congenital PAP is caused by mutations in genes required for normal surfactant production (e.g. SFTPB, SFTPC, ABCA3, and NKX2.1). The myriad of PAP-causing diseases can also be usefully considered as disorders of surfactant production or surfactant clearance (Figure 1A). Notwithstanding this etiologic diversity, autoimmune PAP accounts for approximately 90% of all patients with PAP, and all other PAP-causing diseases account for the remaining 10%.

### Autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [^5e639e82]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disease characterized by myeloid cell dysfunction, abnormal pulmonary surfactant accumulation, and innate immune deficiency. It has a prevalence of 7–10 per million; occurs in individuals of all races, geographic regions, sex, and socioeconomic status; and accounts for 90% of all patients with PAP syndrome. The most common presentation is dyspnea of insidious onset with or without cough, production of scant white and frothy sputum, and diffuse radiographic infiltrates in a previously healthy adult, but it can also occur in children as young as 3 years. Digital clubbing, fever, and hemoptysis are not typical, and the latter two indicate that intercurrent infection may be present. Low prevalence and nonspecific clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings commonly lead to misdiagnosis as pneumonia and substantially delay an accurate diagnosis. The clinical course, although variable, usually includes progressive hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency and, in some patients, secondary infections, pulmonary fibrosis, respiratory failure, and death. Two decades of research have raised autoimmune PAP from obscurity to a paradigm of molecular pathogenesis-based diagnostic and therapeutic development. Pathogenesis is driven by GM-CSF (granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor) autoantibodies, which are present at high concentrations in blood and tissues and form the basis of an accurate, commercially available diagnostic blood test with sensitivity and specificity of 100%. Although whole-lung lavage remains the first-line therapy, inhaled GM-CSF is a promising pharmacotherapeutic approach demonstrated in well-controlled trials to be safe, well tolerated, and efficacious. Research has established GM-CSF as a pulmonary regulatory molecule critical to surfactant homeostasis, alveolar stability, lung function, and host defense.

### Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in children [^982135bb]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare cause of chronic interstitial lung disease in children characterised by accumulation of a lipoproteinaceous material in the alveoli. Bronchoalveolar lavage is the key diagnostic tool, revealing a milky appearance of the return fluid and a periodic acid-Schiff staining material in the alveolar macrophages. PAP is a heterogeneous disease. Immediate-onset forms leading to early and fatal respiratory failure may be related to SP-B deficiency. Postnatal-onset PAP may be associated with various diseases or may be primary. The latter has a polymorphic progression from asymptomatic to uncontrollable respiratory failure. Recent studies have implicated GM-CSF and/or its receptor but the exact underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Therapeutic lung lavages are the only effective treatment for severe cases.

### From the archives of the AFIP: pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [^c7bd86d0]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) may develop in a primary (idiopathic) form, chiefly during middle age, or less commonly in the setting of inhalational exposure, hematologic malignancy, or immunodeficiency. Current research supports the theory that PAP is the result of pathophysiologic mechanisms that impair pulmonary surfactant homeostasis and lung immune function. Clinical symptomatology is variable, ranging from mild progressive dyspnea to respiratory failure. There is a strong association with tobacco use. The predominant computed tomographic feature of PAP is a "crazy-paving" pattern (smoothly thickened septal lines on a background of widespread ground-glass opacity), often with lobular or geographic sparing. The radiologic differential diagnosis of crazy-paving includes pulmonary edema, pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphangitic carcinomatosis. Definitive diagnosis is made with lung biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens that reveal intraalveolar deposits of proteinaceous material, dissolved cholesterol, and eosinophilic globules. Symptomatic treatment includes whole-lung lavage, and multiple procedures may be required. New therapies directed toward the identified defect in immune defense have met with moderate clinical success.

### Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis mimicking idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^0e65f4d3]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disorder of unknown etiology. While most biopsies from patients with PAP disclose a prominent positive periodic acid-Schiff, diastase-resistant intra-alveolar exudate, and minimal interstitial thickening, interstitial fibrosis and honeycombing can be the predominant histologic findings. We recently identified two patients with PAP who initially were thought to have idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, but whose biopsies ultimately disclosed PAP with considerable interstitial fibrosis. Because the clinical and radiographic presentation of PAP can overlap with other interstitial lung disorders, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained idiopathic interstitial pneumonias in young patients.

### Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in Korea: analysis of prevalence and incidence via a nationwide population-based study [^de5a7282]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a very rare lung disease and its prevalence and incidence remain unclear. The prevalence and incidence of PAP were investigated by using nationwide claims data from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment service.

Methods

Data were extracted for adults who visited any secondary or tertiary medical institute between 2010 and 2016 with the PAP-related Korean Classification of Disease, 7th edition code J84.0 and the Rare Intractable Disease exempted calculation code V222. To robust case definition, a narrow case definition was made when all following factors were met: 1) more than two PAP-coded visits within 1year of the first claim, and 2) more than one claim for both chest computed tomography and diagnostic procedures (bronchoscopy or surgical lung biopsy) within 90days before or after the first claim.

Results

A total of 182 patients (narrow, n = 82) with PAP-related codes were identified from 2010 to 2016 and 89 new patients (narrow, n = 66) visited medical institutes between 2012 and 2015. The prevalence of PAP was 4.44 (narrow: 2.27) per 10⁶ population, with a peak age of 60-69years. The incidence of PAP was 0.56 (narrow: 0.41) per 10⁶ population at risk, with a peak age of 50-59years. Among incident cases, the male-to-female ratio was 1.52 and about two-thirds had comorbidities, dyslipidaemia being the most common.

Conclusions

The prevalence and incidence of PAP in Korea are low, similar to those in other countries; however, Korean patients with PAP are characterized by older diagnostic age and a lower male-to-female ratio.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, more specifically with respect to plasmapheresis, ERS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering plasmapheresis in patients with confirmed autoimmune PAP remaining symptomatic and requiring high-flow supplemental oxygen (≥ 4 L/min) or ≥ 2 whole lung lavage over 1 year despite receiving exogenous GM-CSF and rituximab or having previously failed these treatments.

### Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [^048e486f]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a syndrome characterized by the accumulation of alveolar surfactant and dysfunction of alveolar macrophages. PAP results in progressive dyspnoea of insidious onset, hypoxaemic respiratory failure, secondary infections and pulmonary fibrosis. PAP can be classified into different types on the basis of the pathogenetic mechanism: primary PAP is characterized by the disruption of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signalling and can be autoimmune (caused by elevated levels of GM-CSF autoantibodies) or hereditary (due to mutations in CSF2RA or CSF2RB, encoding GM-CSF receptor subunits); secondary PAP results from various underlying conditions; and congenital PAP is caused by mutations in genes involved in surfactant production. In most patients, pathogenesis is driven by reduced GM-CSF-dependent cholesterol clearance in alveolar macrophages, which impairs alveolar surfactant clearance. PAP has a prevalence of at least 7 cases per million individuals in large population studies and affects men, women and children of all ages, ethnicities and geographical locations irrespective of socioeconomic status, although it is more-prevalent in smokers. Autoimmune PAP accounts for > 90% of all cases. Management aims at improving symptoms and quality of life; whole-lung lavage effectively removes excessive surfactant. Novel pathogenesis-based therapies are in development, targeting GM-CSF signalling, immune modulation and cholesterol homeostasis.

### Characteristics of hospital admissions for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis: analysis of the nationwide inpatient sample (2012–2014) [^f239dbfd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare clinical syndrome, initially reported and described by Rosen et al. in 1958 characterized by lipid-rich proteinaceous material accumulating in the alveoli, resulting in dyspnea and cough. The overproduction or inadequate clearance of lung surfactant from pulmonary alveoli have three overarching etiologies: congenital, secondary, and mostly commonly, acquired or autoimmune PAP. Approximately 75% of cases can be diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage resulting in a characteristic opaque and milky appearance and the suggested diagnostic algorithm for those with compatible clinical and imaging findings on chest CT is to first pursue serum granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibody testing. The treatment for PAP is tailored to its etiology. In the case of congenital etiologies, supportive care is the standard, whereas in secondary etiologies, such as in PAP associated with hematologic malignancies, treatment of the underlying disease is initiated. The majority of cases observed are autoimmune PAP, which constitutes approximately 92% of cases, and is associated with increased levels of GM-CSF antibodies.

The most common treatment for autoimmune PAP is whole lung lavage. Various studies have attempted to determine its efficacy, and studies have previously estimated a 10–15% mortality rate from PAP-induced pulmonary failure, prior to whole lung lavage becoming standard of care. Although the exact indications for whole lung lavage have yet to be determined, recent studies and clinical reports generally suggest excellent response to this therapy, with long-term outcomes demonstrating clinical remission in > 70% of patients over the course of 7 years.

Given its relatively recent description, there is a paucity of epidemiologic data regarding the disorder itself. Historical estimates on incidence of PAP have ranged from 0.36 to 1.65 per million in different studies. Most recently, based on large epidemiologic studies from the US and Japan, the prevalence of PAP is felt to be approximately 7 per million. Unfortunately, the rarity of this disease has limited the amount of information we have surrounding the demographics of patients affected. In this study, we utilized the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database in order to better characterize the demographic data, length of stay, hospitalization cost, morbidity and mortality associated with PAP.

### Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis: new insights from a single-center cohort of 70 patients [^99a194dd]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare syndrome characterized by the intra-alveolar accumulation of surfactant lipids and proteins. The aim of the study is to describe the epidemiologic, clinical, physiologic, and laboratory features of PAP in a large single-center cohort of patients with PAP.

Study Population

Over 30 years, 70 patients with PAP were managed at our institution, 64 with primary and 6 with secondary PAP.

Results

The mean age at diagnosis was 43 years with a male to female ratio of 1.3. BAL was the most commonly applied diagnostic method, performed in 83% of cases. A history of smoking was seen in 79%, and of dust exposure in 54%, most commonly to aluminum, silica and sawdust. GM-CSF autoantibody correlated with clinical outcome and KL-6 with diffusing capacity. The number of whole lung lavages (WLL) necessary to reach remission was higher in current smokers.

Conclusions

This study shows that the use of BAL for the diagnosis of PAP can reduce the need of histological confirmation. A history of dust or fume inhalation is strongly associated with PAP, also with the autoimmune form. Smoking seems to influence the response to treatment, increasing the number of WLL necessary to reach remission.

Abstract

The profoundly hypoxemic child presents an interesting set of diagnostic and management challenges in the pediatric emergency department. While common pathologies including pneumonia, asthma, bronchiolitis, and pneumothoraces are managed using evidence-based algorithms, more enigmatic pathologies may present the treating physician with less diagnostic and therapeutic clarity. We present the case of a profoundly hypoxemic 16-year-old girl who presented in minimal distress, with oxyhemoglobin saturation of 63% on room air.

### Characteristics of a large cohort of patients with autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in Japan [^68b48f74]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Rationale

Acquired pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a syndrome characterized by pulmonary surfactant accumulation occurring in association with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibodies (autoimmune PAP) or as a consequence of another disease (secondary PAP). Because PAP is rare, prior reports were based on limited patient numbers or a synthesis of historical data.

Objectives

To describe the epidemiologic, clinical, physiologic, and laboratory features of autoimmune PAP in a large, contemporaneous cohort of patients with PAP.

Methods

Over 6 years, 248 patients with PAP were enrolled in a Japanese national registry, including 223 with autoimmune PAP.

Measurements and Main Results

Autoimmune PAP represented 89.9% of cases and had a minimum incidence and prevalence of 0.49 and 6.2 per million, respectively. The male to female ratio was 2.1:1, and the median age at diagnosis was 51 years. A history of smoking occurred in 56%, and dust exposure occurred in 23%; instances of familial onset did not occur. Dyspnea was the most common presenting symptom, occurring in 54.3%. Importantly, 31.8% of patients were asymptomatic and were identified by health screening. Intercurrent illnesses, including infections, were infrequent. A disease severity score reflecting the presence of symptoms and degree of hypoxemia correlated well with carbon monoxide diffusing capacity and serum biomarkers, less well with pulmonary function, and not with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibody levels or duration of disease.

Conclusions

Autoimmune PAP had an incidence and prevalence higher than previously reported and was not strongly linked to smoking, occupational exposure, or other illnesses. The disease severity score and biomarkers provide novel and potentially useful outcome measures in PAP.

### A case report of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [^ee7537cf]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

This is a case of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis that presented in an inner city hospital in Birmingham, UK. The patient was a previously well 42-year-old man, who went on to experience unusual cerebral complications of the disease. The presentation, imaging findings and diagnostic histology findings are described. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a rare but important diagnosis. Characteristic high-resolution CT findings include diffuse ground glass density with superimposed interlobular septal thickening, which is described as the "crazy paving" pattern. Diagnosis is made by bronchoalveolar lavage. Pathologically the disease is characterised by alveolar filling with a lipid rich, proteinaceous material (positive to periodic acid-Schiff stain) while the lung interstitium remains relatively normal. Morbidity and mortality can be improved by treatment with whole lung lavage.

This study had an increased proportion of subjects who underwent diagnostic bronchoscopy (70.8% vs. 41.7–83.3%) when compared with previous studies; however, the number of subjects who underwent surgical lung biopsy decreased (34.8% vs. 42.0–58.3%). In a review study based on patients with PAP between 1958 and 1988, surgical lung biopsy (71%) was the main diagnostic tool, while the proportion of bronchoscopy (10%) for diagnosis was low. However, compared with this earlier study, recent studies showed relatively high rates of bronchoscopy (56–97% [recent] vs. 10% [earlier]) and low rates of surgical lung biopsy (6–34% vs. 71%) for PAP diagnosis. These results collectively suggest that non-invasive tests are used more actively for the diagnosis of PAP due to increased experience.

Several limitations must be considered. Firstly, PAP cases were defined by using diagnostic codes from a national insurance claims database. Since this database did not provide information for personal identification to researchers due to the Korean Personal Information Protection Act, validation through medical chart review was not possible for the diagnosis of PAP cases. Consequently, this lack of validation may have led to an overestimation of the prevalence and incidence rates. To compensate for this shortcoming, the RID registration system, which demanded the subject to satisfy the universal diagnostic criteria for registration and to be reviewed by the medical institutions before submission to the NHI system, wss used. To calculate more accurate the incidence and prevalence of PAP, we also used the narrow definition of PAP. Secondly, our study only included the PAP patients who visited the secondary or tertiary medical institutes. This inclusion criterion might have led to selection bias in that only severe PAP cases were included. However, due to its rarity, it is unlikely that a diagnosis of PAP was made at primary medical institutions. Even if such diagnoses were made, their accuracy would have been a cause of concern. Thus, it was appropriate to exclude patients diagnosed at these primary medical institutions. Despite these limitations, our study yielded unbiased results from the entire population.

### Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in Korea: analysis of prevalence and incidence via a nationwide population-based study [^76fdb8cb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study population

All adult individuals (≥ 20 years) who visited the secondary or tertiary care medical institutions with the PAP-related KCD-7 code J84.0 as a diagnosis and the RID exempted calculation code V222 from 2010 to 2016 were included in the study. The NHI criteria required for PAP registration in the RID program are as follows: 1) compatible chest computed tomography findings with PAP and 2) bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or histopathologic findings compatible with PAP.

Since our study defined PAP cases structurally using claim data, narrow case definition was madden, to reduce possibility of overestimation or uncertainty of diagnosis. Following were the conditions used for narrow case definition; 1) at least two visits with a PAP-related code within a year of the first claim, and 2) claims of both chest computed tomography (CT) and diagnostic procedures (either bronchoscopy [BFS] or surgical lung biopsy) within 90 days before or after the first claim. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Centre (2017–1190).

### Diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis… [^6b257161]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Methods Papanicolaou-stained smears of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from 7 patients with PAP were evaluated. To serve as controls, the smears of 11 normal subjects and 128 patients with other pulmonary disorders were also examined. The findings on the presence and number of globules were recorded. To differentiate PAP from other pulmonary disorders, the highest globule value obtained from the control group was chosen as the cutoff point. The globules seen as solitary elements in Papanicolaou-stained smears were more than 100 globules per slide in all 7 patients with PAP. These globules appeared to be dark blue in Riu-stained smears. The globules and the amorphous material were PAS positive. Combined alcian blue and PAS-stained smears showed the globules with positive PAS staining of the proteinaceous material with a lack of significant alcian blue staining in all patients with PAP.

The highest globule value seen in Papanicolaou-stained smears of BALF obtained from the control group was 17. To distinguish PAP from other pulmonary disorders, the value of 18 globules was chosen as a cutoff point. Using this cutoff point, the globules seen in Papanicolaou-stained smears seemed to be highly sensitive and specific in aiding a diagnosis of PAP. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a disease characterized by phospholipoprotein material filling in the alveoli and terminal bronchial trees. Its diagnosis is mainly based on histopathologic findings obtained with TBLB or open lung biopsy specimens. However, the diagnostic yield of TBLB is usually unsatisfactory. 3, 4 Open lung biopsy may fail to ensure a diagnosis owing to sampling error and may not be without morbidity or mortality. Compared with TBLB and/or open lung biopsy, BAL can sample a much wider area and is safer for the patient.

When the differentiation is difficult, combined alcian blue and PAS and Grocott methenamine silver staining methods can be used to make a differential diagnosis. A diagnosis of PAP can be further confirmed by PAS stain, combined alcian blue and PAS stain, or electron microscopy of BALF specimens. To avoid an unnecessary delay or miss in making a diagnosis of PAP, it is suggested to reserve some slides of BALF specimens for the patient undergoing BAL.

### Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis with atypical clinical and bronchoscopic features [^cd09a605]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A man in his 40s presented with a 6-month history of progressive exertional dyspnoea. Initial evaluation, including high-resolution CT, which, while demonstrating some findings consistent with crazy-paving, was interpreted as a cellular non-specific interstitial pneumonia pattern when coupled with relative peripheral sparing. Furthermore, bronchoalveolar lavage yielded completely clear fluid with negative periodic acid-Schiff staining, leading to a working diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features, a research classification. Treatment with prednisone and nintedanib proved ineffective, and his symptoms worsened. Subsequent transbronchial cryobiopsy confirmed pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). Crucially, anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor antibodies were negative, establishing a diagnosis of idiopathic PAP. Inhaled recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor led to significant clinical and radiological improvement. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges of PAP with atypical features and highlights the pivotal role of lung biopsy in unresolved interstitial lung disease.

### Confocal laser endomicroscopy for diagnosis and monitoring of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [^7015a42f]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disease characterized by alveolar accumulation of lipoproteinaceous material resulting from a decreased clearance of surfactant components from the air spaces by the alveolar macrophages and type II epithelial cells.–The prevalence is approximately 0.5 to 1 per 1 million per year, and the peak incidence of the disease occurs at middle age. Among men, the relative risk for cigarette smokers is approximately 2.6.

The diagnosis of PAP is based on computed tomography, bronchoalveolar lavage, and histology. Antibodies to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) may also be helpful in making the diagnosis. The treatment of PAP includes whole-lung lavage, application of a recombinant GM-CSF, and lung transplantation.

A relatively new technology in pulmonary medicine, probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) allows for real-time minimally invasive intra-acinar imaging. In the pCLE technology, a specially designed optical probe can be inserted into the distal airway through the working channel of the bronchoscope to provide optical imaging. The confocal microscopy system enables illumination and detection from a single plane of imaging in the tissue to provide a gray-scale video sequence. The imaging system produced 9 frames⁻¹ for a 8966640 pixel image and a circular 600 mm diameter field of view. The lateral resolution and depth of focus of the probe were 3.5 and 0–50 mm, respectively. The lateral resolution was 3.5 μm. The images are produced through thousands of compacted microfibers, which allow flexibility through our bronchoscopes into the distal lung.–

The role of this new method in diagnosing and monitoring PAP patients after the treatment has yet to be investigated. To date, pulmonary pCLE has demonstrated the ability to detect the elastin scaffold of central and peripheral airways, the structure of alveoli, blood vessels, and alveolar macrophages.–Several studies summarizing the pCLE criteria of different inflammatory and oncologic lung diseases have been conducted.–Only 1 case report is devoted to pCLE imaging in a patient with PAP. The purpose of our study was to estimate the role of pCLE in diagnostics and treatment of PAP compared with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings, before and after whole-lung lavage.

### Primary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis: computed tomography features at diagnosis [^366d7236]. Pediatric Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of periodic acid-schiff-positive lipoproteinaceous material in the alveoli. Early diagnosis allows setting up of therapeutic lung lavages, which reduces the need for oxygen supplementation and weight gain.

Objective

To provide a description of radiological features by CT at the onset of primary PAP in children.

Materials and Methods

The clinical and radiological data of 24 patients, including 16 boys and 8 girls (median age: 12 months), diagnosed with a primary form of PAP between April 1992 and May 2012 in a tertiary referral hospital, were retrospectively reviewed. CT images were examined for the presence of alveolar and interstitial elementary lesions. Correlation between clinical and radiological findings was assessed.

Results

The types of elementary lesions detected were: ground-glass opacities (n = 24), intralobular lines (n = 24), thickened interlobular septa (n = 22), thickened fissures (n = 21), airspace consolidation (n = 16), hyperinflation (n = 16), cystic lesions (n = 2) and micronodules (n = 1). A crazy-paving pattern was found in 92% of cases. Consolidation and hyperinflation were especially detected in younger children (median age, 8 months, P < 0.01). A density dependent gradient was found. The distribution of the lesions was symmetrical. There was no correlation between radiological and clinical data of severity of the disease.

Conclusion

CT findings are suggestive of diagnosis of PAP in immunocompetent children with chronic respiratory failure.

Changes in the annual incidence rates

The age- and sex-standardized annual incidence rates were similar through the study period from 0.56 (95% CI: 0.35–0.84) per 10⁶ population at risk in 2012 to 0.52 (95% CI: 0.32–0.79) per 10⁶ population at risk in 2015 (Fig. 4 a). Both sexes also showed similar findings. The standardized annual incidence rates in men were 0.78 (95% CI: 0.44–1.27) per 10⁶ population at risk in 2012 and 0.60 (95% CI: 0.31–1.05) per 10⁶ population at risk in 2015, and those in women were 0.35 (95% CI: 0.14–0.70] per 10⁶ population at risk in 2012 and 0.44 (95% CI: 0.20–0.83) per 10⁶ population at risk in 2015. The age- and sex-standardized annual incidence rates according to the narrow definition were also stable between 2012 and 2015 in all patients (from 0.45 [95% CI: 0.26–0.70] to 0.39 [95% CI: 0.23–0.64] per 10⁶ population at risk), in men (from 0.67 [95% CI: 0.35–1.11] to 0.46 [95% CI: 0.21–0.85] per 10⁶ population at risk), and in women (from 0.25 [95% CI: 0.08–0.57] to 0.29 [95% CI: 0.11–0.64] per 10⁶ population at risk) (Fig. 4 b).

Incidence

Eighty-nine patients (males: 57, females: 32) were identified as incident cases between 2012 and 2015. The incidence rate was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.45–0.69) per 10⁶ population at risk in the whole population, and the incidence rates in men and women were 0.72 (95% CI: 0.55–0.94) and 0.40 (95% CI: 0.27–0.56) per 10⁶ population at risk, respectively (Additional file 3: Table S3).

### CT features of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [^a65f451f]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

This investigation describes the CT features of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in a large group of patients.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of 139 chest CT scans (79 thick-section scans and 60 thin-section scans) from 27 patients with pathologically proven pulmonary alveolar proteinosis was performed. Two independent observers assessed the intraslice patterns and zonal distribution of disease on three CT images of each lung. The observers also graded the percentage of ground-glass opacities, air-space opacities, fibrosis, interlobular opacities, intralobular opacities, and emphysema in each slice. CT scans obtained before and after lavage related to 12 whole-lung lavage treatments on nine patients were evaluated.

Results

The dominant intraslice pattern was geographic, but a diffuse pattern was sometimes seen. The most common zonal pattern was uniform; a lower zone predominance was next most frequent. Ground-glass, air-space, and fibrotic opacities had a generally homogeneous craniocaudal distribution, but there was a trend toward more interlobular opacities at the lung bases (p < 0.002). Ground-glass opacities were seen on at least one scan in 100% of the patients. Interlobular opacities (85%), air-space opacities (78%), substantial fibrosis (7%), and intralobular opacities (7%) occurred less frequently. Compared with thick-section images, thin-section images showed more interlobular opacities, but no difference in ground-glass, air-space, or fibrotic disease. The proportion of lung affected by ground-glass and interlobular opacities decreased significantly (p < 0.05) after lavage.

Conclusion

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis does not present only with alveolar disease. The CT appearance typically combines different types of opacities with a geographic pattern and a uniform zonal distribution with variation over time.

An American Thoracic Society / National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute research statement [^5f7c912b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) — GM-CSF autoantibodies (GMAab) diagnostic and predictive biomarker — states that autoimmune PAP is caused by disruption of GM-CSF signaling by anti–GM-CSF antibodies and that the test is noninvasive with sensitivity and specificity that approach 100% at a cutoff serum GMAab level of 5 μg/ml; because autoimmune PAP responds better to whole-lung lavage and GM-CSF therapy than other causes, GM-CSF autoantibodies also serve as a predictive biomarker; although widely accepted as a key diagnostic test, GM-CSF autoantibody testing is currently available only on a research basis.

Conclusions

When investigating a patient with severe PAP, the pneumologist should be aware of the wide range of diseases which can cause secondary PAP and consider interdisciplinary involvement of a hemato-oncologist. Conversely, hemato-oncologists should include PAP in the differential diagnosis of respiratory failure associated with pulmonary interstitial changes in hematologic diseases.

### Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis induced by silica dust? [^88f78ecf]. Occupational Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Abstract Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disease, with several aetiologies. This study reports the first Finnish case of PAP with possible induction by silica dust. A 58-year-old male patient had a documented history of heavy exposure to silica dust over a long period, although he himself considered the exposure to be low. The patient's cumulative exposure to silica dust was approximately 10 mg m⁻³ years according to the workplace measurements. The patient developed classical symptoms and signs of PAP that closely mimicked those of acute silicosis, but he did not have any signs of classic silicosis. We conclude that significant chronic exposure to silica favours the diagnosis of PAP rather than acute silicosis in this case. PAP should be taken into account when patients exposed to silica dust complain of respiratory symptoms. A patient's assessment of his/her exposure to silica may not always be reliable.

Demographics and diagnostic methods in incident cases

The mean age of incident cases was 50.8 ± 13.4 years (men: 52.1 ± 11.8 years, women: 48.4 ± 15.8 years). The male-to-female ratio of incident cases was 1.82 and peaked at age 40–49 years. Of the incident cases, 92.1 and 70.8% had claims of the chest CT and BFS for 90 days before and after the first visit, respectively (Table 1).

Materials

Data source

From the Health Insurance and Review Agency (HIRA) database between January 2010 and December 2016, de-identified health claims data were obtained. This agency covers all health claims from the Korean NHI scheme and other available medical assistance programs (i.e. the Medical Assistance Program and Veterans Affairs Schemes) in South Korea. HIRA electronically collects the health claims data from medical institutions and stored data in the HIRA claims database. HIRA database includes all healthcare utilization information from inpatients and outpatients, including patient demographics, diagnosis, diagnostic procedures, and prescribed medication. The seventh edition of the Korean Classification of Disease (KCD-7), and the modification of the 10th revision of the International Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems, (ICD-10) were the sources for diagnostic codes (Additional file 1: Table S1).

Since 2010, PAP was added to the Rare Intractable Disease (RID) registration program, an NHI scheme initiated in 2006 with a current total of 167 rare intractable diseases. For patients to be registered into the RID program, a physician must confirm the diagnosis of PAP using the NHI criteria. The registered patients are then provided a co-payment reduction of 90%. It is important to diagnose PAP correctly to meet all the NHI criteria, because medical institutions could not charge the NHI for medical expenses if a presumed diagnosis of PAP did not meet all the NHI criteria. Thus, all physicians involved strictly determined whether each patient qualified for registration in the RID system according to the standard NHI diagnostic criteria. Therefore, it is assumed that an accurate diagnosis must have been made at the time of RID registration. Also, previous studies have used the RID system to evaluate the prevalence and incidence of other rare diseases in Korea. Following registration, both PAP-related KCD-7 (J84.0) and RID codes (V222) were listed in PAP-related claims.

### Lipid-laden macrophages are not diagnostic of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis syndrome and can indicate lung injury [^f3cb6201]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with interest the recent case report by Israel and colleagues that describes a young woman that presented with acute hypoxemia, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and a history of e-cigarette use. The authors concluded that this was a case of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) secondary to vaping-associated lung injury on the basis of the radiological and cytological findings presented. The case presented is undoubtedly interesting, and the report raises several important topical issues, including the spectrum of e-cigarette– or vaping-associated lung injury (EVALI) and the utility of lipid-laden macrophages in BAL fluid. However, we have some remarks regarding this case and the suggested association between EVALI and PAP.

PAP is a rare syndrome characterized by progressive alveolar surfactant accumulation and hypoxemic respiratory failure and is categorized as primary, secondary, or congenital. Primary PAP accounts for the vast majority of cases and is caused by the disruption of GM-CSF (granulocyte–macrophage colony–stimulating factor) signaling, by GM-CSF autoantibodies (autoimmune PAP, accounting for 90% of cases), or by genetic mutations involving the GM-CSF receptor. Secondary PAP occurs in various conditions that cause altered function or a reduced number of alveolar macrophages resulting in abnormal surfactant clearance in the lung.

### Cytopathology of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis complicating lung transplantation [^9c2fc754]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a disorder of unknown origin that occurs rarely after lung transplantation. We identified a patient with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis 66 days after undergoing single lung transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We based the diagnosis on the presence of amorphous clumps or globules of acellular and finely granular material in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). This material persisted for an 18.5-month period and was present in 9 of 14 lavage specimens. However, despite its presence in the native lung at autopsy, the material was seen in only 1 of 14 transbronchial lung biopsy specimens. Although uncommon, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis can be diagnosed readily in BALF by its distinctive cytopathologic features and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary disease in lung transplant recipients.

### Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis following cryptococcal meningitis: a possible cause? [^f945ecd7]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare interstitial lung disease characterised by the presence of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) autoantibodies. A man with no history of infection developed cryptococcal meningitis and a right parahilar cryptococcal mass. Antifungal treatment led to infection control, although there was presence of neurological sequelae. After 3 years, thoracic CT revealed bilateral ground glass opacities and a crazy paving pattern. Transparietal needle biopsy showed proteinaceous alveolar deposits, confirming the diagnosis of PAP. A high titre of serum anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies was found. No specific treatment was started, and radiological lesions decreased progressively. Cryptococcal infection may occur in PAP and in patients with anti-GM-CSF antibodies without PAP. These antibodies dysregulate phagocytosis in monocytes and macrophages, possibly leading to opportunistic infections in previously healthy subjects.

### Hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis: pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis, and therapy [^2defa683]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Rationale

We identified a 6-year-old girl with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), impaired granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor function, and increased GM-CSF.

Objectives

Increased serum GM-CSF may be useful to identify individuals with PAP caused by GM-CSF receptor dysfunction.

Methods

We screened 187 patients referred to us for measurement of GM-CSF autoantibodies to diagnose autoimmune PAP. Five were children with PAP and increased serum GM-CSF but without GM-CSF autoantibodies or any disease causing secondary PAP; all were studied with family members, subsequently identified patients, and controls.

Measurement and Main Results

Eight children (seven female, one male) were identified with PAP caused by recessive CSF2RA mutations. Six presented with progressive dyspnea of insidious onset at 4.8 ± 1.6 years and two were asymptomatic at ages 5 and 8 years. Radiologic and histopathologic manifestations were similar to those of autoimmune PAP. Molecular analysis demonstrated that GM-CSF signaling was absent in six and severely reduced in two patients. The GM-CSF receptor β chain was detected in all patients, whereas the α chain was absent in six and abnormal in two, paralleling the GM-CSF signaling defects. Genetic analysis revealed multiple distinct CSF2RA abnormalities, including missense, duplication, frameshift, and nonsense mutations; exon and gene deletion; and cryptic alternative splicing. All symptomatic patients responded well to whole-lung lavage therapy.

Conclusions

CSF2RA mutations cause a genetic form of PAP presenting as insidious, progressive dyspnea in children that can be diagnosed by a combination of characteristic radiologic findings and blood tests and treated successfully by whole-lung lavage.

### Recurrent pulmonary alveolar proteinosis after lung transplantation: a case series [^3bb7ad8c]. Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disorder that is characterized by the accumulation of proteinaceous material in the alveoli, leading to dyspnea, pulmonary fibrosis and potentially death. Lung transplantation represents the ultimate treatment option in patients with end-stage or refractory PAP. So far, post-transplant recurrence of PAP has been reported in only three individual cases worldwide. Moreover, there are no reported cases of PAP recurrence post-transplantation in existing patient registries. The detection of recurrent PAP presents a significant challenge after transplantation, given the high prevalence of infectious and immunological conditions in the differential diagnosis. Herein, we report PAP recurrence in three patients who underwent lung transplantation for PAP at our center, confirmed through CT imaging and histological findings. PAP recurrence in two patients with prior autoimmune PAP appears to have a mild clinical course, while a fatal course of PAP recurrence was observed in a patient with prior secondary PAP. Considering all reported cases, PAP recurrence was observed across all forms of pre-transplant PAP, contributing to death in three of the six cases. We call for increased awareness of this potentially underdiagnosed complication in patients undergoing lung transplantation due to PAP.

### Current status and future opportunities in lung precision medicine research with a focus on biomarkers. An American Thoracic Society / National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute research statement [^15e0f77c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) — biomarker-directed evaluation beyond autoimmune disease — notes that additional biomarkers are useful for identifying other causes and can be used in an algorithmic manner; for patients with negative serum GM-CSF autoantibodies and elevated levels of serum GM-CSF without apparent associated diseases, further evaluation for hereditary PAP by analyzing GM-CSF receptor gene (CSF2RA or CSF2RB) mutations is recommended on-page, and whole-blood GM-CSF signaling tests such as the GM-CSF-induced STAT5 phosphorylation index test may support the diagnosis of primary PAP.

### Update in nonneoplastic lung diseases [^d78f23ad]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Context

Nonneoplastic lung diseases include a wide range of pathologic disorders from asthma to interstitial lung disease to pulmonary hypertension. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of many of these disorders may ultimately impact diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis. It is important for the practicing pathologist to be aware of this new information and to understand how it impacts the diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of these diseases.

Objective

To update current progress toward elucidating the pathophysiology of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension, as well as to present classification systems for pulmonary hypertension, asthma, and interstitial lung disease and describe how these advances relate to the current practice of pulmonary pathology.

Data Sources

Published literature from PubMed (National Library of Medicine) and primary material from the authors' institution.

Conclusions

Improved understanding of the pathophysiology of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, pulmonary hypertension, and idiopathic hemosiderosis may impact the role of the surgical pathologist. New markers of disease may need to be assessed by immunohistochemistry or molecular techniques. The classification systems for interstitial lung disease, asthma, and pulmonary hypertension are evolving, and surgical pathologists should consider the clinicopathologic context of their diagnoses of these entities.

### Development of microscopic polyangiitis-related pulmonary fibrosis in a patient with autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [^9f47724d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Many studies have shown that ANCA production is key to the pathogenesis of MPA. ANCA is known to activate neutrophils and allow their accumulation at the endothelial portion of a vasculitic lesion. ANCA is also an excellent diagnostic marker of MPA with specificity of 96.3–99.1%. Based on these findings, the European League against Rheumatism and the American College of Rheumatology established new criteria that emphasized serum ANCA in the diagnosis of MPA. A new criterion of MPA, proposed by Watts, lays more emphasis on the role of ANCA in MPA diagnosis, wherein histopathological signs of vasculitis are not essential for the diagnosis. Our case met these criteria due to the patient's high level of MPO-ANCA and the associated urinary findings.

There are several reports of pulmonary fibrosis that developed in patients with aPAP. In these cases, as in ours, the features of PAP disappeared as pulmonary fibrosis progressed. As Luisetti et al. mentioned, it is not possible for us to exclude that some subjects diagnosed with diffuse fibrotic lung disease actually represented the end-stage evolution of a previous pulmonary alveolar proteinosis process. If a patient's BALF or HRCT does not show a typical PAP appearance at the time of admission, serum GM-CSF autoantibody is not usually measured. Thus, the link between PAP and pulmonary fibrosis must be explored. In this report, we suggest the role of ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis in the pathogenesis of aPAP-related pulmonary fibrosis. We sought to verify the existence of ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis in patients with aPAP-related pulmonary fibrosis, because in these cases, steroids or immunosuppressants (including rituximab) that are not usually used for the treatment of aPAP may be effective for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. There is one reported case of secondary PAP with high levels of MPO-ANCA. Further research will be necessary to elucidate the link between aPAP and ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis. Serum ANCA levels should be examined in cases of aPAP complicated by pulmonary fibrosis.

### Characteristics of hospital admissions for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis: analysis of the nationwide inpatient sample (2012–2014) [^4ac9d4d8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare clinical syndrome involving the accumulation of lipid-rich proteinaceous material in the alveoli. There is a paucity of published studies on this condition. To better characterize the demographics, complication rates, mortality, and healthcare costs of patients hospitalized for PAP in the United States, a secondary analysis on the Hospital Cost and Utilization Project's Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was performed on patients admitted from 2012 to 2014 with a diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.

Methods

Using the NIS database, a secondary analysis was performed on 500 admissions with the diagnosis "pulmonary alveolar proteinosis". The clinical variables and outcome measures extracted were: patient demographics, hospital costs, length of stay, frequency of admissions, and inpatient mortality rate.

Results

Among a weighted estimate of 500 hospital admissions from 2012 to 2014, the number of PAP admissions averaged 4.7 per million. The population was predominantly male (55%) with a mean age of 41.45 (CI 38.3–44.5) from all socioeconomic levels. Inpatient mortality was calculated to be 5%, which may result from the fact that the majority of admitted patients had few or no comorbid conditions (CCI 0.72). The most common procedure performed during admission was a bronchoalveolar lavage. Mean length of stay was 6.2 days (CI 3.9–8.5) and average cost of admission was $29,932.20 (CI 13,739–46,124). Of note, 50% of these admissions were considered "elective".

Conclusions

Demographics of patients with PAP who have been hospitalized in the United States are similar to previously reported demographics from prior patient cohorts, specifically a male predominance and a mean age in the 40 s. The inpatient mortality rate of 5% we found is consistent with prior studies demonstrating good disease-specific survival rates. Notably, the cost per admission and overall annual cost associated with PAP hospitalization was calculated to be $29932.20 and $5 million respectively. This reflects the high economic cost associated with hospitalization of PAP patients, and provokes thought about ways to make treatment more cost-effective.

### CYFRA21-1 is a more sensitive biomarker to assess the severity of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [^1eeec59f]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

This study was conducted in Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital and consisted of a retrospective cross-sectional analysis from January 2004 to December 2019. During this period, 168 patients were diagnosed with PAP in our institution. Of these, the data of 151 APAP patients were retrospective analyzed in this study after excluding 12 patients with second PAP and five patients whose data was incomplete. Among the enrolled patients, some had comorbidities, such as hypertension and a history of surgery at certain sites, but none of these comorbidities resulted in increased antibodies to GM-CSF. 27 patients were advised to delayed treatment and regular chest CT review, 19 patients refused whole lung lavage (WLL) or GM-CSF therapy, 105 patients received corresponding treatment (WLL: 35; subcutaneous GM-CSF: 49; inhaled GM-CSF: 6; WLL with subcutaneous GM-CSF: 9; WLL with inhaled GM-CSF: 6). Six months' follow-up data of 88 patients were available. The normal control group was formed with 57 persons who were in the physical examination center. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants through letters. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital (K19-142; Shanghai, China).

Diagnostic criteria

Eligibility criteria were selected as described by Ben-Dov et al. These criteria included histopathologic findings of specimens obtained by open lung biopsy or transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB); a typical milk-like appearance of BALF, which with lamellar bodies visible in electron microscopy; ground-glass opacity and/or a crazy-paving pattern on HRCT; higher number of GM-CSF antibodies in serum; restrictive ventilation and diffusion dysfunction; clinical symptoms (i.e. dyspnea and cough). The patient would be diagnosed with APAP according to typical HRCT pattern, histopathologic findings or typical BALF, and a higher number of GM-CSF antibodies in serum after excluding other diseases which resulted in GM-CSF antibodies increasing. In this study, the diagnosis of APAP was established by BALF (n = 54), TBLB results (n = 55), or open lung biopsy results (n = 42).

### A national registry for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis… [^d643557a]. ClinicalTrials (2015). Low credibility.

In current clinical practice, PAP is diagnosed based on a lung biopsy; an approach that is not able to identify the PAP-causing disease in anyone. Current therapy involves the physical removal of surfactant by a procedure in which the lungs are repeatedly filled with saline and emptied
- whole lung lavage, which is invasive, inefficient, and not widely available, especially for children. The specific objectives of this study are to: 1) determine the ability of the DBSC GMAb Test to correctly identify autoimmune PAP among people with PAP of any type, 2) estimate the prevalence of autoimmune PAP, 3) increase communication and knowledge about PAP-causing diseases, PAP research advances, and future.

research studies among PAP patients, healthcare providers, the medical community, the PAP Foundation, the Translational Pulmonary Science Center and the general public, 4) evaluate the ability of DBSC-based test to correctly identify genetic factors that increase the risk of developing PAP; and 5) to evaluate the ability of the DBSC GMAb Test to correctly identify autoimmune PAP among people with PAP of any type, or another lung diseases, and healthy controls. The experimental approach will compare GMAb levels from DBSCs from Participants diagnosed with PAP and determine the fraction of autoimmune PAP patients among individuals with PAP. DBSC-based genetic testing will be compared to current blood-based methods for identification of known genetic risk factors for developing PAP. Lastly, DBSC GMAb values will be compared to GMAb values from healthy and lung disease controls to determine the ability of the DBSC GMAb test to identify patients with autoimmune PAP.

The aPAP-DSS will be a composite of patient-reported and objective function data measuring patient's breathlessness
- using a dyspnea index, oxygen delivery
- using a lung function index, therapeutic oxygen requirement
- using a supplemental oxygen index, and health status and function
- using a quality of life index. We will compare the multivariate aPAP-DSS with A-aDO2
- the gold standard for measuring lung dysfunction in aPAP, with radiological lung density
- a direct measure of amount of pathological surfactant accumulation that causes the clinical manifestations of aPAP, and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire
- a health outcomes tool.

### Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in pediatric leukemia [^f74e27d1]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disorder characterized by intra-alveolar accumulation of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive surfactant components. Leukemia is the cancer most often associated with PAP; prolonged neutropenia and reduction of alveolar macrophages by myeloablative chemotherapy or leukemic infiltration are implicated. Only isolated cases of PAP have been reported, and pediatric experience is limited.

Procedure

We reviewed all pathology records (1962–2007) of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital to identify patients with PAP.

Results

Five patients had PAP. As expected, all had leukemia and had profound neutropenia at onset of PAP. A diagnosis was made only after PAS staining of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), lung biopsy, or autopsy specimens. Two patients had Down syndrome, which is not known to be associated with PAP. The other three patients had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Two patients showed clinical improvement or histological disappearance of PAP after neutropenia resolved.

Conclusions

PAP should be considered in the differential diagnosis of severe respiratory symptoms in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancy, especially those with Down syndrome, a history of HSCT, or active disease. PAP should be confirmed by PAS staining of a BAL or lung biopsy specimen.

### Napsin – A immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [^83cfd1a0]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Context —

The diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) relies on a limited set of stains, namely hematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid-Schiff-diastase (PAS-D), demonstrating abundant alveolar material representing mostly surfactant. As cells harboring surfactant also express Napsin-A (pneumocytes and macrophages), we hypothesized that it would also be expressed within alveoli in PAP.

Objective —

To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of Napsin-A in the diagnosis of PAP.

Design —

A 12-year retrospective case control study was designed to identify cases of PAP and potential histologic mimics (intra-alveolar fibrin, pulmonary edema, diffuse alveolar damage, and alveolar mucinosis). PAS-D staining and Napsin-A immunohistochemistry were performed. Distribution and intensity were evaluated by using a semiquantitative 3-point scale. Positivity was defined as 2+ intensity score, regardless of distribution.

Results —

Eleven cases of PAP and 46 control cases were identified. Napsin-A showed positivity in all PAP cases and 3 of 12 cases of edema. Among positive cases, all those with a 2+ distribution were PAP cases, with heterogeneous (1+) staining in all cases of edema. PAS-D showed positivity in all cases of PAP and most controls, except cases of edema. Sensitivity and specificity of Napsin-A for PAP were 100% and 94%, respectively, and of PAS-D for PAP, 100% and 21%, respectively. Double positivity for Napsin-A and PAS-D was 100% specific and sensitive for PAP.

Conclusions —

This study is the first to demonstrate that Napsin-A is highly specific for the diagnosis of PAP, more so than PAS-D. It also shows that the combined positivity of Napsin-A and PAS-D is 100% specific and sensitive for PAP.

Materials and methods

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

A total of 55 patients with PAP who were admitted at the Shanghai Lung Hospital from May 2014 to May 2018 were included in this study. Diagnostic criteria for PAP were the following: 1) patients with or without cough and polypnea; 2) chest HRCT showing typical paving stone signs; 3) under electron microscope, oval granules were observed in the lavage solution, with bright and dark threaded or fingerprint-like stripes, which suggested the presence of lamellar bodies (Fig. 1); 4) secondary factors such as industrial dust exposure, various infectious diseases, malignant hematological diseases or immunodeficiency diseases were excluded. The inclusion criteria were: (1) diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary alveolar proteinosis according to PAP diagnostic criteria; (2) 18–70 years old, both male and female; (3) Informed consent. Exclusion criteria were the following: (1) patients with secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis; (2) patients who received rhGM-CSF treatment within 6 months before enrollment; (3) those who received whole lung lavage treatment within 4 weeks before enrollment; (4) leukocyte count (> 12,000/ul); (5) fever > 38 °C; (6) severe edema: systemic diseases, such as cardiac insufficiency, liver and kidney insufficiency, etc.; (7) patients with severe diseases of other systems, including liver, kidney, lung, blood and cardiovascular diseases; (8) pregnant women or those planning the pregnancy, and lactating women; (9) patients with severe history of drug allergy or allergy constitution, or those allergic to Escherichia coli preparations; (10) unable to express subjective discomfort symptoms; (11) patients who are allergic to GM-CSF or not suitable for GM-CSF; (12) other conditions determined by the investigator that do not meet the inclusion criteria.

### From the definition of silicosis at the 1930 johannesburg conference to the blurred boundaries between pneumoconioses, sarcoidosis, and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) [^d17dcc86]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The 1930 International Labour Office Conference on silicosis in Johannesburg identified silicosis by setting a medicolegal framework to its nosology: as with other occupational illnesses, its medical content was fixed under economic pressure. This article follows a reading of all the proceedings of this conference (debates and reports of experts) to examine their potential impact on the etiology and nosology of other diseases, specifically sarcoidosis and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), "idiopathic" diseases in which inorganic particles may be involved. We propose renewed study of the role of inorganic particles in these diseases. To do this, we propose to mobilize detection means such as mineralogical analysis and electron microscopy and in depth interviewing that are currently seldom used in France, in order to establish diagnosis and the potential occupational and environmental origin of these diseases.

### A mini-whole lung lavage to treat autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) [^34ee3a06]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

This study is limited by its retrospective nature that restricts the accessibility of complementary data, such as radiological findings. Enrolled participants cannot be made equal through random assignment, however the statistical analysis here performed adjusted for pre-existing differences in non-equivalent groups.

We cannot exclude that an increasing expertise in diagnostic reasoning process could have finally improved also the practice setting, even if no changes in supportive care was made between 2009 and 2016. This issue was also adjusted in the statistical analysis. Moreover, as LDH diagnostic assay changed in 2011 in our central laboratory, we cannot compare the serum levels measured before and after this date. The small sample size is another critical issue; however, the extreme rarity of PAP should be taken into consideration. Further analysis are thus necessary to confirm the results here presented.

### Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in Korea: analysis of prevalence and incidence via a nationwide population-based study [^61b091eb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The age at diagnosis of PAP in our study was similar to that in previous Korean studies. Byun et al. using a cohort of 38 Korean patients who were diagnosed with PAP in 10 secondary and tertiary referral hospitals between 1993 and 2007, showed that the median diagnostic age of PAP was 52 years. Hwang et al. using a cohort of 78 PAP patients diagnosed between 1993 and 2014, also reported similar results (median: 47.5 years, interquartile range: 42.5–59 years). However, another study, using a cohort with 12 PAP patients diagnosed between 1987 and 1998, showed a younger diagnostic age (median: 43.5 years, interquartile range: 33.0–51.5) when compared with the previously mentioned recent studies. These findings might be attributed to the increase of the aging population in Korea; the proportion of the elderly (≥ 65 years) increased from 7.2% in 2000 to 13.8% in 2017 (Statistics Korea). In addition, since 2007, the Korean government has been offering regular health check-ups, including a chest x-ray every 2 years to all Koreans > 40 years of age; therefore, PAP patients > 40 years of age are more readily detected. This could explain the late diagnostic age of PAP observed in our current study. Recent prevalence of PAP in United States between 2008 and 2012 peaked at over 75 years followed by the aged 65–74 years also supports the global aging of PAP patients.

### Autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis: a dual pathology [^db7dab85]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare pulmonary condition which leads to excessive accumulation of proteinaceous material within the alveoli. Idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis (IPH) is another orphan lung disease and results in recurrent alveolar haemorrhage. This case study describes a case of these two rare pathologies occurring together. A man in his 50s presented with a 6-week history of haemoptysis and worsening dyspnoea. A CT scan of the thorax showed multifocal, bilateral ground glass opacification with a wide differential diagnosis. Full autoantibody screen including myositis panel and coeliac screen were negative. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and tissue from a transbronchial lung cryobiopsy were non-diagnostic. Tissue from a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of PAP with IPH as a second separate pathology. The association of IPH and PAP has not previously been described. We discuss these conditions and postulate how and if they may be related.

### CYFRA21-1 is a more sensitive biomarker to assess the severity of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [^82e74783]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung syndrome that was first described in 1958 and characterized by the intra-alveolar accumulation of surfactant lipids and proteins that impair gas exchange, which results in progressive respiratory insufficiency. PAP was divided into three groups, namely, congenital PAP, secondary PAP, and autoimmune PAP (APAP). The prevalence of APAP is 0.1 per 100,000 population and accounts for about 90% of all PAP cases. Granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibodies were significantly increased in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with APAP and had a high affinity with GM-CSF and decreased GM-CSF activity.

Inoue et al. had suggested the use of the disease severity score (DSS) to assess the severity of PAP and divided the patients five grades on that basis. In 2016, our team proposed the severity and prognosis score of PAP (SPSP) based on smoking status, symptoms, arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂), high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) score, and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), %predicted. SPSP could more precisely assess the severity and make the prognosis for patients with PAP. The levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CYFRA21-1 in patients with APAP were higher than the normal controls, and the common biomarkers. It was not clear which biomarkers were more sensitive to the severity of APAP among the patients.

### GATA2 deficiency in children and adults with severe pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and hematologic disorders [^737970af]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Here we also show that WLLs are feasible also for children, even at very young age, with small sized airways and in the presence of severe respiratory distress, using techniques we have established previously. WLL can be used to symptomatically treat all types of PAP and to bridge until the underlying condition can be cured or alternative treatments have been implemented.

Due to relative immune deficiency state and irrespective of the cause, the impact of infections should be considered carefully. It is likely that with often severe respiratory tract infections PAP may be triggered to deteriorate. Thus we recommend early diagnosis and proper antimicrobial treatment, in particular of organisms characteristic for these often lethal conditions, including mycobacteria, nocardia, herpes viruses, and fungi. In addition and concordant with the immune deficiency the extensive usage of systemic corticosteroids should be cautioned, as there is so far no evidence of their beneficial effect in PAP. Extensive usage might enhance immune deficiency and weaken antimicrobial defense further.

After confirming the diagnosis of PAP either by a combination of characteristic CT scan and BAL findings and trans-bronchial or open lung biopsy, it is important to determine the etiology of PAP. As more than 90% of PAP in adulthood is caused by autoantibodies against GM-CSF, this condition has to be initially excluded by analysis of serum. None of our patients had increased levels of GM-CSF autoantibodies. Serum levels of GM-CSF are low in autoimmune PAP, whereas elevated values can be found in congenital GM-CSFRa or GM-CSFRb defects and possibly in other forms of PAP. Thus, particularly in children these other entities need to be excluded. In our cohort of patients with severe PAP and hematologic diseases, serum GM-CSF level were low to intermediate, supporting some up regulation of GM-CSF. Next, genetic analysis of GATA2 is helpful in order to diagnose the underlying hematologic entity more precisely, in particular in patients who meet the broad but characteristic phenotype of GATA2 deficiency. This diagnostic algorithm for PAP will allow differentiating important subgroups and may help to identify further genetic abnormalities, known or suspected to be associated with PAP.

### COVID-19 pneumonia: the great radiological mimicker [^58112c36]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis

The most common CT findings of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis are bilateral, diffuse, or patchy GGOs and consolidations. The crazy-paving pattern (GGOs superimposed with interlobular and intralobular septal thickening), which was recently reported in COVID-19 pneumonia, was initially described in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (Fig. 12). Increasing opacities and the presence of the pattern in COVID-19 pneumonia is thought to reflect disease progression.

Sarcoidosis

COVID-19 pneumonia may resemble atypical sarcoidosis in some cases with patchy or nodular/mass-like GGOs, consolidations, a crazy-paving pattern, and a reverse halo sign (Fig. 13). Typical findings of sarcoidosis such as mediastinal and/or bilateral hilar lymphadenopathies and perilymphatic nodular opacities with upper lobe predilection do not match those of COVID-19 pneumonia. In sarcoidosis, the consolidation ring of the reverse halo sign may have nodularities due to the granulomatous process.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) procedure — instillation, retrieval, and sample requirements: Normal saline at room temperature is instilled with a total volume between 100 and 300 mL divided into three to five aliquots, and each aliquot is retrieved using negative suction pressure less than 100 mm Hg. The minimal total volume retrieved should be greater than or equal to 5% of the instilled volume, and if less than 5% of each instilled aliquot is recovered due to retention of fluid in the lung, the procedure should be aborted to avoid increased risk. For cellular analysis, a minimal pooled volume of 5 mL is needed (optimal 10–20 ml), and pooling aliquots for routine analyses is acceptable. Gross appearance may aid diagnosis; BAL fluid with flocculent material that settles to the bottom of the container within 15 to 20 minutes is highly suggestive of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.

### A patient journey map for people living with autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [^45b2d38e]. Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) face a complicated journey (physically, emotionally, and financially) to receive the correct diagnosis and treatment. We developed a patient journey map (PJM) to describe the experiences and needs of patients with autoimmune PAP in the USA.

Methods

This PJM was developed in four stages: (1) analysis of existing literature; (2) patient advisory board meetings (n = 7); (3) an online survey (n = 19); and (4) a validation workshop (n = 6).

Results

Four phases of the patient journey were identified: (1) symptoms and experience before diagnosis; (2) diagnosis; (3) treatment; and (4) ongoing monitoring. Patients reported heterogeneous and indirect diagnostic pathways, often waiting months or years for the correct diagnosis. The majority reported at least one misdiagnosis, most commonly pneumonia. Treatment pathways varied substantially, and current treatments and off-label therapies were frequently described as burdensome, emotionally taxing, and/or financially worrisome. Patients described their journey as an "emotional rollercoaster", especially during pre-diagnosis and treatment. Patients reported common barriers to care, particularly insurance problems and access to expert care. Patients specifically cited the need for improved education on autoimmune PAP within the medical community and increased help with insurance challenges related to current treatments.

Conclusions

This PJM provides insights on patients' journeys with autoimmune PAP. Patients reported inconsistent, burdensome, and circuitous journeys. This PJM provides the medical community with valuable information on patients' needs and increases awareness of this rare disease. Over time, these factors may improve diagnosis, treatment, and the holistic experience of patients with autoimmune PAP.

### Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis with myeloproliferative syndrome with myelodysplasia: bronchoalveolar lavage reduces white blood cell count [^c0694562]. American Journal of Hematology (2006). Low credibility.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disorder characterized by surfactant component accumulation in the alveolar space. Primary PAP is likely an autoimmune disorder caused by antibodies to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). When an underlying disease causes PAP, this is called secondary PAP. Hematologic malignancies are an important cause of secondary PAP. As the pathogenesis of primary PAP has become more fully understood, improvements in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches have followed. However, when PAP is secondary to an underlying hematologic malignancy, much remains unclear. Here we describe for the first time a patient with hybrid myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative syndrome and PAP who had a marked decrease in her white blood cell count following a transbronchial biopsy accompanied by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Similar significant decreases in WBC count accompanied clinical improvement following two unilateral BALs. Given that patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis frequently have elevated GM-CSF in bronchoalveolar fluid, this observation provides a unique vantage point to understand the pathophysiology of secondary PAP.

### Secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis: a single-center retrospective study (a case series and literature review) [^e5aa7df1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

This is a case study of patients who were diagnosed with PAP in Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) between Jan. 1st, 2000 and July 1st, 2016. Medical files were retroactively collected on Feb. 2017. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of PUMCH (S-K-215), and universal informed consent forms were signed when each subject was admitted to our hospital. The patients or their kin have given written informed consent to publish these case details. Patients had a clinical diagnosis of PAP, which was further confirmed pathologically by testing for amorphous periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive granules, found either in milky broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or in alveolar structures of lung biopsy tissues. Patients under 18 years old were excluded. Serum GM-CSF autoantibodies were evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as previously described. Patients with positive serum GM-CSF autoantibodies (> 5 μg/mL) were also excluded.

Methods of data analysis

The patients' quantitative characteristics such as age at diagnosis were summarized by median and range. The qualitative characteristics such as general appearance, imaging features and other organ complications were presented as a frequency distribution or percentage. Authors had no access to information that could identify individual participants during or after data collection.

### Comparative study of high-resolution CT findings between autoimmune and secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [^aac6ed2f]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Acquired pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) has been reclassified into autoimmune or secondary PAP according to the occurrence of serum granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibody. Most patients undergo high-resolution CT (HRCT) scanning in order for physicians to make a differential diagnosis of diffuse lung diseases, but no information is available to distinguish the HRCT scan features of secondary PAP from those of autoimmune PAP. The objective of this study was to characterize the HRCT scan features of autoimmune and secondary PAP.

Methods

HRCT scans of 42 patients (21 patients each in the autoimmune PAP and secondary PAP groups) were centrally collected and evaluated in a blinded manner.

Results

Ground-glass opacities (GGO) were a major finding in both the autoimmune PAP and secondary PAP groups. In the secondary PAP group, GGOs typically showed a diffuse pattern (62%), whereas GGOs showed a patchy geographic pattern in the autoimmune PAP group (71%; p < 0.005). The so-called "crazy-paving" appearance and subpleural sparing were frequently seen in the autoimmune PAP group (both 71%), whereas they were less frequently seen in the secondary PAP group (14% and 33%, respectively). The involved area of GGO was even in craniocaudal distribution for the secondary PAP group, whereas it was predominant in the lower lung field compared with the upper lung field in the autoimmune PAP group (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Typical HRCT scan findings for autoimmune PAP patients were GGO with a patchy geographic pattern, subpleural sparing, crazy-paving appearance, and predominance in the lower lung field. These findings were rather infrequent for secondary PAP patients.

### Differential diagnoses of COVID-19 pneumonia: the current challenge for the radiologist-a pictorial essay [^6f7d0080]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Aspiration pneumonia

It is caused by the aspiration of different substances into the airways and lungs. Radiological findings may vary, but frequently anamnesis is sufficient for the diagnosis.

To the purpose of our paper, we will focus on fluid aspiration pneumonia and on lipoid pneumonia.

Fluid aspiration pneumonia

Frequently, these patients are dysfagic and their meals are liquid. Radiological features for differential diagnosis are (Fig. 5 a):
dependent ground-glass opacities;
in the late phases, with recurrence of aspiration, fibrotic architectural distortions.

Fig. 5
a – d COVID-19 pneumonia differential diagnoses: aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. HRTCs of two patients affected by fluid aspiration pneumonia presenting with bilateral, dependent and confluent consolidative foci (white arrows in a) and chronic lipoid pneumonia (b, c), showing a low density consolidation (mean:- 46UH in white circle in c) surrounded by a crazy paving halo (black oval b). Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is characterised by bilateral areas of crazy paving (black arrows in d) and a peculiar juxtaposition of severely affected secondary lobules and normal secondary lobules

Lipoid pneumonia

It is an acute or chronic, reactive pneumonia resulting from endogenous lipid accumulation or from exogenous lipid aspiration. Chronic lipoid pneumonia requires differential diagnosis with COVID-19 pneumonia, while anamnesis is generally sufficient for a clear diagnosis of acute pneumonia.

Anamnesis of lipid inhalation or fat storage disease is necessary to diagnose a lipoid pneumonia. Comparison with previous chest exams is suggested.

Radiological features for differential diagnosis are (Fig. 5 b):
ground-glass opacities and consolidations predominantly involve the middle and inferior lobes;
consolidations typically present very low CT attenuation in relation to their fat content (Fig. 5 c);
fibrosis during chronic stage.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP)

It is a syndrome caused by progressive accumulation of surfactant in pulmonary alveoli and may be primary in most cases or secondary to toxic inhalation syndromes, haematologic neoplasms and immune deficiency. Anamnesis, laboratory tests and comparison with previous HRCTs are helpful.

Radiological features for differential diagnosis are (Fig. 5 d, e):
mainly centro-parenchymal and perihilar crazy paving areas;
juxtaposition of severely affected secondary lobules and normal secondary lobules;
rarely, consolidations with air bronchogram in severe forms;
fibrotic alterations in advanced stage;
pleural effusions, cardiomegaly and lymphadenomegalies, which are features of complicated PAP.

### Confocal laser endomicroscopy for diagnosis and monitoring of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [^5f1e223e]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2015). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In patients with PAP, in vivo confocal endomicroscopy reveals highly fluorescent complexes of granulated lipoproteinaceous material that is distributed from the distal bronchioles to the alveolar lumens. This material was present but less pronounced in the distal lung zones that were aerated on HRCT than in those that were not and was considerably reduced after whole-lung lavage. Apparently PAP diffusely affects lung parenchyma with varying severity of alveolar accumulation of amorphous complexes, and it may proceed not only subclinically but also to be radiologically indistinguishable. pCLE may prove useful for diagnosis of PAP and for evaluating the response to standard or experimental therapy for the disease.

### Pulmonary manifestations of GATA2 deficiency [^36a1c7ef]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

GATA2 deficiency is a genetic disorder of hematopoiesis, lymphatics, and immunity caused by autosomal dominant or sporadic mutations in GATA2. The disease has a broad phenotype encompassing immunodeficiency, myelodysplasia, leukemia, and vascular or lymphatic dysfunction as well as prominent pulmonary manifestations.

Research Question

What are the pulmonary manifestations of GATA2 deficiency?

Study Design and Methods

A retrospective review was conducted of clinical medical records, diagnostic imaging, pulmonary pathologic specimens, and tests of pulmonary function.

Results

Of 124 patients (95 probands and 29 ascertained), the lung was affected in 56%. In addition to chronic infections, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (11 probands) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (nine probands) were present. Thoracic CT imaging found small nodules in 54% (54 probands and 12 relatives), reticular infiltrates in 40% (45 probands and four relatives), paraseptal emphysema in 25% (30 probands and one relative), ground-glass opacities in 35% (41 probands and two relatives), consolidation in 21% (23 probands and two relatives), and a typical crazy-paving pattern in 7% (eight probands and no relatives). Nontuberculous mycobacteria were the most frequent organisms associated with chronic infection. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation successfully reversed myelodysplasia and immune deficiency and also improved pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in most patients.

Interpretation

GATA2 deficiency has prominent pulmonary manifestations. These clinical observations confirm the essential role of hematopoietic cells in many aspects of pulmonary function, including infections, alveolar proteinosis, and pulmonary hypertension, many of which precede the formal diagnosis, and many of which respond to stem cell transplantation.

### Clinical significance of cigarette smoking and dust exposure in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis: a Korean national survey [^8f1bac6b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disease characterized by the accumulation of excessive surfactant lipids and proteins within alveoli, leading to the impairment of gas exchange. Clinical manifestations vary from no symptoms to progressive respiratory failure. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) deficiencies or defects in GM-CSF receptors are known to be related to the pathogenesis. GM-CSF is required for the terminal differentiation of alveolar macrophages (AMs) which play a key role in the clearance of normal surfactant proteins and phospholipids. Three different forms of PAP have been identified: idiopathic (primary or autoimmune), secondary, and hereditary. More than 90% of PAP patients have idiopathic PAP (iPAP), a primary acquired disorder without familial predisposition in which GM-CSF neutralizing auto-antibodies are present. Secondary PAP is associated with various underlying diseases (hematologic malignancies, immunodeficiency disorders, infections) or inhalation injuries that cause AM dysfunction or deficiency in AM number. Hereditary PAP results from homozygous mutations of the genes encoding surfactant proteins and the ABCA3 transporter or from defects of the GM-CSF receptor.

To date, there have been several cross-sectional or retrospective studies enrolling a large cohort of PAP patients. Although the studies have shown similar results in the distribution of age, male predominance, clinical manifestations and treatment methods, there have been demonstrated differences in suspected risk factors of PAP such as smoking and dust exposure.

Therefore, our present study aimed to investigate clinical characteristics of Korean PAP patients and to examine the potential risk factors of PAP with a focus on smoking and dust exposure.

### My approach to interstitial lung disease using clinical, radiological and histopathological patterns [^a14cf2f6]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

4c: alveolar filling with eosinophilic material

The prototype of this pattern is pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). This distinctive disease results in dense granular eosinophilic material filling adjacent alveoli. PAP can be focal or segmental in distribution. Cholesterol clefts and hyaline globules are typically present in the granular infiltrates, and a rim of retraction often separates the infiltrates from adjacent alveolar walls (fig 23). The disease occurs commonly as a primary idiopathic form, but may also be seen as a secondary phenomenon in the settings of occupational disease (especially dust-related), drug-induced injury, haematological diseases and in many settings of immunodeficiency. The granularity of the alveolar material helps differentiate PAP from other alveolar filling processes (such as pulmonary oedema and Pneumocystis infection).

Figure 23
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). All of the diagnostic features of PAP are identifiable in this image: alveolar exudates with an eosinophilic granular appearance, scattered larger inclusions with more intense eosin staining, and slight retraction effect at the periphery of the alveolus. H&E stain, 40× original magnification.

4d: alveolar filling with blood and siderophages

Alveolar haemorrhage syndromes (discussed under pattern 1d) are the diagnosis of exclusion for this alveolar filling pattern. Sometimes striking alveolar haemorrhage can be seen in urgent lobectomy specimens from patients with persistent haemoptysis related to bronchiectasis or other airway/vascular abnormality. As always, the clinical context is essential, as this is most often a localised (ie, lobar) phenomenon.

4e: alveolar filling with neutrophils

Acute infectious bronchopneumonia is the prototype for alveolar filling with neutrophils. This pattern is most commonly identified in autopsy material and rare in surgical biopsy specimens. When this pattern is seen very focally in the specimen, consider other causes of neutrophil exudation, particularly capillaritis in diffuse alveolar haemorrhage.

### One-session bilateral sequential whole lung lavage (OSBSWLL) for the management of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [^aa3a6a47]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP) was recognized by Rosen in 1958. It is a rare entity with a prevalence between 3.2 to 6.7 cases per million. More than 90% of PAP cases occur as primary acquired disorders of unknown etiology.

The diagnosis of PAP is based on the clinical suspicion and radiologic findings (bilateral and symmetrical confluent airspace disease, and/or "crazy paving" pattern seen on computed tomography. The bronchoalveolar lavage effluent has a turbid and milky appearance due to the presence of foamy macrophages or monocyte-like alveolar macrophages with an increased number of lymphocytes. These changes are associated with a large periodic acid-Shift (PAS) positive acellular background of diffuse eosinophilic bodies, which is diagnostic of PAP. The presence of lamellar bodies under electron microscope examination can be used to confirm the diagnosis. These abnormalities translate into an enormous accumulation of surfactant lipoprotein in pulmonary alveoli leading to the clinical findings of increase alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient and hypoxemia.

Whole Lung Lavage (WLL), first described by Ramirez-Rivera in 1965, is currently the first line therapy for PAP. This procedure is performed to remove the excess surfactant proteins and lipids from the alveolar spaces in order to improve gas exchange. Most published case series, as well as a recent global survey, have shown that most centers perform WLL on two separate sessions. In our institution, we have been performing bilateral, sequential WLL on one session (OSBSWLL) since 1994, although inconsistently initially, it became more consistent over the past 15 years. We believe that OSBSWLL is safe to perform, comfortable for the patient, and could reduce costs of a second procedural session. Per our knowledge, this is the largest case series of OSBSWLL reported.

### Metabolic lung disease: imaging and histopathologic findings [^844fce12]. European Journal of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Metabolic lung disease includes pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), pulmonary amyloidosis, metastatic pulmonary calcification, dendritic pulmonary ossification, pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis, and storage diseases. In pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, CT demonstrates air-space consolidation with thickened interlobular septa, producing the so-called "crazy paving" appearance. Pulmonary amyloidosis can appear as parenchymal nodules (nodular parenchymal form), diffuse interstitial deposit (diffuse interstitial form), or submucosal deposits in the airways (tracheobronchial form). Metastatic pulmonary calcification may appear on high-resolution CT as numerous 3- to 10-mm diameter calcified nodules or, more commonly as fluffy and poorly defined nodular opacities. In pulmonary microlithiasis, high-resolution CT demonstrates diffuse punctuate micronodules showing slight perilobular predominance resulting in apparent calcification of interlobular septa. Niemann-Pick disease appears as ground-glass attenuation in the upper lung zone and thickening of the interlobular septa in the lower lung zone. Radiologic study including high-resolution CT will be helpful for the diagnosis and follow-up of these diseases.

### Secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis complicating myelodysplastic syndrome results in worsening of prognosis: a retrospective cohort study in Japan [^83b6b1f1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), a rare disorder predominantly affecting the lungs, is characterized by accumulation of surfactant lipids and proteins in the alveoli and terminal bronchioles. PAP is clinically classified into three distinct forms, namely, autoimmune, secondary, and congenital PAP. Autoimmune PAP is associated with disruption of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling caused by high levels of GM-CSF autoantibody in the lungs. Secondary PAP (sPAP) results from underlying diseases that presumably impair surfactant clearance because of abnormal numbers and functions of alveolar macrophages (AMs). Of the 40 cases of sPAP previously reported by our group, 88% (n = 35) involved hematological disorders as underlying diseases. The probability of survival at two years was 46% in cases with sPAP complicating hematological disorders. The median survival time for all cases including 17 patients who died within two years of the sPAP diagnosis was 16 months. Although myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is the most frequent underlying disease of sPAP (n = 26, 65%), little information is available on the prognostic impact of development of sPAP on patient outcome.

### Confocal laser endomicroscopy for diagnosis and monitoring of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [^5ae22141]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is based on computed tomography, histology, and antibodies to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The role of a novel technique for imaging cells and elastin during endoscopy, probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE), has not yet been investigated in PAP patients. The aim of the present study was to estimate the value of pCLE in the PAP diagnosis and treatment in comparison with the findings of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) before and after whole-lung lavage.

Methods

In vivo pCLE was performed during bronchoscopy in 6 male patients with PAP before and after whole-lung lavage. In certain lung segments, pCLE was followed by HRCT.

Results

During the in vivo pCLE, we found characteristic signs of PAP: a fluorescent floating amorphous substance in the alveoli lumen sticking to conglomerates along with alveolar macrophages. These features were present to a lesser extent after a whole-lung lavage. pCLE revealed specific PAP features not only in segments with crazy-paving and ground-glass opacity, but also in segments without HRCT findings.

Conclusions

The alveolar imaging in PAP patients is able to reveal characteristic changes, both in the presence and in the absence of HRCT findings. Therefore, pCLE may be a helpful tool for the diagnosis and whole-lung lavage therapy. Our data prove that accumulation of lipoproteinaceous substances within the alveoli at PAP is a diffuse but not a patchy process.

### Confocal laser endomicroscopy for diagnosis and monitoring of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [^6375947d]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2015). Low credibility.

Background:

The diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is based on computed tomography, histology, and antibodies to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The role of a novel technique for imaging cells and elastin during endoscopy, probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE), has not yet been investigated in PAP patients. The aim of the present study was to estimate the value of pCLE in the PAP diagnosis and treatment in comparison with the findings of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) before and after whole-lung lavage.

Methods:

In vivo pCLE was performed during bronchoscopy in 6 male patients with PAP before and after whole-lung lavage. In certain lung segments, pCLE was followed by HRCT.

Results:

During the in vivo pCLE, we found characteristic signs of PAP: a fluorescent floating amorphous substance in the alveoli lumen sticking to conglomerates along with alveolar macrophages. These features were present to a lesser extent after a whole-lung lavage. pCLE revealed specific PAP features not only in segments with crazy-paving and ground-glass opacity, but also in segments without HRCT findings.

Conclusions:

The alveolar imaging in PAP patients is able to reveal characteristic changes, both in the presence and in the absence of HRCT findings. Therefore, pCLE may be a helpful tool for the diagnosis and whole-lung lavage therapy. Our data prove that accumulation of lipoproteinaceous substances within the alveoli at PAP is a diffuse but not a patchy process.

### Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis: a comprehensive clinical perspective… [^1a324f76]. publications.aap.org (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a broad group of rare diseases that are defined by the occupation of a lung's gas-exchange area by pulmonary surfactants that are not properly removed. The clinical and radiologic phenotypes among them are very similar. The age of manifestation plays a central role in the differential diagnosis of the almost 100 conditions and provides an efficient path to the correct diagnosis. The diagnostic approach is tailored to identify genetic or autoimmune causes, exposure to environmental agents, and associations with numerous other diseases. Whole-lung lavages are the cornerstone of treatment, and children in particular depend on the expertise to perform such therapeutic lavages. Other treatment options and long-term survival are related to the condition causing the proteinosis.

### Clear vision through the haze: a practical approach to ground-glass opacity [^62575273]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Ground-glass opacity (GGO) is a common, nonspecific imaging finding on chest computed tomography that may occur in a variety of pulmonary diseases. GGO may be the result of partial filling of alveolar spaces, thickening of the alveolar walls or septal interstitium, or a combination of partial filling of alveolar spaces and thickening of the alveolar walls and septal interstitium at the histopathologic level. Diseases that commonly manifest on chest computed tomography as GGO include pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Generating an extensive list of possible causes of GGO in radiologic reports would not be helpful to referring physicians. Preferably, a more concise and focused list of differential diagnostic possibilities may be constructed using a systematic approach to further classify GGO based on morphology, distribution, and ancillary imaging findings, such as the presence of cysts, traction bronchiectasis, and air trapping. Correlation with clinical history, such as the chronicity of symptoms, the patient's immune status, and preexisting medical conditions is vital. By thorough analysis of imaging patterns and consideration of relevant clinical information, the radiologist can generate a succinct and useful imaging differential diagnosis when confronted with the nonspecific finding of GGO.

### Relationship between diffuse pulmonary fibrosis, alveolar proteinosis, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor autoantibodies [^b1ba75bb]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

Extensive pulmonary fibrosis is a rare occurrence in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. We report 2 cases that have interesting implications. A female patient was diagnosed with autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis that evolved over 7 years into diffuse fibrosis. In a male patient with diffuse fibrosis we incidentally detected electron microscopic features of alveolar surfactant accumulation and positive autoantibodies to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. In the male patient we speculated that the pulmonary fibrosis might have been preceded by an asymptomatic phase of autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and that we should investigate the involvement of surfactant dysfunction in the pathogenesis of fibrotic lung disease.

### Pulmonary fibrosis on high-resolution CT of patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [^97f77db0]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The CT findings of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) are not yet well defined. The objective of this study was to evaluate the CT findings of PAP with a focus on pulmonary fibrosis secondary to PAP.

Materials and Methods

High-resolution CT (HRCT) scans of 44 patients with PAP were evaluated retrospectively with a focus on pulmonary fibrosis: 33 patients had autoimmune PAP, and 11 patients had secondary PAP. The intervals between the initial and last CT examinations ranged from 1 to 284 months (median, 60 months). The HRCT images were assessed by two chest radiologists independently; when the two radiologists disagreed, a final decision was made by consensus.

Results

A crazy-paving pattern was a more common HRCT finding in patients with autoimmune PAP than in those with secondary PAP. Traction bronchiectasis was found in four patients (9%) on the initial scans and in 10 patients (23%) on the last scans. There was no honeycombing on the initial scans. Honeycombing developed in two patients (5%): It was detected on 2-year follow-up in one patient and on 6-year follow-up in the other patient. Among the patients with autoimmune PAP, those with fibrosis detected on HRCT during follow-up had a worse prognosis than those without fibrosis detected on HRCT (p = 0.041).

Conclusion

Fibrosis develops in approximately 20% of patients with PAP. The CT findings of parenchymal fibrosis suggest a poor outcome.

### A mini-whole lung lavage to treat autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) [^dcd094bb]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

We retrospectively analyzed 13 autoimmune PAP adult patients referred to our center and admitted to WLL treatment. PAP syndrome diagnosis was made according to the typical chest high-resolution CT findings (HRCT), "crazy paving pattern", and the presence of opaque, milky bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and/or the presence of amorphous, eosinophilic, PAS-positive material, as well as lipid-laden macrophages on bronchoalveolar lavage analysis. All the patients underwent medical history collection, physical examination, laboratory tests, anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies (GMAbs) dosage, radiological assessment with double projection chest X-Ray and HRCT, arterial blood gas analysis, global spirometry, CO diffusion capacity test, exercise tolerance testing (modified Bruce protocol or 6mWT) and broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) cytology. Determination of serum level of GMAbs was performed in the Laboratory of the Rare Lung Disease Consortium at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Serum biomarkers measurements (LDH, Cyfra 21–1, CEA, NSE) were performed in the clinical chemistry facilities according to internal standard operative procedures.

From 2009 to 2011, six autoimmune PAP patients (control group) underwent standard WLL, seven patients (study group) were admitted to "mini-WLL" from 2014 to 2016.

The "mini-WLL" procedure is characterized by the starting of chest percussion in concomitance with the first aliquot infusion and, consequently, consists in a reduction of the infusion volume for each lung from 15–20 to 9L.

Although there are no clearly established criteria for performing WLL, the recommendations followed by the Pavia Center include: (i) presence of persistent or progressive respiratory failure; (ii) absence of respiratory difficulty at rest, but drop by 5 or more percentage points of O₂ saturation on exercise tolerance test (modified Bruce protocol) determined by pulse oximetry; (iii) in selected cases, WLL may be discussed if a PAP patient, in particular a young adult, reports a significant limitation in daily or sports activities.

One month before the WLL and 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 months after the treatment pulmonary function tests were performed. The study also considered, in the period of observation (18 months), if there was a relapsing disease in need for a new WLL procedure.

The investigation was conducted in compliance with the Helsinki declaration.
