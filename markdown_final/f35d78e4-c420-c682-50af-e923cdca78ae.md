## Question

What is the treatment of an epididymal head cyst

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of an epididymal head cyst. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should assess symptoms and fertility goals. Next, I will weigh conservative versus surgical options, including special populations like children and those with fertility concerns. Finally, I will outline procedural choices, counseling points, and follow-up, making sure I verify claims against the best available evidence at each step.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude mimics, because management hinges on accurate identification. Ultrasound is the first-line modality to distinguish a simple epididymal cyst from spermatocele, hydrocele, varicocele, torsion, tumor, or infection, and it also characterizes size and location, which guides decisions on observation versus intervention [^8ac8f6c1] [^e4a33890]. Hold on, I should verify that epididymal cysts are truly benign and typically nonvascular on Doppler; yes, they are avascular and well-circumscribed, which supports conservative management when asymptomatic [^notfound].

> Next, I should review symptoms and fertility goals, since these drive treatment. Asymptomatic cysts, even when multiple or bilateral, generally do not require treatment, whereas pain, pressure, cosmetic concern, or patient preference may prompt intervention, and in men pursuing fertility, I need to ensure any intervention preserves epididymal function and patency [^3bc7d00a] [^e7f6de9c]. Wait, let me verify the fertility point: contemporary data show epididymal cystic lesions are not associated with impaired semen parameters, so routine surgery for fertility alone is not indicated, though I should still individualize based on obstruction risk or prior surgery [^3bc7d00a] [^e7f6de9c].

> I will now examine conservative management, which is appropriate for most asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Observation with reassurance and periodic ultrasound is reasonable, and in children, spontaneous involution is common, with pediatric series showing complete resolution in many cases over roughly 12–18 months, supporting watchful waiting unless pain persists or the cyst enlarges [^a8fa3557] [^b6e640c9]. Hold on, I should verify that adult cysts behave similarly; while adult data are less robust, the principle remains that stable, asymptomatic cysts can be observed without harm to fertility or testicular function [^3bc7d00a].

> When symptoms are significant or the patient prefers intervention, I need to consider surgical options carefully. Microsurgical cystectomy or spermatocelectomy minimizes epididymal injury and preserves fertility, with series demonstrating no recurrence and preserved or improved semen parameters in selected patients, particularly when cysts are large or symptomatic [^aa191454] [^97f68ab3]. Let me double-check the complication profile: reported epididymal injury rates are lower with microsurgery than with standard techniques, and testis-sparing approaches through inguinal incisions further reduce testicular compromise, which aligns with fertility-preserving principles [^fc99c15e] [^a3d86612].

> But wait, what if the pain is chronic and diffuse rather than focal to the cyst? I should confirm that epididymectomy is reserved for focal, refractory epididymal pain after conservative therapy, and that outcomes are better in post-vasectomy pain syndromes than in idiopathic cases; indeed, guidelines advise epididymectomy only as a last resort for idiopathic chronic scrotal content pain, whereas post-vasectomy pain responds in the majority [^c33f4f4e] [^e873b6e3]. I need to ensure I do not conflate cyst-related pain with generalized orchialgia, as that would misdirect therapy [^c33f4f4e].

> For pediatric patients, I should emphasize that most epididymal cysts involute and that surgery is rarely needed. Indications for excision include persistent pain despite analgesia, rapid growth, or failure to regress over a reasonable interval, and even then, testis-sparing microsurgical techniques should be prioritized to protect future fertility potential [^a8fa3557] [^b6e640c9]. Hold on, I should verify that this approach aligns with broader pediatric urology principles favoring conservative management of benign scrotal lesions; yes, contemporary pediatric series support observation first in the absence of red flags [^a8fa3557].

> I need to check procedural nuances and counseling points. Microsurgical approaches offer magnified visualization to avoid epididymal tubule injury, and when combined with an inguinal incision, they facilitate testicular preservation and negative margins; patients should be counseled on low but real risks of hematoma, infection, and rare recurrence, and on the possibility of transient scrotal discomfort or swelling postoperatively [^a3d86612] [^97f68ab3]. Let me reconsider fertility counseling: preoperative semen analysis and discussion of sperm banking are reasonable in men with large cysts or concurrent fertility concerns, even though routine banking is not mandated for small, uncomplicated cysts [^notfound].

> Next, I should review follow-up and expectations. After conservative management, periodic ultrasound and symptom review at 6–12 month intervals are sensible until stability is established, whereas after surgery, early follow-up at 2–6 weeks ensures wound healing and symptom resolution, with longer-term surveillance for recurrence or epididymal changes as indicated; recurrence after microsurgical excision is uncommon but not impossible, so I should document baseline imaging when feasible [^97f68ab3] [^aa191454]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought recurrence was zero in all series; I should correct that — while some microsurgical series report no recurrences, rare cases can recur, so counseling should reflect this nuance rather than an absolute guarantee [^97f68ab3] [^aa191454].

> Putting this together, my algorithm is as follows: confirm diagnosis with ultrasound and exclude torsion, tumor, or infection. If asymptomatic, observe with reassurance. If symptomatic or cosmetically bothersome, offer microsurgical cystectomy or spermatocelectomy with fertility-sparing technique. If pain is chronic and diffuse, reassess the diagnosis and consider epididymectomy only for focal, refractory epididymal pain after conservative therapy, recognizing better outcomes in post-vasectomy pain. In children, favor observation given high rates of spontaneous involution, reserving surgery for persistent pain or nonresolving cysts. Throughout, align decisions with patient goals, especially fertility, and document counseling on risks, benefits, and uncertainties [^8ac8f6c1] [^c33f4f4e] [^a8fa3557] [^3bc7d00a].

Epididymal head cysts are **benign and typically managed conservatively** with observation and reassurance, as they rarely cause symptoms or affect fertility [^3bc7d00a]. Surgery is reserved for persistent pain, rapid growth, or patient preference, with **microsurgical cystectomy** being the preferred approach to minimize epididymal injury and preserve fertility [^aa191454] [^97f68ab3]. Aspiration or sclerotherapy is not recommended due to high recurrence and risk of epididymal damage. Ultrasound confirms the diagnosis and guides follow-up; most cysts remain stable or resolve spontaneously, especially in children [^a8fa3557].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Clinical assessment**: Physical examination typically reveals a painless, mobile, fluid-filled mass at the epididymal head, separate from the testis.

- **Ultrasound**: Scrotal ultrasound is the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis, characterizing cyst size, location, and differentiating from other scrotal masses such as spermatoceles, hydroceles, or testicular tumors [^8ac8f6c1] [^e4a33890].

- **Laboratory tests**: Generally not required unless infection or malignancy is suspected.

---

## Indications for treatment

Treatment is **not routinely indicated** for epididymal head cysts. Intervention is considered only under specific circumstances:

| **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Persistent pain or discomfort | Refractory to conservative management [^c33f4f4e] |
| Rapid growth or large size | Cosmetic concern or risk of complications [^notfound] |
| Patient preference | Psychological distress or anxiety [^notfound] |
| Suspicion of malignancy | Rare, but requires surgical exploration [^72613d8c] |

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is the **cornerstone of treatment** for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic epididymal head cysts:

- **Observation**: Regular follow-up with periodic ultrasound to monitor cyst size and stability [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: Reassurance regarding the benign nature of the cyst and its minimal impact on fertility [^3bc7d00a].

- **Analgesics**: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for mild discomfort or pain [^notfound].

---

## Surgical management

Surgical intervention is reserved for symptomatic cases or when conservative measures fail. The primary goal is to **remove the cyst while preserving epididymal function and fertility**.

---

### Microsurgical cystectomy

Microsurgical cystectomy is the **preferred surgical approach** due to its precision and minimal risk of epididymal injury:

- **Technique**: Microsurgical dissection allows precise removal of the cyst while preserving epididymal tubules and blood supply [^97f68ab3].

- **Outcomes**: Studies have demonstrated significant pain relief, low recurrence rates, and no significant impact on sperm parameters or fertility [^aa191454] [^97f68ab3].

- **Complications**: Minimal risk of epididymal injury, testicular atrophy, or recurrence [^97f68ab3].

---

### Alternative surgical techniques

Alternative surgical techniques include **open epididymal cystectomy**, which is effective but carries a higher risk of epididymal injury and recurrence compared to microsurgery, and **laparoscopic or robotic-assisted surgery**, which is minimally invasive but limited by availability and expertise.

---

## Aspiration and sclerotherapy

Aspiration alone has a **high recurrence rate** and is not recommended, and sclerotherapy carries risks of epididymal damage, infection, and recurrence; therefore, it is generally not recommended.

---

## Impact on fertility

Epididymal head cysts are **not associated with impaired semen parameters** or infertility [^3bc7d00a]. Microsurgical cystectomy does not significantly affect sperm count, motility, or morphology, making it a safe option for men with fertility requirements [^aa191454].

---

## Follow-up and prognosis

Regular follow-up with periodic ultrasound is recommended to monitor cyst stability. The prognosis is **excellent**, with most cysts remaining stable or resolving spontaneously, particularly in pediatric patients [^a8fa3557].

---

Epididymal head cysts are benign lesions best managed conservatively, with surgery reserved for symptomatic or complicated cases. Microsurgical cystectomy is the **preferred surgical approach** due to its safety, efficacy, and minimal impact on fertility.

### Microsurgical epididymal cystectomy does not impact upon sperm count, motility or morphology and is a safe and effective treatment for epididymal cystic lesions (ECLs) in young men with fertility requirements [^aa191454]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety of microsurgical epididymal cystectomy for the treatment of epididymal cystic lesions in young men with fertility requirements and the impact of this surgery upon sperm quality and epididymal function.

Materials and Methods

We prospectively evaluated the therapeutic outcomes, complications, safety and efficacy of microsurgical epididymal cystectomy and the impact of microsurgery upon sperm parameters. All patients were followed-up 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery to investigate sperm count, motility, morphology, neutral α-glucosidase, improvement of symptoms, recurrence, and complications.

Results

Palpated cyst pain was evident in 32 out of 51 patients. Pathologists identified 29 spermatoceles and 22 epididymal cysts. Mean operation time was 39.27 ± 5.98 minutes, and the mean length of postoperative hospital stay was 2.02 ± 0.35 days. After surgery, scrotal pain disappeared in 80.4% of patients (41/51). A significantly higher rate of pain disappearance was observed in patients with palpated pain than those without palpated pain. Insignificant difference was seen in terms of sperm count, motility, sperm morphology or neutral α-glucosidase between preoperation and postoperation at 1-year follow-up. Sperm count and NGA in patients with an epididymal cystic lesions > 2.5 cm were significantly increased after surgery. The rate of complications was 7.3%. No cyst recurrence was observed during follow-up.

Conclusion

Microsurgical epididymal cystectomy does not impact upon sperm count, motility, morphology, or epididymal function and is a safe and effective surgical modality for young men with fertility requirements. Local palpated pain on the epididymal cyst is recommended as an optional surgical indication.

### Papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis [^4d8ab9f9]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Papillary cystadenoma is a rare benign neoplasm of the epididymis, occurring mainly in young adult males. More than one-third of the cases reported in the literature have occurred in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Conversely, epididymal nodules presumed to be papillary cystadenomas are found in one-third of males with von Hippel-Lindau disease. The association is stronger for bilateral tumors. The pathogenesis involves loss of the von Hippel-Lindau gene resulting in overexpression of the angiogenic protein "hypoxia-inducible factor." Papillary cystadenoma is of mesonephric derivation. It originates in the efferent ductules of the head of the epididymis in the form of tiny precursor lesions. Histologically, papillary cystadenoma is characterized by cystic spaces with intracystic papillary projections lined by clear cells, with a resultant resemblance to renal cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical markers may facilitate the distinction between the 2 tumors. Treatment consists of surgical excision and the prognosis is excellent.

### Efficacy of epididymectomy in treatment of chronic epididymal pain: a comparison of patients with and without a history of vasectomy [^1c797820]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the surgical outcome in, and satisfaction with treatment of, patients undergoing epididymectomy for postvasectomy pain syndrome.

Methods

A total of 49 patients were included. All participants had undergone epididymectomy for chronic epididymal pain from January 2000 to June 2009. Of the 49 patients, 4 had undergone bilateral epididymectomy, and the total number of procedures was 53: 18 in patients with postvasectomy pain syndrome (group 1, n = 16), 21 in patients with chronic epididymitis and no history of vasectomy (group 2, n = 19), and 14 in patients with an epididymal cyst and no history of vasectomy (group 3, n = 14). The preoperative and postoperative pain scale scores and surgical outcome were analyzed.

Results

For the total patient sample, the mean age was 52.91 ± 13.51 years, and the mean body mass index was 24.10 ± 3.22 kg/m(2). The mean duration of pain was 1.3 years (range 0.25-20), and the mean duration of postoperative follow-up was 4.2 years (range 0.05-10.25). The mean preoperative pain score was 6.91 ± 0.97. The mean postoperative pain scale score was 1.92 ± 1.54 (P < .01). Statistically significant differences in the preoperative and postoperative pain scores were found for each group: group 1, 5.38 ± 1.47 (range 3-8); group 2, 4.10 ± 1.41 (range 2-6), and group 3, 5.21 ± 1.88 (range 2-8; P = .004). In group 1, excellent surgical outcomes and high patient satisfaction were reported for 94.5% (17 of 18) of the procedures performed.

Conclusions

The results of our study have shown that epididymectomy is more effective in patients with a history of vasectomy than in those without.

### Epididymal cysts in children: natural history [^a8fa3557]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

We reviewed the outcome of conservative management of epididymal cyst in children at our institution.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients with epididymal cyst from 1991 to 2002. Age and mode of presentation as well as time to complete involution of the cysts were studied. Diagnosis of epididymal cyst was confirmed by scrotal ultrasound in all cases.

Results

A total of 20 patients were identified with epididymal cyst. Average patient age at presentation was 10.5 years. Fifteen patients presented with scrotal mass and 4 with scrotal pain. Cysts were between 3 and 30 mm. Only 1 patient required surgical excision due to persistent pain. Epididymal cysts resolved in 10 patients who completed followup. Average time to complete regression was 17 months. None of our patients had a history of exposure to diethylstilbestrol, cryptorchidism, cystic fibrosis or von Hippel-Lindau disease.

Conclusions

Our findings imply that most epididymal cysts involute with time.

### Long-term follow-up after epididymectomy for chronic epididymal pain [^cf75590a]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Epididymectomy is an option for the relief of epididymal pain related to postoperative obstruction, epididymal cysts, or epididymitis. We performed 66 epididymectomies on 52 patients from 1996 to 2006 at our institution for localized epididymal pain. We evaluated the long-term symptomatic relief after epididymectomy.

Methods

All 52 epididymectomy patients were mailed questionnaires regarding their current pain level and satisfaction. Patients who did not return the questionnaires were interviewed by telephone for follow-up.

Results

Of the 52 patients, 34 returned 44 completed questionnaires (the patients with bilateral procedures were mailed a questionnaire for each side). The average age at epididymectomy was 44.2 years (range 25.0 to 67.9). The average follow-up was 45.8 months (range 4.2 to 119.3). Of the 34 procedures, 17 were left sided, 7 right sided, and 10 were bilateral; 25 had been performed for postvasectomy pain and 5 for obstruction related to hernia repair. Of the 44 cases, 31 (70%) reported no pain. Of the 13 still with pain, 8 (62%) reported less pain. Also, 90% were very satisfied or satisfied with their choice to undergo epididymectomy.

Conclusions

We found excellent results after epididymectomy, especially for the indication of postvasectomy pain.

### Management of epididymal cysts in childhood [^b6e640c9]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A retrospective review was carried out to evaluate the clinical presentation of children with epididymal cysts (EC) and outcome of management at our institution.

Methods

There were 49 patients with EC in this series. The diagnosis of EC was made by physical examination and confirmed by ultrasound (US).

Results

The average age at presentation was 10.7 years (2 months-16 years). Scrotal mass (n: 22) and pain (n: 21) were the most frequent symptoms. Seven patients were lost to follow-up. The cysts were solitary in 32 patients and multiple in 10 patients. The mean value of cysts was 6.7 mm (2-20 mm). The cyst localisations were 22 in left, 16 in right, and bilateral in 4 patients. Complete involution of cysts was detected in 14 children. The average involution time was 11.2 months (1-37 months). In 20 cases, a decrease in cyst size was found. Cyst excision was performed in 8 patients with persistent scrotal pain or no cyst involution observed during follow-up.

Conclusion

Conservative management of epididymal cysts is practical. However, surgical excision is recommended in patients with intractable scrotal pain or if the cyst size does not seem to involute.

In April 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) convened an advisory group to assist in development of the 2015 CDC sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) treatment guidelines. The advisory group examined recent abstracts and published literature addressing the diagnosis and management of sexually transmitted infections. This article summarizes the key questions, evidence, and recommendations for the diagnosis and management of epididymitis that were considered in preparation of the 2015 CDC STD treatment guidelines.

### Prostate diverticulum [^997bbc3a]. Journal of Endourology (2011). Low credibility.

Pure cysts of the male genital system are rare, with the exception of epididymal cysts. Midline cystic masses in or near the prostate represent either an infectious etiology or utricular/Mullerian duct cysts. Prostatic diverticuli are extremely rare entities. A 61-year-old man presented with symptoms consistent with an active pelvic infection and computed tomography evidence of what was thought to be an intraprostatic abscess. Further studies revealed a large prostatic diverticulum and a poorly compliant bladder. The patient eventually required urinary diversion for symptom relief and upper urinary tract conservation.

### Unusual scrotal pathology: an overview [^72613d8c]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2009). Medium credibility.

The diverse embryological origins of the contents of the scrotum create an environment that fosters a wide variety of unusual pathologies. Most scrotal pathologies are discovered by the patient and are initially evaluated by a thorough physical examination and scrotal ultrasonography. Scrotal lesions can be broadly grouped by the anatomical location in which they develop; the clinician must consider a wide differential diagnosis based on this location. Solid testicular masses are considered germ cell tumors until proven otherwise, but numerous other possible pathologies exist, including ectopic tissue, metastasis, and other neoplastic growths. Rete testis lesions are classified as developmental, benign or malignant. Cystic lesions of the epididymis are most commonly benign, but malignant neoplasms can also be present. The paratesticular region has the broadest differential diagnosis, as it contains numerous distinct structures and is a common location for ectopic tissue and metastatic disease; a narrower range of lesions develop in the scrotal wall because of its simpler anatomy. Treatment options range from conservative observation to wide surgical excision and should be considered carefully; the aim of therapy is to remove malignant or potentially malignant tissue while minimizing effects on fertility and function.

### A rare case of large epididymal cyst in androgen insensitivity syndrome removed laparoscopically [^edfe903b]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Androgen insensitivity syndrome is a disorder of sexual differentiation with 46XY karyotype. The gonad is at risk (33% by 50 years of age) for development of malignant tumors. Hence, gonadectomy is warranted. We present a case of a 22-year-old woman diagnosed with androgen insensitivity syndrome during investigation of primary amenorrhea. Ultrasonography showed intraabdominally-located gonads, with a large, nontender cyst of 9.2 x 5.6 x 5.4 cm size, with limited mobility, to the right of the midline. There was also a partial septum, with a wall thickness of 1 to 2 mm and containing clear fluid. Because of suspicion of malignancy, complete surgery including laparoscopic peritoneal cytologic study, gonadectomy, lymphadenectomy, and omentectomy were performed. Histopathologic study showed testis with an epididymal cyst. Formation of epididymal cyst is rare in these cases. The patient did well in the postoperative period. She was put on hormone replacement therapy and is doing well.

### The clinical management of intrascrotal extratesticular masses with evaluation of histopathologic findings [^a3d86612]. Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To contribute to the literature by sharing the clinical presentation, surgical approach, postoperative complications management, and follow-up protocols of the patients we operated on due to intrascrotal extratesticular mass.

Methods

Thirty-two patients admitted due to intrascrotal extratesticular mass were included in the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients such as age, initial clinical presentation, physical examination, radiological imaging findings, such as scrotal Doppler ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, mass size, and characteristics, surgical treatment procedures, operation notes, and patient follow-up visits were retrospectively examined and evaluated from the patient files.

Results

The median age of the 32 individuals included in the study was 52 (interquartile range: [45.0-60.5]) years. The primary reason for initial presentation was a palpable mass in 25 (78.1%) patients, pain in 13 (40.6%) patients, and scrotal swelling in 8 (25%) patients. The median mass diameter was 4.4 (interquartile range: [3.1-5.7]) cm. Surgical treatment involved inguinal excision in 29 cases (90.6%) and inguinoscrotal excision in 3 cases (9.4%). All patients were treated with testicle-sparing surgery. The most common tumor location, observed in 27 cases (84.3%), was the epididymis. The most frequent histopathological diagnosis was epididymal cyst, identified in 13 patients (40.6%). Pathology results showed that the mass was removed with negative margins in all patients.

Conclusion

Testicular-sparing surgery through the inguinal approach is one of the surgical methods that can be preferred for intrascrotal extratesticular masses. This approach can both preserve the testicle and achieve successful surgical results. Studies with larger samples are needed on this subject.

Trial Registration

This study was approved by the Erzurum Medicine Faculty University Local Ethics Committee (approval number: BAEK 2023/08-105).

### Comparison between open epididymal cystectomy and minimal resection of epididymal cysts using a scrotoscope: a clinical trial for the evaluation of a new surgical technique [^c9aa2ddd]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a new surgical technique for epididymal cyst (EC) treatment and to assess its safety and efficiency.

Methods

Forty-eight patients with symptomatic EC were randomized into 2 groups. One group (n = 23) received traditional open epididymal cystectomy (OEC) and the other group (n = 25) underwent minimal epididymal cystectomy with scrotoscope (MECS), which provided a clear vision of scrotal contents. Demographic information and perioperative and postoperative outcomes data were obtained and analyzed during a 2- to 6-month follow-up.

Results

No significant differences between the OEC and MECS groups were found in demographic information. Compared with OEC group, the MECS group had a shorter operating time (18.6 ± 2.9 vs 54.5 ± 7.0 minutes; P <.05), shorter incision length (1.1 ± 0.2 vs 4.8 ± 0.6 cm; P <.05), and less blood loss (4.6 ± 1.6 vs 17.0 ± 3.1 g; P <.05). Except for the 8.0% rate (2 of 25) of scrotal edema after MECS and 17.4% rate (4 of 23) of scrotal hematoma after OEC, both groups resulted in 0% incidence of testis or epididymis injury, wound infection, and cyst recurrence based on postoperative outcome data. Significant differences were observed after MECS compared with those after OEC based on the rates of symptom relief (95.2% vs 61.1%; P <.05) and days of wound pain (12.1 ± 2.6 vs 17.7 ± 4.1 days; P <.05).

Conclusion

For the first time, our study applied scrotoscope as a new alternative technique for EC treatment. Scrotoscope provides a clear field of vision and makes tissues harvested available for pathologic examination when performing decortications of EC. The results suggest MECS may be a safe, effective, and encouraging new technique.

### Does surgery have a role in management of chronic intrascrotal pain? [^05d0456d]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the role of epididymectomy in the treatment of chronic postvasectomy and epididymal pain syndrome and to identify the factors that predict the outcome.

Methods

A total of 38 patients, aged 20 to 70 years (mean 45), who had undergone epididymectomy for intractable intrascrotal pain, were identified retrospectively from the pathology records. The clinical notes were reviewed, and details on patient demographics, previous vasectomy, investigations, and histologic features were collected and analyzed. The outcome was assessed by routine outpatient clinic review and telephone interview.

Results

Overall, 32% of patients reported resolution of symptoms after epididymectomy; 17 patients had undergone previous vasectomy, and this group was significantly more likely to have ongoing pain. Abnormal examination and ultrasound findings preoperatively did not correlate with a better outcome from surgery.

Conclusions

The results of our study have shown that epididymectomy has a limited role in the management of chronic intrascrotal pain.

### The role of the radiologist in the evaluation of male infertility: recommendations of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology-scrotal and penile imaging working group (ESUR-SPIWG) for scrotal imaging [^e7f6de9c]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Epididymis

The scrotal US plays a key role in investigating abnormalities of epididymal size, echopattern, and vascularization, which, alone or combined, can suggest different diagnoses [,,–]. In subjects with scrotal pain or prostatitis-like symptoms, epididymal dilation with hypervascularization suggests inflammation [,,–]. A dilated epididymis associated with echopattern abnormalities may also represent the outcome of a past infection/inflammation in currently asymptomatic patients [,,–]. In subjects with obstructive azoo-/oligo-spermia, epididymal enlargement with tubular ectasia may suggest, as an indirect sign, post-testicular obstruction, at the epididymal (Fig. 3), vas deferens or prostatic level, and the latter may be further investigated by extending US to the prostate-vesicular region. Current or previous epididymal inflammation or partial obstruction has been associated with sperm abnormalities. Of note, only a proven bilateral epididymis obstruction can diagnose proximal OA. However, US can only suggest, but not prove, the presence of a complete epididymal obstruction. The scrotal US also allows the assessment of epididymal nodules, frequently represented by cysts, which have no proven role in OA. Rarely, underlying benign or malignant tumors may be identified.

Recommendation 14: In infertile men, epididymis investigation with scrotal US is indicated, to detect indirect signs suggesting obstruction and/or inflammation, possibly exerting a negative impact on sperm parameters. Cysts or nodules should be investigated: they have no proven role in infertility but may be relevant for general male health.

### Microsurgical spermatocelectomy: technique and outcomes of a novel surgical approach [^97f68ab3]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

A microsurgical approach to spermatocelectomy theoretically minimizes the risk of injury to the epididymis and testicular blood supply. We present the technique of microsurgical spermatocelectomy and report our perioperative and recurrence outcomes.

Materials and Methods

In a 15-year period 23 men with a total of 36 epididymal cystic masses underwent microsurgical resection with confirmation of spermatocele diagnosis by intraoperative identification of sperm in the cyst fluid. We reviewed pathology reports for resected epididymal tissue in the spermatocele specimen. Postoperative outcome measures included complications, sperm count changes, improvement in pain and fertility, and cyst recurrence.

Results

Mean spermatocele size was 5.0 cm (range 1 to 15). Common indications for surgery included pain in 35% of cases, infertility in 30% and the 2 conditions in 13%. A total of 13 patients (57%) underwent simultaneous procedures for concomitant varicocele and/or hydrocele with a mean overall surgical time of 152 minutes. A single scrotal hematoma managed conservatively was the only postoperative complication. There was no case of infection. Avoidance of inadvertent epididymal resection was shown by absent epididymal tissue in each of the 36 spermatocele pathology specimens. Also, no patient with preoperative and postoperative semen analyses available experienced a decreased sperm count, confirming the avoidance of iatrogenic epididymal tubule obstruction. At a mean followup of 17.3 months no man had cyst recurrence or testicular atrophy and all with preoperative pain reported improvement. One patient with preoperative infertility achieved pregnancy 12 months after surgery.

Conclusions

Microsurgical spermatocelectomy is safe and effective with a minimal risk of epididymal injury, testicular atrophy and recurrence.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^f092d4d0]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Acute epididymitis—other management considerations and follow-up: Men with acute epididymitis confirmed or suspected to be caused by N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis should be advised to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated and symptoms have resolved, and all men with acute epididymitis should be tested for HIV and syphilis. Men should be instructed to return to their health care providers if their symptoms do not improve <72 hours after treatment, and signs and symptoms that do not subside in <3 days require reevaluation of the diagnosis and therapy. Men who experience swelling and tenderness that persist after completion of antimicrobial therapy should be evaluated for alternative diagnoses, including tumor, abscess, infarction, testicular cancer, TB, and fungal epididymitis.

Case presentation

Case 1

A 20-year-old male presented to the urology unit in May 2012 with hypogastric pain, LUTS, ejaculatory disorders (reduced ejaculate volume and painful ejaculation), hematuria and persistent infections of the lower urinary tract. In his past history the patient underwent, three months after birth, a resection of the descending colon for Hirschsprung disease and right nephrectomy for renal dysplasia with histopathological report of interstitial nephritis. In 2009 he underwent a pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for pelvic pain. The imaging revealed a right seminal vesicle cyst. For the persistence of symptoms, he underwent trans urethral resection of ejaculatory ducts (TUR-ED) without obtaining any improvement of the symptoms. Instead, a subsequent prostatitis and epididymitis appeared. Clinical examination revealed normal external genitalia; at a digital rectal examination (DRE) a swollen periprostatic mass was noticed. Semen analysis and blood tests did not show anomalies. A second MRI showed a liquid bilobated mass near the right seminal vesicle (54 × 38 × 47 mm), increased in volume compared to previous one, with a small hypointense signal, delimitated by a not-enhanced wall, with a fistulous communication with the prostatic urethra (Fig. 1 a). Transrectal ultrasound showed a normal prostate without a clear visualization of the left seminal vesicle. Adjacent to the right seminal vesicle, a large bilobated cystic mass containing dense fluid was confirmed. Urethrocystoscopy and retrograde urethrocystogram showed a communication between the cystic structure and the prostatic urethra. Taking into account the patient’s previous surgeries, after semen cryopreservation, we decided to perform an open retropubic exeresis of the cyst because of the persistence of clinical symptoms (Fig. 1 b). Histopathology examination reported a benign cyst coated by a cylindrical epithelium with diffuse squamous metaplasia and modest chronic inflammation of the cystic wall compatible with deferent duct cyst. On 15th post-operative day, due to a pelvic purulent collection a surgical drainage was performed. A subsequent fistula of the prostatic urethra developed and was managed with 6 weeks of bladder catheterization. At the last clinical consult the patient did not report any sexual or ejaculatory disorder.

We report three patients with midline prostatic cysts (simple, n=1; complex, n=2) that presented with low ejaculate volume and hematospermia. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) revealed a midline prostatic cystic structure that could represent either an ejaculatory duct cyst or a Müllerian duct cyst. In one patient, the ejaculatory duct cyst was confirmed by identification of spermatozoa at microscopic analysis of fluid obtained by TRUS-guided needle aspiration. The two other patients underwent transurethral incision of the cyst with complete resolution of symptoms.

Practice Bulletin No. 174—Additional Level B recommendations state that the evaluation of adnexal masses in adolescents is similar to that in premenopausal women and management of adnexal masses in adolescents should prioritize ovarian conservation to preserve fertility. Aspiration of an adnexal mass may be appropriate in cases of tubo-ovarian abscess (although antibiotic therapy is first-line treatment) and for the diagnosis of suspected advanced ovarian cancer for which neoadjuvant therapy is planned; otherwise, aspiration of cyst fluid for diagnosis is contraindicated when there is a suspicion for cancer. Adnexal torsion in women who want to remain fertile should be managed by reduction of the torsion with concomitant ovarian cystectomy for identified ovarian pathology.

### Relationship between ovarian cysts and infertility: what surgery and when? [^f38bf1e0]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

The relationship between ovarian cysts and infertility is a subject of debate, mainly because it is difficult to determine the real impact of the cyst and its treatment on later fertility. For a long time it was hoped that surgical treatment could prevent potential complications (such as rupture or malignancy). For presumed benign ovarian tumors, fertility sparing should be the main concern. The goal of this survey of current knowledge on the subject is to thoroughly explore the potential relationship between cysts, their treatment, and infertility. Our study is based on a review of the literature dealing with the epidemiology of ovarian cysts and the effects of their surgical management in relation to infertility. Analysis of the epidemiologic data, drawn mainly from comparative studies and cohorts, shows that the role of cysts in infertility is controversial and that the effects of surgical treatment are often more harmful than the cyst itself to the ovarian reserve. Surgery does not seem to improve pregnancy rates. When a surgical option is nonetheless chosen, a conservative laparoscopic approach is more suitable. Besides excision, sclerotherapy and plasma vaporization are promising, offering a greater preservation of the ovarian parenchyma, especially in endometriomas. These techniques must be better defined. The context of the infertility is essential, and surgeons and specialists in reproductive medicine should decide management jointly.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaHematospermia [^a92df965]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Most men with hematospermia or hemospermia (HS) are young (<40 years of age), presenting with transient or episodic HS without other signs or symptoms of disease. The condition is self-limiting in most cases and idiopathic in nature. When a cause can be identified, infections of the urogenital tract are the most common. Imaging does not play a role in this patient population. In older men (>40 years of age), clinical screening for prostate cancer is advised. Furthermore, when HS is persistent or has symptoms, causes include obstruction or stricture at the level of the verumontanum, calcifications or calculi in the prostate, ejaculatory ducts or seminal vesicles, and cysts arising within these structures. Noninvasive imaging, predominantly transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and MRI, can be used in men of any age with persistent or refractory HS, or other associated symptoms or signs. TRUS is considered as the first-line imaging with MRI used when TRUS is inconclusive or negative. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Targeted testicular excision biopsy: when and how should we try to avoid radical orchidectomy? [^56e84adc]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Small, incidental testicular lesions are often benign, but in the past have usually been treated by orchidectomy. An alternative is an operative excision biopsy, with localization by ultrasound if necessary, and characterization of the lesion by frozen section analysis. The present review summarizes the indications for the procedure, lists the likely diagnoses, and describes the technique. Frozen section is accurate for distinguishing benign from malignant lesions, testicular function is usually preserved, and there is no evidence that oncological safety is impaired. Such testis-preserving surgery is a rewarding ground for collaboration between urologists, radiologists, and pathologists.

### Congenital cysts of the lower male genitourinary tract: a disorder with various treatment approaches and pitfalls-case report [^7d54c196]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cysts of the male pelvic floor are uncommon and usually benign. These clinical findings are often incidental and may become symptomatic during the third and fourth decades of life. Symptoms are nonspecific and may include abdominal, perineal and pelvic pain, painful ejaculation, hematospermia, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), urinary retention with subsequent appearance of recurrent prostatitis, epididymitis and infertility. Moreover, these cysts have different anatomic origins and may be associated with various genitourinary congenital anomalies including hypospadias, intergender disorder, adult polycystic kidney, cryptorchidism and omolateral renal agenesis. There are two principal groups of male lower urinary tract cysts: intraprostatic and extraprostatic. Intraprostatic cysts are divided in medial cysts, that develop from the prostatic utricle and Mullerian ducts, paramedial cysts (ejaculatory ducts cysts) and lateral cysts, related to prostatic retention, associated to tumors or prostatic abscesses. The extraprostatic ones include seminal vesicles, deferent ducts and Cowper ducts cysts. The differential diagnosis is usually with ureterocele, bladder diverticulum, hydroureter and ectopic ureter.

In this article we describe the etiopathology, diagnosis and treatment of a case study of congenital cysts of the lower male genitourinary tract.

We report our retrospective experience concerning two patients affected by extraprostatic genito-urinary cysts treated with open and mini-invasive surgery.

### Testicular-sparing excision for benign paratesticular IgG4-related disease [^86fade05]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Most of the epididymal lesions are attributed to benign cases, with adenomatoid tumour of the epididymis being the most common. Other differential diagnoses can include benign epididymal cysts, sarcoidosis and infective aetiologies, such as tuberculosis and epididymal abscess. Malignant epididymal lesions are relatively rare and can be due to primary tumour, such as epididymal leiomyosarcoma or metastases. Certain clinical attributes, such as more acute pain presentation and associated systemic symptoms, can differentiate some infective pathologies compared with other causes. The presence of colour Doppler flow can also be beneficial in distinguishing malignant from benign lesions.

### Epididymal cyst lesions are not associated with impaired semen parameters among men presenting for fertility evaluation [^3bc7d00a]. The Journal of Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Epididymal cyst lesions (ECLs) include both spermatoceles and epididymal cysts and are often incidentally found on physical exam or scrotal US (SUS). We aimed to determine the association of ECLs and semen parameters among men presenting for fertility evaluation.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed men at our institution who had at least 1 semen analysis and SUS available for review between 2002 and 2022. SUS data included testicular measurements, presence or absence of subclinical varicocele, and size and laterality of ECL, if present. Demographic and clinical information including serum testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone and semen parameters were compared between men with and without ECLs.

Results

Among 861 men, 164 (19%) had unilateral right ECL (median 4 mm, interquartile range 3-8 mm), 189 (22%) had unilateral left ECL (median 4 mm, interquartile range 3-9 mm), and 113 (13%) had bilateral ECL. Patients with ECLs were significantly older than men without ECLs at the time of evaluation but had no statistically significant difference in semen volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility, sperm morphology, total motile sperm count, or serum hormonal values. Analysis of men with unilateral and bilateral ECLs showed that ECL size and laterality did not significantly correlate with any semen parameter evaluated.

Conclusions

We found no association between ECLs and semen parameters. Patients should be counseled toward conservative management with observation for asymptomatic ECLs in the setting of fertility evaluation.

### A novel surgical management for male infertility secondary to midline prostatic cyst [^e77368d9]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Male infertility affects about 8% of couples around the world. Midline prostatic cyst (MPC), a rare but surgically correctable disease, is deemed to cause ejaculatory duct obstruction (EDO) which accounts for approximately 1-5% of male infertility. Most MPCs are nonsymptomatic. Semen analysis, transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help to diagnose MPC. For treatment, cyst puncture and simple endoscopic section are widely used. However, the efficacy is often poor. The present study shows a novel surgical management for male infertility secondary to MPC.

### Soft tissue masses: evaluation and treatment (...) [^a4b4ae85]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Imaging Studies ULTRASONOGRAPHY 2, 54Advantages of using traditional or point-of-care ultrasonography include low cost, no radiation exposure, and the ability to evaluate compressibility and assess real-time blood flow. Point-of-care ultrasonography can be used for follow-up in the clinic to evaluate changes. Biopsy 5, 24The location of the biopsy and possible local spread of the malignancy can affect management. 5If there is confidence in the diagnosis, benign masses such as epidermal inclusion cysts and lipomas can be removed en bloc by the family physician. 58, 59Tissue from a removed mass should be sent to pathology to confirm the diagnosis. If the diagnosis is in question, imaging should be considered before a procedure. 1, 12 Epidermal inclusion cysts can present as mobile subcutaneous masses that are as small as a few millimeters to 5 cm in diameter. 1 Multiple epidermal inclusion cysts can be associated with Gardner syndrome.

59 A rapidly growing epidermal inclusion cyst or recurrence after surgical excision warrants further investigation for malignancy. Epidermal inclusion cysts should be removed en bloc because they can recur if not completely removed. Ruptured cysts may become infected and often require antibiotic treatment. 15, 59 32Imaging with ultrasonography or MRI is rarely indicated. Treatment for benign pilar cysts can be simple local excision. GANGLION CYST 14Aspiration requires a large 18-gauge needle to remove the thick gelatinous fluid, and recurrence is common. 72Aspiration should be avoided when neurovascular structures surround the cyst such as with radial-sided volar wrist cysts. Open or arthroscopic excision is suggested if initial conservative therapy is ineffective, and the cyst remains bothersome.
14. BAKER CYST 73These cysts can be more pronounced during a flare-up of knee arthritis. They may be found incidentally on MRI or ultrasonography.

Treatment includes monitoring, aspiration, corticosteroid injection, aspiration with ultrasound-guided fenestration of cyst walls, and arthroscopic cystectomy.
73. Treatment rarely requires excision, and many plantar fibromas can be managed conservatively with shoe padding or modifications. Corticosteroid injections can relieve pain and decrease the size of the fibroma. 36, 72 If orthotics and intralesional corticosteroid injections are ineffective, a subtotal fasciectomy with wide excision can be considered. 36.

### Ultrasound findings of masses of the paratesticular space [^e4a33890]. Clinical Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is a routine investigation for the assessment of scrotal masses. Many of the detected lesions involve the paratesticular structures. The most common paratesticular masses in clinical practice are epididymal cysts and spermatoceles, but there are a large number of other pathologies that can be encountered and may result in diagnostic uncertainty. This review covers a wide range of the common and the rare, but important, causes of paratesticular masses. The ultrasound findings (both typical and atypical) of these lesions are clarified, and emphasis is given to the features that help to differentiate between them.

### Rate and associations of epididymal cysts on pediatric scrotal ultrasound [^8714bbe4]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

We established the baseline occurrence of epididymal cysts, and the correlation between epididymal cysts and testicular size.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all pediatric scrotal ultrasounds done at our institution in 8 years. We analyzed the proportion of cysts by patient age and compared testicular size in boys with vs without epididymal cysts.

Results

Of all patients 14.4% had epididymal cysts. The cyst incidence increased with age, ie 35.3% of boys older than 15 years had cysts. Boys with epididymal cysts had larger testes than boys without cysts regardless of side or age (p <0.001).

Conclusions

Epididymal cysts are more common in older boys. Boys with epididymal cysts had larger testes than boys without cysts.

### A novel surgical management for male infertility secondary to midline prostatic cyst [^adb8e826]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

MPC is previously thought to be Mullerian duct cyst, causing EDO and male infertility through oppressing ejaculatory duct. Recent researches reveal that not all cystic lesions are located in the midline prostate originate from Mullerian duct remnant. Some cases are just the cystadenoma or the simple cyst of prostate. Such cyst in the midline prostate should be termed as prostatic utricular cyst or cystic dilation of prostatic utricle, depending on whether an outlet to the urethra exists.

Despite the embryologic or histological origin, MPC is a surgically correctable disease. Many MPCs are asymptomatic, or have some non-specific symptoms such as perineal pain, hematospermia, and painful ejaculation. One of the most important and serious outcomes caused by cystic lesion oppression is EDO and male infertility. Semen analysis of these patients often showed low semen volume and pH level, reduced semen fructose, oligoasthenozoospermia, and even azoospermia.

Epididymitis is a common and morbid condition seen across a wide age range. There are multiple etiologies that may lead to inflammation of the epididymis, including infection, trauma, autoimmune disease, and vasculitis. Although there have been multiple advances in imaging of the scrotum and detection of urinary pathogens, a large portion of cases remain idiopathic. Management of epididymitis is often difficult, but relies on clinical expertise and the use of established clinical guidelines.

### Aspiration and sclerotherapy versus hydrocoelectomy for treating hydrocoeles [^fec387ee]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hydrocoeles are common cystic scrotal abnormalities, described as a fluid-filled collection between the visceral and parietal layers of the tunica vaginalis of the scrotum. There are two approaches for treatment of hydrocoeles: surgical open hydrocoelectomy and aspiration followed by sclerotherapy.

Objectives

We compared the benefits and harms of aspiration and sclerotherapy versus hydrocoelectomy for the management of hydrocoeles.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 2 August 2014 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing aspiration and sclerotherapy versus hydrocoelectomy for the management of hydrocoeles.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies. Random effects meta-analyses were performed using relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We found four small studies that met the inclusion criteria. These studies enrolled 275 patients with 282 hydroceles. Participants were randomised to aspiration and sclerotherapy (155 patients with 159 hydroceles) and surgery (120 patients with 123 hydroceles). All studies were assessed as having low or unclear risk of bias for selection bias, detection bias, attrition bias and selective reporting bias. Blinding was not possible for participants and investigators based on the type of interventions. Blinding for statisticians was not reported in any of included studies.There were no significant difference in clinical cure between the two groups (3 studies, 215 participants: RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.10), however there was significant heterogeneity (I² = 95%). On further investigation one study contributed all of the heterogeneity. This could be due to the agent used or perhaps due to the fact that this is a much older study than the other two studies included in this analysis. When this study was removed from the analysis the heterogeneity was 0% and the result was significant (in favour of surgery) (2 studies, 136 participants: RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.85).There was a significant increase in recurrence in those who received sclerotherapy compared with surgery (3 studies, 196 participants: RR 9.37, 95% CI 1.83 to 48.4). One study reported a non-significant decrease in fever in the sclerotherapy group (60 participants: RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.08). There was an increased number of infections in the surgery group however this increase was not statistically significant (4 studies, 275 participants): RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.05; I² = 0%). Three studies reported the frequency of pain in the surgery group was higher than aspiration and sclerotherapy group but because of different measurement tools applied in these studies, we could not pool the results. Radiological cure was not reported in any of the included studies. There was no significant difference in haematoma formation between the two groups (3 studies, 189 participants: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.90; I² = 0%). Only one study reported patient satisfaction at three and six months; there was no significant difference between the two groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Postoperative complications as well as cost and time to work resumption were less in the aspiration and sclerotherapy group; however the recurrence rate was higher. The cure rate in short-term follow-up was similar between the groups, however there is significant uncertainty in this result due to the high heterogeneity. There is a great need for further methodologically rigorous RCTs that assess the effectiveness of different type of sclerosant agents, sclerosing solution concentration and injection volume for the treatment of hydrocoeles. It is important that the RCTs have sufficiently large sample size and long follow-up period. Studies should evaluate clinical outcomes such as pain, recurrence, satisfaction, complications and cure using validated instruments. The protocols for all studies should be registered in clinical trial registries and the reports of these studies should conform with international guidelines of trial reporting such as CONSORT. Cost-effectiveness studies should also be undertaken.

### Ectopic opening of the vas deferens into a Müllerian duct cyst [^46d7c608]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Two consecutive cases of ectopic opening of the vas deferens into Müllerian duct cysts are presented, with descriptions of the presentation, physical examination, radiographic and ultrasonographic images, surgical findings and treatment undertaken. In both cases, ablation of the cyst and ligature of the vas deferens was the technique employed. Both patients are currently well, with normal urinary flow and no urinary tract infections, 3 years after surgery. Ectopic opening of the vas deferens into Müllerian duct cysts is a rare entity but should always be considered when a child presents with purulent urinary discharge and abdominal tumor. Surgery is the only treatment recommended.

### Long-term outcome of epididymectomy for the management of chronic epididymal pain [^0bfc21b4]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated the long-term outcomes of patients who underwent epididymectomy for the treatment of chronic epididymal pain.

Materials and Methods

All 72 patients who underwent epididymectomy at our institution between 1994 and 2007 were invited to participate in the study. Patients were mailed questionnaires covering various aspects of the treatment. Questions regarding pain were rated on a scale between 0 and 10 (0--no pain, 10--severe pain). Patients who did not return the questionnaires were followed up by telephone and the medical case notes of all respondents were reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank and Fisher's exact tests with p <0.05 considered statistically significant.

Results

A total of 53 patients participated (74% response rate) and mean followup was 7.4 years. Of these patients 45 (84.9%) underwent epididymectomy for post-vasectomy pain and the remainder (8 of 53, 15.1%) had the procedure for various nonvasectomy reasons. There were significant improvements in pain score in the post-vasectomy (mean 7.3 preoperative to 2.4 postoperative, p <0.001) and nonvasectomy (mean 7 preoperative to 2.8 postoperative, p = 0.002) groups. Of the patients in the post-vasectomy group 93.3% (42 of 45) had less or no pain postoperatively compared to 75% (6 of 8) in the nonvasectomy group. The satisfaction rate with epididymectomy was also higher in the post-vasectomy (42 of 45, 93.3%) compared to the nonvasectomy (5 of 8, 62.5%) group (p = 0.038).

Conclusions

With high patient satisfaction and a favorable long-term outcome epididymectomy appears to be an effective treatment option particularly for post-vasectomy chronic epididymal pain.

Suprapubic or transrectal ultrasound is often the initial diagnostic imaging tool. Urethrocystoscopy and voiding cystourethrography are also useful diagnostic tests for these conditions. Nevertheless, the gold standard for the diagnosis of male pelvic floor cysts is MRI. Differential diagnosis between intraprostatic and extraprostatic cysts is performed with clinical and radiological findings, while histopathological characterization of the cystic wall is usually not significant. However, few cases of malignant cyst of Muller duct (adenocarcinomas and squamous cells carcinomas) have been described. Surgical treatment is recommended in symptomatic patients and in case of obstructive azoospermia. There are different treatment modalities including: trans-rectal drainage, transurethral resection of ejaculatory ducts (TUR-ED), robotic, laparoscopic and open surgery. Endoscopic treatment could be reserved to small lesions. This approach is characterized by lower morbidity, but it has the disadvantage of a higher recurrence rate, as reported in our first case.

In our opinion, open surgery is recommended in large masses and in patients who underwent previous surgery where a laparoscopic approach could be more challenging and have a higher complication rate. The following surgical approaches have been described: extravesical, transvesical, trans-rectal, perineal. The urethral fistula and the late purulent pelvic collection described in our case could be related to a local and systemic infection confirmed by the clinical, laboratory and intra-operative findings. The surgical drainage of the purulent collection, antibiotic therapy and prolonged bladder catheterization have permitted a complete clinical resolution. During the last years, robotic and laparoscopic surgery offered advantages such as image magnification, reduced blood loss, minor invasiveness and morbidity and better preservation of anatomical structures. Nowadays, laparoscopic treatment is the gold standard while robot-assisted surgery is limited to few cases and is associated to higher costs.

Surgical treatment is reserved for symptomatic patients. In asymptomatic patients surveillance is an acceptable option. Pre-operative counseling is important in order to inform the patient about the potential complications such as infertility and erectile dysfunction. Patients must be adequately informed about risks and benefits of the surgical approach in order to reach a shared diagnostic and therapeutic decision making. In this context semen cryopreservation is useful and advisable before surgery.

### MRI of the epididymis: can the outcome of vasectomy reversal be predicted preoperatively? [^d5885b77]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to describe the MRI findings seen with tubular ectasia of the epididymis and investigate whether MRI may predict vasal/epididymal tubular occlusion before vasectomy reversal.

Materials and Methods

First, we compared epididymal T1 signal intensity (measured as percentage change relative to ipsilateral testis) in 24 patients with sonographically established tubular ectasia compared with 22 control patients (sonographically normal epididymides). Second, in a subset of patients with tubular ectasia who subsequently underwent surgery to restore fertility (n = 10), we examined the relationship between epididymal T1 signal intensity and surgical outcome. Vasovasostomy (simple vas deferens reanastomosis with high success rate) was possible when viable sperm were detected in the vas deferens intraoperatively. When no sperm were detected, vasal/epididymal tubular occlusion was inferred and vasoepididymostomy (vas deferens to epididymal head anastomosis, a technically challenging procedure with poorer outcome) was performed.

Results

In tubular ectasia, we found increased epididymal T1 signal intensity (0-77%) compared with normal epididymides (-27 to 20%) (p < 0.0001). In patients with tubular ectasia who underwent surgery (n = 10), we found higher T1 epididymal signal intensity in cases of vasal/epididymal occlusion (0-70%) relative to cases in which vasal/epididymal patency was maintained (0-10%) (p = 0.01). By logistic regression, relative epididymal T1 signal intensity increase above 19.4% corresponded to greater than 90% probability of requiring vasoepididymostomy.

Conclusion

Increased epididymal T1 signal intensity (likely due to proteinaceous material lodged within the epididymal tubules) at preoperative MRI in patients undergoing vasectomy reversal suggests vasal/epididymal tubular occlusion and requirement for vasoepididymostomy rather than vasovasostomy.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^650b2ba9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

To prevent complications and transmission of STIs, presumptive therapy for all sexually active men is indicated at the time of the visit before all laboratory test results are available. Selection of presumptive therapy is based on risk for chlamydial and gonococcal infections or enteric organisms. Treatment goals for acute epididymitis are 1) microbiologic infection cure, 2) improvement of signs and symptoms, 3) prevention of transmission of chlamydia and gonorrhea to others, and 4) decreased potential for chlamydial or gonococcal epididymitis complications (e.g. infertility or chronic pain). Although the majority of men with acute epididymitis can be treated on an outpatient basis, referral to a specialist and hospitalization should be considered when severe pain or fever indicates other diagnoses (e.g. torsion, testicular infarction, abscess, or necrotizing fasciitis) or when men are unable to comply with an antimicrobial regimen. Age, history of diabetes, fever, and elevated C-reactive protein can indicate more severe disease requiring hospitalization.

Recommended Regimens for Epididymitis
For acute epididymitis most likely caused by chlamydia or gonorrhea: Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 10 days
For acute epididymitis most likely caused by chlamydia, gonorrhea, or enteric organisms (men who practice insertive anal sex): Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose
plus
Levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days
For acute epididymitis most likely caused by enteric organisms only: Levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days
* For persons weighing ≥150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered.

Levofloxacin monotherapy should be considered if the infection is most likely caused by enteric organisms only, and gonorrhea has been ruled out by Gram, MB, or GV stain. This includes men who have undergone prostate biopsy, vasectomy, and other urinary tract instrumentation procedures. Treatment should be guided by bacterial cultures and antimicrobial susceptibilities. As an adjunct to therapy, bed rest, scrotal elevation, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are recommended until fever and local inflammation have subsided. Complete resolution of discomfort might not occur for a few weeks after completion of the antibiotic regimen.

Other Management Considerations

Men who have acute epididymitis confirmed or suspected to be caused by N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis should be advised to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated and symptoms have resolved. All men with acute epididymitis should be tested for HIV and syphilis.

Results

From March 2015 to December 2018, a total of 158 patients diagnosed with an epididymal obstruction underwent modified SA-LIVE in our center; among these, 134 were followed up in a prospective study. Reportedly, 80 patients had a history of epididymitis or orchitis; full epididymis could be palpated easily with inflated nodes. The diagnostic ultrasonography findings also proved the existence of inflammation in the scrotum based on the thin net-like ectasia of the epididymal tube with the inner diameter up to 0.4 mm. The mean age of the included patients was 32.1 ± 6.7 (range: 23–50) years, and the mean follow-up was for 17 ± 3.3 (range: 3–36) months. The mean FSH and T levels were 4.3 ± 2.4 mIU/mL and 5.0 ± 2.9 ng/mL, respectively. The mean testicular size was 15.4 ± 3.3 cm 3, as measured by ultrasonography (Table 1).

### Methods and materials (...) [^555d2206]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

There are many surgical approaches to epidermoid cysts. While complete surgical excision can ensure removal of the sac and prevent recurrence, this technique is time-consuming and requires suture closure. The minimal excision technique has been proposed as a less invasive and successful intervention. The minimal excision technique involves a 2- to 3-mm incision, expression of the cyst contents, and extraction of the cyst wall through the incision. 5-mL syringe, filled with 2 percent lidocaine with epinephrine with a 30-gauge needle 25-gauge, 1 ¼-inch needle Sterile Tray for the Procedure Place the following items on a sterile drape covering a Mayo stand: . Procedure Description 1. The skin overlying the site is cleansed with povidone-iodine solution. The skin overlying the cyst and the tissue to the sides and beneath the cyst are anesthetized with 2 percent lidocaine with epinephrine.
2.

A fenestrated drape can be placed on the patient, with the lesion beneath the fenestration. A no. 11 blade is used to create a stab incision into the center of the cyst. A small-tipped hemostat is placed into the cyst, the tips gently opened and compression applied to allow the cyst con tents to pass through the opening. Many lesions can be confused with epidermoid cysts. If a solid tumor is discovered at the time of the procedure, a biopsy should be obtained. Incisional biopsy can be performed for very large lesions, and excisional biopsy for the smaller lesions. Pilar tumors of the scalp are often confused with epidermoid cysts and may require wide excision because they can erode into the skull. Simple epidermoid cysts that appear to be completely excised do not generally require follow-up. If a recurrence is brought to the physician's attention at a later date, standard surgical excision should be attempted.

Cysts on the scalp may have thicker walls than typical epidermoid cysts on the face. Many physicians report that it is easier to remove scalp cysts intact. Thin-walled cysts tend to break and may need to be removed in pieces; however, if adequate kneading of the skin occurs before attempted removal, many cysts can be removed intact.

### A novel surgical management for male infertility secondary to midline prostatic cyst [^9eb28128]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Vasoseminal vesiculography is the golden standard for diagnosis. Percutaneous testicular sperm aspiration (PTSA) is helpful to identify the type of MPC. However, these methods are invasive and complicated. TURS is preferred for simple and noninvasive characteristics. It can offer greater details about the relationship of prostatic, seminal vesicle, and ejaculatory duct. Pelvic MRI not only clearly shows the anatomy of prostatic, seminal vesicle, and ejaculatory duct, but also helps to judge the nature of cyst fluid.

The treatment for MPC is still controversial. Some researchers claimed that treatment should only be performed on symptomatic or infertile patients since almost 60% of cases with MPC did not experience any cyst-related symptoms or fertility impairment. Invasive procedures include transperineal or transrectal puncture and endoscopic section of the utricle meatu. However, puncture therapy has a high recurrence rate while endoscopic incision faces persistent post-operative severe oligozoospermia or azoospermia. We speculate that MPC may cause to seminal vesiculitis and further promote the abnormal semen quality through oppressing ejaculatory duct and causing semen stasis. Therefore, the dilation of ejaculatory duct and the irrigation of seminal vesicle using seminal vesiculoscope were performed after transurethral unroofing of the cyst in present study. A previous study achieved a better result for MPC with male infertility using transurethral endoscopic incision, in which a pregnancy rate was 30.8% (8/26). However, other reports showed a poor efficacy of unroofing of the cyst. The present study is delightful with a pregnancy rate of 41.7% (5/12) and an obviously improved semen quality of 75% (9/12). One patient with azoospermia had spermatozoa in the urine after ejaculation. For the two patients of poor efficacy, seminal vesicle impairment due to long term semen stasis might cause inadequate transfer of semen quality. In conclusion, our data showed that the novel surgical management is effective, minimally invasive, and safe for male infertility secondary to MPC.

### Congenital cysts of the lower male genitourinary tract: a disorder with various treatment approaches and pitfalls-case report [^a57c9468]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Case 2

In May 2013, a 28-year-old male presented to our operative unit with a history of urinary tract infections and reduced ejaculatory volume. He underwent urethroplasty for coronal hypospadias in childhood and right orchiectomy for testicular atrophy after orchidopexy failure in adolescence. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a cystic mass posterior to the bladder. After computed tomography (CT) that failed to show abnormal findings, a pelvic MRI was performed, confirming a right paramedian retrovesical cystic mass of 30 × 80 mm, delimitated by a thin wall and suspicious for a Mullerian remnant (Fig. 2). Urethrocystoscopy showed a cavity on the right side of the verumontanum, and an open end 5 Ch ureteral catheter was inserted. Contrast injection through the uretheral catheter permitted to highlight a pseudocystic mass, with regular profile in communication with the prostatic urethra. A sperm cryopreservation was performed before surgery. The patient underwent a laparoscopic excision of the cystic mass and the pathological examination revealed a benign simple cyst of the right seminal vesicle with aspects of transitional epithelium and presence of pseudo-prostatic gland tissue. Post-operative recovery was regular and bladder catheter was removed 3 weeks after the surgery. The patient was asymptomatic and without urinary tract infections one year after the surgery.

### Congenital cysts of the lower male genitourinary tract: a disorder with various treatment approaches and pitfalls-case report [^2d643b59]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The cysts of the male pelvic floor represent a rare clinical entity. Their origin is linked to an altered development of paramesonephric and mesonephric ducts during embryogenesis.

Case presentation

We report our experience regarding two patients presenting cysts of the ejaculatory system treated with open and mini-invasive surgery. The patients referred to our clinic with nonspecific symptoms and the diagnosis was obtained by radiological investigations. The patient treated with an open approach developed a pelvic purulent collection and a fistula of the prostatic urethra, managed with surgical drainage and prolonged bladder catheterization. On the other hand, the patient treated with laparoscopic approach did not develop any complications. No sexual or ejaculatory disorders were reported.

Conclusions

Patients with congenital cysts of the pelvic floor must be adequately informed about the risks and benefits of surgery and a careful counseling is mandatory before surgery. Treatment is recommended for symptomatic patients and an endoscopic approach is associated with a high rate of recurrence. A laparoscopic approach, when possible, is desirable.

### Robotic-assisted excision of a prostatic utricle cyst in a 12-month boy with proximal hypospadia and 45X0 / 46XY karyotype [^688a77d3]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prostatic utricle cysts result from incomplete regression of Mullerian duct structures and occur most frequently in males with perineal or peno-scrotal hypospadias. Utricular cysts may present with various signs and symptoms including urinary tract infection, pain and post-void incontinence, a palpable abdominal mass or recurrent epididymitis.

Material and Methods

We present a 12 months boy we treated due to proximal hypospadias in two stages, in association to a dysplastic undescended testis that was excised. The karyotype of the patient was 45X0/46XY and after successful hypospadias treatment, the mother complained of purulent discharge in the diapers. A sonogram showed a large cyst behind the bladder with heterogeneous content. The diagnosis of utricle cyst was confirmed by a NMR with detailed anatomy and low confluence of the neck of the cyst to the urethra.

Results

We performed a robotic excision of the cyst consisting of careful dissection between bladder and rectum and a safe ligation of the communication of it to the urethra.

Conclusion

Patient outcome was uneventful. To the best of our knowledge this is the youngest patient with utricle cyst treated with robotic approach reported in the literature.

### Robot-assisted laparoscopic excision of symptomatic retrovesical cysts in boys and young adults [^66d20ed2]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

We review our surgical experience with the management of retrovesical cystic anomalies using robot-assisted laparoscopic techniques.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the presentation, diagnosis and treatment of 6 patients 28 months to 22 years old with retrovesical cystic anomalies who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic excision at our hospital between January 2006 and November 2010.

Results

Presenting signs and symptoms included urinary retention, lower urinary tract symptoms, abdominal pain and repeated epididymitis. Associated anomalies consisted of hypospadias, vesicoureteral reflux, renal agenesis, 5alpha-reductase deficiency, premature adrenarche and cryptorchidism. Cystic anomalies ranged from 3 to 6 cm long. The final diagnoses were prostatic utricular cyst, müllerian duct cyst and seminal vesicle cyst. Ectopic insertion of vas into the cyst was found in 4 cases, requiring ligation of the affected vas in 3. Mean ± SD operative time including cystoscopy was 198 ± 23.8 minutes, and estimated blood loss ranged from 5 to 10 ml. Mean ± SD hospital stay was 1.33 ± 0.52 days. All patients had resumed their regular activities within 2 weeks postoperatively. De novo contralateral epididymitis developed 2 months postoperatively in 1 patient. Otherwise, there was no recurrence of cystic mass or presenting signs or symptoms during followup of 3 to 56 months.

Conclusions

In the management of retrovesical cystic anomalies robot-assisted laparoscopic excision affords a natural extension of conventional laparoscopy with the additional advantages of 3-dimensional vision and ease of instrument control.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men: AUA / ASRM guideline part II [^b69530b2]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

AUA/ASRM male infertility—obstructive azoospermia, including post-vasectomy infertility, presents counseling and management options with graded recommendations. Couples desiring conception after vasectomy should be counseled that surgical reconstruction, surgical sperm retrieval, or both reconstruction and simultaneous sperm retrieval for cryopreservation are viable options (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Clinicians should counsel men with vasal or epididymal obstructive azoospermia that microsurgical reconstruction may be successful in returning sperm to the ejaculate (Expert Opinion). For infertile men with azoospermia and Ejaculatory Duct Obstruction (EDO), the clinician may consider transurethral resection of ejaculatory ducts (TURED) or surgical sperm extraction (Expert Opinion). Fertility restoration should be provided according to the needs and characteristics of the couple and patient preference as a shared decision-making process; both sperm retrieval with ART and microsurgical reconstruction are options, and for most acquired or congenital obstruction (excluding CBAVD), microsurgical reconstruction of the male reproductive tract may be the preferable alternative to sperm retrieval and ICSI when the female partner has normal fertility potential. EDO is rare in infertile men, and if confirmed or suspected on transrectal ultrasonography, treatment should be considered with TURED as this intervention may restore natural fertility.

### Epididymal leiomyoma: an unusual intrascrotal tumor in a child [^3ad1cb2a]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

A 13-year-old boy presented with a large painless scrotal mass and underwent radical orchiectomy with the presumptive diagnosis of testicular tumor. The diagnosis was epididymal leiomyoma (EL). The treatment of paratesticular tumors is excision of the tumor without orchiectomy whenever possible. Even when the epididymal origin of the tumor is detected during operation, it may be impossible to spare the testis because of the tumor's large size or incorporation of the testis into the tumor mass. This case is presented because of the extremely rare incidence of epididymal tumors and of EL and to emphasize the diagnosis and treatment of epididymal tumors.

Diagnostic Considerations

Men who have acute epididymitis typically have unilateral testicular pain and tenderness, hydrocele, and palpable swelling of the epididymis. Although inflammation and swelling usually begin in the tail of the epididymis, it can spread to the rest of the epididymis and testicle. The spermatic cord is usually tender and swollen. Spermatic cord (testicular) torsion, a surgical emergency, should be considered in all cases; however, it occurs more frequently among adolescents and men without evidence of inflammation or infection. For men with severe unilateral pain with sudden onset, those whose test results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary tract infection, or for whom diagnosis of acute epididymitis is questionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation for testicular torsion is vital because testicular viability might be compromised.

Bilateral symptoms should increase suspicion of other causes of testicular pain. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the most accurate method for diagnosing epididymitis but it is not routinely available. Ultrasound should be used primarily for ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord in cases of acute, unilateral, painful scrotal swelling. However, because partial spermatic cord torsion can mimic epididymitis on scrotal ultrasound, differentiation between spermatic cord torsion and epididymitis when torsion is not ruled out by ultrasound should be made on the basis of clinical evaluation. Although ultrasound can demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and swelling associated with epididymitis, it provides minimal diagnostic usefulness for men with a clinical presentation consistent with epididymitis. A negative ultrasound does not rule out epididymitis and thus does not alter clinical management. Ultrasound should be reserved for men if torsion of the spermatic cord is suspected or for those with scrotal pain who cannot receive an accurate diagnosis by history, physical examination, and objective laboratory findings.

Treatment

The patient underwent a right scrotal exploration and testicular-sparing epididymectomy via an inguinal approach. Intraoperative findings included a large multinodular solid mass arising from the epididymal tail (figure 2). The testis was normal and uninvolved. The epididymal tail and mass were dissected off the testis, and the epididymal artery was selectively ligated, with preservation of the testicular vascular supply. He tolerated the procedure and was discharged on the same day.

### Treatment and outcomes of congenital ovarian cysts A study by the Canadian consortium for research in pediatric surgery (canCORPS) [^d7977b47]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The vast majority of congenital ovarian cysts, including most simple cysts and nearly half of complex cysts, resolve spontaneously during infancy. Many patients who undergo interventional management are still treated with oophorectomies. There is no evidence that surgical management increases the chances of saving the ovary. Observation is a safe option that may lead to the avoidance of many unnecessary surgical procedures in young infants.

Results

All operations were completed without conversion to open surgery. There were no severe complications such as rectal injury and urethral sphincter damage. The average length of hospitalization was 3 days. Serum sex hormone levels of all patients prior to and after surgery were within the normal range. The preoperative and postoperative semen parameters were shown in Table 1. After 3 months follow up, the semen quality of 80% patients (4/5) with oligoasthenozoospermia improved obviously. The spermatozoa were present in the semen in 5 of 7 cases with azoospermia. In one patient, the spermatozoa occurred in the urine after ejaculation.

Epididymitis

Acute epididymitis is a clinical syndrome causing pain, swelling, and inflammation of the epididymis and lasting <6 weeks. Sometimes a testicle is also involved, a condition referred to as epididymo-orchitis. A high index of suspicion for spermatic cord (testicular) torsion should be maintained among men who have a sudden onset of symptoms associated with epididymitis because this condition is a surgical emergency.

Acute epididymitis can be caused by STIs (e.g. C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, or M. genitalium) or enteric organisms (i.e. Escherichia coli). Acute epididymitis caused by an STI is usually accompanied by urethritis, which is frequently asymptomatic. Acute epididymitis caused by sexually transmitted enteric organisms might also occur among men who are the insertive partner during anal sex. Nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis caused by genitourinary pathogens typically occurs with bacteriuria secondary to bladder outlet obstruction (e.g. benign prostatic hyperplasia). Among older men, nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis is also associated with prostate biopsy, urinary tract instrumentation or surgery, systemic disease, or immunosuppression. Uncommon infectious causes of nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis (e.g. Fournier’s gangrene) should be managed in consultation with a urologist.

Chronic epididymitis is characterized by a ≥6-week history of symptoms of discomfort or pain in the scrotum, testicle, or epididymis. Chronic infectious epididymitis is most frequently observed with conditions associated with a granulomatous reaction. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is the most common granulomatous disease affecting the epididymis and should be suspected, especially among men with a known history of or recent exposure to TB. The differential diagnosis of chronic noninfectious epididymitis, sometimes termed orchialgia or epididymalgia, is broad (e.g. trauma, cancer, autoimmune conditions, or idiopathic conditions). Men with this diagnosis should be referred to a urologist for clinical management.

### Practice bulletin no. 174 summary: evaluation and management of adnexal masses [^4f343b6c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Adnexal mass aspiration and tubo-ovarian abscess management—Even when a benign, simple cyst is aspirated, the procedure often is not definitively therapeutic, and recurrence is frequent, with the recurrence rate of cysts at 6 months was 44% for premenopausal women and 25% for postmenopausal women, and another series reported a 39% recurrence; spillage at the time of surgery decreases overall survival of patients with stage I gynecologic cancer. An exception to avoiding aspiration applies when women have clinical and radiographic evidence of advanced ovarian cancer and are medically unfit for surgery, because malignant cytology confirmed by aspiration will establish a cancer diagnosis, permitting initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. For tubo-ovarian abscesses, Antibiotic therapy is the first-line treatment for tubo-ovarian abscesses, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Sexually Transmitted Disease Treatment Guidelines suggest hospitalization in cases of pelvic inflammatory disease complicated by tubo-ovarian abscess. Computed tomography and ultrasound-guided aspiration have been used successfully, and in one randomized study of abscesses of less than 10 cm, women treated with drainage had shorter average hospital stay and were less likely to require surgical intervention. Surgical therapy is indicated for postmenopausal women with pelvic abscesses because they are at risk of underlying malignancy.

Ultrasound imaging of the paediatric scrotum

David Hatch, Susie Goodwin

Great Ormond Street Hospital, London (United Kingdom)

Purpose-Objective. To review the anatomy, imaging technique and pathology of disorders of the scrotum in children using ultrasound images and case examples.

Material and methods. Cases of testicular ultrasound studies in our institution database from the past two years were reviewed, and are presented as clinical case studies with the appropriate accompanying imaging.

Results. We classified the range of scrotal pathology encountered into two categories. The “painful scrotum” includes examples such as epididymitis, torsion, haematocele, trauma and inguinal hernia. The “scrotal mass” can be further subdivided into testicular and extra-testicular masses; with examples such as yolk sac tumour, teratoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, epididymal cysts and hydroceles, respectively. Clinical history, patient presentation and a description of the sonographic appearances are included with the supporting literature.

Discussion and conclusions. Ultrasound imaging is valuable in the assessment of paediatric scrotal abnormalities as it offers the most suitable direct extension of clinical examination. Knowledge and understanding of the relevant anatomy and imaging features of scrotal pathology is essential for patient management.

Ultrasound features of paediatric renal transplant complications

David Hatch, Marina Easty

Great Ormond Street Hospital, London (United Kingdom)

Purpose-Objective. To present sonographic imaging findings of complications that occur following renal transplantation in children.

Material and methods. All renal transplants in our radiology database for the past 3 years (2010–2012) were reviewed and evaluated to identify complications. These cases have been correlated with clinical information, complementary imaging and available literature to provide supporting evidence.

Results. A range of ultrasound images/case studies demonstrating renal transplant complications/pathologies will be presented along with techniques of ultrasound image optimization to improve diagnosis. Complications include immediate post-surgical events, acute and chronic rejection, vascular complications and more unusual findings. Discussion regarding complementary imaging modalities are included in the relevant cases along with supporting clinical information from the wider literature.

### Vasectomy: AUA guideline [^faa44a22]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Additional long-term postoperative complications—epididymitis after vasectomy shows variable rates and definitions. Rates of epididymitis varied across studies, with variability likely due to different definitions and the fact that most studies did not differentiate between infectious epididymitis and non-infectious “congestive” epididymitis. Bacterial epididymitis is often confused with pain caused by distention of the epididymal tubule due to back pressure below the vasectomy site or by epididymal sperm granuloma.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part III treatment of chronic scrotal content pain [^1777fed0]. The Journal of Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This Guideline covers the evaluation and treatment of men who present to a clinician with a complaint of chronic pelvic pain. This is Part III of a three-part series focusing on treatment of chronic scrotal content pain (CSCP). CSCP patients typically present with pain described in the testes with tenderness in the epididymis and/or spermatic cord. Patient education of the underlying etiology may promote discussion of treatment options, which often require a multidisciplinary approach that includes management of expectations through supportive counseling during treatment. For discussion of patient evaluation and treatment of chronic prostatitis/ chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), refer to Parts I and II of this series.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review that informs the Guideline statements was based on searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to June 6, 2023), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through May 2023), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through May 2023). An updated search was conducted in June 2024.

Results

The Chronic Pelvic Pain Panel developed evidence- and consensus-based statements to provide guidance for treatment of patients with CSCP, which may include lifestyle modification, pharmacologic management, and procedural intervention.

Conclusions

Specific data on CSCP are lacking with most management options described as off-label use. While there are multiple evolving treatments for CSCP that have shown promising results, most currently lack sufficient data to recommend as treatment and require further investigation to establish a role in patient care.

### Discovery and preclinical evaluation of anti-miR-17 oligonucleotide RGLS4326 for the treatment of polycystic kidney disease [^33021496]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

RGLS4326 was then evaluated in three independent long-term studies. First, we performed a randomized and statistically powered efficacy study in the slowly progressing Pcy /CD1 mouse model (Fig. 5g). Five-weeks-old Pcy /CD1 mice were treated with RGLS4326 at 25 mg kg −1 for 25-weeks. Reduction of KW/BW, cyst index, urine Ngal protein and kidney Ngal mRNA expression were observed after either weekly (QW) or monthly (Q4W) SC dosing of RGLS4326 (Fig. 5h–k). Treatment with control oligonucleotides had no effect. Initiating therapy in 15-weeks-old Pcy /CD1 mice (QW late) did not attenuate cyst growth, exemplifying the importance of early treatment initiation in this model.

In a second long-term study, we examined RGLS4326 in the more aggressive Pcy /DBA mouse model. Six-weeks-old Pcy /DBA mice were treated with QW doses of RGLS4326 at 25, 5, or 1 mg kg −1 for 9-weeks. Tolvaptan is currently the only approved treatment for ADPKD. Therefore, we also performed a head-to-head comparison between RGLS4326 and tolvaptan in the Pcy /DBA model. RGLS4326 demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in KW/BW and cyst index following 9 consecutive weeks of QW SC injections (Fig. 6a–c). However, monthly RGLS4326 treatment did not confer efficacy in the Pcy /DBA model. Tolvaptan treatment reduced KW/BW but did not improve cyst index in this head-to-head comparison.

### Treatment and outcomes of congenital ovarian cysts A study by the Canadian consortium for research in pediatric surgery (canCORPS) [^8306e751]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

To address these limitations, we have created a proposed algorithm for the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic congenital ovarian cysts diagnosed between the beginning of the 3 rd trimester of pregnancy and 3 months of age (Figure 3). The pathway emphasizes management based on the trajectory of sonographic findings, rather than findings at any one point in time. Its objectives are to avoid early intervention, allow an adequate period of observation, identify nonresolving cysts, and document the natural history and outcomes of all lesions. Prospective application of the pathway in a new CanCORPS longitudinal follow-up study will allow further understanding of the natural history of these lesions, refine indications for intervention, and establish well-documented outcomes regardless of treatment modality.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® newly diagnosed palpable scrotal abnormality [^8ac8f6c1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Palpable scrotal abnormalities are caused by a variety of disorders, ranging from indolent benign conditions to aggressive tumors, and infectious and vascular processes. In these patients the diagnostic workup typically begins with a complete clinical, history, and physical examinations, including analysis of risk factors. If imaging is required, ultrasound examination is the diagnostic modality of choice. In few select patients with very large scrotal masses, MRI may be appropriate. However, the use of gadolinium-based contrast should be evaluated critically depending on specific patient factors. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Localization of external urethral orifice in coronary sulcus during urethroplasty in case of severe hypospadias accompanied by prostatic utricle cyst [^b50aa264]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Normally, Mullerian inhibiting factor (MIF) prevents the development of the female reproductive system in embryos around the 10th week of development. When the secretion of MIF is insufficient or the urogenital sinus is not fully developed in a way that allows for the formation of male reproductive organs, the Mullerian tube can degenerate incompletely and form a cystic dilatation connected to the prostatic urethra, forming PUC or cyst. Cysts are small and asymptomatic and are often found in physical examination. They can also be secondary to infection, stones or obstruction. Additionally, urinary tract infections, epididymitis and scrotal abscesses can occur repeatedly, and there are even reports of malignant transformation of prostate cysts. About 90% of PUC cases also display hypospadias or ambiguous external genitalia. The end of the vas deferens (ejaculatory duct), normally opening in the verumontanum, can open into the cyst. According to Monfort, in 4 out of 5 cases, the vas deferens entered the cyst. Ritchey et al. explained that the verumontanum originating from the urogenital sinus was affected due to the abnormality of the urogenital sinus and the formation of PUC, where the ejaculatory duct and vas deferens implant ectopically. Postoperative treatment of hypospadias is often complicated by urethral stricture up to 7–12%. With the increase of urethral pressure after urethroplasty, epididymitis can often occur after undergoing surgery to remedy hypospadias with a PUC.

PUC is often found in the course of hypospadias surgery when it is difficult to insert a catheter, or when complications such as epididymitis and pelvic inflammatory occur after urethroplasty. Few PUCs are confirmed before urethroplasty. However, if the size and location of cysts are not known before an operation, it can cause difficulties during the operation and affect the success of the operation. Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether there is a PUC before the operation for hypospadias, especially for severe hypospadias. Shima et al. reported that PUCs occurred in 13.9% (21/151) of penile-scrotal and perineal hypospadias patients. Therefore, the incidence of severe hypospadias, especially perineal hypospadias with PUC is high, and relevant imaging examinations should be performed before operating.

### Practice bulletin no. 174 summary: evaluation and management of adnexal masses [^1833ae85]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Mature ovarian teratomas and endometriomas—Surgical intervention for suspected endometriomas or mature ovarian teratomas is warranted if the masses are large, symptomatic, or growing in size on serial imaging or if malignancy is suspected. If these masses are managed expectantly, follow-up surveillance is warranted, and in one series of 289 women who opted for expectant management of ultrasound-diagnosed mature teratomas, 26% eventually underwent surgical treatment, with failures more likely among those with larger or more rapidly enlarging cysts. Surgical excision of endometriomas may adversely affect ovarian reserve, and although endometriomas of 5 cm or more have been associated with lower ovarian follicle density, several studies have found similar fertility outcomes among women with or without endometriomas who underwent assisted reproduction. Thus, asymptomatic endometriomas do not require intervention for infertility, and if surgery is required, as much ovarian tissue as possible should be conserved to preserve ovarian function.

### Bobble-head doll syndrome successfully treated with an endoscopic ventriculocystocisternostomy. case report and review of the literature [^64cf581a]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

The bobble-head doll syndrome (BHDS) is characterized by a back-and-forth movement of the head with a frequency of 2 to 3 Hz, which increases during walking and excitement and decreases during concentration. The head movements are accompanied by macrocephaly, ocular disturbances, psychomotor retardation, and sometimes endocrine dysfunction. The BHDS is frequently associated with a suprasellar arachnoid cyst. The authors present the case of a 4-year-old patient with BHDS; an endoscopic cystoventriculostomy was performed by fenestrating a cyst in the suprasellar region. After wide fenestration of the cyst wall that was protruding and obstructing the foramen of Monro, the cyst was entered with the endoscope and a small, natural, valvelike communication of the cyst with the basal prepontine cistern was seen close to the basilar artery. This communication was widened by balloon dilation. After completion of the ventriculocystocisternostomy, the cyst collapsed and the obstruction of the aqueduct was resolved. In view of the source mechanism and cerebrospinal fluid dynamics of the suprasellar arachnoid cyst, a ventriculocystocisternostomy is an important treatment option for BHDS arising from a suprasellar cyst. Three years after treatment, the head bobbing had resolved completely and psychomotor development was improving. Delay of diagnosis and treatment of this condition can cause permanent neurological dysfunction and psychomotor retardation. The authors recommend early ventriculocystocisternostomy as a physiologically based treatment for BHDS originating from a suprasellar cyst.

### Localization of external urethral orifice in coronary sulcus during urethroplasty in case of severe hypospadias accompanied by prostatic utricle cyst [^b93bd55c]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

To explore whether opening the external urethral orifice in the coronal sulcus can reduce the incidence of epididymitis after operating on hypospadias with prostatic utricle cyst (PUC) connecting to the vas deferens. Group A consisted of 3 patients with severe hypospadias and PUC undergoing cystostomy, hypospadias correction and urethroplasty, along with the relocation of the external orifice of the urethra to the coronal sulcus. Group B consisted of 4 patients having initial hypospadias repaired with meatus in the orthotopic position in the glans, presenting with multiple epididymitis after hypospadias surgery and unsuccessful conservative treatment. MR confirmed that all the Group B patients had PUC connecting to the vas deferens. Group B patients underwent urethral dilatation along with urethral catheterization, cutting of the original corpus cavernosum that encapsulated the urethra, and extension of the position of the external urethral orifice to the coronal sulcus.

Results

In group A, 3 children underwent bladder fistula removal 2 weeks after the operation. The penis developed normally without any complications. Four children in group B underwent stent removal 12 weeks after operation, and one patient was still stenosed and dilated again. All patients in group B were followed without epididymitis recurrence.

Conclusions

For patients with hypospadias complicating with a PUC, connecting to one side of the vas deferens, the positioning of the external urethral orifice in the coronary sulcus would be helpful to reduce the occurrence of epididymitis.

### Evaluating the risk of epididymal injury during hydrocelectomy and spermatocelectomy [^fc99c15e]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated the risk of epididymal injury in patients undergoing hydrocelectomy and spermatocelectomy, and determined risk factors that may increase the chance of epididymal injury. To our knowledge the incidences of epididymal injury during hydrocelectomy and spermatocelectomy have not previously been reported.

Materials and Methods

The pathology reports of all patients undergoing hydrocelectomy and spermatocelectomy at a single institution from 1990 to 2003 were retrospectively reviewed to determine if a portion of the epididymis was present in the pathology specimen. Patients with epididymis present then underwent a chart review to determine possible risk factors for epididymal injury.

Results

A total of 338 adults underwent unilateral or bilateral hydrocelectomy from 1990 to 2003. Another 111 patients underwent spermatocelectomy during this period. In 19 patients (5.62%) epididymal injuries were documented during hydrocelectomy and in 19 (17.12%) epididymal injuries were documented during spermatocelectomy. No specific risk factors could be identified.

Conclusions

The risk of epididymal injury during hydrocelectomy and spermatocelectomy is significant. Patients must be informed of this risk since epididymal injury may lead to infertility. To our knowledge this is the first published report documenting the incidence and risk of epididymal injury during hydrocelectomy or spermatocelectomy.

### Primary pancreatic hydatid cyst: a case report and literature review [^91a010f6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hydatid cysts are parasitic zoonoses that often occur in the liver. Pancreatic hydatid cysts are very rare and are usually misdiagnosed as pancreatic cystadenomas. At present, surgical resection combined with albendazole administration is the standard treatment for pancreatic hydatid cysts. However, making accurate preoperative diagnoses and avoiding intraoperative cystic rupture are challenges for surgeons.

Case Presentation

A 28-year-old woman from the pastoral area presented to the surgical office complaining of abdominal pain and new-onset jaundice that began 9 days earlier. An enhanced computed tomography scan demonstrated a 6.0×5.3 cm pancreatic head cystic mass that compressed the common bile duct and induced choledochectasia. The preoperative diagnosis was pancreatic head cystadenoma, and laparotomic pancreaticoduodenectomy was initiated successfully. The intra- and postoperative diagnosis was pancreatic hydatid cyst. The patient was discharged uneventfully 7 days after the operation. A 1-year course of albendazole (15 mg/kg/day) was admitted.

Conclusion

Pancreatic hydatid cysts are rare and often misdiagnosed as other types of cysts. History of living in an area in which the causative organism is endemic and positive anti-echinococcus IgG antibody status could help with the diagnosis. Radical resection combined with oral albendazole administration is the standard treatment for pancreatic hydatid cysts. Avoiding perioperative cystic rupture and abdominal echinococcosis implantation metastasis is crucial for the success of the operation.

### Human and animal fertility studies in cystinosis reveal signs of obstructive azoospermia, an altered blood-testis barrier and a subtherapeutic effect of cysteamine in testis [^7d9b102d]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Therefore, non‐invasive investigations including scrotal ultrasound (US) and the assessment of markers for obstruction in seminal plasma were applied to confirm or rule out an obstructive cause for azoospermia.

In the infantile cystinosis patients, a significantly enlarged diameter of the caput epididymis normalized to the ipsilateral testicular volume was demonstrated, compared with healthy controls. The two juvenile cystinosis patients who were oligospermic, and the ocular cystinosis patient showing normospermia, had a normal caput diameter similar to the control group (Figure 2A,B).

FIGURE 2 
Scrotal ultrasound (US) of the caput epididymis and testicular volume, and analysis of markers for obstruction in seminal plasma of cystinosis patients, vasectomy patients and healthy control subjects. Panel (A): Representative scrotal US images illustrating the assessment of the caput epididymis. Upper left: measurement of the right caput epididymis craniocaudal diameter of a healthy control (control subject n°17), measured in green dots (5.3 mm) which is indicated by the white arrow. Upper right: measurement of testicular volume via two dimensions measured in green dots (34.1 and 21.5 mm) which is indicated by the white arrows. Middle left: measurement of left caput epididymis craniocaudal diameter of a vasectomized patient (control subject n° 36), measured in yellow dots (11.6 mm) which is indicated by the white arrow. Middle right: measurement of the testicular volume of the ipsilateral testis of the vasectomized patient (control subject n° 36) with one dimension measured in green dots (22.3 mm) which is indicated by the white arrow. Lower left: measurement of the left caput epididymis craniocaudal diameter of an infantile cystinosis patient (patient n°10), measured in green dots (10.4 mm) which is indicated by the white arrow. Lower right: measurement for the ipsilateral (same left‐sided) testis of the same infantile cystinosis patient, with three dimensions measured in green dots (23.5, 19.0, and 47.3 mm, respectively) which is indicated by the white arrows. Panel (B): Scrotal US and seminal plasma markers indicate an obstructive cause for azoospermia. Left: Caput epididymis craniocaudal diameter (mm) normalized to the testicular volume for the ipsilateral testis (cm 3) in cystinosis (infantile (INF), juvenile (JUV), and ocular (OC)) and vasectomy patients, and healthy control subjects. Each dot represents a single‐sided measurement of a single patient. The craniocaudal diameter of the caput epididymis is significantly increased in infantile cystinosis patients compared to patients following vasectomy or healthy controls (P <.0001). Middle: ECM1 levels in seminal plasma (μg/mL) of infantile cystinosis male patients is comparable to vasectomy patients, and significantly lower compared to healthy control subjects (P =.0047) which parallels the significant lower level of ECM1 in seminal plasma of vasectomy patients compared to healthy control subjects (P =.0002). Right: Neutral alpha‐glucosidase (NAG) seminal plasma activity per one ejaculate (mIU/ejaculate) falls below the WHO lower limit of normal NAG activity (20 mIU/ejaculate; red dotted line) and is comparable to vasectomy patients

### Treatment of hydatid cyst of the liver: where is the evidence? [^a70ec1e1]. World Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment of hydatid cyst of the liver ranges from surgical intervention (conventional or laparoscopic approach) to percutaneous drainage and to medical therapy. The aim of this systematic review was to provide "evidence-based" answers to the following questions: Should chemotherapy be used alone or in association with surgery? What is the best surgical technique? When is the percutaneous aspiration injection and reaspiration technique (PAIR) indicated? An extensive electronic search of the relevant literature without limiting it to the English language was carried out using MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library. Key words used for the final search were "hydatid cyst," "liver," "treatment," "meta analysis," "randomized controlled trial," "prospective study," "retrospective study." All relevant studies reporting the assessment of one modality of treatment or a comparison of two or several therapeutic methods to treat hydatid cyst of the liver and published in a peer-reviewed journal were considered for analysis. This systematic review allowed us to conclude that chemotherapy is not the ideal treatment for uncomplicated hydatid cysts of the liver when used alone (level II evidence, grade B recommendation). The level of evidence was too low to help decide between radical or conservative treatment (level IV evidence, grade C recommendation). Omentoplasty associated with radical or conservative treatment is efficient in preventing deep abscesses (level II evidence, grade A recommendation). The laparoscopic approach is safe (level IV evidence, grade C recommendation). Drug treatment associated with surgery (level II evidence, grade C recommendation) requires further studies. Percutaneous drainage associated with albendazole therapy is safe and efficient in selected patients (level II evidence, grade B recommendation). The level of evidence is low concerning treatment of complicated cysts.
