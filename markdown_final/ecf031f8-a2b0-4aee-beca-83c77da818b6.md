## Question

What should be done when the vancomycin trough level is 20?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what should be done when the vancomycin trough level is 20 mg/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is a true trough and measured correctly. Then, I should place the value in clinical context by age, infection severity, renal function, MIC, and concurrent nephrotoxins. Next, I will reconcile 2009 trough-based versus 2020 AUC-based guidance to interpret what 20 mg/L implies for exposure and kidney risk. After that, I will outline actionable steps by population: adults with normal renal function, renal impairment or hemodialysis, pediatrics, and neonates. Finally, I need to specify reassessment, monitoring, and special-case caveats like meningitis and augmented clearance states, anchoring recommendations to high-quality guidance where available [^112QWv3D] [^116hsMEx].

> Let me first confirm the measurement validity, because if the timing is off the interpretation will be wrong. A true trough should be drawn within 30 minutes before the next dose; draws taken earlier are systematically higher, with studies showing mean overestimation by roughly 6–7 mg/L, so a "20 mg/L" could actually reflect a true trough closer to 13–14 mg/L if it was bundled with morning labs rather than timed correctly; if timing is uncertain, I should repeat the level properly before adjusting doses, and I should also confirm the units as mg/L or µg/mL, which are equivalent for vancomycin [^112DRAJk] [^113Vq2TM] [^1111dhMP].

> Next, I should review the clinical context to interpret whether 20 mg/L is adequate, excessive, or even unsafe. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: in 2009 we often targeted troughs of 15–20 mg/L for serious MRSA infections in adults, and even higher ends for meningitis, but the 2020 consensus pivoted to AUC-guided targets of 400–600 mg·h/L because trough-only strategies were linked to more nephrotoxicity without added efficacy; in children, lower troughs frequently achieve target AUC, and in neonates the safe trough window is much lower still, so the same "20 mg/L" means different things by age and indication [^116hsMEx] [^116n2y3t] [^112QWv3D] [^117ET2Fh].

> I will now examine what a trough of 20 mg/L implies under current recommendations. At first glance, 20 mg/L seems "on target" per older trough-based practice, but wait, I should verify alignment with 2020 AUC guidance: a trough of 20 mg/L often corresponds to a daily AUC above 600 mg·h/L in many patients, which increases the risk of vancomycin-associated AKI with no consistent efficacy advantage, so I should estimate the AUC using Bayesian software or a two-sample method and aim for 400–600 mg·h/L rather than chasing a specific trough [^112QWv3D] [^114b2RdS].

> For an adult with normal renal function being treated for serious MRSA, I should double-check exposure using an AUC calculation; if AUC/MIC is above 600 or serum creatinine is rising, I need to reduce total daily dose or extend the interval to bring exposure into the 400–600 mg·h/L range while monitoring clinical response, whereas if AUC is already 400–600 with stable renal function and the patient is improving, continuing the regimen with close monitoring is reasonable; I also need to consider de-escalation if cultures support an alternative agent with a better safety profile [^112QWv3D] [^115BegTq] [^1111dhMP].

> Hold on, I should verify renal status, because with chronic kidney disease or intermittent hemodialysis the same trough means something different. In CKD not on dialysis, a trough of 20 mg/L commonly indicates accumulation, so holding or spacing the next dose and re-dosing when the level is below the desired window is prudent, guided by AUC if feasible; in intermittent hemodialysis, a predialysis trough around 10–20 mg/L can be appropriate depending on timing, interdialytic interval, and dialyzer characteristics, but I should still avoid sustained levels exceeding the low 20s and individualize maintenance based on predialysis levels and response [^115DwQm4] [^113MFBBr] [^116cRbsd].

> Let me consider pediatrics, because I need to ensure I am not overexposing children by using adult trough surrogates. In most children, troughs of roughly 7–10 mg/L are sufficient to achieve an AUC/MIC ≥ 400 for MRSA with MIC ≤ 1 mg/L, so a measured trough of 20 mg/L is generally supratherapeutic and increases AKI risk without improving outcomes; I should reduce the dose or extend the interval and switch to AUC-guided monitoring when possible [^117ET2Fh] [^111QffFM] [^112QWv3D].

> For neonates, I should double-check because a trough of 20 mg/L is typically excessive and potentially toxic. Neonatal targets are lower, often aiming for troughs around 5–10 mg/L to balance exposure and safety, and many standard regimens fail to reach adult AUC targets without risking high troughs, so with a trough of 20 mg/L I would hold the next dose, allow the level to decline, then resume at a substantially reduced daily dose or longer interval with careful TDM [^1162rFdd] [^117Ngb1S].

> But wait, what if the organism's MIC is low or high; I need to check the MIC and the method used. If the MRSA MIC is 1 mg/L by broth microdilution, the recommended AUC target is 400–600 mg·h/L; if MIC is below 1, a trough of 20 mg/L is even more likely to overshoot the AUC window, and conversely if MIC is higher, vancomycin may be less reliable and alternative agents should be considered, especially for MIC ≥ 2 mg/L, so I should integrate source control and pathogen data into the dosing decision [^112QWv3D] [^116ZQseF] [^112Zgmvk].

> Next, I should review toxicity risk factors because they change my threshold for acting on a "20 mg/L". Concomitant nephrotoxins, critical illness, longer durations, and higher cumulative exposure all increase AKI risk, and troughs ≥ 15 mg/L have been linked to more nephrotoxicity in several cohorts and meta-analyses, so with any upward creatinine trend or high-risk profile I should proactively lower exposure toward an AUC of 400–500 mg·h/L rather than tolerating a 20 mg/L trough [^113ujL2t] [^112U2Kiv] [^113zXtF6].

> I will now examine special indications, because some scenarios historically targeted higher troughs. For bacterial meningitis, older IDSA guidance endorsed maintaining troughs around 15–20 mg/L, but even in CNS infections I should, whenever possible, prefer AUC-guided targets and balance CNS penetration considerations against AKI risk instead of assuming 20 mg/L is ideal, especially if MIC is ≤ 1 mg/L and clinical response is adequate at lower troughs that keep AUC within 400–600 mg·h/L [^116n2y3t] [^112QWv3D].

> Hmm, wait a minute, what if the patient has augmented clearance, such as major burns or severe trauma. In those states, vancomycin clearance can be markedly increased, and a trough below 15 mg/L might still correspond to adequate AUC, or conversely higher daily doses may be needed to reach target exposure; I should not equate a 20 mg/L trough with adequate or excessive exposure without calculating the AUC and reassessing PK alterations over time in these dynamic conditions [^1169sKXg] [^112u7cen] [^111RsPiE].

> I need to ensure follow-up and monitoring are tight. After any dose change, I should recheck exposure at steady state, typically after 3–4 doses for q12h regimens, confirm the draw is a true trough if a trough is being used, monitor serum creatinine and urine output at least every 48–72 hours in stable patients and more frequently in high-risk settings, and document clinical response and culture-directed de-escalation opportunities; if timing remains a recurrent problem, I should implement workflow fixes to reduce mistimed levels [^112QWv3D] [^112DRAJk] [^113Vq2TM].

> Bottom line, I should not treat a vancomycin trough of 20 mg/L as a universal target. Under 2020 consensus, it usually signals potential overexposure with increased AKI risk and warrants AUC-guided assessment, with dose reduction or interval extension if AUC exceeds 600 mg·h/L; in pediatrics and especially neonates, 20 mg/L is generally supratherapeutic and requires prompt dose adjustment or holding the dose, while in CKD or hemodialysis it often indicates accumulation unless purposefully targeted around the dialysis schedule, so verifying timing, calculating AUC, and tailoring by age, renal function, MIC, and indication are essential next steps [^112QWv3D] [^115DwQm4] [^117ET2Fh] [^1162rFdd].

A vancomycin trough of 20 mg/L is at the **upper end of the therapeutic range** for serious MRSA infections [^116hsMEx]. No immediate **dose change** is needed if the patient is stable and there is no nephrotoxicity, but **monitor renal function closely** [^116BWdxD] and repeat the trough before the next dose. If the patient is unstable, has rising creatinine, or is on nephrotoxins, consider holding or reducing the dose and switch to AUC-guided monitoring to keep AUC/MIC 400–600 [^112QWv3D] [^114b2RdS] [^112Zgmvk]. For less severe infections, reduce the dose to target 10–15 mg/L [^116hsMEx]. Always **confirm the trough was drawn correctly** [^112DRAJk] and reassess if mistimed.

## Clinical significance of a vancomycin trough level of 20 mg/L

A trough of 20 mg/L is at the **upper limit of the 15–20 mg/L range** recommended for serious MRSA infections (bacteremia, endocarditis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, meningitis) [^116hsMEx] [^116n2y3t]. It is generally therapeutic [^114b2RdS] but carries an increased risk of nephrotoxicity [^113ujL2t], particularly with prolonged exposure, higher doses, or concomitant nephrotoxins [^112U2Kiv].

## Clinical actions based on patient stability and infection severity

| **Clinical scenario** | **Action** | **Monitoring** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Stable patient with serious infection (e.g. MRSA bacteremia, endocarditis, pneumonia) | Continue current dosing; no immediate change required | Check renal function (serum creatinine, urine output) [^116BWdxD] and repeat trough before the next dose | 15–20 mg/L is therapeutic [^116hsMEx] for serious infections [^112QWv3D], but monitor for nephrotoxicity [^114b2RdS] [^113ujL2t] |
| Unstable patient or evidence of nephrotoxicity | Hold or reduce the next dose [^114b2RdS]; reassess renal function and vancomycin levels | Check serum creatinine, urine output, and repeat trough before the next dose | Elevated troughs increase nephrotoxicity risk [^113ujL2t], especially with renal impairment or nephrotoxins [^112U2Kiv] |
| Less severe infections (e.g. skin and soft tissue infections) | Reduce dose to target trough 10–15 mg/L [^116hsMEx] | Repeat trough after dose adjustment | Lower troughs suffice for less severe infections and reduce nephrotoxicity risk [^113ujL2t] |

---

## Importance of accurate timing of trough levels

Troughs should be drawn **within 30 minutes before the next dose**; early draws overestimate levels and may prompt inappropriate dose reductions or unnecessary repeat tests [^112DRAJk] [^113Vq2TM]. Confirm **timing** before acting on a trough of 20 mg/L.

---

## Transition to AUC-guided monitoring

Recent guidelines favor **AUC-guided monitoring** [^112QWv3D] (**AUC/MIC 400–600**) [^116npvPc] over trough-only monitoring to maintain efficacy and reduce nephrotoxicity [^114b2RdS]. A trough of 20 mg/L often corresponds to an AUC > 600, which increases nephrotoxicity risk [^114b2RdS] [^112U2Kiv]. Use Bayesian or two-sample methods to estimate AUC and adjust dosing accordingly [^114YKAED].

---

## Summary of recommended actions

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended action** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|
| Stable patient with serious infection | Continue current dosing | Renal function [^116BWdxD]; repeat trough |
| Unstable patient or nephrotoxicity | Hold or reduce dose [^114b2RdS] | Renal function; repeat trough |
| Less severe infection | Reduce dose (target 10–15 mg/L) [^116hsMEx] | Repeat trough |
| Any scenario | Confirm timing of trough [^112DRAJk] | Repeat if mistimed |

A vancomycin trough of 20 mg/L is therapeutic for serious infections [^116hsMEx] but near the nephrotoxicity threshold [^113ujL2t]; act based on clinical stability, infection severity, and accurate timing, and **consider AUC-guided dosing** to balance efficacy and safety [^112QWv3D] [^114b2RdS].

### What proportion of vancomycin trough levels are drawn too early: Frequency and impact on clinical actions [^112DRAJk]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Vancomycin trough levels are recommended to predict vancomycin efficacy, and inaccurate levels may lead to inappropriate clinical actions. However, the frequency of timing errors and associated clinical impact is unknown. We retrospectively analyzed vancomycin levels (n = 2,597) measured during 13 months at a large academic medical center. Of the specimens, 41.3% were drawn too early. These samples yielded significantly higher mean ± SD vancomycin concentrations than correctly timed samples (22.1 ± 11.7 mg/L vs. 15.5 ± 8.6 mg/L; P < .001), and consequently, clinicians were more likely to decrease, discontinue, or hold a patient's vancomycin dose (25.6% vs. 21.4%; P < .02) or repeat the vancomycin level (29.2% vs. 20.0%; P < .001). A substantial proportion of specimens collected to assess vancomycin efficacy were drawn too early, leading to overestimation of patients' true trough levels and possible underdosing of vancomycin or a high rate of repeat tests for vancomycin.

### Therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: A revised consensus guideline and review by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^112QWv3D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Recent clinical data on vancomycin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics suggest a reevaluation of dosing and monitoring recommendations. The previous 2009 vancomycin consensus guidelines recommend trough monitoring as a surrogate marker for the target area under the curve over 24 hours to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC). However, recent data indicate that trough monitoring is associated with higher nephrotoxicity.

This document provides an executive summary of the new vancomycin consensus guidelines for dosing and monitoring. It was developed by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists vancomycin consensus guidelines committee. These consensus guidelines recommend an AUC/MIC ratio of 400–600 mg*hour/L (assuming a broth microdilution MIC of 1 mg/L) to achieve clinical efficacy and ensure safety for patients being treated for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.

### Vancomycin area under the curve-guided dosing and monitoring for adult and pediatric patients with suspected or documented serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: Putting the safety of our patients first [^114b2RdS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The revised vancomycin consensus guidelines recommended area under the curve (AUC)-guided dosing and monitoring for patients with serious invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections as a measure to minimize vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury (VA-AKI) while maintaining similar effectiveness. Data indicate that the intensity of vancomycin exposure drives VA-AKI risk. Trough concentrations of 15–20 mg/L will ensure an AUC ≥ 400 mg × hr/L but most patients will have daily AUCs > 600. VA-AKI increases as a function of AUC, especially when it exceeds 600. In addition to minimizing VA-AKI risk while maintaining similar efficacy, AUC-guided dosing and monitoring is a more precise method for conducting therapeutic drug monitoring for vancomycin relative to trough-only control.

### Individualized empiric vancomycin dosing in neonates using a model-based approach [^115Pwf1J]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2019). Low credibility.

Vancomycin dosing in neonates is challenging due to the large variation in pharmacokinetics. Existing empiric dosing recommendations employ table-based formats, categorizing neonates based on underlying characteristics. The ability to individualize dosing is limited because of the small number of "dose categories", making it difficult to achieve narrow exposure targets. Our objective was to evaluate a model-based dosing approach, designated Neo-Vanco, to individualize empiric vancomycin dosing in neonates.

- **Methods**: Neo-Vanco was developed based on a published, externally validated population pharmacokinetic model. Using a simulation-based methodology, individualized empiric doses that maximize the probability of attaining a 24-hour area under the curve/minimum inhibitory concentration ratio (AUC24/MIC) of > 400 while minimizing troughs > 20 mg/L are calculated. To evaluate the Neo-Vanco strategy, retrospective data from neonates treated with vancomycin at two healthcare systems were used, and empiric dose recommendations from the following four sources were examined: Neo-Vanco, Neofax, Red Book, and Lexicomp. Predicted AUC24 and troughs were calculated and compared.

- **Results**: Overall, 492 neonates were evaluated (median postmenstrual age, 36 weeks [5th-95th percentiles (90% range), 25–47 weeks]; median weight, 2.4 kg [90% range, 0.6–4.8 kg]). The percentage of neonates predicted to achieve an AUC24/MIC of > 400 was 94% with Neo-Vanco, 18% with Neofax, 23% with Red Book, and 55% with Lexicomp (all P < .0001 vs. Neo-Vanco).

### Serum vancomycin levels resulting from continuous or intermittent infusion in critically ill burn patients with or without continuous renal replacement therapy [^1169sKXg]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

We evaluated vancomycin levels as recent guidelines for therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin recommend trough levels of 15 to 20 μg/mL; however, this may be more difficult to achieve in patients with accelerated vancomycin clearance, such as burn patients or recipients of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) therapy. We retrospectively studied 2110 serum vancomycin levels of 171 patients admitted to the burn intensive care unit for more than 4 years and who received vancomycin by continuous infusion (CI) or intermittent infusion (II), with or without simultaneous CVVH.

In-hospital mortality, 14- and 28-day mortality following vancomycin therapy were not different between dosing methods, although increased mortality was observed in the subgroup of patients receiving CI vancomycin empirically for clinical sepsis with negative blood cultures. More vancomycin was delivered to patients daily by CI than II, and therapeutic drug monitoring costs were similar. After controlling for differences in vancomycin dose by case matching with propensity scores, mean vancomycin levels were 20.0 ± 3.8 μg/mL for CI, vs. 14.8 ± 4.4 μg/mL for II (P < .001).

CI dosing resulted in similar levels with or without CVVH, whereas in II dosing, CVVH appeared to significantly decrease vancomycin levels. Although CI dosing was associated with higher vancomycin levels in general and fewer levels of < 10 μg/mL, significant nephrotoxicity or neutropenia was not observed. Fifty-seven patients (33.3%) developed bacteremia, and 106 Gram-positive bacteri…

### Initial vancomycin dosing protocol to achieve therapeutic serum concentrations in patients undergoing hemodialysis [^113MFBBr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Although recent consensus guidelines proposed more aggressive vancomycin troughs of > 10 or 15–20 mg/L for complicated Staphylococcus aureus infections, dosing information to achieve these targets in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) is scarce.

- **Methods**: We used Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) methods with a previously published population-pharmacokinetic model and relevant patient demographics to evaluate and revise our existing vancomycin dosing protocol (1000-mg load followed by 500-mg maintenance dose, with doses infused during the last hour of dialysis). A new protocol (1000-mg load followed by 500-mg maintenance dose for patients 100 kg) was developed and prospectively validated to achieve therapeutic serum troughs in patients undergoing high-flux HD.

- **Results**: MCSs predicted that our existing protocol would be suboptimal in more than one-third of patients. Simulations predicted that the new vancomycin dosing protocol would achieve maintenance (pre-HD) troughs of 10–20 mg/L in 86.0% of cases, including 15–20 mg/L in 35.2%. In prospective validation, the observed postload trough (pre-HD session 2) was 13.5 ± 3.4 mg/L, with 76.9% of levels (20 of 26) between 10 and 20 mg/L. The observed maintenance trough was 17.3 ± 4.0 mg/L with 65.5% (19 of 29) between 10 and 20 mg/L and 89.7% (26 of 29) within 10% of the upper limit (i.e. 10–22 mg/L).

- **Conclusions**: In this study, a practical vancomycin dosing protocol for patients undergoing HD was developed and prospectively validated.

### Attention to age: similar dosing regimens lead to different vancomycin levels among older and younger patients [^1147C16e]. Age and Ageing (2019). Low credibility.

Little is known on the clinical implications of vancomycin trough levels among older patients. The objective of this study is to evaluate the association between vancomycin levels and outcomes among older versus younger patients through a retrospective study.

- **Subjects**: Patients aged 18–64 and ≥ 65 years treated with vancomycin for documented methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.

- **Methods**: We compared the effectiveness and toxicity of vancomycin according to trough levels in older versus younger patients. Subgroup analysis of patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) > 60 ml/min/1.73 m² was performed.

- **Results**: We included 181 patients aged ≥ 65 years and 104 younger patients. The mean age in the older group was 76.9 ± 8 years versus 50.9 ± 12.4 in the younger group. Vancomycin trough levels and 24-hour area under the curve to minimal inhibitory concentrations (AUC/MIC) were significantly higher in older patients, who were also significantly more likely to achieve trough levels of ≥ 15 mg/l within 4 days (98/181, 54.1% vs. 38/104, 36.5% in younger patients, P = 0.004). Results were similar among patients with GFR > 60. Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in older patients (74/181, 40.9% vs. 13/104, 12.5%, P < 0.001). There was no association between vancomycin trough levels and mortality among older patients. No significant differences were demonstrated in clinical or microbiological success or nephrotoxicity.

- **Conclusions**: Applying uniform dosing recommendations across age groups among adults with MRSA infections results in higher vancomycin levels.

### Describing vancomycin serum levels in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients: Are expected goals being met [^117ET2Fh]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Monitoring vancomycin serum levels is important to track both the toxicity and effectiveness of the treatment. In adults, an AUC/MIC > 400 of vancomycin is associated with a better clinical and bacteriological response in patients with MRSA infections, and this target is extended to pediatric patients, despite the lack of similar evidence. Although the AUC/MIC > 400 pharmacodynamic parameter is ideal for determining the clinical efficacy of vancomycin, serum concentration can be used as it is a more practical method.

Tkachuk S et al. showed that vancomycin target serum levels varied based on patient characteristics; however, for pediatric patients in general, levels between 6 and 10 mg/L are sufficient to achieve AUC/MIC ≥ 400. Frymoyer et al. suggest that trough serum levels of 15–20 mg/L are unnecessary to attain AUC/MIC > 400 in the pediatric population, as minimal concentrations of vancomycin between 7 and 10 mg/L were predictive of reaching the pharmacodynamic target of AUC/MIC > 400 in approximately 90% of the simulations carried out with children receiving a dose of 15 mg/kg every 6 h. Our study showed that only 26% of the children reached a serum level of 10–20 mg/L.

Adult guidelines suggest that an AUC/MIC > 400 corresponds to a vancomycin serum concentration of 15 to 20 mg/L for treating MRSA infections. However, children rarely reach this serum level. The study conducted by Kishk et al. found that the correlation of the AUC/MIC > 400 was associated with an average concentration of 11.4 mg/L. In our study, we performed the stratification.

### Vancomycin dosing practices, trough concentrations, and predicted area under the curve in children with suspected invasive staphylococcal infections [^116NR9Rg]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2013). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines recommend empiric vancomycin dosing of 60 mg/kg per day and consideration of higher trough concentrations (15–20 mcg/mL) in children with invasive infections. In this study, we report a retrospective review evaluating the dose/trough relationship and predicted area under the curve in pediatric patients receiving vancomycin for invasive staphylococcal infections.

### Monitoring of vancomycin serum levels for the treatment of staphylococcal infections [^111BiLfv]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Vancomycin serum concentrations were determined for 1,737 patients treated with either 2 x 1 g of vancomycin or 4 x 500 mg daily (780 patients), according to nomograms, or by continuous infusion (957 patients) with a loading dose (1 g) and a total of 2–6 g daily. Trough serum concentrations were determined after 36–48 hours. Adequate serum levels for the treatment of a normal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and a glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA) were observed in 81% and 20.9% of patients, respectively. The data support theoretical arguments that higher and more sustained serum levels of vancomycin, obtained by continuous infusion, may enhance clinical efficacy.

### Vancomycin administration: the impact of multidisciplinary interventions [^1159j9Bt]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

The clinical microbiology team observed that patients were not receiving all prescribed doses of vancomycin. Ward staff were confused about ordering and interpreting vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) levels.

- **Aim**: To audit the incidence of vancomycin dose omission, implement a series of interventions to improve vancomycin dose administration, and repeat the audit process to assess these interventions.

- **Methods**: Three prospective audits were conducted to assess the impact of vancomycin TDM on the administration of vancomycin. After the first audit, a number of changes in the TDM process were undertaken. After reviewing the second audit, a senior pharmacist coordinated ward-based pharmacists to assist staff in interpreting levels, and TDM interpretative charts were designed for drug charts. Following the third audit, feedback to hospital management and a plan for ongoing education were implemented.

- **Results**: There was a significant reduction in the number of vancomycin doses held inappropriately in the third audit (10% (78/782) of prescribed doses) compared to the first audit (16% (161/1007) of doses) (p < 0.01). Of the doses that were held inappropriately, there was a significant decrease in doses held for no apparent reason in audit 3 (16% (27/170) of prescribed doses) compared to audit 1 (25% (69/282) of doses) (p < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: The interventions resulted in a 37.5% reduction in inappropriately held vancomycin doses over a one-year period. However, 10% of doses are still being held inappropriately. This study highlights the difficulties in identifying barriers.

### Neonatal vancomycin continuous infusion: still a confusion [^115FzLz5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Continuous infusions of vancomycin over 24 hours have been shown in adults to reduce drug toxicity, lower treatment costs, and require fewer blood samples for therapeutic drug monitoring. They may also improve clinical outcomes through earlier attainment of target drug concentrations. In neonates, there is no consensus on vancomycin dosing. We reviewed the literature to assess the evidence for vancomycin dosing regimens for continuous infusion in neonates.

- **Methods**: Medline and Embase were searched for studies about continuous vancomycin dosing regimens in neonates that reported serum drug concentrations. The search identified 469 articles, of which 5 were relevant.

- **Results**: Five prospective studies were included; 2 studies used non-linear mixed effects modeling. Vancomycin was administered with parenteral nutrition or 5% dextrose. Target serum concentrations varied (range: 10–30 mg/L). Four studies used loading doses before continuous infusion; only 1 documented achievement of therapeutic concentrations after the load. The time to a therapeutic concentration was not reported for the other studies. Attainment of target concentrations ranged from 56% to 89% of measurements. Only 1 study compared intermittent to continuous infusions, reporting higher attainment of target concentrations with continuous dosing (82% vs. 46%). No adverse effects were reported, although 3 neonates developed a reversible raised serum creatinine in the setting of septicemia.

- **Conclusion**: Continuous infusions of vancomycin in neonates are well tolerated, require less blood sampling, and may lead to better clinical outcomes.

### Describing vancomycin serum levels in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients: Are expected goals being met [^116D6mcb]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

In the sample studied, 48.2% (n = 53) of the patients had a positive microbiologic culture. The patients had between one and five agents identified. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent agent, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis.

The number of samples taken for the evaluation of vancomycin trough serum levels varied between 0 and 11, being undertaken in 87.3% of the 110 patients evaluated. The average duration of vancomycin treatment was 8.7 days (first quartile: 4.3 days and third quartile: 13.0 days). Seven patients died during hospitalization, representing 6.4% of the sample of 110 patients. The trough levels related to this mortality rate ranged from < 5 to 17.3 mg/L.

The information about the interval between dose administration and vancomycin serum collection, the time between the collection and the next dose, and the time of collection are detailed in the study. The median of the initial dose was 40 mg/kg/day, ranging from 30 to 84 mg/kg/day. In relation to all doses administered during treatment with vancomycin, the total daily dose of vancomycin varied from 24 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day, with a median of 40 mg/kg/day.

The study explores the variation of vancomycin serum levels and its implications.

### Cystatin C-guided vancomycin dosing in critically ill patients: A quality improvement project [^113WsdxT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to determine whether a vancomycin dosing algorithm based on estimated glomerular filtration rate from creatinine and cystatin C levels (eGFR cr-cys) improves target trough concentration achievement compared to an algorithm based on estimated creatinine clearance (eCL cr) in critically ill patients.

- **Study design**: This prospective quality improvement project evaluated intensive care unit (ICU) patients started on intravenous vancomycin using one of two different strategies. Dosing regimens were selected and implemented after an individualized goal trough range was established (10–15 or 15–20 mg/L). Steady-state goal trough achievement was compared between treatment arms with and without adjustment for potential confounders.

- **Setting & participants**: The study was conducted in three medical and surgical ICUs at a single tertiary medical center.

- **Quality improvement plan**: From January 2012 to October 2013, vancomycin was dosed according to eCL cr using the Cockcroft-Gault formula (control arm). Between December 2013 and May 2015, a multidisciplinary quality improvement team implemented a novel vancomycin dosing algorithm according to eGFR cr-cys using the CKD-EPI equation (intervention arm).

- **Outcome**: The outcome measured was steady-state initial goal vancomycin trough concentration achievement.

- **Measurements & results**: More patients in the intervention arm (67 of 135, 50%) achieved therapeutic trough vancomycin levels than in the control arm (74 of 264, 28%; OR 2.53; 95% CI 1.65–3.90; P < 0.001). Improved trough achievement was maintained even after adjustment for age, sex, and APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) scores.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^113zXtF6]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

The guidelines define nephrotoxicity as a rise in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL or 50% above baseline on two consecutive measurements after several days of vancomycin with no other apparent cause. This definition is the most frequently used, although other studies utilize the more sensitive risk-injury-failure-loss-ESRD (RIFLE) or AKI network (AKIN) criteria for acute kidney injury (AKI). Herein, VANT refers to the guideline-based definition of nephrotoxicity, and AKI refers to either the RIFLE or AKIN criteria.

Studies employing these latter criteria have found most cases to be of lower stages based on creatinine criteria. For example, in one study using AKIN criteria, 92% of cases reached stage 1, whereas in two studies using RIFLE criteria, 50% and 71% reached only stage R. No study has specified VANT or AKI stage based purely on urine output criteria. Older studies showed mean increases in serum creatinine from baseline of approximately 1–1.5 mg/dL.

### Vancomycin dosing in patients on intermittent hemodialysis [^115DwQm4]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Vancomycin has been a cornerstone antibiotic for the treatment of severe gram-positive infections in dialysis patients for decades. Whereas subtherapeutic vancomycin levels convey a risk of treatment failure and the further emergence of resistance in staphylococci, supratherapeutic vancomycin levels are associated with a dose-related incremental risk for nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Consequently, a narrow therapeutic range with a trough-level target between 15 and 20 μg/ml is recommended.

Vancomycin dosing in hemodialysis patients is mainly influenced by the timing of administration (during or after dialysis), the type of filter used, and the duration of dialysis. Actual body weight, the interdialytic interval, and residual renal function are also considerations. As in patients with normal kidney function, a weight-based loading dose of 20–25 mg/kg should be used in dialysis patients. While most fixed-dose maintenance regimens fail to reach target levels in the majority of hemodialysis patients, straightforward evidence on optimal maintenance dosing is lacking.

### Vancomycin therapeutic guidelines: A summary of consensus recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^116hsMEx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). High credibility.

Practice guidelines for therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin treatment for Staphylococcus aureus infection in adult patients were reviewed by an expert panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists. A literature review of existing evidence regarding vancomycin dosing and monitoring of serum concentrations, in addition to patient outcomes combined with expert opinion regarding the drug's pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety record, resulted in new recommendations for targeting and adjustment of vancomycin therapy.

### Vancomycin [^115BegTq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Vancomycin Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Vancomycin Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Current recommended dosing of vancomycin for children with invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections is inadequate [^114QrFHn]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Vancomycin area-under-the-concentration-time-curve (AUC) for 24 hours divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (AUC24/MIC) > 400 optimally treats invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in adults. It is unknown whether recommended vancomycin dosing regimens for children achieve this value.

- **Methods**: AUC24/MIC was calculated in children using vancomycin doses of 40 and 60 mg/kg/d. AUC24 was calculated as the daily dose divided by vancomycin clearance. Vancomycin clearance in children was estimated by two approaches: (1) previously literature-reported vancomycin clearance, and (2) calculated vancomycin clearance using previously derived predictor models and a hypothetical population of healthy children. A representative MIC of hospital MRSA isolates was used (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 microg/mL).

- **Results**: The MIC50/90 for pediatric MRSA isolates in the previous year was 1.0 microg/mL. With a dose of 40 mg/kg/d, both approaches consistently predicted AUC24/MIC 400 was more readily achieved when MIC was 1.0 microg/mL. However, an MIC of 2.0 microg/mL resulted in AUC24/MIC 400 for invasive MRSA infections even when MIC is 1.0 microg/mL. A starting dose of 60 mg/kg/d should be used in settings where isolates with MIC of 1.0 are common. Alternatives to vancomycin should strongly be considered for patients with MIC ≥ 2.0 microg/mL.

### Evidence-based guideline for therapeutic drug monitoring of vancomycin: 2020 update by the Division of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring, Chinese Pharmacological Society [^116npvPc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines or recommendations often require timely and regular updating as new evidence emerges because this can alter the risk-benefit trade-off. The scientific process of developing and updating guidelines, accompanied by adequate implementation, can improve outcomes. To promote better management of patients receiving vancomycin therapy, we updated the guideline for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of vancomycin published in 2015.

- **Methods**: Our updated recommendations complied with standards for developing trustworthy guidelines, including timeliness and rigor of the updating process, as well as the use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We also followed the methodology handbook published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and the Spanish National Health System.

- **Results**: We partially updated the 2015 guideline. Apart from adults, the updated guideline also focuses on pediatric patients and neonates requiring intravenous vancomycin therapy. The guideline recommendations involve a broadened range of patients requiring TDM, a modified index of TDM (both 24-hour area under the curve and trough concentration), additions regarding the necessity and timing of repeated TDM, and initial dose for specific subpopulations. Overall, one recommendation was deleted, and three recommendations were modified. Eleven new recommendations were added, and no recommendation was made for two clinical questions.

- **Conclusions**: We updated an evidence-based guideline regarding the TDM of vancomycin.

### A multicenter, retrospective outcome analysis of vancomycin area under the curve versus trough-based dosing strategies in patients with burn or inhalational injuries (MONITOR) [^112no4gV]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that requires close therapeutic monitoring. Prolonged exposure to elevated concentrations increases the risk for serious adverse effects such as nephrotoxicity. However, subtherapeutic concentrations may lead to bacterial resistance and clinical failure or death. The most recent Infectious Diseases Society of America publication regarding therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin recommends using area under the curve (AUC)-based monitoring to maximize clinical success. Despite the guideline recommendation for AUC-guided dosing, many institutions still use trough-only monitoring in their practices, including those caring for patients with acute burn injuries.

Following burn injury, patients are at a higher risk for infections, multiorgan failure, and pharmacokinetic alterations. The primary objective of this multicenter retrospective study is to determine optimal therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin by comparing clinical success between AUC and trough-based monitoring in patients with burns. MONITOR was a multicenter, retrospective study of patients with thermal or inhalation injury admitted to one of 13 burn centers from January 1, 2017, to August 31, 2022, who received vancomycin. Demographic and clinical course data, including acute kidney injury (AKI) incidence and clinical success, were obtained. Patients were evaluated for clinical success and grouped according to the method of monitoring and adjusting doses: AUC vs. trough-based monitoring. Clinical success was a composite definition and lack of meeting any 1 of 5 criteria.

### Prediction of vancomycin area under the curve with trough concentrations only: Performance evaluation of pediatric population pharmacokinetic models [^112tR5fN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Improvements to vancomycin exposure may be achieved through model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) based on patient characteristics and measured blood samples. The sampling strategy for traditional vancomycin dose adaptations relies on the interpretation of trough concentrations. However, for accurate estimation of the area under the curve (AUC) over 24 hours, it is advised to obtain at least one postdistributional peak and one trough vancomycin concentration at the end of a dosing interval. The ability to accurately determine a trough-based AUC over 24 hours without a peak concentration offers advantages, such as improved clinical feasibility and reduced patient burden. In this study, we aim to retrospectively evaluate the accuracy and precision of trough-based AUC over 24 hours estimation using existing population pharmacokinetic (popPK) models for vancomycin and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) blood samples for pediatric patients.

### Coagulase negative staphylococcal sepsis in neonates: Do we need to adapt vancomycin dose or target [^115kUyru]? BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Our findings that there was no association between the AUC/MIC ratio and outcome do not prove that such an association does not exist. First, one should bear in mind these data are retrospectively collected and thus outcome measures may be prone to bias. Second, it may well be that the AUC/MIC ratios of 300 and 400 assessed by us are too similar to detect a difference between these two ratios. We believe that more data with a larger dataset in clinical CoNS infections are needed in terms of the optimal AUC/MIC ratio before firm conclusions on the adequacy of dosing recommendations can be drawn.

We and others have shown that to achieve an AUC/MIC value of 400, vancomycin trough levels around 10 mg/L or slightly higher are required, provided that the MIC value of the infecting organisms is ≤ 1 mcg/ml. The latter was the median value of Gram-positive isolates in our hospital as well. However, when the distribution of actual isolates was used in simulations, it appeared that only approximately 35% of neonates achieved AUC/MIC values of 300 and less than 22% achieved 400, suggesting that these targets are not achieved with dosing in the majority of patients. However, one should emphasize once again that we still do not know whether these targets are required at all.

### Healthcare-associated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children: Evidence for reverse vancomycin creep and impact of vancomycin trough values on outcome [^111br42G]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Elevated vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in Staphylococcus aureus have been associated with worse clinical outcomes in adults. For invasive meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections in adults, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends targeting vancomycin serum trough concentrations between 15 and 20 μg/mL. We evaluated trends in vancomycin MICs from healthcare-associated (HCA) S. aureus bacteremia isolates in children in addition to correlating vancomycin serum trough levels with clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: Patients and isolates were identified from a prospective S. aureus surveillance study at Texas Children's Hospital (TCH). HCA S. aureus bacteremia isolates from 2003 to 2013 were selected. Vancomycin MICs by E-test were determined and medical records were reviewed. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined as doubling of the baseline serum creatinine.

- **Results**: Three hundred forty-one isolates met inclusion criteria. We observed a reverse vancomycin creep among MRSA isolates in the study period with a decline in the proportion of isolates with vancomycin MIC ≥ 2 μg/mL (from 32.7% to 5.6%). A vancomycin trough concentration > 15 μg/mL was, however, an independent risk factor for AKI.

- **Conclusions**: Vancomycin MICs are shifting among HCA S. aureus bacteremia isolates with significant implications for treatment strategies.

### Vancomycin dosing in critically ill trauma patients: The VANCTIC study [^112u7cen]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists recommend vancomycin troughs of 15 mg/L to 20 mg/L for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. The pharmacokinetics of vancomycin are altered in critically ill patients, leading to inadequate serum levels. Rates of initial therapeutic vancomycin troughs have ranged from 17.6% to 33% using intermittent infusions (i.e. 15–20 mg/L) and approximately 60% using continuous infusions (i.e. 15–25 mg/L) in critically ill trauma patients. We hypothesized that our dosing protocol would achieve higher rates of initial therapeutic troughs compared with previously published reports due to more aggressive loading doses than those seen in previously published reports.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective study of all critically ill trauma patients admitted to a Level I trauma intensive care unit over a 39-month period who had a suspected serious infection, who were treated with empiric vancomycin per the "pharmacy to dose" protocol, and who had an appropriately drawn steady state trough level. The primary outcome was the rate of initial therapeutic troughs, which was defined as 14.5 mg/L to 20.5 mg/L.

- **Results**: One hundred ninety-seven patients were screened. Seventy patients met inclusion criteria. The study cohort had a median age of 47.5 years and a median Injury Severity Score of 28. Augmented renal clearances were observed, with a median creatinine clearance of 159.1 mL/min and a median Augmented Renal Clearance in Trauma.

### Trough concentrations of vancomycin: Adult therapeutic targets are not appropriate for children [^113bwWTg]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Despite the need for effective vancomycin therapy, there are few data guiding vancomycin monitoring in children. We reviewed retrospectively vancomycin use in children aged 1 month to 12 years. Initial and adjusted target trough vancomycin concentrations in serum were infrequently achieved, regardless of the dosing schedule. Currently recommended trough concentrations need to be re-examined with a more detailed pharmacokinetic study in children.

### Coagulase negative staphylococcal sepsis in neonates: Do we need to adapt vancomycin dose or target [^117Ngb1S]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Vancomycin TDM measurements were taken after the 1st to 44th dose (median 5; IQR 3–8), between 4.5 h and 24 h after the start of infusion. The median number of TDMs per patient was 2 (range 1–9). A trough concentration (C_trough) of 5–10 mg/L was achieved in 63.6% of cases, while 10–15 mg/L was achieved in 20.5% of cases. There were 9.3% and 7.3% of samples with vancomycin concentrations below 5 mg/L and above 15 mg/L, respectively.

Pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from the Anderson model were Vd = 0.61 ± 0.05 L/kg and Cl = 0.06 ± 0.01 L/h*kg. Parameters obtained from the popPK model were Vc = 0.13 ± 0.06 L/kg, Cl = 0.06 ± 0.02 L/h*kg, Q = 0.36 ± 0.10 L/h*kg, and Vp = 0.76 ± 0.22 L/kg.

The mean (SD) vancomycin AUC values obtained in TDM and the Anderson model were similar, at 280.6 ± 102.0 mg/kg*L and 287.1 ± 74.2 mg/kg*L, respectively. AUC values remained consistent throughout the studied GA range (data not shown).

Only 34% and 12% of subjects with positive blood cultures achieved AUC/MIC ≥ 300 and AUC/MIC ≥ 400, respectively. Clinical outcome and individual AUC/MIC values of culture-positive late-onset sepsis (LOS) episodes are shown in Fig. 2. The AUC/MIC ratio for patients with clinical success (median 268.6; IQR 130.7–326.5) and those with clinical failure (median 210.1; IQR 149.5–319.1) was similar.

### Coagulase negative staphylococcal sepsis in neonates: Do we need to adapt vancomycin dose or target [^1162rFdd]? BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

This study investigates the vancomycin dosing requirements in neonates with coagulase-negative staphylococcal (CoNS) sepsis. Trough concentrations of vancomycin required to achieve an AUC of 400 in neonates are lower than those reported for adults. Based on the actual MIC distribution of neonatal invasive CoNS strains, an AUC/MIC of 400 is achieved in less than half of neonates with standard vancomycin dosing. The vancomycin doses that are required to achieve an 80% probability of meeting this target are associated with potentially toxic trough levels. Moreover, with standard vancomycin dosing, treatment failure occurs in about a quarter of cases.

### Association of vancomycin serum concentrations with efficacy in patients with MRSA infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ujL2t]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Recent Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections recommend maintaining vancomycin trough concentrations of 15–20 mg/L for serious infections. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies assessing the impact of low (< 15 mg/L) versus high (≥ 15 mg/L) vancomycin trough levels on the efficacy of MRSA infections treatment. Four prospective and twelve retrospective studies were included, encompassing 2,003 participants.

No significant difference was demonstrated between low and high vancomycin trough levels for the outcome of all-cause mortality (odds ratio (OR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78–1.46, I² = 28%). However, in studies evaluating mainly MRSA pneumonia, there was significantly higher mortality associated with low vancomycin levels (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.11–2.84). No significant difference was demonstrated in treatment failure rates overall (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.88–1.78, I² = 51%).

- **When excluding an outlier study**: Treatment failure became significantly higher in patients with low vancomycin trough levels (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.12–1.91, I² = 16%).

Microbiologic failure rates were significantly higher in patients with low vancomycin levels (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.08–2.26, I² = 0%). Nephrotoxicity was notably higher with vancomycin levels of ≥ 15 mg/L, though no cases of irreversible renal damage were reported.

Data on the effectiveness of higher vancomycin trough levels in the treatment of MRSA infections are limited to a few prospective and mainly retrospective studies.

### What's new in therapeutic drug monitoring of antimicrobials [^116K57T3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

There are several areas of uncertainty regarding therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antimicrobials.

- **Target concentrations**: What concentrations should be targeted and where? There is significant heterogeneity in TDM studies regarding the definition of target concentrations, and the probability of target attainment (PTA) for empirical dosing depends on whether "high" or "low" targets are defined. For example, while there is consensus that concentrations for β-lactams should be above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of pathogens for the better part of a dosing interval, it is debated whether target concentrations of up to 4–6 times the MIC add further benefit. As individual MICs are often not available, the use of empirical MICs for the respective antimicrobial, usually at the higher end of "sensitive", is common. While the use of high MICs in combination with high target attainment aims at avoiding underdosing, the necessity of such high targets is questionable as it also increases the risk of attaining potentially toxic levels.

It is also unclear whether targets should be adjusted according to local resistance epidemiology and if TDM is particularly valuable in settings with high rates of resistance. It must be recognized that antimicrobial concentrations are usually measured in plasma samples, which do not necessarily reflect concentrations at the site of infection and thus act as a surrogate marker.

### Intravenous vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring in children: Evaluation of a pharmacy-driven protocol and collaborative practice agreement [^1145EVMN]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020). Low credibility.

Vancomycin optimization is challenging, requiring careful therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to avoid toxicity and ensure an efficacious concentration. Most prescriptions are empiric and often discontinued within 72 hours, making early TDM unnecessary. Although TDM using trough levels is common, the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) is the preferred pharmacodynamic target. We studied the effect of a pharmacy-driven vancomycin collaborative practice agreement (CPA) at a children's hospital that delayed TDM up to 72 hours and targeted a 2-point 24-hour AUC of ≥ 400 mg × h/L.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed vancomycin courses in patients aged ≥ 30 days who received vancomycin between April 1, 2011, and August 30, 2017. We implemented the CPA on June 1, 2014. Outcomes included CPA use, use of TDM, dosage adjustments, and development of acute kidney injury. We compared courses given while monitoring only trough levels (TO-TDM) with those given while using the CPA (AUC-TDM). We performed interrupted time series analyses to account for preintervention trends.

- **Results**: We included 2379 courses in the TO-TDM period and 2155 in the AUC-TDM period. During the AUC-TDM period, 87% of the courses were managed by the CPA. In adjusted interrupted time series analyses, CPA implementation was associated with an initial change in the level of -0.265 (95% confidence interval, -0.336 to -0.189) in TDM and an initial change in the level of -0.332 (95% CI, -0.506 to -0.163) in dosage adjustments. The 1-year risk of acute kidney injury decreased after CPA implementation (odds ratio, 0…).

### Vancomycin [^1111dhMP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Vancomycin is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)]. The pharmacodynamics of vancomycin is unknown.

In subjects with normal kidney function, multiple intravenous dosing of 1 g of vancomycin (15 mg/kg) infused over 60 minutes produces mean plasma concentrations of approximately 63 mcg/mL immediately after the completion of the infusion, approximately 23 mcg/mL 2 hours after infusion, and approximately 8 mcg/mL 11 hours after the end of the infusion. Multiple dosing of 500 mg infused over 30 minutes produces mean plasma concentrations of about 49 mcg/mL at the completion of infusion, about 19 mcg/mL 2 hours after infusion, and about 10 mcg/mL 6 hours after infusion. The plasma concentrations during multiple dosing are similar to those following a single dose.

In healthy subjects administered a single 1 g dose of vancomycin injection, the geometric mean (geometric %CV) AUC0-inf values for NADA, PEG 400, and vancomycin were 209 (19.6%), 405 (12.5%), and 219 (13.7%) mcg*h/mL, respectively. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, 1 g of vancomycin injection administered over 1.5 hours every 12 hours achieves a geometric mean (95% prediction interval) steady state AUC0–24 exposure of 384 (277–547), 734 (550–994), and 384 (261–567) mcg*h/mL for NADA, PEG 400, and vancomycin in healthy subjects, respectively.

The volume of distribution ranges from 0.3 to 0.43 L/kg after intravenous administration.

### Coagulase negative staphylococcal sepsis in neonates: Do we need to adapt vancomycin dose or target [^116Wh82J]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Simulations of target attainment with dosing were carried out using the above-described models. First, Anderson's popPK model was used with collected subjects' covariate information for retrieval of individual PK parameters. Individual AUC values were evaluated from: AUC = (24*D)/(CL*tau), where tau equals the interval between infusions (h). Second, a TDM population model based on individual Bayesian posterior predictions was used, and fitted concentration curves were constructed for each subject. Twenty-four-hour individual AUCs at steady state were calculated using the trapezoidal approximation method of fitted concentration curves.

1,000 virtual MIC values were generated by bootstrapping vancomycin MICs of CoNS isolates in our database. A discrete distribution of variables was assumed. AUC values obtained by both methods were bootstrapped to 1,000 virtual subjects along with MIC values, and 500 such data sets were simulated for AUC/MIC targets. PTA values of 80% and 90% were found over target levels of AUC/MIC > 400 and AUC/MIC > 300. The higher target was chosen as being associated with clinical efficacy in adult MRSA pneumonia, and the most frequently quoted also in neonatal PKPD simulation studies in recent years. A lower target was also tested, as different pathogen structures and diseases (bloodstream vs. lung tissue penetration) as well as lower protein binding suggest lower optimal exposure for neonates. Empirical confidence intervals were identified from performed simulations.

Calculation of vancomycin doses needed for therapeutic target attainment was performed accordingly.

### Impact of vancomycin exposure on outcomes in patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: Support for consensus guidelines suggested targets [^116ZQseF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

High rates of vancomycin failure in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections have been increasingly reported over time. The primary objective of our study was to determine the impact of vancomycin exposure and outcomes in patients with MRSA bacteremia initially treated with vancomycin.

- **Methods**: This was a single-center retrospective analysis of 320 patients with documented MRSA bacteremia initially treated with vancomycin from January 2005 through April 2010. Two methods of susceptibility, Etest and broth microdilution, were performed for all isolates to determine the correlation of susceptibility testing to patient outcomes.

- **Results**: Among a cohort of 320 patients, more than half (52.5%) experienced vancomycin failure. Independent predictors of vancomycin failure in logistic regression included infective endocarditis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 4.55; 95% confidence interval, 2.26–9.15), nosocomial-acquired infection (AOR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.21–3.97), and initial vancomycin trough 1 mg/L by Etest (AOR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.09–2.49). With the use of Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis, patients with vancomycin area under the curve at 24 h (AUC(24h)) to MIC ratios 421 (61.2% vs 48.6%; p = 0.038).

- **Conclusions**: In light of the high failure rates associated with this antimicrobial, optimizing the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties is crucial.

### An evaluation of the incidence of nephrotoxicity following a loading dose of vancomycin in patients with severe renal impairment [^117SkzPr]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Loading doses of vancomycin assist in the rapid achievement of target trough concentrations. However, patients with renal dysfunction have been excluded from studies evaluating loading doses.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to investigate nephrotoxicity related to the initial vancomycin dose in patients with severe renal dysfunction.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of a large, academic health system. Adults were included if they received intravenous vancomycin in the emergency department and presented with creatinine clearance 20 mg/kg) vs. low (≤ 20 mg/kg) dose of vancomycin. Secondary outcomes included dialysis, vancomycin concentrations, length of stay, in-hospital mortality, and a composite outcome of nephrotoxicity or dialysis.

- **Results**: Of the 927 patients included in the analysis, nephrotoxicity occurred in 7.2% and 13.8% of patients in the high- and low-dose groups, respectively (p < 0.01). Patients in the high-dose group had a reduced risk of nephrotoxicity (relative risk 0.53; 95% confidence interval 0.35–0.78). The reduction in risk remained after fitting a generalized linear model adjusting for weight, age, sex, initial serum creatinine, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (relative risk 0.61; 95% confidence interval 0.39–0.93). Limitations of this study include its retrospective design and single-center population.

- **Conclusion**: These data suggest that vancomycin loading doses can be associated with a reduction in nephrotoxicity risk in this patient population.

### Optimizing vancomycin monitoring in pediatric patients [^116BXYWr]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Several studies have reported that trough levels may not be optimal for monitoring vancomycin therapy due to risks of overexposure and nephrotoxicity. Therefore, we developed a population pharmacokinetic model to optimize vancomycin dosing and monitoring in pediatrics.

- **Methods**: Data were retrospectively collected on 76 pediatric patients, aged 1–12 years, admitted to general pediatric wards or intensive care units at King Saud University Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The predictability of three methods for calculating the area under the curve (AUC) at steady state was assessed for optimum vancomycin therapy monitoring. The three methods were simple linear regression, Bayesian approach, and the two-sample pharmacokinetic equation method. We also used Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the dosing of vancomycin.

- **Results**: A one-compartment model adequately described the data. A strong correlation was observed between the observed and predicted AUC from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0–24h) calculated using the Bayesian approach with a trough sample only or pharmacokinetic equations based on two measured samples (R = 0.93 and 0.92, respectively). For the simple linear regression method with a trough sample only, the predicted AUC0–24h at steady state with vancomycin trough levels of 10, 15, and 20 µg/mL were 413, 548, and 714 µg·hour/mL, respectively. The target AUC0–24h above 400 was achieved in 46% and 95% of individuals with trough values of 7–11 and 11–15 µg/mL, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations indicated that doses of 60–80 mg/kg/day are needed to optimize vancomycin therapy.

- **Conclusions**: The study highlights the importance of optimizing vancomycin dosing and monitoring methods in pediatric patients to mitigate adverse effects and improve therapeutic outcomes.

### Prescribing habits of vancomycin in the emergency department: Are we dosing appropriately [^11297qj9]? The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

To prevent the development of bacterial resistance, guidelines recommend vancomycin dosages of 15–20 mg/kg based on actual body weight.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to determine if two community teaching emergency departments followed the new recommendations for a weight-based dosing regimen for vancomycin.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on the prescribing habits of vancomycin in the emergency department. During a 6-month period, 1,734 doses of vancomycin were dispensed, and a subsequent random sample of 240 doses was reviewed. Data collection included age, gender, weight, creatinine clearance, vancomycin dose, and indication for vancomycin therapy. Mean values, standard deviations, and ranges were computed to illustrate prescribing practices.

- **Results**: The mean vancomycin dose was 1,117 ± 325 mg. Based on actual body weight, the calculated mean dose was 14.6 ± 5.7 mg/kg. Only 19.6% (47 of 240) of all patients received an appropriate dose based on the recommended 15–20 mg/kg vancomycin dose.

- **Conclusions**: Our emergency department is inappropriately dosing vancomycin in the majority of patients. Educating clinicians regarding appropriate vancomycin dosing is recommended to achieve compliance with the latest consensus guidelines.

### Vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity: Grave concern or death by character assassination [^113ramNE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity was reported in 0% to 5% of patients in the 1980s. Numerous clinical trials have confirmed this by comparing novel anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus agents with vancomycin at the FDA-approved dosage of 1 g every 12 hours. Treatment failures of vancomycin in patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections have been reported despite in vitro susceptibility, leading to the use of vancomycin doses higher than those approved by the FDA. Higher doses are being administered to achieve goal vancomycin trough concentrations of 10 to 20 microg/mL, as recommended by several clinical practice guidelines endorsed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

Recent studies suggest that increased rates of nephrotoxicity are associated with aggressive vancomycin dosing. These increased rates are confounded by concomitant nephrotoxins, renal insufficiency, or changing hemodynamics. The studies also demonstrated that vancomycin's nephrotoxicity risk is minimal in patients without risk factors for nephrotoxicity. Clinicians unwilling to dose vancomycin in accordance with clinical practice guidelines should use an alternative agent because inadequate dosing increases the likelihood of selecting heteroresistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates.

### Vancomycin advanced therapeutic drug monitoring: Exercise in futility or virtuous endeavor to improve drug efficacy and safety [^117SAic6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is commonly prescribed to hospitalized patients. Decades of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic research culminated in recommendations to monitor the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to the minimum inhibitory concentration to optimize vancomycin exposure and minimize toxicity in the revised 2020 guidelines. These guideline recommendations are based on limited data without high-quality evidence and limitations in strength. Despite considerable effort placed on vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), clinicians should recognize that the majority of vancomycin use is empiric. Most patients prescribed empiric vancomycin do not require it beyond a few days. For these patients, AUC determinations during the initial days of vancomycin exposure are futile. This added workload may detract from high-level patient care activities. Loading doses likely achieve AUC targets, so AUC monitoring following a loading dose is largely unnecessary for broad application. The excessive vancomycin TDM for decades has been propagated with limitations in evidence, and it should raise caution on contemporary vancomycin TDM recommendations.

### An evaluation of the empirical vancomycin dosing guide in pediatric cardiology [^114uq3Hy]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Vancomycin MAG: Children with normal renal function are usually started on an initial dose of 40 mg/kg, divided every 6–8 hours for mild to moderate infections. The guide involves no loading dose for any patient. Based on the estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) using the bedside Schwartz equation, the interval of daily vancomycin dosing is selected. The goal trough concentration for treatment of general infections is 7–15 mg/L, and for severe infections, it is > 15–20 mg/dL. The guide also proposes a dosage adjustment based on the serum trough level, and the dosage interval is extended by two hours (i.e. every 6 hours is changed to every 8 hours) for supratherapeutic trough levels. However, if the child has a subtherapeutic reading, the dose is increased by 2.5 mg/kg per dose (i.e. 10 mg/kg is changed to 12.5 mg/kg). According to the MAG, serum trough levels are usually obtained 15–30 minutes before the fourth dose for patients receiving the drug at an interval less than 24 hours; otherwise, it is tested before the third dose if the dosing interval is 24 hours or longer. The level is repeated every 5–7 days after achieving the target level.

- **Data collection**: Data were collected using the hospital's electronic database where all patient records were checked daily for vancomycin orders. The baseline characteristics included sociodemographic variables such as weight, height, and gender. The clinical variables were comorbidities, type of cardiac lesion, concomitant nephrotoxic medications, the presence of fever, and laboratory values (i.e. WBC, platelets, ESR, CRP, culture, SCr, BUN). These values were recorded at baseline.

### An intervention to improve the timing of vancomycin levels [^113Vq2TM]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Blood samples for vancomycin levels are often drawn too early, leading to potential misinterpretation of results. However, only a few studies describe interventions to reduce mistimed vancomycin levels. We implemented an information technology (IT)-based intervention that provided educational instructions to nurses and determined the percentage of levels drawn too early for 27 months before (n = 6,291) and 14 months after (n = 3,608) the intervention. In addition, we conducted nurse interviews (n = 40) and dataset analysis to assess the root causes of mistimed levels.

The percentage of vancomycin timing errors decreased from 39% (2,438/6,291) to 32% (1,137/3,608), though in a time series analysis this decrease was not statistically significant (P = 0.64). Four common causes of mistimed levels were identified: (1) unclear provider orders, (2) scheduling levels to be drawn with morning laboratory tests, (3) lack of communication between providers, and (4) failure to adjust the blood draw in relation to the previous dose.

A real-time, IT-based intervention that links the timing of levels with medication administration might have a more substantial impact.

For the medical management of acute bacterial meningitis, specifically regarding antibiotic therapy, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2004 guidelines recommend maintaining serum vancomycin trough concentrations of approximately 15–20 mg/mL in patients receiving vancomycin for the treatment of meningitis.

### Continuous learning in model-informed precision dosing: A case study in pediatric dosing of vancomycin [^111hRoi2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

Vancomycin dosing guidelines emphasize the ratio of AUC over 24 hours to minimum inhibitory concentration as the primary PK/pharmacodynamic predictor of vancomycin activity. For optimal AUC‐guided MIPD, consideration must be given not only to the ability of a model to predict a trough level, but also to its ability to describe the full shape of a PK curve. Because the data available in this study were collected during routine clinical care and peak samples are not routinely collected at this institution, we were concerned that the continuous learning models, especially those implementing one‐compartment kinetics, would not be able to capture the full PK curve. Misspecification of the PK curve would result in erroneous and/or biased AUC estimates.

The gold standard for estimating AUC is noncompartmental analysis; however, this approach requires densely sampled serum concentrations. Instead, simulated "true" AUC estimates were compared with AUC estimates produced by each of the literature models and the continuous learning models. The Kloprogge model was selected for creating the simulated data set and simulated "true" AUC values because it was (i) a two‐compartment model, and vancomycin PK is most commonly found to be described by two compartments, (ii) developed in a more densely sampled data set than the other models under consideration (6.7 samples per patient), and (iii) described the patients in this population well. For clarity, the models developed in 50 patients have been excluded, because their predictions were less relevant.

### Prediction of vancomycin area under the curve with trough concentrations only: Performance evaluation of pediatric population pharmacokinetic models [^113QSPJu]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that has widespread use in the pediatric population, especially among critically ill patients. Over the past decade, multiresistant bacterial cultures, particularly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), have become endemic in pediatric intensive care units, leading to increased transmission and invasive hospital-acquired infections. Vancomycin is widely used for the prevention and treatment of MRSA infections in pediatric patients.

To ensure the efficacy and safety of vancomycin, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is essential. Illness-related pathophysiologic alterations cause changes in individual pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, making TDM particularly challenging in neonatal and pediatric patients. Inadequate vancomycin treatment may result in drug toxicity, often nephrotoxicity, or subtherapeutic exposure. The vancomycin PK/pharmacodynamic index for optimal exposure is the 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 24h) over the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the targeted pathogen (AUC 24h /MIC 1 mg/L). Until the 2020 consensus guideline, TDM based on vancomycin trough levels (10–15 mg/L) had been applied in some countries as the surrogate target accommodating adequate AUC 24h exposure. To improve antibiotic exposure and ultimately patient outcomes, the updated consensus review recommends calculating the AUC 24h and targeting it to 400 to 600 mg·h/L instead of dosing by trough levels.

Ideally, the vancomycin AUC 24h target of 400 to 600 mg·h/L should be obtained by maximum…

### Prediction of vancomycin area under the curve with trough concentrations only: Performance evaluation of pediatric population pharmacokinetic models [^113XQrqb]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

In pediatric patients, vancomycin plays a pivotal role in combating infections, necessitating precise therapeutic drug monitoring to ensure efficacy and safety. The adoption of model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) has demonstrated potential in optimizing dosing strategies based on the 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC24h). However, the predictive performance of population pharmacokinetic models using only trough concentrations to estimate AUC24h has not been evaluated.

- **Methods**: The predictive performance of 23 vancomycin population pharmacokinetic models was retrospectively evaluated in two cohorts: cohort A, 21 patients with postnatal age < 50 days; cohort B, 124 patients with postnatal age ≥ 50 days. Multiple scenarios were investigated using peak and trough concentration, peak concentration solely, trough concentration solely, or covariate information (a priori). The median AUC24h per patient across all models was used as the true AUC24h.

- **Results**: For both cohorts, the relative root mean square error (rRMSE) for the AUC24h precision based on trough concentrations was similar to the rRMSE based on a peak and trough sample. For cohort A, the models by Chen, Colin, and Mehrotra showed the best trough-based performance with the lowest relative bias (range, -3.3% to -2.6%) and rRMSE (range, 6.8%-7.3%). For cohort B, the models from Alsultan and Lv illustrated the lowest relative bias (range, 1.75% to -5.4%) and rRMSE (range, 16.6%-15.1%).

- **Conclusions**: This study illustrates that trough concentration-based AUC24h estimation is feasible.

### Describing vancomycin serum levels in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients: Are expected goals being met [^115rZ3cp]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Infections in intensive care units (ICU) are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. In the United States, infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) account for 8% of all hospital-acquired infections, and MRSA infections are associated with an estimated 18,650 deaths annually. In the pediatric population, MRSA infections are also associated with significant morbidity and hospital expenses.

The appropriate treatment for severe infections caused by S. aureus represents a significant challenge, as therapeutic failure can result in death. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic widely used for the treatment of severe infections caused by Gram-positive microorganisms, especially MRSA. It is currently considered the first choice for empirical therapy of these infections.

According to the consensus recommendations of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists, maintaining an area under the curve (AUC)/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio of > 400 is a suitable target for achieving a successful outcome in the treatment of MRSA infections. This pharmacodynamic target is considered the best predictor of microbiological and clinical outcomes when treating MRSA infections. However, the calculation of the AUC is clinically impractical. Trough serum concentration, measured shortly before the fourth dose, i.e. at steady state, with a value of 15–20 mg/L, is correlated with an AUC/MIC > 400 in adult patients with MRSA MIC < 1 mcg/mL.

### Desired vancomycin trough serum concentration for treating invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcal infections [^111QffFM]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Vancomycin area under the curve/minimal inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) > 400 best predicts the outcome when treating invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection; however, trough serum concentrations are used clinically to assess the appropriateness of dosing. We used pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation to examine the relationship between vancomycin trough values and AUC/MIC in children receiving vancomycin 15mg/kg every 6 hours and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MIC of 1 μg/mL. A trough of 7–10 μg/mL predicted achievement of AUC/MIC > 400 in > 90% of children.

### Implementation of a dose calculator for vancomycin to achieve target trough levels of 15–20 microg/mL in persons undergoing hemodialysis [^116cRbsd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is a key antibiotic for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections in patients undergoing dialysis. It has a narrow therapeutic range, where overdosing imposes a risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, whereas underdosing predisposes to treatment failure and the emergence of drug resistance. Trough levels of 15–20 μg/mL have been identified as the optimal target.

A multivariate model called the vancomycin dose calculator (VDC) was prospectively developed and validated to permit accurate vancomycin dosing in persons undergoing hemodialysis. The model identified three simple parameters responsible for 94.6% of the variance observed: predialysis vancomycin trough level, dry body weight, and period to the next dialysis session. Maintenance dosing was accurate in 77.9% of patients, while major over- and underdosing were avoided in the remaining patients. The mean measured trough level of 16.5 μg/mL was 5.6% lower than the mean predicted trough level of 17.5 μg/mL. With regard to loading doses, a fixed dose of 20 mg/kg led to subtherapeutic trough levels in half of the patients.

The VDC permits accurate vancomycin maintenance dosing based on predialysis trough level, dry body weight, and period to the next dialysis session in most patients undergoing hemodialysis. Higher loading doses that account for the period to the next dialysis may be more appropriate than the fixed loading doses used in this study.

### Describing vancomycin serum levels in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients: Are expected goals being met [^112C8zs6]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Two important factors that can hinder the serum concentration of antimicrobials are related to the increased volume of distribution and increased renal clearance caused by the intravenous administration of fluids and vasoactive drugs. Often, multiple conditions that can influence pharmacokinetics are present simultaneously, excessively complicating the prediction of adequate serum concentrations. Generally, conditions leading to a suboptimal dosage are prevalent. The volume of distribution describes the relationship between the dose and the resulting serum concentration, but in conditions where the volume of distribution is increased, a reduction in the drug's serum concentration is expected.

In our study, the positive fluid balance did not show any influence on vancomycin serum levels. In critically ill patients, alterations in physiopathologic conditions that lead to increased capillary permeability, formation of edema, vasodilation, and hypotension may result in pharmacokinetic alterations in many antibiotics. Additionally, measures taken to reverse this situation, such as administering large amounts of fluids, make it difficult to interpret the concentrations of vancomycin, the volume of distribution, and subsequently the degree of distribution throughout the tissue. As vancomycin is an antibiotic with hydrophilic qualities, the volume of distribution may be high, while plasma concentrations may be reduced. Katip et al. evaluated pharmacokinetic aspects of vancomycin in patients in the early stage of septic shock and verified that the clearance of vancomycin…

### Impact of source of infection and vancomycin auc0–24/micbmd targets on treatment failure in patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia [^112Zgmvk]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Despite recent controversies about toxicity and reduced efficacy, vancomycin remains the treatment of choice for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia. The parameter associated with treatment success is the vancomycin 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve to MIC ratio (AUC0–24/MIC). This study aimed to determine the utility of calculated AUCs and explore the optimal AUC0–24/MIC targets associated with treatment success.

In this single-centre retrospective observational cohort study of 127 patients with MRSA bacteraemia, forty-five patients (35.4%) did not respond to vancomycin treatment. Patient characteristics were essentially the same between those who did not respond to vancomycin treatment and those with treatment success.

- **Independent predictors of treatment failure**: The source of bacteraemia (odds ratio (OR), 4.29; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.50–12.26; p 0.007) and not achieving an AUC0–24/MICBMD (using broth microdilution) target of ≥ 398 (OR, 11.4; 95% CI, 4.57–28.46; p < 0.001) were identified as independent predictors of treatment failure.

- **Bacteraemic source-specific thresholds**: Higher AUC0–24/MICBMD targets were required for high-risk sources, such as infective endocarditis (target of 440), compared with 330 for low-risk sources, such as line-related bacteraemia.

Overall treatment success in patients with MRSA bacteraemia was associated with a vancomycin AUC0–24/MICBMD target of ≥ 398, with source-specific targets observed. Future vancomycin practice guidelines will need to take into account MIC methodology, source of bacteraemia, and patient populations prior to setting targets and monitoring recommendations.

### The association between vancomycin trough concentrations and acute kidney injury in the neonatal intensive care unit [^115GgVNk]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

There has been an ongoing debate on the dosage, frequency of administration, and the most appropriate monitoring of vancomycin therapy. Multiple factors influence the clearance of vancomycin, including gestational age, postnatal age, weight, renal tubular function, and creatinine levels. Historically, the area-under-the-curve concentration versus time to the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC:MIC) was accepted as the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic predictor of adequate treatment with vancomycin. An AUC:MIC greater than 400 has been recommended to achieve the desired antimicrobial effect in both adult and pediatric populations.

A consensus statement released by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists in 2009 recommended vancomycin as the first-choice drug for MRSA with MIC < 1. However, with increasing MICs, higher trough concentrations are recommended. In serious clinical infections such as endocarditis, meningitis, hospital-acquired pneumonia, bacteremia, and osteomyelitis, trough concentrations between 15–20 are recommended. These higher troughs allow for greater vancomycin exposure, a higher AUC, and the ability to reach the goal AUC:MIC ≥ 400.

### Optimal vancomycin AUC target in pediatric MRSA bacteremia: A Bayesian-guided approach [^115w7nNq]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is the most commonly used drug for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. The parameter associated with its therapeutic efficacy is the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). However, because of difficulties in directly measuring AUC, trough concentration (C trough) monitoring has been employed as a surrogate marker since 2009. Nonetheless, several studies have indicated that C trough does not consistently reflect AUC values and lacks a significant correlation with outcomes.

Moreover, a meta-analysis suggested that AUC monitoring may reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) compared with C trough measurement. The 2020 revised vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) guidelines recommend AUC monitoring and suggest using Bayesian software to estimate AUC. Bayesian-derived TDM can easily estimate AUC using the vancomycin population pharmacokinetic model and individual patient data.

Previous studies on adults with severe MRSA infections have recommended an AUC/MIC ≥ 400 mg·h/L as a therapeutic target, despite variations in AUC estimation methods and the inherent limitations of retrospective studies. Given the differences in clinical severity, prognosis, and physiological responses to vancomycin in pediatric patients with MRSA bacteremia compared with adults, it remains uncertain whether the AUC/MIC target recommended for adults can be directly extrapolated to the pediatric population. Two retrospective pediatric studies, in which the AUC was calculated using Bayesian estimations, have explored this issue.

### Should therapeutic drug monitoring based on the vancomycin area under the concentration-time curve be standard for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections?-No [^116MYdo4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

In this counterpoint, we critically appraise the evidence supporting therapeutic drug monitoring based on the vancomycin 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC24) for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. We reveal methodological weaknesses and inconsistencies in the data and suggest that, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence of benefit compared with modestly reducing trough targets, alternative strategies are more likely to result in superior safety and efficacy. These include focusing on fundamental antibiotic stewardship to limit vancomycin exposure overall, achieving earlier and more complete source control, and establishing alternative therapeutic options to vancomycin. Implementation of AUC24-based therapeutic drug monitoring will take resources away from these more promising, alternative solutions.

### Optimizing initial vancomycin dosing in burn patients [^111RsPiE]. Burns (2011). Low credibility.

Burned patients exhibit altered vancomycin pharmacokinetics, necessitating adjusted dosing. Unfortunately, published initial dosing recommendations targeting troughs of 15–20mg/L for this population are lacking. This study aimed to develop initial vancomycin dosing recommendations based on the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in acute burn patients.

A retrospective chart review of 49 vancomycin-treated burn patients was conducted. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters were determined, and Monte Carlo Simulation was employed to develop initial vancomycin dosing recommendations that target trough concentrations between 15 and 20mg/L.

The results indicated that vancomycin pharmacokinetic parameters significantly vary (p < 0.05) 14 days after burn. Monte Carlo simulation showed that the most commonly used empiric dosing regimen (1g iv q12 h) achieved targets with a probability of < 50% 14 days after burn.

This study provides initial vancomycin dosing recommendations for burn patients 48 h to 14 days post-burn and patients more than 14 days after burn. However, due to the heterogeneity in pharmacokinetics and the observation that vancomycin pharmacokinetics change over time post-burn, monitoring vancomycin serum concentrations is necessary.

### Cost-benefit analysis comparing trough, two-level AUC and Bayesian AUC dosing for vancomycin [^114YKAED]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Low credibility.

Area under the time-concentration curve (AUC)-guided dosing provides better estimates of exposure than vancomycin trough concentrations. Though clinical benefits have been reported, the costs of AUC-guided dosing are uncertain. The objective of this study was to quantify the costs of single-sample Bayesian or two-sample AUC strategies versus trough-guided dosing.

- **Methods**: A cost-benefit analysis from the institutional perspective was conducted using a decision tree to model the probabilities and costs of acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with vancomycin administered over 48 hours up to 21+ days. Costs included vancomycin concentrations, Bayesian software, and AKI hospitalization costs, and probabilities were obtained from primary literature. Robustness was assessed via both one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

- **Results**: In the base-case model, two-sample AUC versus trough dosing saved an average of US$ 846 per patient encounter, and single-sample Bayesian AUC versus trough dosing saved an average of US$ 2065 per patient encounter. This translates into annual cost-savings of US$ 846,810 and US$ 2,065,720 for two-sample and single-sample Bayesian methods versus trough dosing, respectively, assuming 1000 vancomycin-treated patients per year. Assuming a budget of US$ 100,000 per year for Bayesian software, an institution would need to treat ≥ 41 patients with vancomycin for at least 48 hours to break even.

- **Conclusions**: There are significant institutional cost benefits using two-sample AUC or single-sample Bayesian methods over trough dosing.

### An evaluation of the empirical vancomycin dosing guide in pediatric cardiology [^1118k2Ef]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Vancomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic used for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). An initial dose ranging between 40 and 60 mg/kg/day, divided every 6–8 hours, is usually sufficient and safe for most pediatric patients. The serum blood level, obtained at a steady state just before the fourth dose, is used as a robust pharmacodynamic marker to ensure drug safety and efficacy. A trough level ranging between 10 and 15 mg/L is often required for general indications, while a higher level ranging between 15 and 20 mg/L is recommended for more complicated infections.

Due to the emergence of bacterial tolerance and resistance, higher doses are currently prescribed to achieve the target vancomycin trough concentration (7–10 mg/L), a level desired for the majority of mild to moderate infections precipitated by MRSA. Major organizations, such as the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines, endorse a total daily dose (TDD) of 60–80 mg/kg for children younger than 12 years old and 60–70 mg/kg for children older than 12 years for MRSA strains with a MIC ≤ 1 mg/L.

### Recent changes in vancomycin use in renal failure [^116Edsz1]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is a key tool in the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections. A progressive increase in vancomycin resistance, with consequent treatment failure, has been observed in staphylococci. Therefore, new dosing guidelines advocating much higher vancomycin doses have been issued, proposing target trough levels of 15–20 microg/ml. Whether and how these targets can be achieved in patients with chronic kidney disease or those on dialysis are still under evaluation. The higher vancomycin doses needed to achieve these treatment targets carry a substantial risk for nephrotoxicity. This risk increases with higher trough levels and longer durations of vancomycin use. Critically ill patients, those receiving concomitant nephrotoxic agents, and patients with already compromised renal function are particularly at risk for vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity.

### Vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity in the critically ill: A retrospective multivariate regression analysis [^112U2Kiv]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

To evaluate the influence of vancomycin dose, serum trough concentration, and dosing strategy on the evolution of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients, a retrospective, single-center, observational study was conducted at the University Hospital ICU, Birmingham, UK. The study included all critically ill patients receiving vancomycin from December 1, 2004, to August 31, 2009, with no intervention.

The prevalence of new-onset nephrotoxicity was reported using risk, injury, failure, loss, and end-stage renal disease criteria. Independent factors predictive of nephrotoxicity were identified using logistic regression analysis. Complete data were available for 1,430 patients. Notable findings include:

- **Concomitant vasoactive therapy**: Odds ratio = 1.633; p < 0.001.
- **Median serum vancomycin concentration**: Odds ratio = 1.112; p < 0.001.
- **Duration of therapy**: Odds ratio = 1.041; p ≤ 0.001.

Intermittent infusion was associated with a significantly greater risk of nephrotoxicity than continuous infusion (odds ratio = 8.204; p ≤ 0.001).

In conclusion, higher serum vancomycin concentrations and longer therapy duration are independently associated with increased odds of nephrotoxicity. Furthermore, continuous infusion is linked to a decreased likelihood of nephrotoxicity compared with intermittent infusion. This large dataset supports the use of continuous infusion of vancomycin in critically ill patients.
