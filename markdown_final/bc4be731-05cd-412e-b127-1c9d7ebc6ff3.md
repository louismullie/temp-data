## Question

propofol triglycerides

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how propofol's triglyceride content affects lipid metabolism, monitoring, and management in critical care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formulation and lipid load from propofol. Then, I should verify the incidence and timing of hypertriglyceridemia across populations. Next, I will examine risk factors and pathophysiology, including PRIS and pancreatitis risk. After that, I need to check monitoring recommendations and thresholds. Then, I will review mitigation strategies, including alternatives and formulation choices. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and highlight special populations and knowledge gaps, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the formulation and lipid burden. Propofol is a 10% oil-in-water emulsion, and each milliliter delivers approximately 0.1 g of fat (about 1.1 kcal), so a propofol infusion at 50 mcg/kg/min in a 70 kg adult provides roughly 5 g/hour of lipid, which is clinically relevant when combined with parenteral nutrition or other lipid sources [^115ndMFV] [^11347uHW] [^112nJZp9] [^111godL2].

> I need to verify the incidence and timing of hypertriglyceridemia. In COVID-19 cohorts, hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 400 mg/dL) occurred in about 39% of patients after a median of 3.8 days and a median cumulative dose around 4,300 mg, with severe elevations ≥ 1000 mg/dL in about 2.8% and a median time to severe elevation near 10 days, which is earlier and at lower cumulative doses than reported in non-COVID populations [^113NHou6] [^115zHeYb]. In general ICU populations, older data suggest about 18% exceed 400 mg/dL and 4% exceed 1000 mg/dL, with a median time to elevation near 47 hours and substantial cumulative dosing, though risk varies by acuity and baseline lipids [^115zHeYb]. Even short-term pediatric sedation can raise triglycerides modestly without clinical pancreatitis, underscoring that duration and dose modulate risk [^112kB6HK] [^111BitHM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. I should review risk factors. Obesity consistently increases risk, with an odds ratio around 1.87 in COVID-19 cohorts, and higher illness severity, inflammation, and concurrent lipid sources further elevate risk. Critically ill patients often receive propofol alongside parenteral nutrition, which compounds the lipid load and impairs clearance, especially in inflammatory states that suppress lipoprotein lipase activity [^113NHou6] [^115QFjgF] [^114FpAVx]. I should also confirm that baseline hypertriglyceridemia and disorders of lipid metabolism are recognized cautions in labeling, reinforcing the need for vigilance in predisposed patients [^115ndMFV] [^11347uHW].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiology and downstream risks. The exogenous lipid load can exceed hepatic clearance capacity, leading to hypertriglyceridemia and, in severe cases, fat overload syndrome with lipemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and coagulopathy; additionally, propofol may impair mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, contributing to metabolic acidosis and organ dysfunction seen in PRIS, although hypertriglyceridemia is not itself diagnostic of PRIS and may be an epiphenomenon in some contexts [^113aDRbA] [^117YPy4b]. I should double-check pancreatitis risk: triglycerides above 500 mg/dL increase risk, and above 1000 mg/dL the risk rises substantially, though propofol-associated pancreatitis appears uncommon in modern cohorts, particularly when monitored and managed proactively [^115agAt5] [^115zHeYb].

> I will now examine monitoring recommendations and thresholds. Many clinicians monitor triglycerides every 2–3 days after 48 hours of propofol, with a pragmatic threshold of 400–500 mg/dL prompting dose reduction or discontinuation. The FDA advises monitoring in patients at risk of hyperlipidemia and adjusting therapy if fat clearance is inadequate, and parenteral nutrition guidance similarly recommends baseline and serial triglyceride checks when lipid emulsions are used, integrating propofol's lipid load into total lipid dosing decisions [^115Lf9Hj] [^115ndMFV] [^11347uHW] [^115QFjgF] [^112nJZp9] [^111godL2]. Wait, let me verify pediatric guidance: SCCM suggests that for children, limiting dose and duration mitigates PRIS risk and supports periodic labs including triglycerides during prolonged infusions, aligning with adult monitoring principles though thresholds are extrapolated [^115MGfdw].

> Let me consider mitigation strategies. First, dose and duration minimization is foundational. Keeping infusions at or below 50 mcg/kg/min and avoiding prolonged courses beyond 48–72 hours when possible reduces lipid exposure and PRIS risk, with pediatric guidance explicitly recommending less than 4 mg/kg/h and under 48 hours when feasible [^11172LH9] [^115agAt5] [^115MGfdw]. Second, I should confirm formulation effects: MCT/LCT propofol may reduce injection pain and has similar pharmacokinetics to LCT formulations, but does not eliminate triglyceride elevation with prolonged high-dose use; nonetheless, it remains a reasonable choice when available [^114t9uiL] [^115FZLw8]. Third, concurrent lipid reduction matters; coordinating with nutrition to reduce parenteral lipid dose or temporarily hold lipid emulsions can meaningfully decrease total lipid load while propofol is ongoing [^112nJZp9] [^111godL2]. Fourth, alternatives such as dexmedetomidine, benzodiazepines, or fospropofol disodium can be used when hypertriglyceridemia emerges or PRIS risk is high; fospropofol in particular avoids lipid emulsion and has shown smaller triglyceride increases than propofol in early trials, though onset is slower and data in critical illness are limited [^111iThkt] [^116pSYvo] [^114MmuSZ].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population or context. In COVID-19, hypertriglyceridemia occurs earlier and at lower cumulative doses, likely reflecting inflammatory dyslipidemia and impaired lipoprotein lipase activity; therefore, earlier and more frequent monitoring is prudent, and the threshold to adjust propofol should remain low if lipids rise quickly [^113NHou6] [^114FpAVx]. In pediatrics, short procedural sedation shows only modest, transient triglyceride increases, but prolonged ICU sedation carries PRIS risk, so strict adherence to dose and duration limits and vigilant lab monitoring are essential [^112kB6HK] [^115MGfdw]. In patients with baseline hypertriglyceridemia or pancreatitis history, I should confirm baseline lipids and consider alternative sedatives from the outset or at the first upward trend to avoid severe hypertriglyceridemia and its complications [^115ndMFV] [^11347uHW].

> I should double-check the practical, risk-stratified approach. For low-risk patients without obesity or baseline hypertriglyceridemia, obtain a baseline triglyceride and recheck within 2–3 days of continuous propofol, then every 3–5 days if stable. For high-risk patients (obesity, COVID-19, high-dose propofol, concurrent lipids), check at baseline and every 2–3 days thereafter, and consider earlier intervention if triglycerides approach 400 mg/dL. If triglycerides reach 400–500 mg/dL, reduce or discontinue propofol and reassess within 24–48 hours. If triglycerides exceed 1000 mg/dL, stop propofol immediately, evaluate for pancreatitis, and consider lipid-lowering strategies or plasmapheresis in severe cases while addressing alternative sedation needs [^115Lf9Hj] [^115QFjgF] [^115agAt5].

> Hold on, I should verify the key takeaways and ensure internal consistency. Propofol's lipid load is clinically meaningful in prolonged ICU use, especially when combined with other lipid sources. Hypertriglyceridemia is common but often manageable with proactive monitoring and dose limitation. PRIS is rare but serious and not reliably predicted by triglyceride level alone, so continuous clinical surveillance for acidosis, arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, and renal failure remains critical. Formulation choice and lipid-sparing strategies can mitigate but do not eliminate risk. And in COVID-19 and other hyperinflammatory states, earlier and more frequent monitoring is warranted due to altered lipid metabolism [^115ndMFV] [^113eLUQh] [^117YPy4b] [^113NHou6] [^114FpAVx].

Propofol is formulated in a **10% lipid emulsion** that delivers about 1.1 kcal/mL of fat [^115agAt5] [^115ndMFV], so prolonged or high-dose infusions can cause **hypertriglyceridemia** and, rarely, pancreatitis [^115zHeYb]. Risk rises with **doses > 50 mcg/kg/min**, **duration > 48 hours**, obesity, diabetes, or concurrent lipid nutrition [^113BAvyQ] [^112wQWNs] [^115QFjgF] [^115zHeYb]. Monitor triglycerides every 2–3 days after 48 hours [^115zHeYb] [^115Lf9Hj]; if > 400–500 mg/dL, reduce or stop propofol and consider alternatives [^115zHeYb]. MCT/LCT formulations may lower triglycerides but do not eliminate risk [^115FZLw8]. Management includes stopping propofol, treating pancreatitis if present, and using insulin/dextrose or plasmapheresis for severe hypertriglyceridemia [^notfound].

## Propofol formulation and triglyceride content

Propofol is a **lipid-soluble** agent delivered in a 10% oil-in-water emulsion containing long-chain triglycerides (soybean oil) [^1127S6g5], glycerol, and egg lecithin. Each milliliter provides ~0.1 g fat (1.1 kcal) [^115ndMFV], so prolonged infusions add substantial lipid load [^11347uHW].

---

## Clinical evidence of hypertriglyceridemia associated with propofol

Multiple studies and case reports document **propofol-associated hypertriglyceridemia**, particularly with prolonged or high-dose infusions:

- **Incidence**: 18–39% in ICU patients on propofol, with 4–12% > 1,000 mg/dL [^115zHeYb] [^113NHou6].
- **Risk factors**: Higher doses (> 50 mcg/kg/min), longer duration (> 48 h), obesity, diabetes, and concurrent lipid nutrition [^113BAvyQ] [^113NHou6] [^115QFjgF] [^111uHhj4].
- **Severity**: Levels > 1,000 mg/dL increase pancreatitis risk [^115agAt5].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Hypertriglyceridemia with propofol reflects both the **exogenous lipid load** from the emulsion and impaired clearance during critical illness [^1165Phm1] [^114FpAVx]. Inflammation and insulin resistance reduce lipoprotein lipase activity, worsening hypertriglyceridemia [^114FpAVx].

---

## Clinical significance and complications

Hypertriglyceridemia from propofol is not merely laboratory; it carries **clinically important risks**:

- **Pancreatitis**: Risk rises with triglycerides > 500 mg/dL and is high > 1,000 mg/dL [^115agAt5].
- **PRIS**: Associated with metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and organ failure, though triglycerides alone are not diagnostic [^113eLUQh] [^114FpAVx].
- **Fat overload syndrome**: Rare but serious, with hyperlipidemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and coagulopathy [^116Fx5aN].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

Given the risk, **structured monitoring and management** are essential:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Monitoring recommendations** | **Management strategies** |
|-|-|-|
| General ICU patients | - Baseline triglycerides <br/> - Then every 2–3 days after 48 h [^115Lf9Hj] | - Reduce dose or stop if > 400–500 mg/dL <br/> - Consider alternatives (dexmedetomidine, benzodiazepines) [^115zHeYb] |
| High-risk patients (obesity, diabetes, high-dose propofol) | - More frequent monitoring <br/> - Consider daily triglycerides | - Earlier intervention <br/> - Lower dose limits <br/> - Alternative sedatives [^117XEDzV] |
| Severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1,000 mg/dL) | - Immediate triglyceride measurement <br/> - Pancreatitis evaluation | - Stop propofol <br/> - Insulin/dextrose infusion <br/> - Plasmapheresis if refractory [^111MCVt2] |

## Alternative formulations and their impact on triglyceride levels

MCT/LCT formulations may reduce triglycerides compared with LCT but **do not eliminate risk**; hypertriglyceridemia still occurs with prolonged or high-dose use [^115zHeYb] [^1127S6g5].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **regular triglyceride monitoring** during prolonged propofol use, dose reduction or discontinuation if triglycerides rise, and consideration of alternatives in high-risk patients [^112zRenp] [^115MGfdw].

---

Propofol's lipid emulsion can cause **hypertriglyceridemia**, especially with prolonged or high-dose infusions; monitor triglycerides and intervene early to reduce pancreatitis and PRIS risk [^115ndMFV].

### Changes in concentrations of free propofol by modification of the solution [^113RDTD5]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Because free propofol is thought to be responsible for pain on injection, we investigated the changes in concentrations of free propofol by modifying two kinds of propofol products in a medium- and long-chain triglyceride (MCT/LCT) emulsion and in an LCT emulsion. The techniques used in this study were 1) mixing 2% lidocaine (10:1), 2) mixing 5% dextrose in acetated Ringer's solution to reduce pH (10:1), and 3) changing the temperature to 4 degrees, 20 degrees, and 36 degrees C. The propofol preparations were dialyzed for 24 h, and the receptor medium was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. The concentration of free propofol in propofol MCT/LCT was significantly smaller by 30% than that in propofol LCT. Neither mixing lidocaine nor cooling reduced the concentrations of free propofol in both products, but the concentrations were reduced by a decrease in pH and by an increase in temperature. Because mixing lidocaine can induce instability in an emulsion of propofol and warming can rapidly induce microbial growth, injection of lidocaine before propofol administration is recommended to reduce the pain on injection. The concentrations of free propofol in propofol MCT/LCT were significantly smaller (by approximately 30%-45%) than those in propofol LCT during any situation in this study.

Implications

Neither mixing lidocaine nor cooling reduced the concentrations of free propofol in both products but the concentrations were reduced by a decrease in pH and by an increase in temperature. Propofol medium- and long-chain triglycerides had significantly smaller concentrations by approximately 30%-45% than those in propofol long-chain triglycerides during any situation in this study.

Discussion

This is the largest study evaluating propofol use and safety in patients with COVID-19 and, to our knowledge, is also the largest study to date assessing the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia caused by propofol in a real-world setting. Given that patients with COVID-19 often have deeper sedation targets to facilitate comfort and ventilator synchrony during long-duration mechanical ventilation, it is important to elucidate the safety profile of propofol in this patient population.

Propofol is formulated in a phospholipid emulsion and may lead to hypertriglyceridemia with high doses or long-duration use. Elevated triglycerides in patients on propofol therapy have been associated with adverse sequelae, including acute pancreatitis. Although the evidence characterizing the relationship of hypertriglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis is scant, many clinicians use a triglyceride concentration of 400 to 500 mg/dL as a cutoff for using adjunctive or alternative sedative agents. Guidelines recommend monitoring triglyceride concentrations after 2 days of propofol infusion but not a threshold to prompt dose reduction or discontinuation. Interestingly, subsequent guidelines omit similar recommendations and do not provide further insight.

A 2005 retrospective cohort study found that 18% of patients on propofol therapy had elevated triglycerides of ≥ 400 mg/dL, and 4% of patients had a concentration ≥ 1000 mg/dL. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia-associated pancreatitis in the cohort was 1.9%. By comparison, the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia in our study was 38.9%, double the rate described by Devlin et al. Patients in our study were more critically ill (median APACHE II score, 27 vs 19) and had a longer ICU length of stay (33 vs 8.6 days). The propofol infusion rate upon hypertriglyceridemia diagnosis was similar at 50 µg/kg/min, but the cumulative dose at that time was substantially lower in our cohort (4307 vs 15 032 mg). Data on obesity, metabolic syndrome, and baseline triglyceride levels were not described in the study by Devlin et al, making it unclear if these contributed to the differences in hypertriglyceridemia seen in our cohort. Despite this, our data suggest that COVID-19 may lead to the development of hypertriglyceridemia more often and at lower cumulative doses, without an increased risk of acute pancreatitis.

### Sedation with GPI 15715, a water-soluble prodrug of propofol, using target-controlled infusion in volunteers [^112bUBd6]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

GPI 15715 is the first water-soluble propofol prodrug that has been studied in humans. Present propofol lipid formulations have well known undesirable properties, for example, pain on injection and increased triglyceride concentrations. We investigated whether GPI 15715 is suitable to achieve and maintain moderate sedation for 2 h. Six male and six female volunteers received a target-controlled infusion of GPI 15715, with an initial propofol target concentration of 1.8 microg/mL and the possibility to adjust the propofol target once after 1 h. Propofol concentrations, the bispectral index, and modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (MOAA/S) scores were monitored. The median MOAA/S score was 4 during the first hour and was 3 during the second hour of infusion. The propofol target had to be changed to 2.4 microg/mL in seven volunteers and to 3.0 microg/mL in two volunteers. A propofol concentration of 1.9 microg/mL had the highest probability to result in an MOAA/S score of 3, which corresponds with moderate sedation. We observed no serious side effects. We conclude that GPI 15715 produces excellent sedation.

### The safety of continuous infusion propofol in mechanically ventilated adults with coronavirus disease 2019 [^112ujpd1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study supports previously published evidence that propofol-associated acute pancreatitis is rare. - However, in response to hypertriglyceridemia, providers in our study often lowered the dose or discontinued propofol altogether and added or transitioned to an alternative sedative, often a benzodiazepine, to facilitate propofol weaning. Guidelines recommend minimizing benzodiazepines to improve short-term outcomes such as risk of delirium and shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay. Midazolam in particular has a context-sensitive half-life and can accumulate during continuous infusion even absent any organ dysfunction. Therefore, transitioning from continuous infusion propofol to a benzodiazepine may have deleterious effects.

Although awareness of PRIS has increased, there is no consensus definition because it is not fully understood and exceedingly difficult to diagnose and characterize. Lower dosage and shorter-duration propofol infusions have been recommended for risk mitigation, although it is unclear whether PRIS is preventable. Clinical manifestations remain nonspecific, especially so in COVID-19, because components of PRIS such as acute kidney injury and elevated liver enzyme concentrations are observed commonly in this patient population. The estimated incidence of PRIS is 1.1%, and mortality rates range from 18% to 48%. The pathophysiology of PRIS is believed to be a result of mitochondrial dysfunction. One study found that screening for CK < 5000 U/L eliminates the possibility for development of PRIS. Therefore, we selected a CK threshold of ≥ 5000 U/L as a prerequisite for possible PRIS in our study. EHRs of patients with CK ≥ 5000 U/L were rereviewed and demonstrated a 3.2% incidence of possible PRIS and, of those, a 7-day mortality rate of 25%. However, these data should not be conflated with the incidence and mortality of PRIS because several clinical features of this syndrome may also be present in severe COVID-19.

### Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of propofol in a medium-chain triglyceride emulsion [^1127S6g5]. Anesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Because propofol is water insoluble, current formulations of propofol use a soybean oil emulsion. These soybean emulsions cause elevated plasma triglycerides and support bacterial growth. This study compares an alternative formulation of propofol as a 2% emulsion in a medium-chain triglyceride solution (IDD-D Propofol) with Diprivan.

Methods

This double-blind, crossover, phase 1 study compared IDD-D Propofol with Diprivan using two consecutive protocols of 12 subjects each. Subjects in protocol 1 received a single bolus of 2.5 mg/kg, and those in protocol 2 received the same induction dose followed by a 30-min infusion at 0.2 mg. kg(-1).min(-1). Venous samples were taken for propofol concentration and biochemical measurements. Induction and emergence times were measured by termination of voluntary counting and responding to command, respectively.

Results

Plasma concentrations were not different between the two formulations. Induction time was 14% longer with IDD-D Propofol than with Diprivan (N = 24, protocols 1 and 2 combined, 53.3 ± 12.1 s and 46.9 ± 7.8 s, respectively; P = 0.002). Emergence time was not significantly different for protocol 1 but was marginally longer (P = 0.04) for IDD-D Propofol in protocol 2 (1,197 ± 445 s [n = 11] and 1,254 ± 468 s [n = 12], respectively). As expected because of the inherent characteristics of the formulations, plasma triglycerides were elevated for Diprivan but not for IDD-D Propofol; octanoate, a metabolite of medium-chain triglycerides, was elevated only with IDD-D Propofol. Octanoate was elevated to concentrations below those considered toxic. Plasma concentrations of other biochemical markers of medium-chain triglyceride metabolism, ketones, showed no significant changes. Interestingly, there were significant differences between male and female subjects in the propofol plasma concentrations and time to awakening with both drugs.

Conclusions

Differences between the two propofol formulations were slight and not clinically significant. Similar gender differences in plasma concentrations and awaking times were found for both formulations.

### Impact of fospropofol disodium on lipid metabolism and inflammatory response in patients with hyperlipidemia: a randomized trial [^114ybBR5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, compared with propofol, intravenous infusion of fospropofol disodium for more than 3 h during anesthesia can reduce the impact on lipid metabolism in patients with hyperlipidemia, and does not increase the level of inflammatory factors.

### Effects of short-term propofol administration on pancreatic enzymes and triglyceride levels in children [^112kB6HK]. Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

This prospective, clinical trial evaluated the effects of short-term propofol administration on triglyceride levels and serum pancreatic enzymes in children undergoing sedation for magnetic resonance imaging. Laboratory parameters of 40 children, mean age (SD; range) 67 (66; 4–178) months undergoing short-term sedation were assessed before and 4 h after having received propofol. Mean (SD) propofol loading dose was 2.2 (1.1) mg.kg(-1) followed by continuous propofol infusion of 6.9 (0.9) mg.kg(-1).h(-1). Serum lipase levels (p = 0.035) and serum triglyceride levels (p = 0.003) were raised significantly after propofol administration but remained within normal limits. No significant changes in serum pancreatic-amylase levels were seen (p = 0.127). In two (5%) children, pancreatic enzymes and in four (10%) children triglyceride levels were raised above normal limits; however, no child showed clinical symptoms of pancreatitis. We conclude that even short-term propofol administration with standard doses of propofol may have a significant effect on serum triglyceride and pancreatic enzyme levels in children.

### The performance of a target-controlled infusion of propofol in combination with remifentanil: a clinical investigation with two propofol formulations [^116DHmoF]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

Target-controlled infusion (TCI) incorporates the pharmacokinetic variables of an IV drug to facilitate safe and reliable administration. In this clinical study we investigated the performance of propofol TCI in combination with remifentanil. Fifty-four adult patients scheduled for general surgery lasting longer than 1 h received a combined TCI of propofol (Marsh parameter set; propofol randomly either dissolved with long- or middle-/long-chain triglycerides) and remifentanil. Arterial propofol plasma concentrations and hemodynamic and derived electroencephalogram variables were determined at various stages before, during, and after surgery. Measured propofol plasma concentrations exceeded the predicted values by 59%, and 48% when recalculated with the Schnider parameter set. Pharmacokinetic population analysis showed a small central volume of distribution (3.55 L) and reduced clearance (1.31 L/min) for propofol. ASA status and sex were the only variables that had a significant influence on propofol pharmacokinetics. In a second step, a new pharmacokinetic variable set for propofol was determined in the first 27 patients. Post hoc performance analysis of the remaining 27 patients showed improved accuracy using the new variable set. Our results show that when remifentanil and propofol are combined, the Marsh and Schnider parameter sets systematically underestimate propofol plasma concentrations. Presented, in part, at the Annual Meeting of the European Society of Anesthesiologists, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, June 1, 1999, and the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, Dallas, Texas, October 12, 1999.

### Propofol as a continuous infusion during cardiopulmonary bypass does not affect changes in serum free fatty acids [^116wJsK4]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

Perioperative myocardial infarction or ischaemia is a potential consequence of cardiac surgery and elevated free fatty acids can increase the severity of myocardial ischaemic damage. We investigated perioperative changes in serum free fatty acids, and other serum lipids, as a consequence of using propofol infusions for cardiac surgery during cardiopulmonary bypass. Twenty-five patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting were allocated to two groups. One group of 12 patients was given a continuous infusion of propofol and the other group of nine patients received intermittent boluses of midazolam as a hypnotic agent. Serum lipid concentrations were measured at four periods perioperatively. Changes in free fatty acid concentrations were similar between the two groups. Lipid concentrations related to triglyceride in the propofol group decreased on one occasion but subsequently returned to control value. On the other hand, such values in the midazolam group remained lower than control values. Propofol is not a contraindication as an anaesthetic for cardiac surgery in respect of concern regarding the effects of free fatty acids.

### Propofol infusion syndrome: a structured review of experimental studies and 153 published case reports [^115rR8a8]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our analysis of 153 published cases of PRIS shows that this syndrome, or at least its reflection in the medical literature, has changed over the last 24 years. A typical patient who died with PRIS in the early 1990s was a child with respiratory infection who developed PRIS after having received an excessive dose of propofol. Nowadays, PRIS is more likely to be seen in an adult or elderly patient sedated by a usual dose of propofol in an ICU in whom mild unexplained acidosis and elevation of creatine kinase is noted, sometimes with worsening of AKI and arrhythmia, but other features of PRIS are often missing. This may reflect a change of prescription habits, with more ICU patients exposed to propofol, but a smaller proportion of them exposed to dangerously high doses. Our multivariate analysis shows that, after adjustment for covariates, there are only a few independent predictors of death. The most important of these seems to be the cumulative dose of propofol, being represented by both mean infusion rate and the duration of infusion. Out of all the other features of PRIS, which seem to increase the probability of death in univariate analysis, only the presence of TBI and fever were significantly related to PRIS mortality after adjustment for other covariates. Other variables, most notably patient age, the presence of arrhythmia or other ECG changes, were eliminated from the model.

By studying the dependency of the frequency of PRIS signs on the rate and duration of propofol infusion we observed the following associations:
Dose-related signs of PRIS occur more frequently with higher infusion rates, irrespective of the duration of infusion. This includes cardiac failure, metabolic acidosis, fever, and perhaps hypotension. Of note, the first two tended to be more frequent in cases caused by a shorter duration of propofol infusion.
Signs of PRIS dependent on duration of infusion occur more frequently with longer propofol infusions irrespective of dose; arrhythmia and other ECG changes belong to this category, occurring more frequently in cases where a whole range of propofol doses were administered for more than 48 hours.
Signs of PRIS dependent on cumulative dose rise in frequency with both the dose and time of administration. Rhabdomyolysis and hypertriglyceridaemia represent this category and occur most frequently with high doses of propofol after 96 hours of administration.
"Idiosyncratic" signs of PRIS occur independently of the rate and duration of infusion. AKI and hepatomegaly belong to this category, even though the latter shows a trend to association with the cumulative dose.

These patterns may reflect the different pathophysiological mechanisms proposed to cause PRIS.

Propofol

Propofol is an agonist for GABA A receptors, resulting in hyperpolarization by increasing the duration of chloride channel opening/conductance by directly activating the chloride ionophore complex. This activation inhibits firing, thereby inducing sedation and anxiolysis. Of note, propofol binds at a different site of the GABA A receptor than benzodiazepines, and, hence, is often used in benzodiazepine refractory cases. Propofol also reduces glutamate activity, thereby preventing seizures, inhibits NMDA glutamate receptors, and is thought to inhibit other amino acids that may be upregulated in DTs. Propofol acts within seconds, duration of action is approximately 10 min, and has a short elimination half-life. Risks of propofol infusion include hypotension, the rare but potentially fatal propofol-related infusion syndrome, metabolic acidosis, and hypertriglyceridemia. Of note, barbiturates and propofol have similar effects on intracranial dynamics and cerebral activity. It is not clear if the increased duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital length of stay of patients treated with propofol is secondary to propofol itself or the severity of the withdrawal. Two, small, single-center studies demonstrated the efficacy of propofol in alleviating DTs, with one showing no difference in ventilator days, ICU days, or hospital length of stay between patients receiving benzodiazepines versus propofol. The ASAM guidelines recommend propofol in mechanically ventilated ICU patients with resistant alcohol withdrawal. Of note, higher induction doses of propofol are required in patients with AUD, with a recommended IV loading dose of 100 to 200 mg/hour.

### Propofol in a medium-and long-chain triglyceride emulsion: pharmacological characteristics and potential beneficial effects [^115FZLw8]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a possible unwanted effect during long-term propofol sedation while using a formulation containing long-chain triglycerides (LCT) from soybean oil. The use of propofol formulated in a solvent consisting of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and LCT might reduce the risk. Because a new solvent may affect the pharmacological profile of propofol, in this prospective, randomized, controlled, and double-blinded study we compared the pharmacodynamic and kinetic characteristics of propofol diluted in MCT/LCT fat solution with those of propofol formulated in LCT fat emulsion. In addition, serum triglyceride levels were measured during and after the administration of both drugs. Thirty patients likely to require mechanical ventilation over at least 48 h were randomized to receive either propofol 2% MCT/LCT (Group 1) or propofol 2% LCT (Group 2). Infusion rates of propofol (2.34 ± 0.83 mg. kg(-1). h(-1) in Group 1 versus 2.31 ± 0.6 mg. kg(-1). h(-1) in Group 2), the plasma propofol concentrations during infusion (0.95 ± 0.53 versus 0.98 ± 0.32 micro g/mL), and the concentrations and arousal behavior after discontinuation of the drug did not show significant differences. Plasma triglyceride concentrations during sedation did not differ between the groups, whereas there was a tendency toward a more rapid triglyceride elimination in Group 1 after termination of the propofol administration.

Implications

Propofol diluted in an emulsion of medium- and long chain-triglycerides shows equivalent pharmacological properties during long-term sedation compared with its hitherto well known formulation containing long-chain triglycerides only. In addition, potential favorable effects on the plasma triglyceride profile could be found.

### External validation of the modified Marsh and schnider models for medium-chain triglyceride propofol in target-controlled infusion anesthesia [^116JsHoZ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Propofol is the most widely-used intravenous anesthetic agent in contemporary medical practice. Traditionally, propofol has been formulated in a fat emulsion consisting of long-chain triglyceride (LCT). However, this formulation often leads to a high incidence of moderate to severe pain on injection. To solve this problem, a new formulation of propofol containing a combination of 50% medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) and 50% LCT was introduced. This MCT/LCT emulsion reduces the concentration of free propofol in the aqueous phase of the emulsion, which is associated with injection pain. Due to its advantage in causing less injection pain, MCT/LCT propofol has rapidly replaced LCT propofol.

Modifying the composition of the carrier emulsion for propofol might influence the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the drug. Some earlier studies indicated that the pharmacokinetic parameters calculated were not markedly different between LCT and MCT/LCT emulsion following a single intravenous injection or a short-term infusion in volunteers. Conversely, Le Guen et al. found that considerable differences in potency between propofol formulations could be observed during general anesthesia when using a target-controlled infusion (TCI) system for surgical patients. Different models might deliver different amounts of propofol. Most popular propofol models in the commercialized TCI pump system, such as the modified Marsh and Schnider models, were developed for LCT propofol, not MCT/LCT propofol. If there is a meaningful difference in TCI performance between LCT and MCT/LCT propofol, it may necessitate the development of a new model specifically for MCT/LCT propofol.

The predictive performance of a pharmacokinetic model refers to how accurately it can predict the plasma concentrations of a drug based on factors such as dosage, time since administration, and individual characteristics. Although the time course of propofol concentrations with limited aqueous solubility can be altered by changing the lipid emulsion formulation, there has been no investigation of the predictive performance of popular propofol models by directly measuring plasma concentrations in situations when MCT/LCT propofol is infused for a long-time anesthesia using TCI. Hence, it remains unclear whether the modified Marsh and Schnider models are suitable for TCI with MCT/LCT propofol. This research aimed to determine the predictive performances of the modified Marsh and Schnider models during general anesthesia with TCI using MCT/LCT propofol, without making a direct comparison between LCT and MCT/LCT propofol.

### The safety of continuous infusion propofol in mechanically ventilated adults with coronavirus disease 2019 [^112wQWNs]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion and Relevance

Hypertriglyceridemia occurred frequently in patients with COVID-19 critical illness who received continuous infusion propofol but did not lead to the development of acute pancreatitis. The only identified predisposing factor for hypertriglyceridemia was obesity. Elevated triglyceride concentrations occurred more often and at lower cumulative doses than reported previously in patients without COVID-19. PRIS was rare and challenging to diagnose but must be monitored carefully to aid in prompt recognition and intervention. Application of these data may aid in optimal monitoring for serious adverse effects of propofol used in patients with COVID-19.

### Evaluation of low-dose propofol preadministration to attenuate vascular pain during induction of anesthesia [^114xCCx6]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To determine whether a small dose of propofol before induction decreases pain with injection using two different formulas of propofol-10% long-chain triglycerides (LCT) and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and LCT.

Design

Prospective, randomized, comparative study.

Setting

University-affiliated hospital.

Patients

200 ASA physical status I and II patients.

Interventions

Group A (LCT control) and group B (MCT/LCT control) were first preadministered normal saline plus Intralipid (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) as a placebo, whereas group C (LCT study) and group D (MCT/LCT study) received each formulation of propofol 0.1 mg/kg before induction. After three minutes, groups A and C received LCT propofol two mg/kg for induction. Groups B and D received LCT/MCT propofol in the same manner.

Measurement

Pain was evaluated blindly at the time of both preadministration and induction, using a 4-point scale: 0 = no pain, 1 = mild pain, 2 = moderate pain, and 3 = severe pain.

Main Results

36 (72%) LCT and 31 (62%) LCT/MCT control group patients (groups A and B) had pain. Pretreatment with propofol (groups C and D) attenuated the frequency of pain significantly in 21 (42%) and 24 (48%) patients at induction, respectively.

Conclusion

Long-chain triglyceride and LCT/MCT propofol, 0.1 mg/kg administration before induction, resulted in attenuated pain at an induction dose of propofol.

Safety

There appeared to be a comparable incidence of TEAEs (80.2% vs. 81.0%, P = 1.000) and drug-related TEAEs (57.0% vs. 64.3%, P = 0.451) in the HSK3486 and propofol groups during the whole trial period. The severity for the majority of TEAEs was grade 1 or 2 and only one patient (HSK3486 group) had a secondary hypertriglyceridaemia exacerbation (grade 3) during the follow-up period, which was not related to HSK3486. There were no deaths, no serious AEs (SAEs) occurred, no requirement for dose adjustments or drug discontinuation because of TEAEs, or any patients withdrawing from the trial due to TEAEs.

Pain on injection and hypotension during induction were the most frequent drug-related TEAEs, with incidence of pain on injection being significantly lower in the HSK3486 group (8.1% vs. 21.4%, P = 0.046) (Table 3). Of note, the severity of the majority of injection site pain was mild, only 2 (2/9, 22.2%) patients in the propofol group presented with moderate pain (grade 2). The occurrence of drug-related hypotension (30.2% vs. 28.6, P = 1.000) and drug-related bradycardia (20.9% vs. 21.4% P = 1.000) during the maintenance were not statistically different between the two groups. Other drug-related TEAEs in the follow-up period including increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and a prolonged QT interval were very rare and self-curing.

Table 3
Summary of drug-related TEAEs termed by PT

Patients in the HSK3486 and propofol groups showed similar fluctuation trends in SBP, DBP, MAP, heart rate and oxygen saturation (SpO 2) during anaesthesia induction, intraoperatively and in the recovery period without significant differences (Figure 1, Supplemental Digital Content and Table 5, Supplemental Digital Content). The incidence of clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities was similar between the HSK3486 and propofol groups.

### Impact of fospropofol disodium on lipid metabolism and inflammatory response in patients with hyperlipidemia: a randomized trial [^111JZeo9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In recent years, the incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases related to hyperlipidemia has been on the rise, and perioperative hyperlipidemia can negatively impact postoperative outcomes. Elevated blood lipid levels can lead to atherosclerosis, subsequently inducing and exacerbating cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Factors such as perioperative anesthesia, surgical procedures, blood loss, and postoperative pain may intensify the stress response, increasing the body's release of stress hormones such as catecholamines, thyroid hormones, and glucagon. These hormones can counteract some effects of insulin, thereby enhancing lipolysis. Additionally, hyperlipidemia can alter the energy supply in patients, potentially leading to insulin resistance during the perioperative period. This can result in decreased glucose metabolism in tissues, leading to hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia.

Propofol has been widely utilized in clinical anesthesia and sedation due to its advantages, including rapid onset, effective sedation, quick recovery, and minimal side effects. As a short-acting intravenous anesthetic, propofol functions by inhibiting calcium channels and reducing calcium ion influx, which can, to some extent, offset the body's stress response. However, the side effects associated with intravenous infusion are significant. Propofol employs fat emulsion as a carrier, and prolonged infusion can lead to elevated blood lipid levels, with the triglyceride component in the emulsion being a key contributor to this increase. Previous studies have identified ApoA1 as an important anti-atherosclerotic factor, while ApoB is a recognized risk factor for atherosclerosis. The ApoB/ApoA1 ratio reflects the balance between and pro-atherosclerotic and anti-atherosclerotic factors in plasma. It serves as the most specific indicator for all ischemic events, superior the predictive value of ApoAl or ApoB alone. This study demonstrated that levels of TG, CHOL, LDL-C, ApoB, and the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio in the control group significantly increased after 3 h of continuous intravenous propofol infusion compared to preoperative values. Although these lipid metabolism indices showed a decreasing trend over time, they did not return to baseline levels 24 h post-surgery. This may be attributed to alterations in the enzyme system under stress, which can slow fat metabolism. Furthermore, the infusion of propofol exacerbates the body's fat load, leading to hyperlipidemia. In addition to propofol infusion, patients with hyperlipidemia may experience insulin resistance, which alters their energy supply and subsequently reduces triglyceride metabolism. Clinical studies have indicated that prolonged and continuous infusion of propofol in the ICU can cause hyperlipidemia and impair liver function, aligning with the findings of this study.

### The safety of continuous infusion propofol in mechanically ventilated adults with coronavirus disease 2019 [^113NHou6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background:

Propofol is commonly used to achieve ventilator synchrony in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet its safety in this patient population is unknown.

Objective:

To evaluate the safety, in particular the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia, of continuous infusion propofol in patients with COVID-19.

Methods:

This was a retrospective study at 1 academic medical center and 1 affiliated teaching hospital in New York City. Adult, critically ill patients with COVID-19 who received continuous infusion propofol were included. Patients who received propofol for < 12 hours, were transferred from an outside hospital while on mechanical ventilation, or did not have a triglyceride concentration obtained during the infusion were excluded.

Results:

A total of 252 patients were included. Hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglyceride concentration ≥ 400 mg/dL) occurred in 38.9% of patients after a median cumulative dose of 4307 mg (interquartile range [IQR], 2448–9431 mg). The median time to triglyceride elevation was 3.8 days (IQR, 1.9–9.1 days). In the multivariable regression analysis, obese patients had a significantly greater odds of hypertriglyceridemia (odds ratio = 1.87; 95% CI = 1.10, 3.21). There was no occurrence of acute pancreatitis. The incidence of possible propofol-related infusion syndrome was 3.2%.

Conclusion and Relevance:

Hypertriglyceridemia occurred frequently in patients with COVID-19 who received propofol but did not lead to acute pancreatitis. Elevated triglyceride concentrations occurred more often and at lower cumulative doses than previously reported in patients without COVID-19. Application of these data may aid in optimal monitoring for serious adverse effects of propofol in patients with COVID-19.

Propofol Administration at the Time of Hypertriglyceridemia. a

Comparing patients with or without hypertriglyceridemia, both groups had similar severity of illness, history of hyperlipidemia on admission, and hospital length of stay (Table 4), but there was a relationship between body mass index (BMI) and development of hypertriglyceridemia (P = 0.015), with a greater proportion of obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2) patients in the hypertriglyceridemia group. Although likely statistical coincidence, there was a significant relationship between discharge disposition and development of hypertriglyceridemia (P = 0.042), with more patients discharged home in the hypertriglyceridemia group. Although cumulative propofol dose, duration, and time to peak triglyceride concentrations were similar, patients with hypertriglyceridemia had a longer duration of high-dose propofol administration (≥ 50 µg/kg/min; 3.9 vs 3.0 days, P = 0.036).

Table 4.
Propofol Comparison With and Without Hypertriglyceridemia.

Pancreatic enzymes were not assessed routinely during propofol administration, but 61 (59.2%) patients had elevated concentrations when obtained. Providers checked pancreatic enzyme concentrations more frequently in those who developed hypertriglyceridemia (amylase: 23.5% vs 9.1%, P = 0.003; lipase: 53.1% vs 33.1%, P = 0.003). However, there was no difference in the incidence of elevated pancreatic enzyme concentrations. Although only 12 (19.7%) patients with elevated concentrations had imaging performed, there was no clinical or radiographic evidence of acute pancreatitis in any patient.

CK was checked frequently (at least once for 97.6% of patients), and 8 (3.2%) patients met our definition of possible PRIS, 4 of whom had hypertriglyceridemia. Six (75%) patients met at least 4 of our PRIS criteria in addition to CK ≥ 5000 U/L. The duration of propofol administration prior to CK elevation ranged from 2 to 17 days, and 5 (62.5%) patients received doses ≥ 40 µg/kg/min for > 48 hours. Two patients (25%) died within 7 days of the identified CK elevation. There was no association of hypertriglyceridemia and possible PRIS.

### Propofol-assisted deep extubation in the dental treatment of pediatrics: a randomized controlled triple-blind trial [^1149Cmcx]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric propofol administration raises safety concerns due to its association with propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS). The US Food and Drug Administration specifically cautions against extended propofol-mediated sedation to pediatric patients in intensive care settings due to the risk of PRIS. Japanese retrospective research identified heightened pediatric susceptibility to PRIS, attributable to elevated anesthetic propofol levels, slower metabolic clearance, and amplified lipid metabolism dependence compared with adults. The guidelines impose strict dosing thresholds (≤ 4 mg/kg/h) and 48-h administration limits for ventilator-dependent pediatric cases. The accumulative doses in our study meet that requirement. Importantly, epidemiologic evidence confirms the exceptional rarity of PRIS occurrences. PRIS surveillance requires vigilance for triad manifestations: intractable metabolic acidosis, pathognomonic ECG abnormalities, and myoglobinuria; with mandatory monitoring of acid–base balance and muscle injury biomarkers during prolonged high-dose infusions, prioritizing multimodal sedation strategies. Per our dental anesthesia protocol and international sedation and analgesia guideline, propofol should be titrated to desired endpoints in small, incremental doses.

### Effect of short-term propofol administration on pancreatic enzymes and lipid biochemistry in children between 1 month and 36 months [^111BitHM]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Use of propofol in pediatric age group has been marred by reports of its adverse effects like hypertriglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis, although a causal relation has not yet been established.

Objectives

This prospective, clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the effects of short-term propofol administration on serum lipid profile and serum pancreatic enzymes in children of ASA physical status I and II aged between 1 month and 36 months.

Methods

Anesthesia was induced with Propofol (1%) in the dose of 3 mg·kg(-1) intravenously and was maintained by propofol infusion (0.5%) at the rate of 12 mg·kg(-1·) h(-1) for the first 20 min and at 8 mg·kg(-1·) h(-1) thereafter. The mean dose of propofol administered was 12.02 ± 2.75 mg·kg(-1) (fat load of 120.2 ± 27.5 mg·kg(-1)). Lipid profile, serum amylase, and lipase were measured before induction of anesthesia, at 90 min, 4 h, and finally 24 h after induction.

Results

Serum lipase levels (P < 0.05), serum triglyceride levels (P < 0.05), and serum very low-density lipoproteins VLDL levels (P < 0.05) were raised significantly after propofol administration from baseline although remained within normal limits. Serum cholesterol levels and serum low-density lipoproteins LDL levels showed a statistically significant fall over 24 h. No significant changes in serum pancreatic amylase levels were seen (P > 0.05). None of the patients developed any clinical features of pancreatitis in the postoperative period.

Conclusion

We conclude that despite a small, transient increase in serum triglycerides and pancreatic enzymes, short-term propofol administration in recommended dosages in children of ASA status I and II aged between 1 month and 36 months does not produce any clinically significant effect on serum lipids and pancreatic enzymes.

### Impact of fospropofol disodium on lipid metabolism and inflammatory response in patients with hyperlipidemia: a randomized trial [^11436T9N]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Observed indicators

The levels of TG, CHOL, HDL-C, LDL-C, ApoA1, and ApoB were measured in 3 mL of venous blood collected from patients at four-time points: 1 day before surgery (T 0), 3 h after anesthesia induction (T 1), 4 h after surgery (T 2), and 24 h after surgery (T 3). C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were assessed using ELISA at T 0 and T 3, respectively. The effective sedation time during induction and the incidence of adverse reactions — including injection pain, hypotension, respiratory depression, nausea, and vomiting — were recorded for both groups. The effective sedation time was defined as the duration from the start of anesthetic drug administration to the loss of the eyelash reflex (by verbal response), while hypotension was characterized as a decrease in mean arterial pressure of more than 20% from the baseline level.

Statistical analysis

TG levels at 4 h post-operation were used as the primary evaluation index to calculate the sample size. Oztekin et al. reported that the plasma TG levels at 4 h after anesthesia induction and maintenance with propofol were significantly higher than baseline levels. Assuming that plasma TG levels in the propofol group were 125 ± 34 mg/dl at 4 h post-operation and 94 ± 39 mg/dl in the phosphate propofol disodium group (based on midazolam data), with α = 0.025, β = 0.2, and an optimality cut-off value of 12, the sample size calculation formula indicate that 57 participants are required for each group. Accounting for a 20% dropout rate, the minimum required sample size increases to 71 participants per group, or 142 in the two groups. As this is a multicenter clinical study carried out in 7 hospitals, the sample size is expanded 2.5-fold, resulting in 360 participants, with 180 in each group.

SPSS 25.0 software was utilized for the comparative analysis of the data. Measurement data that followed a normal distribution were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. For comparing indicators at different time points between the two groups, ANOVA and single-factor tests of repeated measures were employed. Paired t -tests were conducted for pairwise comparisons at different time points within each group, while independent sample t-tests were used for comparisons between groups. Categorical data were analyzed using the Chi-square test, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Sequential use of midazolam and dexmedetomidine for long-term sedation may reduce weaning time in selected critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients: a randomized controlled study [^114MmuSZ]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sedation is an essential component of care in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients, which should ideally control anxiety and agitation and provide amnesia while minimizing adverse effects. Current sedatives have different side-effect profiles and remain problematic in long-term sedation. Midazolam and propofol used to be the first-line agents for sedation in mechanically ventilated patients. Midazolam is a potent anxiolytic, hypnotic, and sedative with a drawback of unpredictable accumulation of its active metabolite, and midazolam can induce anterograde amnesia. Nevertheless, previous studies showed that midazolam used for long-term sedation in mechanically ventilated patients was associated with worse outcomes, including delayed recovery, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and possible development of delirium. Propofol, a sedative-hypnotic agent, was associated with a dose-dependent effect and faster recovery without accumulation. However, high dose or prolonged use of propofol may cause hypertriglyceridemia, uncommon fatal propofol infusion syndrome, respiratory drive depression, and hypotension because of systemic vasodilation.

Unlike other sedatives, dexmedetomidine — a highly selective central alpha-2 adrenergic agonist with both analgesic and sedative effects, notable for its ability to provide light sedation, analgesia, and physiologic-like sleep, as well as its minimal effect on respiratory drive — has been shown to result in a more awake and interactive patient, a lower incidence of delirium, fewer days on ventilator, and an earlier ICU discharge. However, previous studies reported dexmedetomidine was more applicable for light to moderate sedation than deep sedation despite the use of the maximum dose of dexmedetomidine (1.4 µg/kg/h) and was associated with markedly increased fentanyl needs in patients with RASS target − 3 or deeper; what's more, bradycardia and hypotension were more common with dexmedetomidine.

### Hemodynamic impact of cipepofol vs propofol during anesthesia induction in patients with severe aortic stenosis… [^116KWHYV]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance In this randomized clinical trial, cipepofol provided superior hemodynamic stability as an induction agent compared to propofol at equipotent doses and similar anesthesia depths for patients with AS. Therefore, cipepofol could serve as an alternative induction agent to propofol for patients at high cardiovascular risk. Compared with the propofol group, the cipepofol group exhibited a significantly smaller median AUC, representing a 35% reduction in AUC. This randomized clinical trial demonstrated that compared with propofol, cipepofol at an equipotent dose provided superior hemodynamic stability during anesthesia induction in patients undergoing TAVR, especially for older patients with severe aortic valve stenosis. Specifically, patients managed with cipepofol significantly reduced the AUC within the first 15 minutes postinduction.

The benefit of cipepofol did not seem to be due to compromised anesthesia depth, as there were no differences in the BIS index between the 2 groups within 15 minutes postinduction. This study offers more comprehensive insight into the role of cipepofol vs propofol in blood pressure management via a systematic evaluation of the area under the relative MAP curve. Unlike studies that focused solely on transient blood pressure fluctuations, this study examined the effects of cipepofol on blood pressure management throughout the entire induction period, using the AUC as a comprehensive indicator of hemodynamic instability. 26 The cipepofol group showed a 35% reduction in AUC compared to the propofol group, with a lower incidence of hypotension. The lowest mean MAPs were 66 mm Hg for cipepofol and 62 mm Hg for propofol. Incidences of postinduction hypertension and tachycardia were similar across groups.

These findings have clinical relevance, especially for older patients with aortic valve stenosis.

### Severe acquired hypertriglyceridemia following COVID-19 [^116KvULo]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

BACKGROUND

Severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride concentration > 10 mmol/L) is relatively rare and characterised by a markedly increased risk of (potentially lethal) pancreatitis. The pathogenesis of severe hypertriglyceridemia may reflect a lack of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) functionality due to pathogenic variants in the LPL gene and/or genes associated with LPL function or due to a combination of environmental factors such as alcohol consumption and medication use, co-morbidities leading to elevated triglycerides such as insulin resistance and hypothyroidism, and predisposing genetic variants associated with higher triglycerides. In addition, triglyceride concentrations of approximately 23 mmol/L have recently been observed in patients with COVID-19. These patients were treated with tocilizumab or propofol (lipid containing), which have both previously been reported to cause hypertriglyceridemia. In exceedingly rare cases, hypertriglyceridemia caused by an acquired LPL deficiency syndrome has been described associated with autoimmune diseases. Here, we report the first case of extreme hypertriglyceridemia due to a transient, severe reduction in LPL activity following an episode of COVID-19.

### Propofol infusion syndrome: a structured review of experimental studies and 153 published case reports [^115hZ4RQ]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

From the clinical perspective it is important to note that exceeding recommended doses of propofol is not only the main risk factor for the development of PRIS, but also that the probability that PRIS will be deadly also increases — at least among the published cases of PRIS. On the other hand, our analysis shows that PRIS can develop with doses well within the recommended safety limits and even after a relatively short duration of administration. In these situations some typical features are often missing, which can make the diagnosis challenging. For example, with doses < 4 mg/kg per hour the frequencies of hypertriglyceridaemia, fever, hepatomegaly and heart failure are < 5% in published cases of PRIS, while after short infusions of higher doses, ECG changes and arrhythmia may not be present and PRIS can be manifested as unexplained cardiac failure and metabolic acidosis. Propofol should automatically be suspected if any of the signs of PRIS appear without alternative explanation in an ICU patient on propofol infusion. There is no specific treatment for PRIS and the only way to prevent further deterioration and death is to recognize PRIS early and stop the infusion. Supplementation of co-enzyme Q may become a promising therapeutic strategy (a propofol "antidote") in the near future.

### Fatal accidental lipid overdose with intravenous composite lipid emulsion in a premature newborn: a case report [^116Fx5aN]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Our patient had received propofol, a molecule prepared in a lipid emulsion, for premedication before surfactant administration. His clinical course, and some pharmacological arguments, suggest that propofol administration probably had a negligible influence, if any, in the occurrence of clinical and laboratory symptoms. Pharmacodynamic data observed in neonates during laryngoscopy suggest respiratory and/or clinical recovery from sedation within 15–30 min in a large majority of infants after variable doses (1–2.5 mg/kg) of intravenous propofol. From a biological point of view, the administration of 1 mg/kg of propofol corresponds to a very low lipid intake, 5 mg of soybean oil, which cannot explain the very high serum triglyceride level observed 39–40 h after propofol administration.

Adverse events associated with ILE are infrequent and usually non-life-threatening, with the exception of patients at the extremes of age, particularly neonates and infants. Fat overload syndrome is characterized by an increase in triglyceride levels, associated with fever, cholestasis, hepatosplenomegaly, and coagulopathy. It has been reported in patients receiving ILE in high dosages and/or for extended periods of time. Another cause is accidental lipid overdose due to an excessive infusion rate. In the neonatal literature, four cases are reported with Intralipid 20%, a pure soybean oil emulsion. Medialipide is a 20% emulsion consisting of half medium-chain triglycerides and half soybean oil. Four other cases of overdose with this product following an administration error were identified both in the national pharmacovigilance database and VigiBase, including three premature newborns who presented mild and resolving symptoms after ILE had been stopped for some days. The most common symptom was hypertriglyceridaemia; transcient tachycardia and polypnoea were observed in one newborn. The last case involved a more extensive overdose in a 23-month-old male child with a severe pulmonary history. He rapidly presented a deterioration of the general condition with fever (39 °C), sweating, polypnoea, desaturation and acute respiratory distress, requiring transfer to a paediatric intensive care unit to provide respiratory support. The severe hypertriglyceridemia and the overall condition improved after 10 days.

### Incidence of propofol-related infusion syndrome in critically ill adults: a prospective, multicenter study [^114fL5NU]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

There are a number of potential limitations to our study. By not evaluating a control group of patients receiving a non-propofol sedation regimen(s), it remains unclear if the clinical symptoms of PRIS that were identified were truly a result of propofol therapy or related to some other manifestation of critical illness and thus our reported incidence of PRIS may be greater than what truly exists. The specific cause for each PRIS-associated clinical manifestation (e.g. unexplained metabolic acidosis) was not investigated (e.g. additional diagnostic testing) outside of that which would occur in routine clinical practice. The incidence of PRIS may have been higher than our reported value if laboratory monitoring was required to determine PRIS manifestations such as rhabdomyolysis and hypertriglyceridemia. Finally, we did not mandate the discontinuation of propofol as a part of the study when PRIS was detected and thus cannot reliably estimate the resolution of PRIS in these situations.

Sedation in the ICU

To facilitate mechanical ventilation in the ICU, sedative agents are often used (in large amounts). Although specific protocols for sedation and mechanical ventilation may reduce ICU length of stay and improve outcome, it has recently been reported that a daily interruption of sedation (wake-up call) did not reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, but increased the overall need for benzodiazepines and the workload of the nurses.

The most widely used sedatives in Europe are propofol and midazolam, often combined with opioids. A clinical trial in 60 patients showed that a combination of haloperidol and propofol reduced the occurrence of respiratory depression when compared with midazolam - propofol.

The role of dexmedetomidine for sedation of ICU patients was evaluated recently in two randomized controlled trials. The investigators reported that the latter agent shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation versus midazolam but was associated with more adverse effects.

With respect to long-term sedation, Theilen and colleagues compared the pharmacological characteristics of propofol in medium-chain and long-chain triglyceride emulsion. Thirty patients who required mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours received either propofol 2% medium-chain triglyceride/long-chain triglyceride or propofol 2% long-chain triglyceride, followed by measurements concerning propofol serum and plasma triglyceride levels. Interestingly, the medium-chain tryglyceride/long-chain triglyceride group was characterized by a faster elimination of the triglycerides post treatment. Another trial by Mesnil and colleagues compared the effects of inhaled sevoflurane with intravenous propofol and midazolam in 47 patients receiving sedation for at least 24 hours. The primary endpoints were wake-up times and extubation delay after termination of sedation. The patients allocated to the sevoflurane group showed significantly shorter wake-up time and extubation delay (P < 0.01) as compared with the intravenous groups. Similarly, the morphine consumption was lower, and no hallucination episodes occurred during the 24-hour post-extubation period in the sevoflurane group. The use of volatile agents in the ICU, however, requires a specialist medical device and trained staff.

### The safety of continuous infusion propofol in mechanically ventilated adults with coronavirus disease 2019 [^114FpAVx]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The triglyceride concentration alone should not be used as a monitoring parameter for PRIS because we could identify no correlation. This is consistent with a previous publication. Unfortunately, guidelines are silent as to recommendations for monitoring and treatment of PRIS. However, because of the prolonged, high doses of propofol administered to COVID-19 patients, providers should be mindful of the clinical manifestations of PRIS and the overlap with known COVID-19 manifestations and can monitor CK often to facilitate recognition and minimize morbidity.

There are other potential risks of using propofol in patients with COVID-19, specifically those who develop sHLH-like cytokine storm, because they may have elevated triglycerides at baseline. sHLH and COVID-19 critical illness can manifest similarly, possibly exacerbating the risk of propofol-related hypertriglyceridemia. A recent cross-sectional study demonstrated that high triglyceride concentrations were strong predictors of a severe course of COVID-19. The pathophysiology involves the overexpression of cytokines, and the inflammatory state produced during COVID-19 infection leads to significant changes in lipid metabolism, specifically affecting the lipoprotein lipase enzyme. This decreased enzyme activity results in decreased conversion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to low-density lipoprotein, which ultimately results in elevated triglyceride and decreased high-density lipoprotein concentrations. Another recent study described the dysregulation of lipid metabolism in patients with COVID-19. The authors found that patients with severe COVID-19 disease were more likely to have alterations in serum concentrations of lipids, including triglycerides, than those with mild or moderate disease. This has been described in other viral infections, and altered lipid metabolism ultimately leads to alterations in mitochondria homeostasis and energy production.

One studythat characterized patients with COVID-19 who received the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumabfor cytokine storm found that 29 patients (35.8%) experienced hypertriglyceridemia > 500 mg/dL, and of those patients, 8 (27.6%) did not receive propofol. Tocilizumab-related hypertriglyceridemia has not been reported previously. In our cohort, only 16.3% of patients received tocilizumab, and there was no difference in the development of hypertriglyceridemia in these patients. When all these data are considered, it is evident that there are multiple mechanisms that may lead to elevated triglycerides in patients with severe COVID-19. Given the retrospective nature of this study, the exact causes of hypertriglyceridemia seen in patients with COVID-19 are uncertain and cannot be solely attributed to propofol administration.

### Hypertriglyceridemia: a potential side effect of propofol sedation in critical illness [^115eYsKB]. Intensive Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hypertriglyceridemia (hyperTG) is common among intensive care unit (ICU) patients, but knowledge about hyperTG risk factors is scarce. The present study aims to identify risk factors favoring its development in patients requiring prolonged ICU treatment.

Methods

Prospective observational study in the medicosurgical ICU of a university teaching hospital. All consecutive patients staying ≥ 4 days were enrolled. Potential risk factors were recorded: pathology, energy intake, amount and type of nutritional lipids, intake of propofol, glucose intake, laboratory parameters, and drugs. Triglyceride (TG) levels were assessed three times weekly. Statistics was based on two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and linear regression with potential risk factors.

Results

Out of 1,301 consecutive admissions, 220 patients were eligible, of whom 99 (45%) presented hyperTG (triglycerides > 2 mmol/L). HyperTG patients were younger, heavier, with more brain injury and multiple trauma. Intake of propofol (mg/kg/h) and lipids' propofol had the highest correlation with plasma TG (r (2) = 0.28 and 0.26, respectively, both p < 0.001). Infection and inflammation were associated with development of hyperTG [C-reactive protein (CRP), r (2) = 0.19, p = 0.004]. No strong association could be found with nutritional lipids or other risk factors. Outcome was similar in normo- and hyperTG patients.

Conclusions

HyperTG is frequent in the ICU but is not associated with adverse outcome. Propofol and accompanying lipid emulsion are the strongest risk factors. Our results suggest that plasma TG should be monitored at least twice weekly in patients on propofol. The clinical consequences of propofol-related hyperTG should be investigated in further studies.

### Fospropofol disodium versus propofol for deep sedation in critically ill patients: a randomized pilot study [^116pSYvo]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Safety

At least one adverse event was identified in 39 (65.0%) cases, including 19 (63.3%) in the fospropofol disodium group and 20 (66.7%) in the propofol group. Since some patients experienced multiple adverse events, the total number of adverse event episodes may exceed the number of affected individuals. The most common adverse event was hypotension, with 18 cases (60.0%) in both groups (Table 3). There were no differences in the duration and dosage of vasopressors between the two groups (Table 2). Tadycardia occurred in two patients in the fospropofol disodium group and none in the propofol group. The sequential mean heart rate and mean arterial pressure were presented in Supplemental Figs. 4 and 5.

The triglyceride concentration at discontinuation was significantly higher in the propofol group than in the fospropofol disodium group, however, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia between the two groups (Table 3). No patients experienced propofol infusion syndrome, and there were no patients who withdrew from the study due to the occurrence of serious adverse events.

### The effects of propofol infusion on hepatic and pancreatic function and acid-base status in children undergoing craniotomy and receiving phenytoin [^113bLyJM]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In this study, we investigated the effects of propofol infusion on hepatic and pancreatic enzymes and acid-base status compared with baseline values in children undergoing craniotomy who were receiving phenytoin for antiepileptic prophylaxis.

Methods

In this prospective clinical study, we measured the serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), pancreatic amylase, lipase, and triglyceride levels of 30 children ranging from 4 to 12 yr. All children received propofol anesthesia and were taking phenytoin for antiepileptic prophylaxis. Patients already receiving phenytoin were continued on their medication. Peroral 5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) phenytoin was started in patients who were not receiving phenytoin. Serum AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, bilirubin, pancreatic amylase, lipase, and triglyceride levels were studied on admission to the hospital, 1 day before surgery, and on postoperative Days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Arterial blood gas samplings were taken after tracheal intubation, during the operation (2nd and 4th h), just after extubation, and 1, 2, 6, and 12 h after extubation.

Results

Serum AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, pancreatic amylase, lipase, and triglyceride levels were increased significantly in the postoperative period compared with baseline with a peak value on postoperative Day 1 and returned to normal values within a week. Base excess levels after extubation were significantly decreased compared with baseline. They were in the normal range, however, and returned to baseline values by 6 h after surgery. There were no clinical signs of hepatitis or pancreatitis. Bilirubin levels were normal. None of the children developed complications related to the liver or pancreas during the 4–6 mo after surgery.

Conclusions

Despite the slightly increased pancreatic and hepatic enzyme levels during the postoperative period, anesthesia maintenance with propofol in children undergoing craniotomy had no significant clinical effect on the acid-base status or pancreas or liver enzymes.

### Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling of propofol for long-term sedation in critically ill patients: a comparison between propofol 6% and propofol 1% [^112RSYwk]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

A population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model of propofol for long-term sedation in critically ill patients is described, because limited information is available in these patients. In the models the influence of time-independent covariates, in particular, the propofol formulation (propofol 6% versus propofol 1%), and of time-dependent covariates was investigated.

Methods

Twenty critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients received propofol formulated as propofol 6% (n = 10) or propofol 1% (n = 10) during a 2- to 5-day period. The level of sedation was assessed with the Ramsay 6-point scale. The data from a short-term sedation study in 24 patients after cardiac surgery were included. Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling was performed with NONMEM.

Results

The pharmacokinetics was adequately described by a 2-compartment model. The propofol formulation was not a significant covariate for the pharmacokinetics, whereas serum triglyceride concentration (TG) and relative body temperature (T(c)) were significant covariates for elimination clearance (CL). The population pharmacokinetic parameters were as follows: CL = 2.2 + 0.27 x T(c) - 0.049 x TG (mean, 2.1 L/min); volume of central compartment, 22.2 L; CL (distribution), 1.5 L/min; and volume of peripheral compartment, 168 L. The addition of other time-independent covariates (long-term versus short-term sedation study, as well as physiologic characteristics) or time-dependent covariates (duration of propofol infusion, additional midazolam rates, and hemodynamic parameters) to the model did not improve the quality of fit. For the pharmacodynamics, the probability that the sedation level was equal to, or more than, a specific score was described with the use of a sigmoid inverse logit of the maximal achievable probability model. The values for the inverse logit of the concentration causing half of the maximal effect for Ramsay sedation scores of 2 through 6 were 0.13 ± 0.09, 0.31 ± 0.17, 0.56 ± 0.24, 0.79 ± 0.31, and 1.78 ± 0.65 mg/L, respectively (population mean ± SE). Interindividual variability was high, with a coefficient of variation of 119% in the 50% effective concentration values. No covariates were identified.

Conclusions

The population models in critically ill patients showed no differences in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics between propofol 6% and propofol 1%. TG and T(c) appeared to be significant covariates for elimination clearance. For the pharmacodynamics, when propofol concentrations were between 0.75 and 1.5 mg/L, Ramsay sedation score 6 was most probable (40%-75%) and the probability for Ramsay sedation score 5 was 20% to 40%. Large pharmacodynamic variabilities were observed.

### Impact of fospropofol disodium on lipid metabolism and inflammatory response in patients with hyperlipidemia: a randomized trial [^1148gQgu]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study also indicates that fospropofol disodium has a longer onset time for sedation compared to propofol, along with a lower incidence of adverse reactions such as injection pain, hypotension, and respiratory depression. This prolonged sedation effect is likely due to the conversion of fospropofol disodium to propofol by alkaline phosphatase in vivo, which requires time to complete. During this conversion process, the instantaneous concentration of propofol is lower, contributing to the reduced incidence of adverse reactions.

The limitation of this study lies in its focus on immediate complications associated with anesthetic drugs, such as injection pain, respiratory depression, and hypotension. Long-term complications related to hyperlipidemia, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases or acute pancreatitis, were not assessed. Future research should aim to investigate these long-term outcomes to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the implications of anesthetic choices in patients with hyperlipidemia.

### Propofol [^111FrshP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.6	Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Sedation of Intubated, Mechanically Ventilated Adult Patients

In the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), propofol injectable emulsion can be administered to intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients to provide continuous sedation and control of stress responses only by persons skilled in the medical management of critically ill patients and trained in cardiovascular resuscitation and airway management.

Propofol injectable emulsion should be individualized according to the patient's condition and response, blood lipid profile, and vital signs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8, 5.9, and 5.10)]. For intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation should be initiated slowly with a continuous infusion in order to titrate to desired clinical effect and minimize hypotension. When indicated, initiation of sedation should begin at 5 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/hour). The infusion rate should be increased by increments of 5 mcg/kg/min to 10 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/hour to 0.6 mg/kg/hour) until the desired level of sedation is achieved. A minimum period of 5 minutes between adjustments should be allowed for onset of peak drug effect.

Most adult ICU patients recovering from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation will require maintenance rates of 5 mcg/kg/min to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/hour to 3 mg/kg/hour) titrated to desired level of clinical response. With medical ICU patients or patients who have recovered from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation, the rate of administration of 50 mcg/kg/min or higher may be required to achieve adequate sedation. These higher rates of administration may increase the likelihood of patients developing hypotension. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

### Attenuation of propofol tolerance conferred by remifentanil co-administration does not reduce propofol toxicity in rabbits under prolonged mechanical ventilation [^116Cb6ys]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Prolonged sedation with propofol at high doses may lead to fatal multi-organ dysfunction, know as propofol infusion syndrome. We tested the hypothesis that propofol plus remifentanil co-administration attenuates propofol tolerance to its sedative effect and assessed if such an effect has an impact on propofol toxicity in rabbits under prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Materials and Methods

Eighteen healthy male rabbits were mechanically ventilated and received propofol (group P, n = 6), propofol plus remifentanil (group PR, n = 6), or remifentanil plus sevoflurane (group RS, n = 6) in order to be kept under sedation (group P) or sedation/analgesia (groups PR and RS) for up to 48 h. Initial propofol and remifentanil infusion rates (IRs) were adjusted, if needed, to maintain the desired level of sedation and analgesia, respectively (groups P and PR). In group RS, remifentanil was infused at IRs equivalent to those of group PR. Propofol IRs were recorded, propofol concentrations were measured in the arterial plasma, and blood biochemical parameters and organ histopathology were assessed.

Results

Animals survived for 29–36 h in group P and 22–38 h in group PR (100% mortality rate). Tolerance was developed to propofol's sedative effect. The onset of tolerance was delayed and its magnitude was decreased in group PR compared with group P. Propofol was accumulated in the systemic circulation. Propofol clearance rate was gradually decreased. Arterial lactate, and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides, and creatine kinase (CK) levels were increased. The heart, lungs, liver, gallbladder, kidneys, urinary bladder, and skeletal muscles were seriously injured in groups P and PR. In group RS, mortality was 0%, while there was only mild injury of the lungs, liver, gallbladder, kidneys, and urinary bladder.

Conclusions

Although propofol tolerance is attenuated in propofol plus remifentanil receiving rabbits under prolonged mechanical ventilation, fatal multi-organ injury occurs resembling human propofol infusion syndrome.

### Impact of fospropofol disodium on lipid metabolism and inflammatory response in patients with hyperlipidemia: a randomized trial [^1174agyh]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study indicates that fospropofol disodium effectively reduces perioperative lipid metabolism disorders in patients with hyperlipidemia. Fospropofol disodium, a phosphate ester of propofol, exhibits good water solubility and does not require fat emulsion as a carrier, resulting in minimal impact on lipid metabolism during the perioperative period for these patients. As a water-soluble drug and a precursor to propofol, it is converted into propofol by alkaline phosphatase in the body, thereby producing its anesthetic effects. Once in the bloodstream, propofol crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds to GABAA receptors, enhancing chloride ion influx while reducing calcium ion flow, which inhibits the sedative effects on postsynaptic neurons. Notably, while levels of TG, CHOL, LDL-C, ApoB, and the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio in the treatment group were elevated compared to preoperative levels, the degree of increase was significantly less pronounced than in the control group, with values largely returning to baseline 24 h post-surgery. These findings suggest that fospropofol disodium has a minimal effect on perioperative lipid metabolism in hyperlipidemic patients and may offer a protective effect.

Propofol is known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant stress effects. Research has shown that it can inhibit the expression of interleukins and cyclooxygenase, thereby reducing oxidative stress and inflammation during the perioperative period, demonstrating its anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, CRP and IL-6 levels increased in both groups 24 h post-surgery, but no significant differences were observed between them. This increase may be attributed to factors such as anesthesia, surgical trauma, and postoperative pain.

Fospropofol disodium, which is converted to propofol by alkaline phosphatase in the body, shares a similar mechanism of action with propofol. Although fospropofol disodium has been modified to be a water-soluble preparation without the need for fatty emulsions, the lack of significant difference in inflammatory response between the two suggests that its anti-inflammatory effect is comparable to that of propofol, with minimal influence from its physical and chemical properties.

### Incidence of propofol-related infusion syndrome in critically ill adults: a prospective, multicenter study [^113eLUQh]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

While propofol is associated with an infusion syndrome (PRIS) that may cause death, the incidence of PRIS is unknown. Determining the incidence of PRIS and the frequency of PRIS-related clinical manifestations are key steps prior to the completion of any controlled studies investigating PRIS. This prospective, multicenter study sought to determine the incidence of PRIS and PRIS-related clinical manifestations in a large cohort of critically ill adults prescribed propofol.

Methods

Critically ill adults from 11 academic medical centers administered an infusion of propofol for 24 hours were monitored at baseline and then on a daily basis until propofol was discontinued for the presence of 11 different PRIS-associated clinical manifestations and risk factors derived from 83 published case reports of PRIS.

Results

Among 1017 patients [medical (35%), neurosurgical (25%)], PRIS (defined as metabolic acidosis plus cardiac dysfunction and 1 of: rhabdomyolysis, hypertriglyceridemia or renal failure occurring after the start of propofol therapy) developed in 11 (1.1%) patients an average of 3 (1–6) [median (range)] days after the start of propofol. While most (91%) of the patients who developed PRIS were receiving a vasopressor (80% initiated after the start of propofol therapy), few received a propofol dose > 83 mcg/kg/min (18%) or died (18%). Compared to the 1006 patients who did not develop PRIS, the APACHE II score (25 ± 6 vs 20 ± 7, P = 0.01) was greater in patients with PRIS but both the duration of propofol use (P = 0.43) and ICU length of stay (P = 0.82) were similar.

Conclusions

Despite using a conservative definition for PRIS, and only considering new-onset PRIS clinical manifestations, the incidence of PRIS slightly exceeds 1%. Future controlled studies focusing on evaluating whether propofol manifests the derangements of critical illness more frequently than other sedatives will need to be large. These studies should also investigate the mechanism(s) and risk factors for PRIS.

### The safety of continuous infusion propofol in mechanically ventilated adults with coronavirus disease 2019 [^117Nrz24]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 311 consecutive patients met inclusion criteria during the defined time period (Figure 1). In all, 59 patients were excluded as a result of either propofol administration for < 12 hours, no serum triglyceride concentration measured, or transfer from an outside hospital while on mechanical ventilation. The 252 patients included in the primary analysis were mostly male (71.8%), with a median age of 67 years (IQR, 58–74 years; Table 1). No patient received parenteral nutrition support during propofol infusion. The cohort had high acuity, with a median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score of 27 (IQR, 22–31)and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 12 (IQR, 10–13). The median ICU and hospital lengths of stay were 33 days (IQR, 16.8–60.3 days) and 38 days (IQR, 20–62.2 days), respectively. The mortality rate was 32.5%, and the majority of survivors were discharged to a medical facility.

Abbreviation: ICU, intensive care unit; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 19.

Table 1.
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics.

Hypertriglyceridemia occurred in 98 patients (38.9%) who received continuous infusion propofol (Table 2). The median time to elevated triglycerides was 3.8 days (IQR, 1.9–9.1 days), and the median total dose was 4307 mg (IQR, 2448–9432 mg; Table 3). Only 2.8% of patients had a serum triglyceride concentration ≥ 1000 mg/dL, which occurred at a median of 9.9 days (IQR, 7.9–19.7 days) from propofol initiation. The median infusion rate at the time hypertriglyceridemia was detected was 50 µg/kg/min (IQR, 40–60 µg/kg/min), and the incidences of decreasing or discontinuing the infusion within 24 hours were 35.7% and 16.3%, respectively. Adjunctive or alternative sedative agents were initiated in 26.5% of patients (eg, midazolam 46.1%, lorazepam 27%). Hypotension requiring vasopressor support within 6 hours after propofol initiation occurred in 11.1% of patients.

### The safety of continuous infusion propofol in mechanically ventilated adults with coronavirus disease 2019 [^1161yjYm]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Propofol is commonly used to achieve ventilator synchrony in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet its safety in this patient population is unknown.

Objective

To evaluate the safety, in particular the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia, of continuous infusion propofol in patients with COVID-19.

Methods

This was a retrospective study at 1 academic medical center and 1 affiliated teaching hospital in New York City. Adult, critically ill patients with COVID-19 who received continuous infusion propofol were included. Patients who received propofol for < 12 hours, were transferred from an outside hospital while on mechanical ventilation, or did not have a triglyceride concentration obtained during the infusion were excluded.

Results

A total of 252 patients were included. Hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglyceride concentration ≥ 400 mg/dL) occurred in 38.9% of patients after a median cumulative dose of 4307 mg (interquartile range [IQR], 2448–9431 mg). The median time to triglyceride elevation was 3.8 days (IQR, 1.9–9.1 days). In the multivariable regression analysis, obese patients had a significantly greater odds of hypertriglyceridemia (odds ratio = 1.87; 95% CI = 1.10, 3.21). There was no occurrence of acute pancreatitis. The incidence of possible propofol-related infusion syndrome was 3.2%.

Conclusion and Relevance

Hypertriglyceridemia occurred frequently in patients with COVID-19 who received propofol but did not lead to acute pancreatitis. Elevated triglyceride concentrations occurred more often and at lower cumulative doses than previously reported in patients without COVID-19. Application of these data may aid in optimal monitoring for serious adverse effects of propofol in patients with COVID-19.

P407 Concurrent use of propofol and clevidipine in critically ill patients: incidence of hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis

B Burbach, T Lam, J Jancik

Hennepin County Medical Center, Pharmacy, Minneapolis, United States

Introduction: Clevidipine (CLEV) and propofol (PROP) are lipid-based medications used in the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypertension and sedation, respectively. No data exists regarding potential adverse effects of concurrent therapy with this combination. This study aims to evaluate the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia (hTG) and pancreatitis in ICU patients using concurrent CLEV and PROP.

Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective chart review in patients utilizing CLEV and PROP concurrently from February 2015 to November 2018. Patients were included if they were 18 years and older, on CLEV and PROP concurrently for at least 24 hours with no more than 2 hours of interruption at a time, had at least one triglyceride (TG) level during concurrent therapy, and admitted to the medical or surgical ICU. The incidence of hTG (defined as TG equal to or greater than 500 mg/dL) and pancreatitis (provider assessment based on 2013 American College of Gastroenterology guidelines) was evaluated. Patients with and without hTG were compared to identify risk factors for the development of hTG.

Results: Of 145 patients screened, 30 patients were included which comprised 36 observations. The incidence of hTG was 13.9% with no patients developing pancreatitis. Patients with hTG had a higher median age compared to without hTG (64.5 vs. 38), p = 0.015. In patients with hTG the median dose of CLEV and PROP were 16 mg/h and 42.3 mcg/kg/min, respectively, which was higher but not statistically significant when compared to patients without hTG. Cumulative lipid load (g/kg/d) was non-significantly higher in patients with hTG (2.6 vs. 1.9), p = 0.599.

Conclusions: The incidence of hTG was comparable to what is cited in literature for PROP alone. Patients with hTG were older, had higher median CLEV and PROP doses, and a larger cumulative lipid load compared to patients without hTG.

### Propofol 6% as sedative in children under 2 years of age following major craniofacial surgery [^1157zDWi]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Background

After alarming reports concerning deaths after sedation with propofol, infusion of this drug was contraindicated by the US Food and Drug Administration in children < 18 yr receiving intensive care. We describe our experiences with propofol 6%, a new formula, during postoperative sedation in non-ventilated children following craniofacial surgery.

Methods

In a prospective cohort study, children admitted to the paediatric surgical intensive care unit following major craniofacial surgery were randomly allocated to sedation with propofol 6% or midazolam, if judged necessary on the basis of a COMFORT behaviour score. Exclusion criteria were respiratory infection, allergy for proteins, propofol or midazolam, hypertriglyceridaemia, familial hypercholesterolaemia or epilepsy. We assessed the safety of propofol 6% with triglycerides (TG) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels, blood gases and physiological parameters. Efficacy was assessed using the COMFORT behaviour scale, Visual Analogue Scale and Bispectral Index monitor.

Results

Twenty-two children were treated with propofol 6%, 23 were treated with midazolam and 10 other children did not need sedation. The median age was 10 (IQR 3–17) months in all groups. Median duration of infusion was 11 (range 6–18) h for propofol 6% and 14 (range 5–17) h for midazolam. TG levels remained normal and no metabolic acidosis or adverse events were observed during propofol or midazolam infusion. Four patients had increased CPK levels.

Conclusion

We did not encounter any problems using propofol 6% as a sedative in children with a median age of 10 (IQR 3–17) months, with dosages < 4 mg kg(-1) h(-1) during a median period of 11 (range 6–18) h.

2.3 Dosing Information

Dosing Considerations

Prior to administration of Omegaven, correct severe fluid and electrolyte disorders and measure serum triglycerides to establish a baseline level.
Initiate Omegaven dosing as soon as direct or conjugated bilirubin (DBil) levels are 2 mg/dL or greater in pediatric patients who are expected to be PN-dependent for at least 2 weeks.
The dosing of Omegaven depends on each patient's energy requirements, which may be influenced by age, body weight, tolerance, clinical status, and ability to metabolize and eliminate lipids.
When determining dose, take into account the energy supplied by dextrose and amino acids from PN, as well as energy from oral or enteral nutrition. Energy provided from lipid-based medications must also be taken into account (e.g., propofol).
Omegaven contains 0.15 to 0.30 mg/mL of dl-alpha-tocopherol. Take into account the amount of alpha-tocopherol in Omegaven when determining the need for additional supplementation of vitamin E.

Recommended Pediatric Dosing

The recommended nutritional requirements of fat and recommended dosage of Omegaven to meet those requirements for pediatric patients are provided in Table 1, along with recommendations for the initial and maximum infusion rates.
If hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides greater than 250 mg/dL in neonates and infants or greater than 400 mg/dL in older children) develops once Omegaven has been initiated at the recommended dosage, consider stopping the administration of Omegaven for 4 hours and obtain a repeat serum triglyceride level. Resume Omegaven based on new result as indicated.
In patients with elevated triglyceride levels, consider other reasons for hypertriglyceridemia (e.g., renal disease, other drugs). If triglycerides remain at elevated levels, consider a reduced dose of 0.5 g to 0.75 g/kg/day with an incremental increase to 1 g/kg/day.
Monitor triglyceride levels during treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.8)].
The recommended duration for infusion of Omegaven is between 8 and 24 hours, depending on the clinical situation.
Administer Omegaven until DBil levels are less than 2 mg/dL or until the patient no longer requires PN.

### Propofol anaesthesia and metabolic acidosis in children [^113zVei6]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2003). Low credibility.

Background

We aimed to investigate the effect of propofol infusion anaesthesia on acid-base status and liver and myocardial enzyme levels of children during short-term anaesthesia.

Methods

Thirty-six children, aged 3–12 years, were randomized into two groups. In group P (n = 18), induction and maintenance were performed with propofol, 3 mg x kg-1 and 20, 15 and 10 mg x kg-1 x h-1, respectively. In group H (n = 18) following induction with 5 mg x kg-1 thiopenthal, anaesthesia was maintained with 2–3% halothane. Blood samples were obtained following anaesthesia induction and 30, 60 and 120 min after discontinuation of anaesthesia.

Results

There was no difference in lactate dehydrogenase, myocardial creatininephosphokinase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and cholesterol levels between and within the groups. All postoperative triglyceride levels were higher and pH levels were lower in group P than group H (P < 0.05) and there was no difference within the groups.

Conclusions

In these healthy patients, short-term use of propofol did not result in significant acidaemia, nor alterations in hepatic or myocardial enzyme levels.

### Propofol injectable emulsion [^11347uHW]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.9 Risks of Propofol Infusion Syndrome in Patients with ICU Sedation

Use of propofol injectable emulsion infusions for both adult and pediatric ICU sedation has been associated with a constellation of metabolic derangements and organ system failures, referred to as Propofol Infusion Syndrome, that have resulted in death. The syndrome is characterized by severe metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, lipemia, rhabdomyolysis, hepatomegaly, renal failure, ECG changes (Coved ST segment elevation -similar to ECG changes of the Brugada syndrome) and/or cardiac failure.

The following appear to be major risk factors for the development of these events: decreased oxygen delivery to tissues; serious neurological injury and/or sepsis; high dosages of one or more of the following pharmacological agents: vasoconstrictors, steroids, inotropes and/or prolonged, high-dose infusions of propofol (> 5 mg/kg/hour for > 48 hours). The syndrome has also been reported following large-dose, short-term infusions during surgical anesthesia. In the setting of prolonged need for sedation, increasing propofol dose requirements to maintain a constant level of sedation, or onset of metabolic acidosis during administration of a propofol infusion, consideration should be given to using alternative means of sedation.

Prescribers should be alert to these events in patients with the above risk factors and immediately discontinue propofol when the above signs develop.

5.10 Risk of Elevations in Serum Triglycerides

Propofol injectable emulsion use requires caution when administered to patients with disorders of lipid metabolism such as primary hyperlipoproteinemia, diabetic hyperlipemia, and pancreatitis.

Since propofol injectable emulsion is formulated in an oil-in-water emulsion, elevations in serum triglycerides may occur when propofol injectable emulsion is administered for extended periods of time. Patients at risk of hyperlipidemia should be monitored for increases in serum triglycerides or serum turbidity. Administration of propofol injectable emulsion should be adjusted if fat is being inadequately cleared from the body. A reduction in the quantity of concurrently administered lipids is indicated to compensate for the amount of lipid infused as part of the propofol injectable emulsion formulation; 1 mL of propofol injectable emulsion contains approximately 0.1 g of fat (1.1 kcal).

### Propofol infusion syndrome: a structured literature review and analysis of published case reports [^117YPy4b]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Propofol infusion syndrome is a rare, potentially fatal condition first described in children in the 1990s and later reported in adults. We provide a narrative review of what is currently known about propofol infusion syndrome, including a structured analysis of all published case reports; child and adult cases were analysed separately as propofol is no longer used for long-term sedation in children. The review contains an update on current knowledge of the pathophysiology of this condition along with recommendations for its diagnosis, prevention, and management. We reviewed 108 publications documenting 168 cases of propofol infusion syndrome. We evaluated clinical features and analysed factors influencing mortality in child and adult cases using separate multivariate analysis models. We used separate multiple linear regression models to analyse relationships between cumulative dose of propofol and the number of features seen and organ systems involved. Lipidaemia, fever, and hepatomegaly occurred more frequently in children than in adults, whilst rhabdomyolysis and hyperkalaemia were more frequent in adults. Mortality from propofol infusion syndrome is independently associated with fever and hepatomegaly in children, and electrocardiogram changes, hypotension, hyperkalaemia, traumatic brain injury, and a mean propofol infusion rate > 5 mg kg -1 h -1 in adults. The cumulative dose of propofol was associated with an increased number of clinical features and the number of organ systems involved in adult cases only. Clinicians should consider propofol infusion syndrome in cases of unexplained metabolic acidosis, ECG changes, and rhabdomyolysis. We recommend early consideration of continuous haemofiltration in the management of propofol infusion syndrome.

### Effect of a 0.5% dilution of propofol on pain on injection during induction of anesthesia in children [^117M6okh]. Anesthesiology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pain on injection of propofol in children has been reported to be as high as 30–80%. The reason for the pain is assumed to be the aqueous phase of the propofol emulsion. Therefore, for the first time, this study tested the hypothesis that dilution of propofol to a 0.5% emulsion might reduce the incidence of pain during propofol injection.

Methods

The study design was prospective, monocenter, double-blind, and randomized. Sixty-four children aged 2–6 yr were scheduled to receive 0.5% or 1.0% propofol in a medium-chain-triglyceride/long-chain-triglyceride emulsion. Incidence and intensity of pain were assessed by spontaneous expressions of pain and withdrawal of the arm. In a subgroup of 21 children, serum triglyceride levels were measured before and 3 and 20 min after induction. Adverse events were recorded.

Results

Amounts of propofol required until loss of eyelash reflex were 4.40 ± 1.01 mg/kg for 0.5% propofol and 4.31 ± 0.86 mg/kg for 1.0% propofol. Percentages of children who showed at least one pain reaction were 23.3% in the 0.5% propofol group and 70.0% in the 1.0% propofol group (P < 0.001). Serum triglycerides were higher in the 0.5% propofol group 3 and 20 min after injection (251.7 vs. 148.8 mg/dl; P = 0.001 and 135.5 vs. 75.5 mg/dl; P = 0.03). Adverse events or complications did not occur.

Conclusions

Dilution of propofol to a 0.5% medium-chain-triglyceride/long-chain-triglyceride emulsion reduced pain effectively during injection in children aged 2–6 yr. Cumulative doses until 4–5 mg/kg propofol led to moderate increases of triglyceride levels and did not result in significant adverse events.

### The safety of continuous infusion propofol in mechanically ventilated adults with coronavirus disease 2019 [^1169WZpN]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

A recent study at the same institution found that 27.9% of patients developed triglyceride concentrations ≥ 400 mg/dL while on propofol, with a 1.5% incidence of acute pancreatitis. In this study, patients developed hypertriglyceridemia after a median of 47 hours (IQR, 16.3–73.5 hours) and received a median cumulative propofol dose of 21 800 mg (IQR, 9300–32 400 mg). This contrasts with our study because patients developed hypertriglyceridemia after a median of 3.8 days and received a median cumulative propofol dose of 11 700 mg in our cohort. The higher incidence of hypertriglyceridemia at lower cumulative doses suggests that COVID-19 may have an impact on the metabolism and utilization of triglycerides.

One small prospective observational study to date has compared propofol-associated hypertriglyceridemia in patients with and without COVID-19. Over a 7-day study period, the authors found that patients with COVID-19 had a higher incidence of triglyceride concentrations > 500 mg/dL (33% [n = 27] vs 4.3% [n = 23]; P = 0.014). After correcting for differences in total propofol doses administered, COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk for developing hypertriglyceridemia (OR = 5.97; 95% CI: 1.16, 59.57; P = 0.031). Of note, patients with COVID-19 had a greater median BMI, baseline triglyceride concentration, and multiple higher serum inflammatory markers (eg, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin). This further supports our hypothesis and findings that patients with COVID-19 are at a higher risk of developing of hypertriglyceridemia.

### Incidence of local anesthetic systemic toxicity in patients receiving bupivacaine infiltration analgesia for total joint arthroplasty under general anesthesia: a retrospective single-center study [^114bQPxd]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

We also investigated the influence of different maintained anesthetics on LIA-induced LAST. Although a previous EEG study found that sevoflurane might be epileptogenic at 1.5 and 2 minimum alveolar concentrations (MAC), a meta-analysis of clinical trials showed that sevoflurane- and propofol-maintained anesthesia had a comparable incidence of postoperative seizures. Our study revealed that patients receiving propofol infusion had a decreased incidence of seizures and tremors compared with those receiving sevoflurane inhalation. Although propofol is dissolved in a 10% MCT/LCT triglyceride solution, it cannot substitute for a 20% lipid emulsion for LAST resuscitation because of its strong cardio-depressive effect. An experimental piglet model demonstrated that propofol did not increase the time to cardiac arrest after bupivacaine infusion compared with sevoflurane. Combining our results with those previous studies, propofol infusion appears to merely mitigate LIA-induced CNS toxicity, but has no effect on CV toxicity compared to sevoflurane. This CNS-specific benefit of propofol might be attributed to its residual anticonvulsant effects during anesthesia emergence rather than a reduction in plasma LA concentrations.

The development of LAST is associated with the vascularity of the injection site, drug properties, LA dosage, volume, the presence of vasoconstrictors, the level of binding proteins such as albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein, and the patient's comorbidities. Populations identified as susceptible to LAST events include patients with extreme ages (neonates and elderly); pregnant women; individuals with renal diseases, cardiac diseases, and hepatic dysfunction; and those with lower levels of α1-acid glycoprotein. However, these documented risk factors have not been observed in our patients who developed severe or major LAST events. A possible explanation might be that awareness of these documented risk factors for LAST resulted in reduced bupivacaine doses, and thus fewer LAST events in these populations. Further pharmacokinetic studies to determine the plasma albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein concentrations and to stratify susceptible populations for LIA-induced LAST might be required to develop safer LIA strategy.

### The safety of continuous infusion propofol in mechanically ventilated adults with coronavirus disease 2019 [^115Lf9Hj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Based on this study, we offer several recommendations and considerations regarding the safety of propofol use in COVID-19. First, monitor triglyceride concentrations within 2 to 3 days of propofol initiation and every 2 to 3 days, especially for obese patients and those receiving high-dose propofol infusions. Second, a triglyceride threshold of 400 to 500 mg/dL to discontinue propofol may be liberalized given the low risk of acute pancreatitis seen in this cohort as well as other published studies. Third, consider obtaining CK concentrations every 2 to 3 days to monitor for PRIS, especially for prolonged, high-dose propofol infusions.

This study has several limitations, including its retrospective nature, which render our observations speculative. Most of the data were pulled from an IDR, which raises the possibility that the results may be confounded by missing data. However, data elements in question were reviewed manually to ensure accuracy as far as possible. For example, missing data points may have caused the APACHE II scores to be underestimated. Although implausible, there is a possibility of falsely elevated triglyceride concentrations if any blood specimens were obtained via blood specimen collection utilizing the infusion port assigned to propofol. Such an event is unlikely to be documented, although no specimens were noted to be grossly lipemic. Unfortunately, because of the retrospective design and difficulty obtaining an accurate medication history, lipid pharmacotherapy was not reported in these data. It is our policy to maintain home medications while admitted unless contraindicated. In response to the pandemic, our health system expanded ICU capacity substantially into alternative physical locations that utilized health care personnel with minimal formal critical care training. - Substantial effort was made to standardize protocols and communication among permanent and temporary ICUs. However, sedation practices, propofol utilization, and monitoring (eg, triglycerides, CK) varied among units, which may have led to selection bias as to laboratory monitoring. For example, 27 patients who were excluded from our analysis received propofol for a median 3.6 days but never had monitoring of triglyceride concentration. Further highlighting the need for education on the monitoring and toxicity of propofol, only 6 patients had a baseline triglyceride concentration drawn before propofol administration. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the direct impact of propofol on triglyceride concentrations. It is plausible that patients with severe COVID-19 have a higher risk for hypertriglyceridemia at baseline, and propofol administration may accentuate this risk. Moreover, only 12 (19.7%) patients with elevated pancreatic enzymes had follow-up imaging to assess the pancreas. Thus, the overall rate of acute pancreatitis may not be zero. Finally, some patients had propofol discontinued and restarted multiple times throughout their admission; quantified cumulative exposure may be inaccurate.

### Effects of postoperative sedation with propofol and midazolam on pancreatic function assessed by pancreatitis-associated protein [^114sgC3C]. Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

This prospective randomised controlled study evaluated the effects of postoperative sedation with propofol and midazolam on pancreatic function. We studied 42 intensive care unit patients undergoing elective major surgery who were expected to be sedated postoperatively. Patients were randomly assigned to a propofol group (n = 21) or a midazolam group (n = 21). To assess pancreatic function, the following parameters were measured: pancreatitis-associated protein, amylase, lipase, cholesterol and triglyceride prior to start of sedation on the intensive care unit, 4 h after the sedation was started and at the first postoperative day. Patients in the propofol group received on average (SD) 1292 (430) mg propofol and were sedated for 9.03 (4.26) h. The midazolam group received 92 (36) mg midazolam and were sedated for 8.81 (4.68) h. Plasma cholesterol concentrations did not differ significantly between groups. Triglyceride plasma levels 4 h after the start of infusion were significantly higher in the propofol group (140 (54) mg.dl(-1)) than the midazolam-treated patients (81 (29) mg.dl(-1)), but were within normal limits. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding amylase, lipase and pancreatitis-associated protein plasma concentrations at any time. No markers of pancreatic dysfunction were outside the normal range. We conclude that postoperative sedation with propofol induced a significant increase of serum triglyceride levels but that pancreatic function is unchanged with standard doses of propofol.

### Nutrition of the COVID-19 patient in the intensive care unit (ICU): a practical guidance [^112zRenp]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Refeeding syndrome (RS) and complications related to propofol use must be prevented

The RS is underestimated at ICU admission. COVID-19 patients are often vulnerable (old, polymorbid, malnourished, sarcopenic) and frequently unwell for 9–15 days, i.e. presenting fever, asthenia, lack of appetite, reduced food intake, leading to energy deficit before their ICU admission. These characteristics promote the risks of electrolyte imbalances (i.e. refeeding syndrome). We propose to detect/prevent the RS in older patients, those with polymorbidity, no/low food intake for > 5 days, preexisting malnutrition, and abnormal electrolytes due to diuretic treatment and dialysis. Plasma potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium should be measured within 6 h after nutrition support is started to detect and treat low values. For refeeding guideline, please refer to the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines.

Specific advices regarding patients under propofol should be stated here. All the sedative drugs, including propofol and benzodiazepines, have immunosuppressive effects. The "propofol infusion syndrome" (PRIS) is a rare complication observed when propofol is used for > 48 h and at high doses (> 4 mg/kg/h) and must be evoked in case of hemodynamic degradation or lactic acidosis without any other causative factor. The monitoring every 72 h of arterial gazometry, plasma lactate, creatine phosphokinase, and triglycerides allows anticipating the risk of PRIS and stop propofol. In the COVID-19, the cytokine storm could lead to hemophagocytosis that could itself increase plasma triglyceride, independently from propofol use. Plasma triglyceride monitoring at least every 72 h is advised in all ICU COVID-19 patients. Moreover, propofol doses should be controlled and alternative sedation should be used if the doses are too high or the treatment is prolonged. Large administration of omega-6 fatty acids is not recommended in the context of strong inflammatory response to virus load.

### Fospropofol disodium versus propofol for deep sedation in critically ill patients: a randomized pilot study [^111eWQna]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Efficacy

The percentages of time in the target RASS without rescue sedation were similar in both groups, 96.78% ± 0.07% in the fospropofol group and 98.43% ± 0.04% in the propofol group, p = 0.273 (Table 3). The infusion of fospropofol disodium and propofol yielded a total of 614 and 601 RASS evaluations, respectively. 595 (96.91%) of the observations in the fospropofol group fell into the target RASS range and 590 (98.17%) in the propofol group (Fig. 2). During the intervention period, the RASS score was−4.68 ± 0.40 with an NI value was 30.32 ± 8.84 in the fospropofol group and the RASS score was−4.72 ± 0.34 with an NI value of 29.21 ± 7.67 in the propofol group. And the sequential mean RASS scores and NI values in the two groups are shown in Supplemental Figs. 2 and 3. The majority of NI values fell into stages D and E, and most of the time there was a good alignment between NI values and RASS scores. The distribution of RASS scores and NI value was shown in Fig. 3.

### Impact of fospropofol disodium on lipid metabolism and inflammatory response in patients with hyperlipidemia: a randomized trial [^114TiU98]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aims to assess the impact of intravenous infusion of fospropofol disodium on lipid metabolism and the inflammatory response in individuals with hyperlipidemia.

Methods

A total of 360 preoperative individuals with hyperlipidemia were selected and randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the control group, with 180 participants in each group. The treatment group received an induction dose of fospropofol disodium at 10 mg/kg intravenously, followed by maintenance at a rate of 10 mg/(kg·h). The control group was administered propofol intravenously at 2 mg/kg for induction and maintained at 4 mg/(kg·h). All other medications were consistent between the two groups. Blood samples (3 mL of venous blood) were collected from patients at four-time points: 1 day before surgery (T 0), 3 h after anesthesia induction (T 1), 4 h post-surgery (T 2), and 24 h post-surgery (T3), to measure levels of triglycerides (TG), cholesterol (CHOL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), and apolipoprotein B (ApoB). C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were assessed at T 0 and T 3. Sedation onset time and adverse reactions were recorded for both groups.

Results

At T 0, the control group exhibited increased TG, CHOL, LDL-C, ApoB, and the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio, while the ApoA1 level had decreased. The LDL-C level and the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio showed significant increases (P < 0.01). Both groups showed elevated CRP and IL-6 levels at T 3 (P < 0.01). Compared to the control group, the treatment group demonstrated reduced levels of TG, CHOL, LDL-C, ApoB, and the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio at T 1 -T 3, while ApoA1 levels were higher at T1-T2 (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). The sedation onset time was notably longer in the treatment group, and the incidence of injection-related pain, respiratory depression, hypotension, and other adverse reactions was significantly lower (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

Compared with propofol, intravenous infusion of fospropofol disodium for more than 3 h during anesthesia has lesser impact on lipid metabolism in patients with hyperlipidemia and does not increase inflammatory factors levels.

### Pain on injection of lipid-free propofol and propofol emulsion containing medium-chain triglyceride: a comparative study [^115RkwJv]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Pain on injection of propofol continues to be a problem for anesthesiologists. A lipid-free formulation of propofol and a propofol emulsion containing medium-chain triglyceride have become available in the Indian market. We performed this study to assess the pain on injection of propofol emulsion containing medium-chain triglyceride as the lipid carrier and lipid-free propofol formulation. One-hundred-thirty adult patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group I received propofol emulsion containing medium-chain triglyceride and Group II received lipid-free propofol. One fourth of the total calculated induction dose was injected over 5 s in the largest vein on the dorsum of a hand. Pain was assessed using verbal response and behavioral signs. Both formulations caused pain on injection. However, the lipid-free propofol solution produced frequent (89%) and severe pain on injection compared with the emulsion containing medium-chain triglyceride (40%).

Implications

Pain on injection of two formulations of propofol was compared. A lipid-free formulation produced more pain on injection as compared with the emulsion containing medium-chain triglyceride.

### Preventing pain during injection of propofol: effects of a new emulsion with lidocaine addition [^1116GQDJ]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Previous studies found that lidocaine addition to propofol long-chain triglyceride was associated with a lower incidence of injection pain than medium-chain triglyceride/long-chain triglyceride formulation, but the incidence was still high (31–40%). Our study investigated whether the incidence of injection pain could be further reduced by the addition of lidocaine (10 mg, 20:1) to propofol medium-chain triglyceride/long-chain triglyceride.

Methods

In a randomized double-blind controlled trial 464 patients scheduled to undergo regional anaesthesia were assigned to receive one of the following four options: propofol medium-chain triglyceride/long-chain triglyceride + lidocaine, propofol long-chain triglyceride + lidocaine, propofol medium-chain triglyceride/long-chain triglyceride or propofol long-chain triglyceride. Propofol was injected to reach grade 3 of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale.

Results

Incidence of injection pain was 18% in the propofol medium-chain triglyceride/long-chain triglyceride + lidocaine group, 31% in the propofol long-chain triglyceride + lidocaine group, 47% in the propofol medium-chain triglyceride/long-chain triglyceride group and 60% in the long-chain triglyceride group. Propofol medium-chain triglyceride/long-chain triglyceride + lidocaine was associated with a statistically significant reduced incidence of injection pain compared with propofol long-chain triglyceride +lidocaine (P = 0.0249, number needed to treat = 7.7).

Conclusions

Premixing propofol medium-chain triglyceride/long-chain triglyceride with lidocaine is one of the most effective measures currently available to reduce the incidence of injection pain in sedated patients during regional anaesthesia.

### Fospropofol disodium versus propofol for deep sedation in critically ill patients: a randomized pilot study [^115X7pGz]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary outcome and secondary outcome

The primary outcome was the percentage of time in the target sedation range without rescue sedation (defined as the percentage of the RASS evaluations in the target sedation range). The Secondary outcomes included ventilator-free hours within 7 days, ventilator-free hours within 28 days, successful extubation, length of ICU stay within 28 days, 28-day all-cause mortality and adverse events.

Safety evaluation

Safety was assessed based on the treatment of adverse events, physical exams, clinical lab tests, vital sign monitoring, and ECG assessments. Adverse events mainly focused on compromised hemodynamics, including hypotension, and bradycardia. Moreover, we also assessed the incidence of propofol infusion syndrome, and hypertriglyceridemia.

Hypotension was defined as a decrease of mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 20% from baseline, or a MAP below 60 mmHg; bradycardia was defined as a decrease of heart rate (HR) greater than 20% from baseline or less than 50 beats per minute; propofol infusion syndrome was defined as one or more of otherwise unexplained metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, or ECG changes, with or without acute kidney injury, hyperkalaemia, lipidaemia, cardiac failure, fever, elevated liver enzymes or raised lactate when critically ill patients receive propofol infusions, typically either high dose (> 5 mg/kg/h) or of long duration (> 48 h). And blood samples were taken before and after medication for all patients to test serum triglyceride concentration. Hypertriglyceridemia included mild, moderate and severe hypertriglyceridemia with the diagnostic criteria of serum triglyceride concentration between 1.7 and 2.3 mmol/L, between 2.3 and 11.2 mmol/L and above 11.2 mmol/L, respectively.

### Efficacy and safety of remimazolam tosilate versus propofol in patients undergoing day surgery: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^114fPXhW]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Prior reports suggested that propofol reduces the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and exerts a neuroprotective effect by maintaining Th17/Treg cell balance. Upregulation of CD11 and CD18 on the surface of neutrophils is an important marker of the inflammatory response. Hence, inflammatory factors and the expression of CD11b/CD18 for neutrophils and CD39/CD73 for Tregs were measured in this study. No significant differences were detected in either set of surface markers between the three groups, suggesting that RT may have a similar effect on the patient's inflammatory profile compared with propofol. A prior work suggested that propofol induces marked changes in lipid profile and a modest increase in total TG. In the present study, increased TG expression after anesthesia was observed in the propofol group but not the RT groups.

This study has several limitations. First, because the present study is limited to patients who underwent day surgery with an LMA, the efficacy and safety of RT during procedures that require intubation may be different. Second, NPY was detected before PACU discharge in this study when patients might fully recover from sleep inhibition. Changes in NPY are suggested to be detected before, during and after the procedures in the future study. Third, propofol and RT may reach different levels of anesthesia depth according to the BIS values. The depth of anesthesia may affect the hemodynamic stability and the recovery time. However, BIS monitoring may not properly reflect the depth of anesthesia with remimazolam. Appropriate ranges of BIS and alternative methods to monitor the depth of RT anesthesia need more researches. Fourth, due to limited experience with the drug, the optimal induction dose and the recovery profile of RT still need to be explored. Anesthesiologists need more experience with RT to its full advantage and initiate tapering off early enough to allow for the fastest recovery. Lastly, patients over 75 years old and above ASA II were not included in this study. Hence, the efficacy and safety of RT and flumazenil in older patients and those with comorbidities requires further study. Larger trials with a more vulnerable patient population are needed before RT can be recommended for general use.

The primary outcome was the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia defined as any triglyceride concentration of ≥ 400 mg/dL after propofol initiation. Additionally, we characterized the relationships among triglyceride concentrations and propofol dose and duration, the need for vasopressor therapy within 6 hours of propofol initiation, and the incidences of acute pancreatitis and possible PRIS. In patients with hypertriglyceridemia, the incidences of propofol infusion rate reduction and discontinuation were recorded, along with addition of adjunctive or alternative agents within 24 hours of dose reduction/discontinuation. A reduction in propofol rate was considered clinically meaningful if the reduction was by at least 20 µg/kg/min or at least 50% lower than the rate when hypertriglyceridemia was discovered. Adjunctive or alternative agents included chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, dexmedetomidine, olanzapine, quetiapine, oxycodone, and methadone. Acute pancreatitis was defined as elevated pancreatic enzymes in serum (eg, amylase, lipase) and abdominal computed tomography with findings consistent with acute pancreatitis (eg, pancreatic edema or infarction, peripancreatic fluid collection[s]). - Elevated pancreatic enzymes were defined as a serum amylase concentration ≥ 125 IU/L or serum lipase concentration ≥ 60 IU/L.

All patients with an elevated creatinine kinase (CK) concentration (≥ 5000 U/L) were evaluated for PRIS. Given that myositis is a clinical feature of COVID-19, the lack of diagnostic specificity, the nonspecific clinical presentation of PRIS, and lack of a standard definition, patients were considered to have "possible" PRIS if they had an elevated CK concentration and at least 2 of the following while receiving propofol: anion gap metabolic acidosis, serum lactate concentration ≥ 4 mmol/L, serum potassium concentration ≥ 5.5 mEq/L, acute bradyarrhythmia or cardiovascular collapse, acute kidney injury, or elevated concentrations of liver enzymes. Acute bradyarrhythmia was defined as a new drop in heart rate to less than 60 beats per minute not in sinus rhythm, and cardiovascular collapse included cardiac failure in the absence of cardiac disease. Acute kidney injury was defined as an elevation of serum creatinine greater than 50% from baseline or at least 0.3 mg/dL. Elevated liver enzymes were defined as an increase in concentrations to at least 3 times the upper limit of normal. Patients met the definition for possible PRIS if they had at least 2 of the listed criteria within 24 hours of elevated CK concentration. All laboratory monitoring, including triglyceride and CK concentrations, were obtained at the discretion of the provider.

### Does the newer preparation of propofol, an emulsion of medium / long chain triglycerides cause less injection pain in children when premixed with lignocaine? [^116D9Jdg]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Injection pain during propofol administration can be particularly distressing in children. The newly available emulsion of propofol in medium and long chain triglycerides (LCT) is reported to cause less injection pain because of lower concentrations of free propofol. This study compared the incidence of injection pain during administration of propofol emulsion of LCT and propofol emulsion of medium and long chain triglycerides (MCT/LCT) both premixed with lignocaine in children.

Methods

This prospective, randomized, double blind study was conducted after obtaining institutional ethics committee approval, parental consent and included 84 children aged 5–15 years. Preoperatively, an intravenous cannula was inserted in all children. four children were excluded. Those included, depending on the randomization, received 3 mg x kg(-1) of either propofol LCT or propofol MCT/LCT both premixed with lignocaine (0.1%). The incidence and intensity of injection pain was assessed.

Results

Pain on injection of propofol LCT with lignocaine was observed in 16/40 children (40%), five of these children complained of severe pain. In comparison, 14/40 (35%) children complained of pain following propofol MCT/LCT premixed with lignocaine (P = 0.644), the intensity being severe in two children (P = 0.698).

Conclusions

Propofol MCT/LCT and propofol LCT premixed with lignocaine are both associated with pain on injection in children; the incidence and intensity of the injection pain are similar.

### Propofol infusion syndrome: a structured review of experimental studies and 153 published case reports [^113aDRbA]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

In summary, current experimental data suggest that propofol, structurally similar to co-enzyme Q, interferes with electron flux from upstream complexes (I and II) to complex III. In addition it interferes with fatty acid oxidation, which builds up in plasma over time. Very high doses of propofol seem to directly inhibit the activity of complex IV and uncouple the respiratory chain by modifying the structure of F 1 F 0 ATPase.

Our finding that mechanical cardiac failure and metabolic (in most cases lactic) acidosis occur early (often within the first few hours) and in a dose-dependent manner, is consistent with a direct inhibition of aerobic phosphorylation observed in experimental studies. The heart is highly reliant on aerobic ATP synthesis and acidosis may represent a combination of hypoperfusion and cytopathic hypoxia in tissues. Fever is reported more frequently with higher propofol infusion rates and this may reflect mitochondrial uncoupling and energy dissipation as heat. Fever is also an independent predictor of mortality in our model, possibly identifying subgroups of patients who are more susceptible to mitochondrial uncoupling. On the other hand, arrhythmia and ECG changes occurred more frequently in PRIS cases caused by prolonged propofol infusions and were the only signs which were not seen in animal models of PRIS triggered by short-term (< 38 hours) high-dose propofol. A possible explanation is that arrhythmia and ECG changes are caused by elevated free fatty acids, which steadily increase over days during propofol administration and are known to be proarrhythmogenic (even more so in combination with metabolic acidosis). Similarly, rhabdomyolysis (a common feature of inborn defects of fatty acid oxidation) is associated with the duration of propofol administration and may also be related to the propofol-induced defect of fatty acid oxidation. The frequency of hypertriglyceridaemia seems to also increase with cumulative dose of propofol. If the dose of lipid emulsions exceeds the capacity of hydrolysis in plasma, triacylglyceroles accumulate in the blood and are taken up by the reticulo-endothelial system, causing hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, and clotting disturbances ("fat overload syndrome"). Recommended lipid dose for parenteral nutrition is 29–54 mg/kg per hour. To match this dose, propofol as a 1% solution in 10% intralipid has to run at 2.9–5.4 mg/kg per hour. Most of the patients with PRIS exceeded this rate. Nonetheless, it seems that excessive doses of lipid emulsions are generally well tolerated; rapid infusions of lipid emulsions even in a range of 170–5000 mg/kg per hour have been accidentally administered without side effects. In animal models of PRIS, elevated triglycerides was the only sign observed in control animals receiving intralipid alone. In our study, even in the subgroup of patients with infusions at a rapid rate administered over an extended period of time, only a minority (40%) developed hypertriglyceridaemia and this symptom had no relation to the outcome of PRIS. Possible explanation is that hypertriglyceridaemia represents an epiphenomenon rather than a genuine part of PRIS. Other features of lipid overload syndrome were absent in our series of patients with PRIS, with the exception of one patient with hyperbilirubinaemia. AKI is reported in 39% of patients with PRIS. It was associated with rhabdomyolysis in our series (R = 0.28, p = 0.0004) and myoglobin casts were found in kidneys of rabbits treated with propofol, but still there is no link to propofol dose or duration of infusion. It is likely that propofol may have been only a minor factor among many others causing AKI in sick ICU patients.

### Liberation from mechanical ventilation in the cardiac intensive care unit [^114Nu2xZ]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Sedation management near extubation

The management of pain, anxiety, and agitation in intubated patients is critical but can delay liberation from IMV if not carefully managed. Sedation strategies should balance minimizing patient discomfort while avoiding oversedation. Common sedatives include benzodiazepines, propofol, and dexmedetomidine (Table 5). Benzodiazepines may convey some hemodynamic advantages, particularly in patients with cardiogenic shock, as they do not depress cardiac output and may even reduce cardiac filling pressures. However, studies have shown that benzodiazepines are an independent risk factor for delirium in ICU patients, and may lead to prolonged IMV and longer ICU length of stay compared to other agents. Thus, utilization of benzodiazepines should be limited in the CICU, except for special circumstances, such as those experiencing seizures or alcohol withdrawal. The Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines recommend utilization of non-benzodiazepine agents, including propofol or dexmedetomidine, as the preferred choice in ICU patients. Meanwhile, opioids are first-line analgesic agents for intubated patients and should be transitioned to as needed intermittent dosing, if not done already, as the patient approaches extubation readiness.

Table 5
Sedation Medications Used During the Peri-Extubation Period

Propofol is a frequently utilized agent for sedation in the CICU. It has been shown to result in less delirium and fewer days of IMV when compared with benzodiazepines. Propofol has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with rapid onset and can be quickly weaned off as its plasma concentration rapidly declines when the infusion is held, enabling frequent awakening trials. Propofol may also aid in terminating supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias through sympathetic inhibition. As such, propofol may be preferred for deep sedation in patients with incessant ventricular tachycardia. However, due to its sympathetic inhibition, propofol may have dose-dependent hemodynamic effects, resulting in hypotension through negative inotropy, chronotropy, and vasodilatation. Other side effects include hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides must be monitored regularly) and propofol infusion syndrome (a rare but possibly lethal complication). Propofol utilization has not been exclusively studied in the CICU, though it has been studied in patients following cardiac surgery and is generally considered to be a safe and effective sedative in patients who have cardiac comorbidities. However, we encourage careful titration of propofol in patients with cardiogenic shock or significant ventricular dysfunction.

### The safety of continuous infusion propofol in mechanically ventilated adults with coronavirus disease 2019 [^115agAt5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Respiratory failure from COVID-19 is often severe and protracted; patients requiring mechanical ventilation often require prolonged, deep sedation to optimize oxygenation and ventilation and facilitate ventilator synchrony. In the general critical care population, guidelines recommend use of nonbenzodiazepine sedatives, such as propofol or dexmedetomidine, as first-line remedies to improve short-term outcomes. However, patients with COVID-19 often require high doses of sedative medications for prolonged periods, and propofol is integral to achieving these goals.

Propofol, an anesthetic agent formulated in a 10% lipid emulsion, has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with a rapid onset and short duration of action. Possible adverse effects of propofol administration include respiratory depression, hypotension, hypertriglyceridemia, and propofol-related infusion syndrome (PRIS). Hypertriglyceridemia, in turn, can be associated with acute pancreatitis, which can be severe. The risk of acute pancreatitis is increased with triglyceride concentrations > 500 mg/dL, and the risk is significantly higher with triglyceride concentrations > 1000 mg/dL. As a result, many clinicians monitor triglyceride concentrations every 2 to 3 days during prolonged infusion and may switch to an alternative sedative agent if the concentration exceeds 400 to 500 mg/dL. These alternative agents are typically benzodiazepines, which have been associated with worse outcomes, such as increased delirium, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and longer ICU and hospital lengths of stay. PRIS is a rare, potentially devastating complication associated with prolonged high doses (> 83 µµg/kg/min for > 48 hours), and has a reported mortality rate ranging from 18% to 48%. - Clinical features of PRIS may include refractory bradycardia, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis, hyperlipidemia, acute kidney injury, or acute fatty liver. Finally, there is a potential risk of hypertriglyceridemia from propofol use in patients who develop secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), a macrophage activation syndrome that, similar to COVID-19, can be associated with cytokine storm. Patients with sHLH may have elevated triglyceride concentrations at baseline.

The objective of this study was to assess the safety of continuous infusion propofol in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients with COVID-19. We examined the incidences of hypertriglyceridemia, acute pancreatitis, PRIS, and propofol reduction or discontinuation caused by adverse effects. We hypothesized that hypertriglyceridemia is more prevalent among these patients and occurs at lower cumulative doses of the drug.

### Fospropofol disodium versus propofol for long-term sedation during invasive mechanical ventilation: a pilot randomized clinical trial [^111iThkt]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Fospropofol disodium is a propofol prodrug that is water-soluble and has a reduced risk of bacterial contamination and hypertriglyceridemia compared with propofol. Prior to implementing a large randomized trial, we investigated the feasibility, initial efficacy, and safety of fospropofol disodium compared with propofol in long-term mild-to-moderate sedation in intensive care units (ICUs).

Design

Single-centered, prospective, unblind, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial.

Setting

The general ICU of university-affiliated teaching hospital.

Patients

Adult patients (n = 60) expected to have mechanical ventilation for > 24 h were enrolled and randomly assigned to the fospropofol or propofol group.

Interventions

The fospropofol group received continuous fospropofol disodium infusions and the propofol group received continuous propofol infusions. The sedation goal was a score of -3 to 0 on the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS).

Measurements

The primary outcome was the percentage of time spent in the target sedation range without rescue sedation. Safety outcomes were based on adverse events. Blood samples were collected to measure formate concentration in plasma.

Main Results

The median dose was 4.33 (IQR, 3.08–4.94) mg/kg/h in the fospropofol group and 1.96 (IQR, 1.44–2.94) mg/kg/h in the propofol group. The median percentage of time spent in the target RASS range without rescue sedation was identical in both groups, with 83.33% (IQR, 74.43%-100.00%) in the fospropofol group and 83.33% (IQR, 77.45%-100.00%) in the propofol group (p = 0.887). At least one adverse event was identifed in 23 (76.7%) fospropofol patients and 27 (90.0%) propofol patients. The most common adverse events were tachycardia and hypotension. No paresthesia, catheter-related bloodstream infection or propofol infusion syndrome in both groups was reported. Three patients in the fospropofol group had mild hypertriglyceridemia, and nine patients in propofol group had hypertriglyceridemia (mild in eight patients and moderate in one patient) (10% versus 30%, p = 0.104). The formate concentration in plasma was very low, and no significant difference was identified at any time point between the two groups.

Conclusions

Fospropofol disodium appears to be a feasible, effective and safe sedative for patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation with long-term sedation.

### The effects of intravenous lidocaine on pain during injection of medium-and long-chain triglyceride propofol emulsions [^117Urwir]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

Propofol formulated in medium- and long-chain triglycerides (MCT/LCT) is thought to cause less pain on injection. In this study we sought to determine if adding lidocaine to propofol-MCT/LCT is more effective in decreasing pain compared with propofol-MCT/LCT alone or conventional propofol-lidocaine mixtures. Seventy-five patients were randomized into three groups. Group A received conventional propofol-lidocaine mixtures with 20 mg lidocaine, group B received propofol-MCT/LCT with saline, and group C received propofol-MCT/LCT with 20 mg lidocaine. The incidence of pain was 24% in groups A and B and 4% in group C. The number needed to treat to prevent pain was 5. We conclude that propofol-MCT/LCT-lidocaine mixtures significantly reduce pain.

### Optimal clinical management of children receiving ketogenic parenteral nutrition: a clinical practice guide [^112ui7y5]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Side effects and monitoring

The available international parenteral nutrition guidelines include a description of side effects 9, 10, 28, 34 but do not provide specific information during KDT. When KDT is established as parenteral nutrition treatment for refractory status epilepticus or FIRES, adverse effects already known during KDT initiation might occur (e.g. hypoglycemia, constipation, hypertriglyceridemia, increased liver enzyme, increased pancreatic amylase).

On the basis of the data from KD‐PN studies 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 38 and in clinical practice, it is clear that, during KD‐PN, side effects are frequently documented even if parenteral nutrition is only given for a few days.

The mixing of drugs with parenteral nutrition has to be avoided on the basis of drug compatibility. 34

Most side effects are transient and can be avoided by the use of strict protocols in the intensive care unit. This highlights the need for the slow introduction of KD‐PN based on the international parenteral nutrition guidelines with tailoring of ratio, fat, protein, and carbohydrate, and regular monitoring of liver function with quick response to hyperketosis and hypoglycemia (e.g. frequency of monitoring glucose and ketone levels tailored to the medical and nutritional status). Initiation during propofol anesthesia should be avoided owing to the risk of propofol infusion syndrome caused by the high triglyceride content of this anesthetic. If considered necessary, it should be handled with caution with strict monitoring of lipids and renal, cardiac, and liver functioning. 4

Limited data have been published in this area. 14, 16, 17, 18, 19 The White Paper on ketogenic diet includes brief recommendations on KD‐PN monitoring. 20

Results from our international survey show a wide range of laboratory parameters (e.g. glucose, ketone levels, or bicarbonate/carbon dioxide) that should be checked during KD‐PN and its frequency (Appendix S1).

An overview of recommendations for monitoring is shown in Table 4.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofol sedation in ICU patients undergoing mechanical ventilation: a multicenter, single-blind, randomized, noninferiority trial [^117T6qyY]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Propofol-related hypertriglyceridemia has been frequently reported, mainly due to its formulation as a 10% oil-in-water lipid emulsion. In the present study, a significantly decreased triglyceride concentration was observed up to 24 hours after the end of ciprofol administration, but this may be clinically irrelevant and needs to be unequivocally established in subsequent studies.

The hemodynamic TEAEs observed, such as hypotension, respiratory depression, and bradycardia, have also been reported for other sedatives. The occurrence rate and duration of drug-related hemodynamic TEAEs appeared to be less in the ciprofol group, although these apparent differences did not reach statistical significance. Grade 3 drug-related hypotension (2.2% vs 4.4%) and allergic dermatitis (1.1% vs 0) occurred in two patients (2.2%) and 2 (4.4%) in the ciprofol and propofol groups, respectively, but all patients recovered or improved after discontinuation of drug administration. Of note, the vast majority of SAEs were associated with the patients' primary disease, but one patient experienced serious respiratory depression (lasting for 2 min), which may have been related to the initiation of remifentanil 3 hours after the end of ciprofol administration. Ciprofol produced good hemodynamic profiles in former studies, such as less fluctuations in MAP, less prevalence of intraoperative hypotension, respiratory depression, and other intubation responses (,–). Generally speaking, ciprofol had a tolerable profile being a new choice for use in ICU sedation of Chinese patients receiving MV.

Another concern for ICU sedation is the occurrence of delirium, as it could significantly increase the mortality of ICU patients and prolong the ICU stay. Delirium was monitored twice a day by using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU test in the former phase 2 trial, and negative results were reported. Nevertheless, the limitation of the current study is that the delirium was not set as an endpoint during the initial study design. Although delirium was added to the secondary endpoints in the study protocol, based on a reviewer's helpful comment during the publication process, given that the enrollment of patients was completed earlier than the expected date, we ultimately did not evaluate delirium, which clearly warrants further studies in the near future. Other limitations included the small sample size, unbalanced baseline age and SOFA between groups, the high percentage of postoperative ICU patients, and the lack of baseline Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores.

### The 'propofol infusion syndrome': the facts, their interpretation and implications for patient care [^11532fJ1]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2006). Low credibility.

AstraZeneca (the manufacturer of Diprivan) presents its review of the history of the so-called 'propofol infusion syndrome', highlighting the difficulties in analysing the incomplete information available. Theories as to its causality are presented and discussed; these include mitochondrial toxicity, mitochondrial defects, impaired tissue oxygenation and carbohydrate deficiency. A review of published and confidential safety data is presented and discussed; it concludes that the major risk factors for its development appear to be poor oxygen delivery, sepsis, serious cerebral injury and high propofol dosage. In some reports an increasing lipaemia was noted and was likely to be due to a failure of hepatic lipid regulation, possibly related to poor oxygenation and/or possibly a lack of glucose. In some cases an increasing lipaemia was the first indication of impending 'propofol infusion syndrome' onset and it should not be viewed as a benign sign. The lipaemia can lead to sequestration of propofol into the lipid phase, leading to lowered free propofol levels and apparent insensitivity to propofol. In conclusion AstraZeneca advocates good haemodynamic and oxygen delivery management, adequate glucose provision, adherence to recommended propofol dosing regimes together with active management of lipaemias to both prevent and treat 'propofol infusion syndrome'.

### Fospropofol disodium versus propofol for deep sedation in critically ill patients: a randomized pilot study [^111jEcQY]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Sedation levels in ICU patients are typically assessed using subjective scoring systems, such as the RASS. The subjective scoring systems assesses the depth of sedation based on the patient's response to sound and physical stimuli. However, for ICU patients in deep sedation, it is challenging to further differentiate whether over-sedation has occurred. The Narcotrend monitor provides continuous, quantified, and objective monitoring of sedation status in critically ill patients. Therefore, in this study, we employed both RASS score and NI value to assess the depth of sedation in patients. Similar to the Bispectral Index (BIS), NI is influenced by various factors, with electromyographic interference affecting the accuracy of NI values. With the exception of a few numerical deviations that may be influenced by external factors, our results demonstrate a good overall consistency between RASS scores and NI values in most cases.

Fospropofol disodium, as a propofol prodrug, primarily demonstrates advantages in its water solubility and low lipid properties, which are particularly crucial for patients with dyslipidemia or in regions without suitable storage conditions for ester-based drugs. This study focused on the changes in blood lipids before and after medication for all patients. We observed that the increase in triglycerides after medication in the propofol group was significantly higher than that in the sodium phosphinate group, which is consistent with previous reports. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of hyperlipidemia (p = 0.052). This issue warrants attention, and we will continue to monitor this issue in future large-scale studies.

Respiratory and circulatory depression are common concerns with sedation, especially in mechanically ventilated ICU patients requiring deep sedation. Given that all patients were under deep sedation and mechanical ventilation, the issue of respiratory depression could not be observed. Hypotension was the most common adverse event, but the blood pressure of all patients can be maintained at a relatively stable level after vasopressors, with no significant difference of the duration and dosage of vasopressors between groups. Two patients in the fospropofol disodium group experienced bradycardia, compared to none in the propofol group. Overall, patients remained hemodynamically stable, with no significant changes in heart rate or mean arterial pressure during the medication period.

5.9 Risks of Propofol Infusion Syndrome in Patients with ICU Sedation

Use of DIPRIVAN infusions for both adult and pediatric ICU sedation has been associated with a constellation of metabolic derangements and organ system failures, referred to as Propofol Infusion Syndrome, that have resulted in death. The syndrome is characterized by severe metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, lipemia, rhabdomyolysis, hepatomegaly, renal failure, ECG changes (Coved ST segment elevation -similar to ECG changes of the Brugada syndrome) and/or cardiac failure.

The following appear to be major risk factors for the development of these events: decreased oxygen delivery to tissues; serious neurological injury and/or sepsis; high dosages of one or more of the following pharmacological agents: vasoconstrictors, steroids, inotropes and/or prolonged, high-dose infusions of propofol (> 5 mg/kg/hour for > 48 hours). The syndrome has also been reported following large-dose, short-term infusions during surgical anesthesia. In the setting of prolonged need for sedation, increasing propofol dose requirements to maintain a constant level of sedation, or onset of metabolic acidosis during administration of a propofol infusion, consideration should be given to using alternative means of sedation.

Prescribers should be alert to these events in patients with the above risk factors and immediately discontinue propofol when the above signs develop.

5.10 Risk of Elevations in Serum Triglycerides

DIPRIVAN use requires caution when administered to patients with disorders of lipid metabolism such as primary hyperlipoproteinemia, diabetic hyperlipemia, and pancreatitis.

Since DIPRIVAN is formulated in an oil-in-water emulsion, elevations in serum triglycerides may occur when DIPRIVAN is administered for extended periods of time. Patients at risk of hyperlipidemia should be monitored for increases in serum triglycerides or serum turbidity. Administration of DIPRIVAN should be adjusted if fat is being inadequately cleared from the body. A reduction in the quantity of concurrently administered lipids is indicated to compensate for the amount of lipid infused as part of the DIPRIVAN formulation; 1 mL of DIPRIVAN contains approximately 0.1 g of fat (1.1 kcal).

### Effect of best practice advisories on sedation protocol compliance and drug-related hazardous condition mitigation among critical care patients [^115JKF5L]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether best practice advisories improved sedation protocol compliance and could mitigate potential propofol-related hazardous conditions.

Design

Retrospective observational cohort study.

Setting

Two adult ICUs at two academic medical centers that share the same sedation protocol.

Patients

Adults 18 years old or older admitted to the ICU between January 1, 2016, and January 31, 2018, who received a continuous infusion of propofol.

Interventions

Two concurrent best practice advisories built in the electronic health record as a clinical decision support tool to enforce protocol compliance with triglyceride and lipase level monitoring and mitigate propofol-related hazardous conditions.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcomes were baseline and day 3 compliance with triglyceride and lipase laboratory monitoring per protocol and time to discontinuation of propofol in the setting of triglyceride and/or lipase levels exceeding protocol cutoffs. A total of 1,394 patients were included in the study cohort (n = 700 in the pre-best practice advisory group; n = 694 in the post-best practice advisory group). In inverse probability weighted regression analyses, implementing the best practice advisory was associated with a 56.6% (95% CI, 52.6–60.9) absolute increase and a 173% relative increase (risk ratio, 2.73; 95% CI, 2.45–3.04) in baseline laboratory monitoring. The best practice advisory was associated with a 34.0% (95% CI, 20.9–47.1) absolute increase and a 74% (95% CI, 1.39–2.19) relative increase in day 3 laboratory monitoring after inverse probability weighted analyses. Among patients with laboratory values exceeding protocol cutoffs, implementation of the best practice advisory resulted in providers discontinuing propofol an average of 16.6 hours (95% CI, 4.8–28.3) sooner than pre-best practice advisory. Findings from alternate analyses using interrupted time series were consistent with the inverse probability weighted analyses.

Conclusions

Best practice advisories can be effectively used in ICUs to improve sedation protocol compliance and may mitigate potential propofol-related hazardous conditions. Best practice advisories should undergo continuous quality assurance and optimizations to maximize clinical utility and minimize alert fatigue.

### I.V. fat emulsion (Intralipid) [^112nJZp9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.3 Recommended Dosage and Administration

The recommended nutritional requirements of lipid and recommended dosages of Intralipid to be administered to meet those requirements for adults and pediatric patients are provided in Table 1.
The dosing of Intralipid depends on the patient's individual energy requirements influenced by age, body weight, tolerance, clinical status, and the ability to metabolize and eliminate lipids.
When determining dose, energy supplied by dextrose and amino acids from PN, as well as energy from oral or enteral nutrition, has to be taken into account. Energy and lipid provided from lipid-based medications should also be taken into account (e.g., propofol).
Prior to administration of admixtures with Intralipid, correct severe fluid and electrolyte disorders and measure serum triglyceride levels to establish a baseline value. In patients with elevated triglyceride levels, initiate Intralipid at a lower dosage and titrate in smaller increments, monitoring the triglyceride levels with each adjustment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Dosage Modifications in Patients with Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency

When admixtures with Intralipid are administered to correct essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD), supply 8% to 10% of caloric input from Intralipid in order to provide adequate amounts of linoleic and linolenic acids.

5.9	Risks of Propofol Infusion Syndrome in Patients with ICU Sedation

Use of propofol injectable emulsion infusions for both adult and pediatric ICU sedation has been associated with a constellation of metabolic derangements and organ system failures, referred to as Propofol Infusion Syndrome, that have resulted in death. The syndrome is characterized by severe metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, lipemia, rhabdomyolysis, hepatomegaly, renal failure, ECG changes (Coved ST segment elevation -similar to ECG changes of the Brugada syndrome) and/or cardiac failure.

The syndrome has also been reported following large-dose, short-term infusions during surgical anesthesia. In the setting of prolonged need for sedation, increasing propofol dose requirements to maintain a constant level of sedation, or onset of metabolic acidosis during administration of a propofol infusion, consideration should be given to using alternative means of sedation.

Prescribers should be alert to these events in patients with the above risk factors and immediately discontinue propofol when the above signs develop.

5.10	Risk of Elevations in Serum Triglycerides

Propofol injectable emulsion use requires caution when administered to patients with disorders of lipid metabolism such as primary hyperlipoproteinemia, diabetic hyperlipemia, and pancreatitis.

Since propofol injectable emulsion is formulated in an oil-in-water emulsion, elevations in serum triglycerides may occur when propofol injectable emulsion is administered for extended periods of time. Patients at risk of hyperlipidemia should be monitored for increases in serum triglycerides or serum turbidity. Administration of propofol injectable emulsion should be adjusted if fat is being inadequately cleared from the body. A reduction in the quantity of concurrently administered lipids is indicated to compensate for the amount of lipid infused as part of the propofol injectable emulsion formulation; 1 mL of propofol injectable emulsion contains approximately 0.1 g of fat (1.1 kcal).

### Midazolam and propofol used alone or sequentially for long-term sedation in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients: a prospective, randomized study [^115DDJE1]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study showed that the sequential use of midazolam and propofol for long-term sedation was an effective and safe sedation protocol. The study showed a less frequent incidence of agitation, faster recovery, earlier extubation and lower total ICU cost, and had a trend to accelerate ICU discharge compared with midazolam alone. The protocol was associated with less cost of pharmaceutical sedation, and less incidence of hypotension compared with propofol alone. No patients showed hypertriglyceridemia with propofol used alone or sequentially. The use of propofol in the long-term sedation was associated with faster recovery, earlier extubation and shorter mechanical ventilation, increased incidence of hypotension and higher pharmaceutical sedation costs than midazolam.

In the present study, no differences were seen in terms of adequate levels of sedation among the three groups. This finding was consistent with the previous published results. The quality of sedation of midazolam and propofol (used alone or sequentially) was similar. Withdrawal symptoms may occur in ICU patients with long-term exposure to benzodiazepine sedatives. Midazolam is a water-soluble benzodiazepine with a rapid onset and a short duration of action, withdrawal syndrome (including agitation) immediately following cessation. The rate of agitation after interruption of sedation in group M-P was significantly lower than group M, similar to the results of Saito and colleagues who found that the rate of agitation evaluated after extubation in group M-P (8%) was significantly lower than in group M (54%). Although withdrawal syndrome in critically ill patients may be attributed to other causes, such as alcohol or illicit-drug withdrawal, or chronic use of anxiolytics or hypnotics, our study population excluded these patients with addiction. The decreased incidence of agitation in group M-P may be attributed to a period of propofol infusion before stopping sedation, masking withdrawal symptoms associated with discontinuation of midazolam.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^115QFjgF]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Parenteral nutrition lipid monitoring — intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) use should be guided by triglyceride assessment, risk factors, and dosing limits. Prior to administering ILE, serum triglyceride concentrations should be determined for patients with a history of elevated triglycerides or risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia, since hypertriglyceridemia has occurred with rapid infusion of ILE, propofol use, overfeeding, suboptimal glucose control, and inflammation. Triglyceride levels less than 400 mg/dL are acceptable, and the contribution of energy from lipids should not account for more than 30% of total energy intake. Optimal triglyceride monitoring should occur weekly, when ILE intake increases, and during sepsis, with frequency adjusted per the acuity of illness and the clinical stability of the patient.

### Propofol infusion syndrome: a structured review of experimental studies and 153 published case reports [^116PmBn8]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS) is a rare, but potentially lethal adverse effect of a commonly used drug. We aimed to review and correlate experimental and clinical data about this syndrome.

Methods

We searched for all case reports published between 1990 and 2014 and for all experimental studies on PRIS pathophysiology. We analysed the relationship between signs of PRIS and the rate and duration of propofol infusion causing PRIS. By multivariate logistic regression we looked at the risk factors for mortality.

Results

Knowledge about PRIS keeps evolving. Compared to earlier case reports in the literature, recently published cases describe older patients developing PRIS at lower doses of propofol, in whom arrhythmia, hypertriglyceridaemia and fever are less frequently seen, with survival more likely. We found that propofol infusion rate and duration, the presence of traumatic brain injury and fever are factors independently associated with mortality in reported cases of PRIS (area under receiver operator curve = 0.85). Similar patterns of exposure to propofol (in terms of time and concentration) are reported in clinical cases and experimental models of PRIS. Cardiac failure and metabolic acidosis occur early in a dose-dependent manner, while arrhythmia, other electrocardiographic changes and rhabdomyolysis appear more frequently after prolonged propofol infusions, irrespective of dose.

Conclusion

PRIS can develop with propofol infusion < 4 mg/kg per hour and its diagnosis may be challenging as some of its typical features (hypertriglyceridaemia, fever, hepatomegaly, heart failure) are often (> 95%) missing and others (arrhythmia, electrocardiographic changes) occur late.

### 2022 Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guidelines on prevention and management of pain, agitation, neuromuscular blockade, and delirium in critically ill pediatric patients with consideration of the ICU environment and early mobility [^115MGfdw]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Propofol sedation in mechanically ventilated children — We suggest that continuous propofol sedation at doses less than 4 mg/kg/hr (67 μg/kg/min) and administered for less than 48 hours may be a safe sedation alternative to minimize the risk of propofol-related infusion syndrome (PRIS) development (conditional, low-level evidence), and short term (< 48hr) continuous propofol sedation may be a useful adjunct during the periextubation period to facilitate weaning of other analgesosedative agents prior to extubation (good practice). PRIS developed in 84% of a small cohort receiving propofol at doses exceeding both 4 mg/kg/hr (67 μg/kg/min) and a 48 hour duration, whereas in five larger prospective observational series no cases were reported when high doses (4 mg/kg/hr) and long durations (48 hr) were avoided. Suggested monitoring/screening for PRIS during continuous propofol sedation includes continuous electrocardiogram and intermittent measurement of lactic acid, triglycerides, creatine kinase, serum creatinine, and liver function studies, and several small studies have reported successful early extubation using propofol sedation in children following cardiac surgical procedures, patients at high risk for extubation failure, or burn injury patients.

TABLE 3.
Summary of Adverse Events in ICU Patients in the Two Groups

Figure S1 shows that the vital clinical signs in the two groups were stable after the study drug administration and the overall change trend was practically identical. The lowest systolic blood pressure occurred at 30 minutes after the initial administration of ciprofol or propofol, with a median (range) value of 121.0 mm Hg (78–184 mm Hg) versus 113.0 mm Hg (82–192 mm Hg). The decreased changes of triglyceride concentrations from baseline in patients given ciprofol was greater than those given propofol within 0–24 hours after drug administration ceased (p = 0.048) (Table 3).

Plasma Concentrations

The change trend in plasma concentrations of ciprofol and propofol was basically the same, with ciprofol having a virtually identical terminal t 1/2 to that of propofol (Fig. 2). The measured plasma concentrations of ciprofol and propofol were 7.3–210.6 and 190.8–1,741.7 ng/mL, respectively, when RASS had fallen to a range of +1 to –2.

### Propofol infusion syndrome or adrenoleukodystrophy? [^114NpPKw]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Following a propofol anesthetic, a 5-year-old girl with lower extremity spasticity seized and developed hypertriglyceridemia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. A presumed diagnosis of propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS) was made, but further investigation revealed neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy. PRIS should be considered with this constellation of symptoms, but other neurometabolic disorders must always be ruled out.

### Refractory atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response as a heralding sign of propofol infusion syndrome in a patient with COVID-19 [^111MCVt2]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A woman in her 40s was transferred to the medical intensive care unit due to severe COVID-19 infection causing respiratory failure. Her respiratory failure worsened rapidly, requiring intubation and continuous sedation with fentanyl and propofol infusions. She required progressive increases in the rates of the propofol infusion, as well as addition of midazolam and cisatracurium due to ventilator dyssynchrony. To support the high sedative doses, norepinephrine was administered as a continuous infusion. She developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, with rates ranging between 180 and 200s which did not respond to intravenous adenosine, metoprolol, synchronised cardioversion or amiodarone. A blood draw revealed lipaemia, and triglyceride levels were noted to be elevated to 2018. The patient developed high-grade fevers up to 105.3 and acute renal failure with severe mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis, indicating propofol-related infusion syndrome. Propofol was promptly discontinued. An insulin-dextrose infusion was initiated which improved patient's fevers and hypertriglyceridaemia.

### Incidence of hypertriglyceridemia in patients on propofol, clevidipine, or both [^111Kfa6W]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Propofol and clevidipine (PC) are commonly used in the treatment of critically ill patients. While both medications are lipid emulsions, there is limited evidence concerning the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) when these agents are used individually or concurrently.

Objective

The objective of this study is to determine the effects of propofol, clevidipine, or concurrent PC on triglycerides (TGs) and related outcomes in critically ill adults.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study conducted at an academic medical center. Patients were included if they received ≥ 24 hours of continuous propofol and/or clevidipine. Excluded were those without TG levels after ≥ 24 hours of infusion, baseline HTG, acute pancreatitis at admission, or receiving total parenteral nutrition with lipids. The primary outcome was incidence of HTG (defined as a TG level > 400 mg/dL). Secondary outcomes included median and peak TG levels, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, total lipid infused, time to peak TG level, peak lipase level, and development of pancreatitis.

Results

In total, 190 patients were studied: 109 in the propofol group, 50 in the clevidipine group, and 31 in the PC group. Incidence of HTG was similar (19 [17.4%] vs 6 [12%] vs 4 [12.9%] patients, P = 0.6246). Peak and median TG levels were similar for propofol, clevidipine, and PC groups (216 mg/dL vs 189.5 mg/dL vs 205 mg/dL, P = 0.7069; 177 mg/dL vs 185.5 mg/dL vs 177 mg/dL, P = 0.6791).

Conclusions and Relevance

There was a similar incidence of HTG in all groups. The results of this study suggest that the concurrent use of PC should not modify the frequency of TG level monitoring.

### Discomfort on injection: a comparison between two formulations of propofol [^114t9uiL]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

A randomized double-blind controlled trial was performed to determine if there was a difference in discomfort on injection between two preparations of propofol. A long-chain triglyceride preparation (LCT-propofol (Fresenius)) was compared against a medium- and long-chain triglyceride preparation (MCT/LCT-propofol (BBraun)).

Methods

One hundred and twenty ASA I-II patients listed for elective procedures were consented and randomized to receive either induction agent. A standard rate of infusion was used for induction of anaesthesia and subjects were questioned about discomfort until contact was lost. Discomfort was recorded as none, mild, moderate or severe. Incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and anti-emetic requirements were recorded in the postanaesthetic care unit.

Results

There was seen to be a 54% reduction in moderate/severe discomfort with MCT/LCT-propofol compared with LCT-propofol (P < 0.006). There was a 70% reduction in severe discomfort with MCT/LCT-propofol compared with LCT-propofol (P < 0.04). The term discomfort was used during the study because there is a wide array of unpleasant sensations felt by patients during propofol induction which are not always reported as pain. There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting or anti-emetic use between the two groups.

Conclusions

There is a significant decrease in the incidence of discomfort with MCT/LCT-propofol compared with LCT-propofol. This difference is more marked in subjects reporting severe discomfort.

### Propofol injectable emulsion [^11172LH9]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

2.6 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Sedation of Intubated, Mechanically Ventilated Adult Patients

In the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), propofol injectable emulsion can be administered to intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients to provide continuous sedation and control of stress responses only by persons skilled in the medical management of critically ill patients and trained in cardiovascular resuscitation and airway management.

Propofol injectable emulsion should be individualized according to the patient's condition and response, blood lipid profile, and vital signs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8, 5.9, and 5.10)]. For intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation should be initiated slowly with a continuous infusion in order to titrate to desired clinical effect and minimize hypotension. When indicated, initiation of sedation should begin at 5 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/hour). The infusion rate should be increased by increments of 5 mcg/kg/min to 10 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/hour to 0.6 mg/kg/hour) until the desired level of sedation is achieved. A minimum period of 5 minutes between adjustments should be allowed for onset of peak drug effect.

Most adult ICU patients recovering from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation will require maintenance rates of 5 mcg/kg/min to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/hour to 3 mg/kg/hour) titrated to desired level of clinical response. With medical ICU patients or patients who have recovered from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation, the rate of administration of 50 mcg/kg/min or higher may be required to achieve adequate sedation. These higher rates of administration may increase the likelihood of patients developing hypotension. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

### External validation of the modified Marsh and schnider models for medium-chain triglyceride propofol in target-controlled infusion anesthesia [^115V6ztS]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Propofol formulated with medium- and long-chain triglycerides (MCT/LCT propofol) has rapidly replaced propofol formulated with long-chain triglycerides (LCT propofol). Despite this shift, the modified Marsh and Schnider pharmacokinetic models developed using LCT propofol are still widely used for target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol. This study aimed to validate the external applicability of these models by evaluating their predictive performance during TCI of MCT/LCT propofol in general anesthesia.

Methods

Adult patients (n = 48) undergoing elective surgery received MCT/LCT propofol via a TCI system using either the modified Marsh or Schnider models. Blood samples were collected at various target propofol concentrations and at specific time points, including the loss of consciousness and the recovery of consciousness (13 samples per patient). The actual plasma concentration of propofol was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. The predictive performance of each pharmacokinetic model was assessed by calculating four parameters: inaccuracy, bias, divergence, and wobble.

Results

Both the modified Marsh and Schnider models demonstrated predictive performances within clinically acceptable ranges for MCT/LCT propofol. The inaccuracy values were 24.4% for the modified Marsh model and 26.9% for the Schnider model. Both models showed an overall positive bias, 16.4% for the modified Marsh model and 16.6% for the Schnider model. The predictive performance of MCT/LCT propofol was comparable to that of LCT propofol, suggesting formulation changes might exert only a minor impact on the reliability of the TCI system during general anesthesia. Additionally, both models exhibited higher bias and inaccuracy at target concentrations ranging from 3.5 ~ 5 ug/ml than at concentrations between 2 ~ 3 ug/ml.

Conclusions

The modified Marsh and Schnider models, initially developed for LCT propofol, remain clinically acceptable for TCI with MCT/LCT propofol.

Trial registration

This study was registered at the Clinical Research Information Service of the Korean National Institute of Health (registration number: KCT0002191; 06/01/2017).

### Unusual case of propofol-related infusion syndrome complicating severe COVID-19 ARDS [^11245TMx]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

An elderly man presenting with shortness of breath and hypoxaemia was admitted with acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. Due to worsening hypoxaemia, he was transferred to the intensive care unit and required mechanical ventilation. Propofol was infused at 1.5–4mg/kg/hour. Within 48 hours of initiation, we noticed worsening metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, elevated creatine kinase and elevated myoglobin levels. Suspecting propofol-related infusion syndrome (PRIS), we discontinued his propofol infusion immediately and initiated supportive measures. In 48 hours, there was a significant improvement in metabolic acidosis, hypertriglyceridaemia, rhabdomyolysis and renal function. The propofol infusion rate and cumulative propofol dosage (under 140mg/kg) were well below levels associated with PRIS. COVID-19's pathogenesis, still under investigation, may have contributed to this presentation. It is imperative for clinicians to maintain a high degree of suspicion once propofol is initiated, regardless of the cumulative dose or rate of infusion.

### Impact of fospropofol disodium on lipid metabolism and inflammatory response in patients with hyperlipidemia: a randomized trial [^115CuDFD]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In clinical practice, propofol is a widely used intravenous anesthetic. However, since its formulation requires an emulsion as a carrier, prolonged intravenous anesthesia with propofol can lead to elevated blood lipid levels. Studies have shown that continuous use of propofol anesthesia may exacerbate fat accumulation, disrupt lipid metabolism, and contribute to the development of hyperlipidemia. Fospropofol disodium, a class I water-soluble intravenous anesthetic, is primarily metabolized into propofol via alkaline phosphatase in the body and does not rely on a fat emulsion carrier. It is characterized by rapid onset, shorter duration of action, and a lower incidence of injection pain. While it has minimal effects on blood lipids in patients with normal lipid metabolism during anesthesia, its influence on lipid metabolism in patients with hyperlipidemia during the perioperative period requires further investigation.

Other studies have indicated that propofol can inhibit inflammatory activation and the generation of oxygen-free radicals, exhibiting certain anti-inflammatory properties. Currently, research on the anti-inflammatory effects of fospropofol disodium remains limited. Based on the above background, we hypothesized that intravenous infusion of propofol disodium during anesthesia positively affect lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses in patients with hyperlipidemia. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the impact of prolonged intravenous fospropofol disodium infusion on lipid metabolism and the inflammatory response in patients with hyperlipidemia, providing a basis for its clinical application.

### Smoflipid [^111godL2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Recommended Dosage and Administration

The recommended nutritional requirements of lipid and recommended dosages of SMOFlipid to be administered to meet those requirements for pediatric and adult patients are provided in Table 1, along with recommendations for the initial and maximum infusion rates.
The recommended duration of infusion for SMOFlipid will vary depending on the clinical situation. Adjust the administration flow rate by taking into account the dose being administered, the daily volume/intake, and the duration of the infusion [see Overdosage (10)].
When determining dose, energy supplied by dextrose and amino acids from PN, as well as energy from oral or enteral nutrition, has to be taken into account. Energy and lipid provided from lipid-based medications should also be taken into account (e.g., propofol).
Prior to administration of SMOFlipid, correct severe fluid and electrolyte disorders and measure serum triglyceride levels to establish a baseline value. In patients with elevated triglyceride levels, initiate SMOFlipid at a lower dosage and titrate in smaller increments, monitoring the triglyceride levels with each adjustment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
SMOFlipid contains 0.162 to 0.225 mg/mL of all-rac-alpha-tocopherol. Take into account the amount of all-rac-alpha-tocopherol in SMOFlipid when determining the need for additional supplementation.
