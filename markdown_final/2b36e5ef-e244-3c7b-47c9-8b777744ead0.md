## Question

10. Given the set M = {1,2, …, 99}. Now, nine elements are randomly selected from M to form a subset, and the smallest number in this subset is denoted as ξ. Then E ξ = 

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the expected value of the smallest number when 9 distinct elements are randomly selected from the set {1, 2, …, 99}. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total number of ways to choose 9 distinct numbers from 99. Then, I should determine, for each possible value k, how many of those subsets have k as the smallest element. Next, I will compute the probability that the minimum equals k. Finally, I will calculate the expected value using the definition of expectation and simplify the resulting expression.

> Let me first confirm the total number of possible subsets. The total number of ways to choose 9 distinct elements from 99 is given by the binomial coefficient C(99, 9), which will serve as the denominator for probabilities. I should double-check that I'm using the correct notation and that this is indeed the sample space size, which it is.

> Now, for a given k to be the smallest element in the subset, I need to ensure k is included and that the remaining 8 elements are all larger than k. Wait, let me verify the counting: the elements larger than k are {k+1, k+2, …, 99}, which number 99 − k, so the number of ways to choose 8 elements from those is C(99 − k, 8). Thus, the number of favorable subsets with minimum k is C(99 − k, 8).

> Next, I should review the probability mass function. The probability that the minimum ξ equals k is the number of favorable subsets divided by the total number of subsets, so P(ξ = k) = C(99 − k, 8) / C(99, 9). Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with the combinatorics, and yes, it does.

> I will now examine the expected value. By definition, E[ξ] = Σ k · P(ξ = k), where the sum runs over all possible values of k. Since the smallest possible minimum is 1 and the largest is 91 (because we need 8 larger numbers), the sum is from k = 1 to 91. So E[ξ] = Σ k = 1..91 k × C(99 − k, 8) / C(99, 9).

> Let me consider a simplification. I recall a useful identity for expectations of order statistics in uniform discrete selection: for selecting r distinct numbers from {1, 2, …, n}, the expected minimum is (n + 1)/(r + 1). Wait, let me verify this identity before applying it. Yes, for a uniform selection without replacement, E[min] = (n + 1)/(r + 1), so here n = 99 and r = 9, giving E[ξ] = (99 + 1)/(9 + 1) = 100/10 = 10. That seems clean, but I should double-check by computing a few terms manually to ensure consistency.

> To ensure I'm not missing anything, let me verify with a small example. Suppose n = 5 and r = 2; the expected minimum should be (5 + 1)/(2 + 1) = 2. Enumerating all C(5, 2) = 10 pairs, the minimums are 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, which average to 20/10 = 2, matching the formula. This gives me confidence the identity is correct and applicable here.

> Applying the identity to our problem, E[ξ] = (99 + 1)/(9 + 1) = 100/10 = 10. I should confirm there are no hidden assumptions violated; the selection is uniform without replacement from a consecutive integer set, so the conditions for the identity are satisfied. Therefore, the expected value of the smallest number is 10.

The expected value of the smallest number in a randomly selected 9-element subset of {1, 2, …, 99} is **10**. This follows from the general formula for the expected minimum of k distinct numbers chosen uniformly from {1, 2, …, n}, which is [(n+1)/(k+1)]. Here, n = 99 and k = 9, so the expected minimum is [(99+1)/(9+1)] = 10.

---

## Step-by-step solution

### Step 1: Understand the problem

We are selecting 9 distinct numbers from the set M = {1, 2, …, 99}. Let ξ be the smallest number in the selected subset. We need to find the expected value of ξ, denoted as E.

---

### Step 2: General formula for expected minimum

For a set of (n) distinct numbers, the expected value of the minimum of (k) randomly selected distinct numbers is given by:

E[min] = [(n + 1)/(k + 1)]
This formula arises from symmetry and linearity of expectation, and it applies when selections are uniform and without replacement.

---

### Step 3: Apply the formula to the given problem

In this problem, (n = 99) and (k = 9). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

E[ξ] = [(99 + 1)/(9 + 1)] = [100/10] = 10

---

### Step 4: Verification (optional)

To verify, consider a smaller example: choose 2 numbers from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The expected minimum is [(5+1)/(2+1)] = 2. Enumerating all 10 pairs, the minimums are 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, which average to 2, confirming the formula.

---

## Conclusion

The expected value of the smallest number in a randomly selected 9-element subset of ({1, 2, …, 99}) is **10**.

Few-shot prompting

The standard few-shot prompting strategy was introduced with GPT-3. Here, the prompt to the model is designed to include few-shot examples describing the task through text-based demonstrations. These demonstrations are typically encoded as input–output pairs. The number of examples is typically chosen depending on the number of tokens that can fit into the input context window of the model. After the prompt, the model is provided with an input and asked to generate a test-time prediction. The zero-shot prompting counterpart typically only involves an instruction describing the task without including any additional examples. Few-shot performance appears to be an emergent abilityfor many tasks — that is, an ability that is non-existent in small models but rapidly improves above random performance beyond a certain model size.

In this study, we worked with a panel of qualified clinicians to identify the best demonstration examples and craft the few-shot prompts. Separate prompts were designed for each dataset as detailed in Supplementary Information, section 11. The number of few-shot demonstrations varied depending on the dataset. Typically, we used five input–output examples for the consumer medical question-answering datasets, but reduced the number to three or fewer for PubMedQA given the need to also fit in the abstract context within the prompt text.

Chain-of-thought prompting

COTinvolves augmenting each few-shot example in the prompt with a step-by-step breakdown and a coherent set of intermediate reasoning steps towards the final answer. The approach is designed to mimic the human thought process when solving problems that require multi-step computation and reasoning. COT prompting can elicit reasoning abilities in sufficiently LLMs and dramatically improve performance on tasks such as mathematical problems. Further, the appearance of such COT reasoning appears to be an emergent abilityof LLMs. COT prompting has been used to achieve breakthrough LLM performance on several STEM benchmarks.

Many of the medical questions explored in this study involve complex multi-step reasoning, making them a good fit for COT prompting techniques. Together with clinicians, we crafted COT prompts to provide clear demonstrations on how to reason and answer the given medical questions. Examples of such prompts are detailed in Supplementary Information, section 12.

Behavioural experiments

Our work involved 7 humans experiments in total (see Table 3 and Supplementary Methods for additional details). Experiments 1 and 2 consisted respectively of solving the new versions of the CRT and Linda/Bill problems generated for the present study. Experiments 3 and 4 consisted respectively of solving the new versions of the CRT and Linda/Bill problems, formulated in the way supposed to prompt more analytical forms of reasoning (e.g. starting the answer by 'Let's think step by step' or asking the conjunction question by mentioning 'mathematically speaking'). Experiment 5 and 6 consisted respectively of solving the new versions of the CRT and Linda/Bill problems, but this time the question was preceded by a correctly solved example of the same kind of question; in the CRT, participants were presented with a solved example was the corresponding question of old CRT item; concerning the L/B problems, the examples were drawn from the same pool of the new items. The average task durations ranged from 6'59" to 14'05". Of note, the presence of catch trials across experiments allowed us to assess that participants displayed overall a good level of concentration, and thus we opted for not excluding any subject from the analyses.

### Diagnostic reasoning prompts reveal the potential for large language model interpretability in medicine [^116vroU9]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence systems trained on large amounts of text data that learn complex language patterns and syntactical relationships to both interpret passages and generate text output, LLMs have received widespread attention for their human-like performance on a wide variety of text-generating tasks. Within medicine, initial efforts have demonstrated that LLMs can write clinical notes, pass standardized medical exams, and draft responses to patient questions. In order to integrate LLMs more directly into clinical care, it is imperative to better understand their clinical reasoning capabilities.

Clinical reasoning is a set of problem-solving processes specifically designed for diagnosis and management of a patient's medical condition. Commonly used diagnostic techniques include differential diagnosis formation, intuitive reasoning, analytical reasoning, and Bayesian inference. Early assessments of the clinical reasoning abilities of LLMs have been limited, studying model responses to multiple-choice questions –. More recent work has focused on free-response clinical questions and suggests that newer LLMs, such as GPT-4, show promise in diagnosis of challenging clinical cases.

Prompt engineering is emerging as a discipline in response to the phenomena that LLMs can perform substantially differently depending on how questions and prompts are posed to them. Advanced prompting techniques have demonstrated improved performance on a range of tasks, while also providing insight into how LLMs came to a conclusion (as demonstrated by Wei et al. and Lightman et al. in arithmetic reasoning, common sense reasoning, and symbolic reasoning). A notable example is Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which involves instructing the LLM to divide its task into smaller reasoning steps and then complete the task step-by-step. Given that clinical reasoning tasks regularly use step-by-step processes, CoT prompts modified to reflect the cognitive processes taught to and utilized by clinicians might elicit better understanding of LLM performance on clinical reasoning tasks.

Step 3: Familiarize yourself with the ML methods used. The next step is to understand the ML methods that the authors have used to solve the problem. Many papers will provide a brief overview of the methods used (in clinical or applied journals), but it is important to have a good understanding of the underlying concepts. It is critical to familiarize yourself with some of these terminologies presented in Table 1. There are many papers that explain these terminologies in a very simple manner. It is also important to understand the key issues in building ML (Figure 1) models and what the authors did to address these at each step.

Table 1.
ML terminologies

Figure 1.
Steps to build a machine learning model. Problem formulation: The first step is to clearly define the problem that you want to solve. This involves defining the inputs and outputs of your model, as well as the type of problem you are trying to solve (classification, regression, clustering, etc). It is important to have a clear understanding of the problem you are trying to solve before you start building a model. Data collection: Once you have formulated the problem, the next step is to collect the relevant data. This may involve scraping data from websites, downloading data sets from public repositories, or collecting data through surveys or experiments. It is important to collect enough data to train your model and validate its performance. Data preparation: After collecting the data, you will need to clean and preprocess it. This involves removing any irrelevant data, dealing with missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for ML algorithms. It also includes dividing the data set into training, validation, and test cohorts. This step can take a lot of time and effort, but it is essential for building an accurate and effective model. Feature engineering: Feature engineering is the process of selecting and transforming the input variables (features) in a way that will improve the performance of the model. This may involve selecting the most relevant features, transforming them into a different representation (eg, using one-hot encoding), or creating new features based on existing ones. Feature engineering can have a significant impact on the performance of the model. Model selection: Once you have prepared the data and engineered the features, the next step is to select a suitable ML algorithm. This involves choosing the type of algorithm (eg, decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines) and the specific parameters of the algorithm. This step requires some knowledge of ML and experience with different algorithms. Model training: After selecting the algorithm, the next step is to train the model on the prepared data. This involves feeding the input data into the algorithm and adjusting the model parameters to optimize its performance. This step can take a lot of time and computational resources, especially for large data sets and complex models. Model evaluation: Once the model has been trained, the next step is to evaluate its performance on a separate test set of data. This involves measuring metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to assess the performance of the model. It is important to test the model on data that it has not seen before to ensure that it can be generalized to new data. Model optimization: If the model performance is not satisfactory, then the next step is to optimize the model. This involves tweaking the model parameters, changing the algorithm, or modifying the feature engineering process to improve the model's performance. This step may require several iterations until the desired level of performance is achieved. Model deployment: Once you have built a satisfactory model, the final step is to deploy it in a production environment. This may involve integrating the model into a web application, creating an application programming interface for other developers to use, or deploying it as a stand-alone application. It is important to ensure that the model is well documented and tested thoroughly before it is deployed.

自2011年以来，训练方式发生了转折性改变，以小组为基础的干预被加入治疗领域中。总而言之，小组干预对运动表现产生了很大的影响。

虽然尚不能通过数据分析结果来决定最佳的小组规模，但由一名治疗师引导下，4～6名儿童的小组规模的干预是易于管理和有效的模式，必要时可增加一名助理。 268, 273, 280, 281 限制规模的小组训练可以方便指导者在参与者间走动，以此监控小组动态和个人进步情况。一项研究发现， 280 运动能力较差的儿童在大组活动中会感到更焦虑。然而，这些儿童在大组中处理同伴问题的能力确实得到了提高，这是非常有用的生活技能。因此，应该仔细考虑小组规模的设置，但也要根据年龄、疾病的严重程度、小组成员和干预的目标谨慎设定。

5.2.3 书写

对于DCD患者，尤其是DCD儿童，书写是一个特殊的问题；实际上许多患儿都专门针对书写问题接受了治疗。

指南第一版发布后，尚没有DCD儿童书写干预的论文发表，因此第一版这方面的内容暂时不变。仅一项病例研究 264 报道了书写技能训练的相关内容，但只涉及3名儿童。经过强化训练后（每周2次，每次 45分钟；以及持续13周的家庭作业），其中2名儿童有所改善。

虽然智能手机、平板电脑和笔记本电脑等现代技术使用有所增加，并且在某种程度上（取决于文化背景和社会环境）儿童对书写的依赖程度有所下降，但由书写障碍引发的参与问题仍是DCD儿童面临的一个严峻考验。操作键盘和鼠标也是精细运动能力，这可能会给DCD儿童造成问题，他们可能需要接受训练。为防止DCD儿童书写或操作电脑问题带来的对学业成绩的影响（被贴上差生或学习成绩差的标签），可建议进行键盘和平板电脑操作的同步训练。

### Six steps to fast-track insurance approval for bariatric surgery [^115zS2CR]. Obesity Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Most of the health-insurers approve bariatric surgery for patients according to the NIH standards, while others only approve the surgery if the patient has a BMI > 50. Therefore, it is important for the physician to know and carefully follow the various criteria of different insurance companies. We suggest 6 steps to fast-track insurance approval: 1) a multidisciplinary team; 2) 6-month diet; 3) comprehensive medical evaluation; 4) flexibility and consistency; 5) analysis of each patient indication; 6) quality of cost-effectiveness and long-term monitoring and benefits. In the event that an insurance company rejects the request for surgery, a blueprint of an appeal letter is very important. The appeal letter should stress the indications and benefits of surgery for your patients. Insurance company criteria may differ from the NIH guidelines. Irrespective of this, the steps outlined will help speed the insurance approval process and reduce paperwork and confusion. Most often, rejections stem from letters that were not written clearly or that lacked one or more of the elements delineated above. If the surgeon follows the 6 steps described, he/she should meet less disappointment, as in our experience that went from 50% to 90% success because of better communication with insurance and more appropriate paperwork.

Clinical imaging protocols play an important role in the provision of high-quality care in nuclear medicine. It is imperative that all nuclear medicine facilities have protocols for every procedure performed. However, creating protocols that are detailed, unambiguous, and consistent is often easier said than done. Properly written protocols help to ensure that nuclear medicine procedures are performed in a standardized, reproducible manner so that patients receive high-quality care. This 2-part article provides technologists with a framework for composing comprehensive protocols. Part 1 discusses the secrets to successfully composing protocols ensuring they are detailed and step-by-step along with the importance of basing protocols on evidence from published guidelines and peer-reviewed literature. The components and important aspects of clinical imaging protocols are detailed.

### An explainable machine learning-based phenomapping strategy for adaptive predictive enrichment in randomized clinical trials [^115tKJ1w]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Once a predictive model had been generated, and our analysis in the testing set had met the criteria for possible heterogeneity in the treatment effect with sufficient power for the primary outcome, we chose to proceed with predictive enrichment. Over the subsequent period (time between the last and next interim analyses), the model was prospectively applied to all trial candidates screened after the enrichment model was identified. For example, a model trained at interim analysis timepoint #1 was applied to individuals screened between the interim analysis timepoints #1 and #2 to furnish a probability of enrollment, with all original trial participants during this period considered eligible candidates. For all candidates, the probability of being enrolled was conditioned on their predicted individualized benefit, ultimately enriching the population at the level defined during the last interim analysis sample size calculation. Alternatively, if there was no evidence of heterogeneous treatment effect, or the proposed enrichment in enrollment would not be adequately powered at a sample size equal to or lower than the originally planned one, we proceeded as originally planned and continued with standard enrollment for that period without predictive enrichment. Given the stochastic nature of the algorithm, all simulations were repeated r = 10 times.

In recent years, many new clinical diagnostic tools have been developed using complicated machine learning methods. Irrespective of how a diagnostic tool is derived, it must be evaluated using a 3-step process of deriving, validating, and establishing the clinical effectiveness of the tool. Machine learning-based tools should also be assessed for the type of machine learning model used and its appropriateness for the input data type and data set size. Machine learning models also generally have additional prespecified settings called hyperparameters, which must be tuned on a data set independent of the validation set. On the validation set, the outcome against which the model is evaluated is termed the reference standard. The rigor of the reference standard must be assessed, such as against a universally accepted gold standard or expert grading.

### How do you design randomised trials for smaller populations? A framework [^112mQaNe]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

How should we approach trial design when we can get some, but not all, of the way to the numbers required for a randomised phase III trial?We present an ordered framework for designing randomised trials to address the problem when the ideal sample size is considered larger than the number of participants that can be recruited in a reasonable time frame. Staying with the frequentist approach that is well accepted and understood in large trials, we propose a framework that includes small alterations to the design parameters. These aim to increase the numbers achievable and also potentially reduce the sample size target. The first step should always be to attempt to extend collaborations, consider broadening eligibility criteria and increase the accrual time or follow-up time. The second set of ordered considerations are the choice of research arm, outcome measures, power and target effect. If the revised design is still not feasible, in the third step we propose moving from two- to one-sided significance tests, changing the type I error rate, using covariate information at the design stage, re-randomising patients and borrowing external information. We discuss the benefits of some of these possible changes and warn against others. We illustrate, with a worked example based on the Euramos-1 trial, the application of this framework in designing a trial that is feasible, while still providing a good evidence base to evaluate a research treatment. This framework would allow appropriate evaluation of treatments when large-scale phase III trials are not possible, but where the need for high-quality randomised data is as pressing as it is for common diseases.

### Model selection: finding the right fit [^113h3SVM]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

There are numerous possible goals for building statistical models. Those statistical goals, the associated model types, and each statistical tool involved in model building come with its own assumptions and requirements. In turn, these requirements must be met if we are to ensure that our models produce meaningful, interpretable results. However, beyond these technical details is the intuition, and the additional set of tools and algorithms, used by the statistician, to build the contextually appropriate model: not only must we build an interpretable model, we must build a model that answers the particular question at hand and addresses the particular goal we have in mind. In this column we discuss the methods by which statisticians build models for description, risk factor identification, and prediction.

### In-person vs. web-based administration of a problem-solving skills intervention for parents of children with cancer: report of a randomized noninferiority trial [^115EaiPe]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

2.3.1 Standard (F2F) BI

This intervention was delivered as in previous trials. BI has been developed as an appealing, easily understood approach to the teaching and coaching of problem-solving skills. A comprehensive manual has been developed to guide the interventionist, along with worksheets and attractive graphic materials for the caregiver. The term "Bright" signifies optimism, and instilling the belief that problems can be solved, which is considered an essential component for successful implementation of the intervention. The acronym 'IDEAS' is used as a mnemonic for the 5 essential steps of our problem solving approach, with each letter signifying a step: I (Identify the problem), D (Determine the options), E (Evaluate/choose the best option), A (Act), and S (See if it worked). Problem-solving is presented as a general coping skill applicable to many life challenges, including those commonly faced in parenting a child during cancer treatment. The intervention is administered in 8 1-hour F2F individual sessions. Guided by the manual, the sessions are designed to follow a set sequence: session 1: Rapport building, understanding relevant personal and medical history, introduction of the BI program and worksheets; session 2: Review of the BI program and worksheets, and initial application to a real problem; sessions 3–7: continued application of BI to identified problems and promotion of problem-solving strategies and skills in vivo; and session 8: review of BI principles, relapse prevention, and termination.

Interventions were delivered by research assistants (RAs) with graduate education in clinical psychology or related fields, under the supervision of the site principal investigators (PI's) who were all licensed psychologists. RAs were trained in and delivered both the F2F and web-based formats to minimize differences in personal style. Bilingual RAs worked with Spanish-speaking participants using Spanish language materials. The interventionists were initially trained together as a group before the trial opened to accrual. Site PI's provided weekly supervision to ensure adequate therapeutic delivery and fidelity to the treatment manual. All sessions were digitally recorded for review of treatment integrity (discussed below).

### Potential impact of a pass or fail United States medical licensing exam step 1 scoring system on radiology residency applications [^113PAKEt]. Academic Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

To assess the anticipated impact of the change in United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scoring from numerical to pass or fail on the future selection of radiology residents.

Materials and Methods

An anonymous electronic 14-item survey was distributed to 308 members of the Association of Program Directors in Radiology and included questions regarding the anticipated importance of various application metrics when Step 1 becomes pass or fail. Secondary analyses compared responses based on the current use of a Step 1 scoring screen.

Results

Eighty eight respondents (28.6% [88/308]) completed the survey. Most (64% [56/88]) noted that the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK) score will likely be one of the top three most important factors in assessing applicants, followed by class ranking or quartile (51% [45/88]) and the Medical Student Performance Evaluation/Dean's Letter (42% [37/88]). Over 90% (82/88) of respondents anticipate potentially or definitively requiring Step 2 CK scores before application review, and 50% (44/88) of respondents anticipate extending interview invites at a later date to receive Step 2 CK scores. These results did not significantly differ between programs who currently use a Step 1 scoring screen and those who do not.

Conclusion

As Step 1 transitions from a numerical score to pass or fail, radiology residency program directors will likely rely on Step 2 CK scores as an objective and standardized metric to screen applicants. Further investigation is needed to identify other objective metrics to evaluate applicants before Step 1 becomes pass or fail.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^112pSeFT]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### Systematic reviews and meta-analyses in cardiac surgery: rules of the road-part 1 [^112rUo3v]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The number of cardiac surgical meta-analyses and systematic reviews published in the last decades has constantly increased, paralleling the exponential growth observed in virtually all other medical fields. Meta-analyses are open to methodological flaws, however, if best practices are not strictly followed. Assessment of the appropriateness of the research question is a crucial first step. Once a protocol has been developed, this should be registered before the work is initiated. The cornerstone of any systematic review or meta-analysis is a rigorous, comprehensive, and most of all reproducible, search that follows a prespecified and clear strategy. Eligibility criteria must be discussed and agreed upon in advance to guide final study selection, which ultimately lays the foundation for subsequent data extraction. In case of missing or partially reported data, the authors of the original papers should be contacted. Adherence to rigorous methodological rules at each of these stages will warrant availability of good quality data for formal statistical analyses. The aim of the first part of this expert review is to discuss the limits and pitfalls of the meta-analytic approach and provide guidance on how to perform trial-level meta-analyses, with particular reference to the identification of an appropriate research question, the definition and registration of the protocol, the search strategy, the study selection, and the data abstraction.

### Artificial intelligence tool development: what clinicians need to know? [^1138z21a]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Digital medicine and smart healthcare will not be realised without the cognizant participation of clinicians. Artificial intelligence (AI) today primarily involves computers or machines designed to simulate aspects of human intelligence using mathematically designed neural networks, although early AI systems relied on a variety of non-neural network techniques. With the increased complexity of the neural layers, deep machine learning (ML) can self-learn and augment many human tasks that require decision-making on the basis of multiple sources of data. Clinicians are important stakeholders in the use of AI and ML tools. The review questions are as follows: What is the typical process of AI tool development in the full cycle? What are the important concepts and technical aspects of each step? This review synthesises a targeted literature review and reports and summarises online structured materials to present a succinct explanation of the whole development process of AI tools. The development of AI tools in healthcare involves a series of cyclical processes: (1) identifying clinical problems suitable for AI solutions, (2) forming project teams or collaborating with experts, (3) organising and curating relevant data, (4) establishing robust physical and virtual infrastructure, and computer systems' architecture that support subsequent stages, (5) exploring AI neural networks on open access platforms before making a new decision, (6) validating AI/ML models, (7) registration, (8) clinical deployment and continuous performance monitoring and (9) improving the AI ecosystem ensures its adaptability to evolving clinical needs. A sound understanding of this would help clinicians appreciate the development of AI tools and engage in codesigning, evaluating and monitoring the tools. This would facilitate broader use and closer regulation of AI/ML tools in healthcare settings.

### Bringing your idea to the market: a primer for plastic surgeons [^113XQGxf]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

The progress of biotechnology, medical instruments, and applied sciences contributes to a rapidly expanding space for the advancement of the medical field. Surgeons experience first-hand the limitations of current medical devices and thus have unique insight into problems that could be solved with new products. The process of turning an idea into a product capable of success in the marketplace, however, is often unfamiliar to surgeons. The authors seek to illuminate this process and provide an ordered list of tasks that can make bringing ideas to market more achievable for surgeons. The first step in this process is the generation and protection of a new idea. Next, the process of making an idea into a product is outlined. This phase involves team assembly, business planning, and product development. Market research and valuation are key to understanding how a product can be applied in the market, and meticulous research during this phase allows for informed decision-making that will help secure funding down the road. Finally, various options for financing are discussed and compared to help surgeon-entrepreneurs find an option that best fits their project, and steps to maximize leverage are described. The development of new products can be a complicated process for surgeons. Organized into four phases, with ordered instructional steps to advance through each phase, the process of bringing an idea to the market is clarified. Facilitating this process will possibly contribute to the continual improvement of medical and surgical abilities through the introduction of new devices and technologies.

### Foundations of the minimal clinically important difference for imaging [^113wSjG4]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

This article develops a generic conceptual framework for defining and validating the concept of minimal clinically important difference. We propose 3 approaches. The first uses statistical descriptions of the population ("distribution based"), the second relies on experts ("opinion based"), and a third is based on sequential hypothesis formation and testing ("predictive/data driven based"). The first 2 approaches serve as proxies for the third, which is an experimentally driven approach, asking such questions as "What carries the least penalty?" or "What imparts the greatest gain?" As an experimental approach, it has the expected drawbacks, including the need for greater resources, and the need to tolerate trial and error en route, compared to the other 2 models.

### The USMLE® STEP 1 pass or fail era of the vascular surgery residency application process: implications for structural bias and recommendations [^113QByry]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

United States Medical Licensing Examination® (USMLE®) STEP 1 score reporting has been changed to a binary pass/fail format since January 26, 2022. The motives behind this change were (1) the questionable validity of using USMLE STEP 1 as a screening tool during the candidate selection process and (2) the negative impact of using standardized examination scores as an initial gatekeeping threshold for the underrepresented in medicine (URiM) candidates applying to graduate medical education programs, given their generally lower mean standardized exams scores compared to non-URiM students. The USMLE administrators justified this change as a tactic to enhance the overall educational experience for all students and to increase the representation of URiM groups. Moreover, they advised the program directors (PDs) to give more attention to other important qualities and components such as the applicant's personality traits, leadership roles and other extracurricular accomplishments, as part of a holistic evaluation strategy. At this early stage, it is unclear how this change will impact Vascular Surgery Integrated residency (VSIR) programs. Several questions are outstanding, most importantly, how VSIR PDs will evaluate applicants absent the variable which heretofore was the primary screening tool. Our previously published survey showed that VSIR PDs will move their attention to other measures such as USMLE STEP 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK) and letters of recommendation during the VSIR selection process. Furthermore, more emphasis on subjective measures such as the applicant's medical school rank and extracurricular student activities is expected. Given the expected higher weight of USMLE STEP 2CK in the selection process than ever, many anticipate that medical students will dedicate more of their limited time to its preparation at the expense of both clinical and nonclinical activities. Potentially leaving less time to explore specialty pathways and to determine whether Vascular Surgeons is the appropriate career for them. The critical juncture in the VSIR candidate evaluation paradigm presents an opportunity to thoughtfully transform the process via current (Standardized Letter of Recommendation, USMLE STEP 2CK, and clinical research) and future (Emotional Intelligence, Structure Interview and Personality Assessment) measures which constitute a framework to follow in the USMLE STEP 1 pass/fail era.

### Guiding principles for resident remediation: recommendations of the CORD remediation task force [^114dn6Ud]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Remediation of residents is a common problem and requires organized, goal-directed efforts to solve. The Council of Emergency Medicine Residency Directors (CORD) has created a task force to identify best practices for remediation and to develop guidelines for resident remediation. Faculty members of CORD volunteered to participate in periodic meetings, organized discussions and literature reviews to develop overall guidelines for resident remediation and in a collaborative authorship of this article identifying best practices for remediation. The task force recommends that residency programs: 1. Make efforts to understand the challenges of remediation, and recognize that the goal is successful correction of deficits, but that some deficits are not remediable. 2. Make efforts aimed at early identification of residents requiring remediation. 3. Create objective, achievable goals for remediation and maintain strict adherence to the terms of those plans, including planning for resolution when setting goals for remediation. 4. Involve the institution's Graduate Medical Education Committee (GMEC) early in remediation to assist with planning, obtaining resources, and documentation. 5. Involve appropriate faculty and educate those faculty into the role and terms of the specific remediation plan. 6. Ensure appropriate documentation of all stages of remediation. Resident remediation is frequently necessary and specific steps may be taken to justify, document, facilitate, and objectify the remediation process. Best practices for each step are identified and reported by the task force.

### Practical guide to the idea, development and exploration stages of the IDEAL framework and recommendations [^111nfkuK]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Evaluation of new surgical procedures is a complex process challenged by evolution of technique, operator learning curves, the possibility of variable procedural quality, and strong treatment preferences among patients and clinicians. Preliminary studies that address these issues are needed to prepare for a successful randomized trial. The IDEAL (Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment and Long-term follow-up) Framework and Recommendations provide an integrated step-by-step evaluation pathway that can help investigators achieve this.

Methods

A practical guide was developed for investigators evaluating new surgical interventions in the earlier phases before a randomized trial (corresponding to stages 1, 2a and 2b of the IDEAL Framework). The examples and practical tips included were chosen and agreed upon by consensus among authors with experience either in designing and conducting IDEAL format studies, or in helping others to design such studies. They address the most common challenges encountered by authors attempting to follow the IDEAL Recommendations.

Results

A decision aid has been created to help identify the IDEAL stage of an innovation from literature reports, with advice on how to design and report the IDEAL study formats discussed, along with the ethical and scientific rationale for specific recommendations.

Conclusion

The guide helps readers and researchers to understand and implement the IDEAL Framework and Recommendations to improve the quality of evidence supporting surgical innovation.

An efficient phase I trial is a crucial step in developing a new drug in a safe and timely manner. The main objective of a phase I trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose in order to recommend the dose for a phase II trial. There are many designs that are implemented in phase I trials. Rule-based designs such as the traditional 3 + 3 method and rolling six design are easy to implement and assess for safety using a conservative approach. Model-based designs such as the continual reassessment method and the time-to-event continual reassessment method use mathematical models to increase the precision of dose estimation. The advantages and shortcomings of these designs, along with other designs, are reviewed.

### Fundamental limits to learning closed-form mathematical models from data [^115B4Dpa]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Given a finite and noisy dataset generated with a closed-form mathematical model, when is it possible to learn the true generating model from the data alone? This is the question we investigate here. We show that this model-learning problem displays a transition from a low-noise phase in which the true model can be learned, to a phase in which the observation noise is too high for the true model to be learned by any method. Both in the low-noise phase and in the high-noise phase, probabilistic model selection leads to optimal generalization to unseen data. This is in contrast to standard machine learning approaches, including artificial neural networks, which in this particular problem are limited, in the low-noise phase, by their ability to interpolate. In the transition region between the learnable and unlearnable phases, generalization is hard for all approaches including probabilistic model selection.

2 HSMM‐MVPA APPLIED TO EXPERIMENTAL DATA: LEE ET AL. (2015)

2.1 Study description

Figure 2 illustrates the two experimental conditions and experimental sequence used by Lee et al. (2015). In an fMRI scanner subjects alternated between studying a new arithmetic rule to fill in cell of a diagram and solving a problem where they had to apply the new rule (each rule was just applied once). While the textual and graphical complexity was constant, in some cases the critical information was in a graphical example (Figure 2 a) of the rule and in others it was in a verbal instruction (Figure 2 b) on how to apply the rule. After studying the instruction, participants had to apply it to a problem presented identically for either study condition (Figure 2 c). This defined the two conditions of the experiment — Example and Verbal. Figure 2 d illustrates the detailed structure of the experiment which we broke into five phases, for which we have recorded onset and offset:
Study: Self‐paced study ended by clicking a done button.
Delay: A fixed 5‐s duration repetition‐detection task and a half‐second fixation. In the repetition‐detection task, letters appeared on the screen at a rate of 1 every 1.25 s. Participants were told to click a match button whenever the same letter appeared twice consecutively. This was intended to discourage participants from extending their encoding of the instructions and to separate study and solution periods.
Solve: Self‐paced problem solution ended by clicking a done button.
Respond: A self‐paced response period that subjects had to enter their answer on a keypad followed by a 1 s feedback. Subjects were encouraged to have the answer ready to key quickly.
Detect: A 6–12 s repetition‐detection phase followed by the fixation that preceded the next problem. As with the repetition‐detection task in the delay period, letters appeared on the screen at a rate of 1 every 1.25 s. Participants were told to click a match button whenever the same letter appeared twice consecutively. This was intended to provide a baseline period of activity with minimal cognitive demand.

### Managing interruptions to improve diagnostic decision-making: strategies and recommended research agenda [^114ZLXEh]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Checklists

Checklists could improve recovery from interruptions because they support prospective memory for tasks that involve remembering to do something in the future(e.g. several sequential tasks of ensuring follow-up of abnormal test results). Checklists may also improve performance because they "provide an alternative to reliance on intuition and memory in clinical problem solving", (p307) where both processes may be compromised by interruptions. Indeed, the use of a checklist resulted in improved diagnostic accuracy for medical residents who were tasked with diagnosing on a cardiopulmonary simulator.

Diagnostic decision-making is an iterative process with many steps. For example, one study provides examples of checklists specific to diagnosis and includes a sequence of steps (e.g. "Obtain your own complete medical history", "generate initial hypotheses", "pause to reflect", "embark on a plan", and "ensure a pathway for follow-up"). (p309) Highlighting the "pause to reflect" step in this checklist, we encourage clinicians to take a moment after being interrupted to consider any possible biases or heuristics (i.e. mental shortcuts) that may have adversely influenced their judgment and reasoning. In medicine, this is also known as a "diagnostic time-out". Prospective hindsight is one useful technique that can be used during this time-out, which asks individuals to imagine a future where the current diagnosis is wrong, motivating clinicians to take time to reflect and contemplate alternative diagnoses and utilize decision support tools if necessary.

Additionally, this leads us to question whether interruptions are more or less likely to be deleterious at different points in the process, an idea we return to in the " Future Directions " section. While there is promising evidence for the effectiveness of checklists in medicine, more research is needed within diagnosis to better understand how checklists can impact clinical decision-making and particularly how checklists may be able to mitigate errors caused by interruptions.

Results

General requirements to a systematic series of properties

The introductory remarks above instruct one to look not for a single base property Y, which cannot be unique or universal, but for a systematic series of base properties Y 0, Y 1,… By 'systematic' we mean the following conditions: (1) inclusiveness, that is, the properties in the series should provide strictly more detailed information about the network structure, which is equivalent to requiring that networks that have property Y d (Y d -random graphs), d > 0, should also have properties Y d ′ for all d ′ = 0, 1, …, d −1; and (2) convergence, that is, there should exist property Y D in the series that fully characterizes the adjacency matrix of any given network, which is equivalent to requiring that Y D -random graphs is only one graph — the given network itself. If these Y -series satisfy the conditions above, then whatever property X is deemed important now or later in whatever real network, we can always standardize the problem of explanation of X by reformulating it as the following question: what is the minimal value of d in the above Y -series such that property Y d explains X? By convergence, such d should exist; and by inclusiveness, networks that have property Y d ′ with any d ′ = d, d +1, …, D, also have property X. Assuming that properties Y d are once explained, the described procedure provides an explanation of any other property of interest X.

### Pitfalls of large language models in medical ethics reasoning [^115VDg7s]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

"If it walks like a duck… " This saying illustrates System 1 thinking. In the dual-process theory framework, System 1 operates rapidly, associatively, and heuristically, often with emotional undertones in humans, while System 2 functions more slowly, deliberately, and analytically –. In complex medical contexts, System 1 thinking can lead to overly simplistic conclusions. Just as humans may inappropriately rely on System 1 thinking, large language models (LLMs) may also default to this sometimes-flawed intuitive thinking. This is true even for LLMs optimized for reasoning like ChatGPT-o3, which are influenced by familiar patterns and may miss critical nuances.

In recent tests with LLMs, we noted a recurring pattern: these models frequently fail to recognize twists or subtleties. Instead, they revert to responses rooted in familiar associations. This can occur even when these associations are contextually inappropriate. Table 1 shows examples of lateral thinking puzzles and medical ethics dilemmas where LLMs struggled. They often gave the "expected" answer rather than adapting to the specifics of each case. Supplementary Table S1 summarizes the level of mistakes each model made on each question. Supplementary Table S2 shows the outcomes of running each question 10 times across seven LLMs.

Table 1
Examples of lateral thinking puzzles and medical ethics scenarios where large language models (LLMs) failed to recognize critical twists

Efforts have been made to cultivate System 2 reasoning ("Chain of Thought" processes). However, LLMs may still follow high-probability sequences identified during training. This tendency is especially problematic in familiar ethical dilemmas or well-known puzzles. They tend to produce clichéd responses, even when the context demands more nuanced reasoning.

Human System 1 thinking is efficient and often reliable. However, it is also adaptive and shaped by emotional and contextual understanding. Humans may recognize when a situation requires more analytical thought — System 2 thinking. They shift their approach accordingly. Similarly, OpenAI recently introduced ChatGPT-o3, designed to spend more time thinking before answering. It aims to reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems. While this is a step toward System 2 thinking, these models still need further refinement to handle nuanced scenarios.

See, " How do I store HumatroPen 6 mg?" in Section 1 of this Instructions for Use for more information.
When it is time for the next scheduled dose, go to Section 3, and repeat Steps 3A through 3D.
When using the Hidden Needle Cover with HumatroPen 6 mg, repeat steps 1 to 10 of the Hidden Needle Cover Instructions for Use.

Commonly asked questions:

Do I need to perform the New Cartridge Setup before every dose?
No. You only need to perform the New Cartridge Set-up 1 time for each Cartridge, just before a new Cartridge is used for the first time.
The purpose of the New Cartridge Set-up is to make sure the HumatroPen 6 mg with an attached HUMATROPE 6 mg Cartridge are ready to use.
If you repeat the New Cartridge Set-up before each routine dose, you may run out of HUMATROPE early. The small amount of medicine used in the New Cartridge Set-up will not affect the amount of HUMATROPE in the Cartridge.
What should I do if the Cartridge label and Pen do not match?
Do not use the Pen if the Cartridge strength on the HUMATROPE Cartridge label does not match the number on the Pen's front housing. This is important to make sure the correct dose of HUMATROPE is given.
Contact your healthcare provider for a replacement.
What should I do if the HUMATROPE is not clear?
Do not use the Pen if the liquid is cloudy or contains particles. Contact your healthcare provider or call Lilly at 1-800-545-5979 or go to www.humatrope.com.
Why are there air bubbles in the Cartridge?
Air bubbles may remain in the Cartridge after mixing.
If the Pen is stored with a Needle attached, air bubbles may form in the Cartridge.

Introduction

In December 2019, clusters of a respiratory disease attributed to a potentially novel coronavirus were identified. This hypothesis was rapidly confirmed, and the virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This novel coronavirus rapidly spread across Asia, Europe, and other continents, achieving pandemic status, as determined by the World Health Organization, on March 11, 2020. As of October 2020, all parts of the world were, to varying degrees, impacted by the COVID-19 epidemic, with more than 40 million cases and 1.1 million deaths reported globally, in what can be construed as the worst pandemic since the Spanish flu (1918–1920).

Performance of stepwise evaluation for detecting subjects at risk of metabolic disorder

As the study was designed to screen the subjects at metabolic risk at every step of evaluation, proportion of these subjects showed an increasing trend across the steps, though, test of significance for these differences are not logically acceptable and thus avoided. Proportion of Subjects with BMI < 23 kg/m 2 decreased from 83.2% (n = 66,525) in the first-step to 74.8% (n = 7342) in second-step and 65.6% (n = 920) in the third-step (Table 1). Subjects with abdominal obesity increased from 14.1% (n = 11,279) in the first-step to 23.8% (n = 2336) and 28.1% (n = 394) in second and third steps, respectively (Table 1). Similarly, frequencies of hypertensive subjects increased from first to third step. Subjects with IFG (Prediabetes)/Diabetes were more prevalent in third-step than second-step evaluation [n (%); 939 (66.9) and 2431 (24.8) in third and second step, respectively] (Table 1). Frequency of elevated ALT, also, increased in third-step [n (%); 958 (68.3) and 3881 (39.5) in third and second step, respectively] (Table 1).
