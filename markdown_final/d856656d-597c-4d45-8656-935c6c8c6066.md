## Question

Can a 13 year old take coq10 for blood pressure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about CoQ10 use for blood pressure in a 13-year-old. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about pediatric blood pressure thresholds and the appropriate first-line management. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for CoQ10 in lowering blood pressure, especially in adolescents. Next, I need to check whether there are any pediatric-specific safety data or dosing guidance for CoQ10. Finally, I should weigh potential benefits against risks and align with guideline-based care to make a clear recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic and treatment framework for a 13-year-old with elevated blood pressure. In adolescents aged 13 years and older, elevated blood pressure is 120–129/ < 80 mm Hg, stage 1 hypertension is 130/80–139/89 mm Hg, and stage 2 hypertension is ≥ 140/90 mm Hg; management begins with lifestyle therapy (DASH-style diet, sodium reduction, and regular physical activity), and pharmacologic therapy is considered if blood pressure remains elevated after lifestyle efforts or if there is stage 2 hypertension or comorbidities [^116KjFEv] [^114KfiF7].

> Now, I should review the evidence for CoQ10 in blood pressure reduction. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and reliability of benefit in adults with hypertension. The most rigorous Cochrane review concludes that CoQ10 does not have a clinically significant effect on blood pressure in primary hypertension, with pooled effects of roughly −3.7 mm Hg systolic and −2.0 mm Hg diastolic and authors noting moderate-quality evidence of no meaningful benefit, which is not sufficient to recommend it as antihypertensive therapy [^113GzQuS]. Earlier, smaller studies and meta-analyses reported larger reductions, but these results are inconsistent and hampered by small samples and methodological limitations, reinforcing uncertainty rather than efficacy [^115D14Ya] [^116JxMbS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — could pediatric data change this picture? I need to check for any adolescent-specific trials of CoQ10 for blood pressure. I should double-check: the pediatric hypertension guidelines and the USPSTF review of treatment studies do not include CoQ10 as an intervention, and there are no randomized trials in adolescents demonstrating blood pressure benefit from CoQ10, which means the evidence base is adult-only and largely negative or inconclusive for clinical BP lowering [^116KjFEv] [^112h45ir].

> Next, I should review safety and pediatric considerations. General reviews describe CoQ10 as well tolerated with mostly mild gastrointestinal effects, but these data are predominantly in adults; there is no established pediatric dose for blood pressure lowering, and high-dose CoQ10 has been used in specific mitochondrial disorders in infancy and childhood as disease-specific therapy rather than for routine hypertension, so I cannot extrapolate those regimens to a healthy adolescent with primary hypertension [^115uvcK1] [^113EMQTD] [^11284bn5].

> But wait, what if someone argues for "it can't hurt" and is worth trying adjunctively? Hmm, wait a minute — without proven benefit in adolescents and with established, guideline-backed lifestyle and pharmacologic strategies, introducing an unproven supplement risks delaying effective care, incurring cost, and potentially interacting with medications; importantly, some over-the-counter and prescription agents can raise blood pressure, so adding unregulated supplements may complicate interpretation of response, reinforcing that we should prioritize evidence-based therapy and monitoring [^114KfiF7] [^117N4k3K].

> Let me consider guideline-concordant alternatives. For adolescents with persistent hypertension after lifestyle therapy, pediatric guidelines support pharmacologic therapy with agents such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, or thiazide diuretics, and the USPSTF summarizes that pediatric RCTs of antihypertensives show modest but consistent BP reductions versus placebo, which are clinically actionable; this is the appropriate pathway rather than off-label nutraceuticals [^114KfiF7] [^112h45ir].

> I should confirm the practical next steps. I will now examine the plan: ensure accurate diagnosis with proper cuff size and repeated measurements, implement DASH-style dietary patterns, sodium reduction, weight management if applicable, and at least 3–5 days per week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, then reassess blood pressure; if targets are not met or if stage 2 hypertension is present, initiate guideline-directed pharmacotherapy and monitor for adverse effects and adherence, avoiding CoQ10 for this indication [^1144VUZB] [^114KfiF7].

> Bottom line, after weighing the totality of evidence and pediatric guidance, I need to ensure the recommendation is clear: CoQ10 should not be used for blood pressure lowering in a 13-year-old because there is no adolescent evidence of benefit, adult data show no clinically meaningful effect, there is no established pediatric dose for hypertension, and guideline-based lifestyle and pharmacologic therapies are available and preferred [^113GzQuS] [^1144VUZB] [^112h45ir].

---

No, CoQ10 is **not recommended** for blood pressure management in a 13-year-old because there is **no pediatric evidence** supporting its use [^112h45ir] and adult data show only small, inconsistent effects [^113GzQuS]. Pediatric hypertension should be managed with **lifestyle changes** [^1144VUZB] and, if needed, **guideline-directed medications** [^1118iARc]. CoQ10 is generally safe, but it should only be considered under a pediatrician's supervision, not as a primary treatment.

---

## Evidence for CoQ10 in blood pressure management

Adult studies show **modest, inconsistent effects** — typically 3–10 mmHg reductions in systolic pressure and 2–7 mmHg in diastolic — with notable heterogeneity and limited quality [^115D14Ya] [^113GzQuS]. Pediatric evidence is **absent**; there are no randomized trials in children or adolescents, so efficacy and safety for hypertension are unproven.

---

## Safety considerations for CoQ10 supplementation in adolescents

General safety: CoQ10 is usually well tolerated; mild gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort) and rare insomnia or rash have been reported [^115uvcK1]. Pediatric safety: Specific adolescent safety data are lacking; caution is warranted given developmental differences and potential drug interactions [^notfound].

---

## Current pediatric hypertension guidelines

First-line management is **lifestyle modification** — DASH-style diet, sodium restriction, weight management, and regular physical activity [^1144VUZB]. Pharmacologic therapy: If lifestyle fails or hypertension is severe, use guideline-directed antihypertensives (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, or thiazide diuretics) [^114KfiF7]. CoQ10 is **not mentioned** in pediatric guidelines for hypertension management [^notfound].

---

## Potential risks and interactions

- **Drug interactions**: CoQ10 may interact with antihypertensives (e.g. beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers), potentially altering blood pressure control or medication efficacy [^notfound].

- **Unknown long-term effects**: Chronic use in adolescents is not studied; long-term safety and effects on growth and development are unknown [^notfound].

---

## Clinical recommendations

- **Do not use as primary therapy**: CoQ10 should not be used as primary or adjunctive therapy for hypertension in adolescents without pediatric evidence [^notfound].

- **Lifestyle modifications first**: Emphasize diet, exercise, weight management, and sodium reduction [^1144VUZB].

- **Pharmacologic therapy if needed**: Use guideline-directed medications if lifestyle changes are insufficient [^114KfiF7].

- **Physician supervision**: If CoQ10 is considered for another indication, use only under pediatrician supervision with monitoring for adverse effects and interactions.

## Summary of evidence

| **Aspect** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|
| Efficacy in adolescents | No pediatric evidence; adult data show modest, inconsistent effects [^113GzQuS] [^115D14Ya] |
| Safety in adolescents | Limited data; generally well tolerated in adults [^115uvcK1] |
| Guidelines | Not recommended by pediatric hypertension guidelines [^notfound] |
| Recommendation | Do not use for blood pressure management in adolescents without pediatric evidence |

---

CoQ10 is **not recommended** for blood pressure management in a 13-year-old because of the absence of pediatric evidence and only modest, inconsistent adult data. Management should focus on **lifestyle changes** and, if needed, **guideline-directed medications**, with any CoQ10 use restricted to physician supervision for other indications.

### Co-enzyme Q10 supplementation for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^114WY5wZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the number one cause of death and disability worldwide and public health interventions focus on modifiable risk factors, such as diet. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant that is naturally synthesised by the body and can also be taken as a dietary supplement. Studies have shown that a CoQ10 deficiency is associated with cardiovascular disease.

Objectives

To determine the effects of coenzyme Q10 supplementation as a single ingredient for the primary prevention of CVD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 11); MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to November week 3 2013); EMBASE (Ovid, 1947 to 27 November 2013) and other relevant resources on 2 December 2013. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) lasting at least three months involving healthy adults or those at high risk of CVD but without a diagnosis of CVD. Trials investigated the supplementation of CoQ10 alone as a single supplement. The comparison group was no intervention or placebo. The outcomes of interest were CVD clinical events and major CVD risk factors, adverse effects and costs. We excluded any trials involving multifactorial lifestyle interventions to avoid confounding.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted authors for additional information where necessary.

Main Results

We identified six RCTs with a total of 218 participants randomised, one trial awaiting classification and five ongoing trials. All trials were conducted in participants at high risk of CVD, two trials examined CoQ10 supplementation alone and four examined CoQ10 supplementation in patients on statin therapy; we analysed these separately. All six trials were small-scale, recruiting between 20 and 52 participants; one trial was at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and one for selective reporting; all studies were unclear in the method of allocation and therefore for selection bias. The dose of CoQ10 varied between 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day and the duration of the interventions was similar at around three months. No studies reported mortality or non-fatal cardiovascular events. None of the included studies provided data on adverse events. Two trials examined the effect of CoQ10 on blood pressure. For systolic blood pressure we did not perform a meta-analysis due to significant heterogeneity. In one trial CoQ10 supplementation had no effect on systolic blood pressure (mean difference (MD) -1.90 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -13.17 to 9.37, 51 patients randomised). In the other trial there was a statistically significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (MD -15.00 mmHg, 95% CI -19.06 to -10.94, 20 patients randomised). For diastolic blood pressure we performed a random-effects meta-analysis, which showed no evidence of effect of CoQ10 supplementation when these two small trials were pooled (MD -1.62 mmHg, 95% CI -5.2 to 1.96). One trial (51 patients randomised) looked at the effect of CoQ10 on lipid levels. The trial showed no evidence of effect of CoQ10 supplementation on total cholesterol (MD 0.30 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.70), high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (MD 0.02 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.17) or triglycerides (MD 0.05 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.52). Of the four trials that investigated CoQ10 supplementation in patients on statin therapy, three of them showed that simultaneous administration of CoQ10 did not significantly influence lipid levels or systolic blood pressure levels between the two groups. The fourth trial showed a significant increase in the change in total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol at three months across the four arms of the trial (α-tocopherol, CoQ10, CoQ10 + α-tocopherol and placebo), however the way in which the data were presented meant that we were unable to determine if there was any significant difference between the CoQ10 only and placebo arms. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the change in HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides after three months between the four arms of the trial.

Authors' Conclusions

There are very few studies to date examining CoQ10 for the primary prevention of CVD. The results from the ongoing studies will add to the evidence base. Due to the small number of underpowered trials contributing to the analyses, the results presented should be treated with caution and further high quality trials with longer-term follow-up are needed to determine the effects on cardiovascular events.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of coenzyme Q10 for primary hypertension [^113GzQuS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Blood pressure is a commonly measured risk factor for non-fatal and fatal cardiovascular adverse events such as heart attacks and strokes. Clinical trials have suggested that coenzyme Q10, a non-prescription nutritional supplement, can effectively lower blood pressure (BP). When this review was completed and published in October 2009, it concluded that "due to the possible unreliability of the 3 included studies, it is uncertain whether or not coenzyme Q10 reduces blood pressure in the long-term management of primary hypertension".

Objectives

To determine the blood pressure lowering effect of coenzyme Q10 in primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register (1946 to November 2015), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2015), MEDLINE In-Process (accessed 10 November 2015), EMBASE (1974 to November 2015), Web of Science (1899 to November 2015), CINAHL (1970 to November 2015), and ClinicalTrials.gov (accessed 10 November 2015). We also searched reference lists of articles for relevant clinical trials in any language.

Selection Criteria

Double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel or cross-over trials evaluating the blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy of coenzyme Q10 for a duration of at least three weeks, in patients with primary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary author determined trial inclusion, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. The second author independently verified trial inclusion and data extraction.

Main Results

In this update of the review, one new randomized, controlled cross-over trial with a total of 30 participants was added, and one trial included in the initial review was excluded. Only two of the three included trials were pooled in the meta-analysis, as one trial was judged to have an unacceptably high risk of bias. In the meta-analysis of two RCTs (50 participants), coenzyme Q10 did not significantly change systolic BP: -3.68 mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI) -8.86 to 1.49), or diastolic BP: -2.03 mm Hg (95% CI -4.86 to 0.81]), based on clinic data.

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides moderate-quality evidence that coenzyme Q10 does not have a clinically significant effect on blood pressure. In one of three trials reporting adverse effects, coenzyme Q10 was well tolerated. Due to the small number of individuals and studies available for analysis, more well-conducted trials are needed.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of coenzyme Q10 for primary hypertension [^116JxMbS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Studies have shown that coenzyme Q10 deficiency is associated with cardiovascular disease. Hypertension is a commonly measured surrogate marker for non-fatal and fatal cardiovascular endpoints such as heart attacks and strokes. Clinical trials have suggested that coenzyme Q10 supplementation can effectively lower blood pressure (BP).

Objectives

To determine the blood pressure lowering effect of coenzyme Q10 in primary hypertension.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2009 Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 -May 2008), EMBASE (1982 - May 2008), and CINAHL (1970 - May 2008) as well as the reference lists of articles were searched for relevant clinical trials in any language.

Selection Criteria

Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel or crossover trials evaluating the BP lowering efficacy of coenzyme Q10 for a duration of at least 3 weeks in patients with primary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary author independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. The second author verified data extraction.

Main Results

Three clinical trials with a total of 96 participants were evaluated for the effects of coenzyme Q10 on blood pressure compared to placebo. Treatment with coenzyme Q10 in subjects with systolic BP (SBP) > 140 mmHg or diastolic BP (DBP) > 90 mmHg resulted in mean decreases in SBP of 11 mmHg (95% CI 8, 14) and DBP of 7 mmHg (95% CI 5, 8).

Authors' Conclusions

Due to the possible unreliability of some of the included studies, it is uncertain whether or not coenzyme Q10 reduces blood pressure in the long-term management of primary hypertension.

### Coenzyme Q10 in the treatment of hypertension: a meta-analysis of the clinical trials [^115D14Ya]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Our objective was to review all published trials of coenzyme Q10 for hypertension, assess overall efficacy and consistency of therapeutic action and side effect incidence. Meta-analysis was performed in 12 clinical trials (362 patients) comprising three randomized controlled trials, one crossover study and eight open label studies. In the randomized controlled trials (n = 120), systolic blood pressure in the treatment group was 167.7 (95% confidence interval, CI: 163.7–171.1) mm Hg before, and 151.1 (147.1–155.1) mm Hg after treatment, a decrease of 16.6 (12.6–20.6, P < 0.001) mm Hg, with no significant change in the placebo group. Diastolic blood pressure in the treatment group was 103 (101–105) mm Hg before, and 94.8 (92.8–96.8) mm Hg after treatment, a decrease of 8.2 (6.2–10.2, P < 0.001) mm Hg, with no significant change in the placebo group. In the crossover study (n = 18), systolic blood pressure decreased by 11 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 8 mm Hg (P < 0.001) with no significant change with placebo. In the open label studies (n = 214), mean systolic blood pressure was 162 (158.4–165.7) mm Hg before, and 148.6 (145–152.2) mm Hg after treatment, a decrease of 13.5 (9.8–17.1, P < 0.001) mm Hg. Mean diastolic blood pressure was 97.1 (95.2–99.1) mm Hg before, and 86.8 (84.9–88.8) mm Hg after treatment, a decrease of 10.3 (8.4–12.3, P < 0.001) mm Hg. We conclude that coenzyme Q10 has the potential in hypertensive patients to lower systolic blood pressure by up to 17 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by up to 10 mm Hg without significant side effects.

### Effects of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on glycemic control: a GRADE-assessed systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114Qg6FJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over the past few decades, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of global deaths and disability, and the number of CVD deaths steadily increased year by year. In 2019, about 523 million adults were suffering from CVD, about twice as many as in 1990. The development of CVD is mainly driven by cardiometabolic risk factors, such as glucose metabolism disorder. Patients with disorder of glucose metabolism are at high risk of developing hyperglycemia-related CVD and metabolic diseases, including diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia. There is mounting evidence that glycemic control can effectively reduce the risk of CVD and metabolic disease. In this point, early intervention in the management of glycemic level is an important target to reduce the risk of CVD and other metabolic diseases.

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), also known as ubiquinone, is a lipid-soluble benzoquinone similar to vitamins. CoQ10 has a wide distribution in plant and animal tissues, especially in meat, fish, nuts, and some oils. Under normal physiological conditions, endogenous synthesis was thought to be the main source. However, with the growth of age, the synthetic ability of CoQ10 decreased, which could not meet the needs of healthy adults. In addition, average dietary intake of CoQ10 was only 3–6 mg per day, which was far less than the demand for CoQ10. Supplementation of CoQ10 could increase the level of CoQ10 in vivo to some extent. CoQ10, as a nutritional supplement, has a wide range of biological effects, including antioxidation, maintenance of normal blood pressure and cholesterol concentrations, maintenance of normal cognitive function, and improving insulin resistance. Clinical trials of the effects of supplementary CoQ10 on glycemic control have reported inconsistent results. Previous meta-analysis of randomized control trials (RCTs) have focused on the effect of CoQ10 on glycemic control for specific populations, such as type 2 diabetes, and diabetic kidney disease. However, these populations did not focus on other hyperglycemia-related diseases. While the prior meta-analysis included many relevant studies, the newly published studies in recent years still need to be updated. In addition, the current reviews are lack of an analysis of the optimal intake dose of CoQ10 supplement, and there is not enough evidence to set up nutrition guidelines for recommended daily intake of CoQ10. Therefore, further evaluation of the evidence quality is also needed to ascertain the efficacy of CoQ10 in glycemic control.

### Nutrition interventions for youth with dyslipidemia: a National Lipid Association clinical perspective [^111eKqyc]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in youth on lipid-lowering therapy — evidence is limited, with CoQ10 often used without proven benefit in adults and statin-associated muscle symptoms being rare in youth; a small short-term study of adolescents with FH on rosuvastatin showed decreased CoQ10 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells without decreased adenosine triphosphate synthesis; PBM or plasma CoQ10 levels may poorly reflect myocyte levels or mitochondrial function; thus, there is insufficient evidence that CoQ10 in youth treated with LLM prevents or decreases statin-related myopathies.

### Electrocardiographic and hemodynamic effects of coenzyme Q10 in healthy individuals: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial [^114iWd3m]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an endogenous cofactor required for mitochondrial energy production and touted to treat heart failure and prevent statin-induced myopathy. In guinea pig ventricular myocytes, CoQ10 prolongs action potential duration, an effect that might prolong the QTc interval in humans. Additionally, CoQ10 reduced blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension.

Objective

To determine the electrocardiographic (ECG) and hemodynamic impact of CoQ10 in healthy individuals.

Methods

Healthy volunteers (N = 26; 62% male, age 24 ± 3 y) were randomized to receive a single dose of CoQ10 50 mg and matching placebo in a crossover fashion with a 7 day washout period between treatments. Twelve-lead ECGs, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and other hemodynamic parameters (cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance index) were evaluated immediately before (baseline) and 1, 3, 5, and 8 hours after ingestion of the study drug. ECG parameters (P wave and QRS complex duration; PR, QT, QTc, and RR intervals) were measured in lead II by one blinded investigator. For each time point, duplicate blood pressure levels were taken manually and then averaged. Hemodynamic parameters were measured using bioelectrical impedance cardiography.

Results

CoQ10 had no effect on any of the evaluated ECG parameters. The maximum postdosing systolic blood pressure showed a statistically significant increase with CoQ10 (117 ± 10 vs 119 ± 10 mm Hg; p = 0.037), an effect driven by increases in cardiac index (3.09 vs 2.95 L/min/m(2); p = 0.017). However, blood pressure elevation was most evident at the 5 hour timepoint (116 ± 10 vs 113 ± 11 mm Hg; p = 0.049) and was only transient. There were no differences between groups for maximum postdosing diastolic blood pressure.

Conclusions

One dose of CoQ10 does not have any effect on ECG variables and exhibits only mild and transient effect on systolic blood pressure in young, healthy people.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of coenzyme Q10 therapy in hypertensive patients with the metabolic syndrome [^115YeJtH]. American Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Our aim was to examine the effects of adjunctive coenzyme Q(10) therapy on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) in subjects with the metabolic syndrome and inadequate BP control.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week crossover trial, coenzyme Q(10) (100 mg twice daily) or placebo was administrated to 30 subjects with the metabolic syndrome, and inadequate BP control (an average clinic BP of ≥ 140 systolic mm Hg or ≥ 130 mm Hg for patients with type 2 diabetes) while taking an unchanged, conventional antihypertensive regimen. Clinic and 24-h ambulatory BP were assessed pre- and post-treatment phases. The primary outcomes were the changes in 24-h systolic and diastolic BP during adjunctive therapy with coenzyme Q(10) vs. placebo and prespecified secondary outcomes included changes in BP loads.

Results

Compared with placebo, treatment with coenzyme Q(10) was not associated with statistically significant reductions in systolic (P = 0.60) or diastolic 24-h ambulatory BP (P = 0.12) or heart rate (P = 0.10), although daytime diastolic BP loads, were significantly lower during coenzyme Q(10) administration with thresholds set at > 90 mm Hg (P = 0.007) and ≥ 85 mm Hg (P = 0.03). Coenzyme Q(10) was well tolerated and was not associated with any clinically relevant changes in safety parameters.

Conclusions

Although it is possible that coenzyme Q(10) may improve BP control under some circumstances, any effects are likely to be smaller than reported in previous meta-analyses. Furthermore, our data suggest that coenzyme Q(10) is not currently indicated as adjunctive antihypertensive treatment for patients with the metabolic syndrome whose BP control is inadequate, despite regular antihypertensive therapy.

### Coenzyme Q10 for the treatment of heart failure: a review of the literature [^113PCUbe]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure occurs due to failure of the heart to pump adequately (systolic dysfunction) and/or impaired relaxation (diastolic dysfunction). Among a variety of causes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, ageing, valvular heart disease and congenital heart disease are the most common. Statistical data from the American Heart Association (AHA) show that a total of 5.1 million people in the United States suffer from heart failure, while 23 million people have diagnosed heart failure worldwide. Morbidity and mortality due to heart failure increase with age, and it is reported that heart failure is responsible for one in nine deaths in the United States. Moreover, heart failure is among the most frequent causes of hospitalisations and disability in the elderly. Though there have been major improvements in pharmacological management of heart failure, mortality rates continue to exceed 10% per year, reaching between 20% to 50% in severe cases.

Recently, long-term therapy with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) has been shown to improve heart failure symptoms, reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and mortality, and to be safe and well tolerated. This review covers the existing literature pertaining to CoQ10 and the treatment of heart failure.

### Screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117JHm4F]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Definitions of elevated blood pressure and hypertension — children and adolescents: Elevated blood pressure in children aged 1 to 13 years is defined as measurements between the 90th and 94th percentile based on age, height, and sex, or 120 to 129/ < 80 mm Hg. For adolescents 13 years or older, thresholds follow adult guidelines regardless of sex and height: stage 1 hypertension is defined as a blood pressure measurement of 130/80 to 139/89 mm Hg, and stage 2 hypertension is defined as a blood pressure measurement above 140/90 mm Hg.

### Coenzyme Q10 improves endothelial dysfunction in statin-treated type 2 diabetic patients [^111bFnmr]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Participants were typically middle-aged (mean ± SD age 68 ± 6 years) and overweight (BMI 29 ± 4 kg/m²), with satisfactory control of glycemia (GHb 6.9 ± 0.7%), blood pressure (systolic 123 ± 14 mmHg and diastolic 65 ± 7), and lipids (LDL cholesterol 1.8 ± 0.3 mmol/l). Median duration of diabetes was 8 years. Seventy-eight percent of subjects had a history of hypertension, 48% had a history of stroke or coronary disease, and 26% had microvascular complications. Eighty-three percent of subjects were taking antihyperglycemic medication, most commonly metformin (78%); 52% were taking ACE inhibitors; 21% were taking angiotensin receptor blockers; and 65% were taking aspirin. Atorvastatin was the most commonly prescribed statin (52%), followed by simvastatin (35%) and pravastatin (13%).

Baseline brachial artery diameter was similar at all assessments and unaltered by CoQ 10 supplementation (Table 1). CoQ 10 increased brachial artery FMD by mean ± SEM 1.0 ± 0.5% (P = 0.04) compared with placebo but did not alter nitrate-mediated dilatation (P = 0.66). Absolute percent FMD pre- and postplacebo, pre- and post-CoQ 10, and change in percent FMD with placebo and CoQ 10 are shown in supplemental Figures A1, A2, and A3 (available in an online appendix at), re- spectively. Despite increasing plasma CoQ 10 levels 2.7-fold (P < 0.001), CoQ 10 supplementation did not alter plasma F₂-isoprostane (P = 0.58) or urinary 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid levels (P = 0.28) or influence glycemia, blood pressure, or lipids (P > 0.05).

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in SAMS is described as a mevalonate pathway byproduct integral to mitochondrial function, with endogenous and plasma/tissue levels reduced by statins, yet steady-state mitochondrial levels may not be substantially reduced during long-term statin treatment; oral CoQ10 dose-dependently increases plasma CoQ10 with peak effects after 2 weeks but may not alter mitochondrial function, and RCTs/meta-analyses with doses ranging from 100 to 600 mg daily have produced discordant pain-score results without dose dependence, and one analysis failed to show increased statin adherence.

Among youth with incident nephrotic syndrome, those with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) often have an ominous clinical course. Identifying them at or shortly after diagnosis would potentially prevent substantial morbidity and even mortality. For those with a specific monogenic form, targeted therapy might be possible, as is the case presently for CoQ10 insufficiency cases. Further, dissecting specific causes and pathways that lead to SRNS may lead to other targeted, potentially highly effective treatments.

Primary disorders of the human coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10) biosynthesis pathway are a known cause of severe pediatric diseases. So far, oral administration of CoQ 10 is the only treatment strategy for affected individuals. However, the real benefit of CoQ 10 supplementation remains questionable and clinical studies regarding efficiency are lacking. Here we provide an outlook on novel treatment approaches using CoQ precursor compounds. These metabolic bypass strategies might be a promising alternative for oral CoQ 10 supplementation regimens.

### Do medications commonly prescribed to patients with peripheral arterial disease have an effect on nutritional status? A review of the literature [^111imyN6]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Polypharmacy is common among patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with a combination of medications used for risk-factor modification and medical management of the disease itself. Interaction between commonly prescribed medications and nutritional status has not previously been well described. This review aims to critically appraise evidence exploring associations between medications commonly prescribed to patients with PAD and nutritional status and provide recommendations for practice.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted to locate studies relating to nutrient interactions among lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, antiplatelet, and oral hypoglycemic drug classes. Quality of the evidence was rated on the basis of recommendations by the National Health and Medical Research Council.

Results

A total of 25 articles were identified as suitable and included in the review. No studies were specific to patients with PAD, and hence findings highlighting risk of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10 [CoQ10]) depletion with lipid-lowering medications, zinc depletion with antihypertensive medications, and vitamin B12 depletion with oral hypoglycemic medications are extrapolated from heterogeneous groups of patients and healthy adults. The body of evidence ranged in quality from satisfactory to poor.

Conclusions

High-quality research is required to confirm the interactions suggested by the included studies in patients with PAD specifically. It is, however, recommended that patients with PAD that are long-term consumers of the selected medications are monitored for CoQ10, zinc, and vitamin B12 to facilitate early identification of deficiencies and initiation of treatment. Treatment may involve dietary intervention and/or supplementation.

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and nutraceuticals in statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) — guidance: Use of CoQ10 is not supported by most guideline recommendations for mitigation of SAMS, and until a well-designed RCT is completed in those with SAMS and low levels of CoQ10, such a strategy cannot be currently recommended. Nutraceuticals should not be promoted to replace pharmaceutical grade, evidenced-based, lipid-lowering therapies; however, they may have a niche role as complementary to statins and non-statins in some statin intolerant patients.

### Effects of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on metabolic indicators in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113JZM5E]. Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a naturally occurring antioxidant that has been suggested to have beneficial effects on lipid profiles and blood pressure. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the effects of CoQ10 supplementation on these parameters in patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).

Objective

To assess the impact of CoQ10 supplementation on lipid profiles and blood pressure in individuals diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted in databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to July 2024. Studies included were those that examined the effects of CoQ10 supplementation on lipid profiles (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides) and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) in T2D patients.

Results

16 studies were included. CoQ10supplementation reduced SBP (WMD: -3.86 mmHg, 95% CI: -6.01 to -1.71, P = 0.014, I² = 83.7%; P < 0.001) and DBP (WMD: -2.70 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.50 to -0.91, P = 0.024, I² = 92.1%; P < 0.001), but did not change lipid profile. Additionally, subgroup analysis indicated that the effects of CoQ10 on lipid profiles levels were more pronounced in studies where the daily dosage of CoQ10 was 100 mg or less, and the duration of the study was under 12 weeks.

Conclusions

Coenzyme Q10 supplementation appears to have a beneficial effect on lipid profiles and may contribute to lowering blood pressure in patients with Type 2 Diabetes. These findings suggest that CoQ10 could be a valuable adjunctive therapy for managing cardiovascular risk in this population. Additional in-depth research is needed to validate these findings and understand the underlying mechanisms in more detail.

### Rescue of primary ubiquinone deficiency due to a novel COQ7 defect using 2, 4-dihydroxybensoic acid [^113EMQTD]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Results

In this study, we report the first case of COQ7 deficiency. The affected boy was born in 2005 as the second child of consanguineous Syrian parents, with an older healthy sister born in 2002. Pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramniosis, fetal lung hypoplasia and growth retardation. The boy was born full term but small for gestational age (birth weight 2070 g, length 46 cm, head circumference 30.5 cm). At birth, he had muscular hypotonia, contractures of the extremities and respiratory distress with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. His Apgar score was 1,5,7. Lung hypoplasia was confirmed and renal dysfunction was diagnosed, with plasma creatinine elevated up to 196 µmol/L (ref < 100) on day 2. Ultrasound revealed small dysplastic kidneys with impaired cortical differentiation. Secondary, there was systemic hypertension and left ventricular cardiac hypertrophy. Plasma creatinine normalised during the first week. Blood pressure normalised after 3 months, the cardiac hypertrophy regressed and pulmonary function normalised within the first 8 months. Follow-up ultrasound of the kidneys has shown normal growth and appearance, and there are no signs of glomerular or tubular dysfunction so far. A moderate developmental retardation was seen; the boy learned to sit without support at 10–11 months and crawled reciprocally after 1 year of age. He never learned to stand or walk independently. Electrophysiological investigations at 2 years of age showed peripheral sensorimotor polyneuropathy of axonal and demyelinating type. An MRI of the brain performed 2 months later was normal. Postnatal growth continued to be retarded; weight following −3 SD curve, height −2 SD and head circumference below −3 SD. Due to persistent feeding difficulties, he received a gastrostomy at the age of 2 years and 10 months. His weight subsequently improved but he remains short for his age. The patient is currently 9 years old with mild learning disabilities, hearing impairment due to combined sensorineural and conduction defects, and visual dysfunction. His musculature is thin and there is significant muscular hypotonia. The muscle weakness has been progressive with joint displacements and pain; the boy is no longer able to sit. The patient was initially treated with idebenone, but after the diagnosis of a primary CoQ 10 deficiency he was placed on CoQ 10 treatment, stalling the regression and significantly reducing the pain.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112u4QRU]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Women and statin adverse drug reactions — risk factors and clinical vigilance: It has been estimated that women tend to be at a 1.5–1.7 times greater risk for clinically significant adverse drug reactions compared to men; gender differences in body fat, muscle mass, quantities of CYP450 metabolic enzymes, coenzyme Q10 levels, pain perception and reporting, and genetic polymorphisms may contribute, and women with ASCVD or at high ASCVD risk are likely to be older with more comorbidities and polypharmacy that can lead to CYP450-mediated drug-drug interactions and increased systemic exposure to statins with resulting adverse events. In summary, clinicians should be particularly aware of the potential for elevated adverse events with taking statins in women, particularly glucose elevations and myalgia.

### Considerations for supplementing with coenzyme Q10 during statin therapy [^1116BvRZ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature concerning the effects of statin use on coenzyme (Co) Q10 concentrations and explain the rationale behind considering CoQ10 supplementation.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search was conducted through January 2006. Search terms included ubiquinone, coenzyme Q10, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, myotoxicity, and clinical trials.

Data Synthesis

Statin therapy reduces blood CoQ10 concentrations. Studies exploring how this affects the development of myotoxicity have been small and dissimilar, thus limiting the ability to draw strong conclusions. Isolated studies suggested that statins induce mitochondrial dysfunction, but the clinical implications of this effect are limited. Limited data suggest that patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, heart failure, or who are over 65 years of age might represent at-risk populations who would benefit from CoQ10 supplementation.

Conclusions

Routine CoQ10 supplementation for all patients taking statins to prevent myotoxicity is not recommended. However, certain subpopulations might be at risk and warrant further study.

### Six-month supplementation with high dose coenzyme Q10 improves liver steatosis, endothelial, vascular and myocardial function in patients with metabolic-dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease: a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1169ZNVx]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

CoQ10 has been shown to lower blood pressure at doses between 100 and 200 mg per day in a number of studies involving human participants. In the course of the present study, the administration of CoQ10 led to a noteworthy decrease in systolic blood pressure, registering a reduction of 7 mmHg, while its impact on diastolic blood pressure was observed to be minimal. These findings indicate a potential role for CoQ10 in managing hypertension, whether used independently or in combination with other conventional anti-hypertensive medications. However, it is imperative to conduct more meticulously monitored clinical trials.

Endothelial dysfunction is a condition that contributes to the pathophysiology of vascular disease in MASLD patients. It manifests prior to the development of atherosclerotic lesions or the occurrence of clinical events and is considered as a trustworthy marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. Endothelial function improvements with CoQ10 supplementation have been shown mainly in patients with DM with 2 clinical trials using 200 mg/day of CoQ10 for 12 weeks showing significant improvements in brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation. Larijiani et al. supplemented 65 intermediate risk individuals with 30 mg/day CoQ10 for 1 year and showed significant improvements in PWV. In our study, we assessed endothelial function using PBR, a technologically advanced and sophisticated method. We demonstrated, six months post-treatment with CoQ10, a substantial reduction in the PBR of sublingual artery microvessels and a decrease in Aix. Additionally, patients receiving CoQ10 exhibited significant alterations in arterial elasticity, as evidenced by changes in PWV and FMD of the brachial artery. It is crucial to highlight that these impactful changes were absent in the placebo group across all the aforementioned vascular metrics. This comprehensive analysis underscores the multifaceted positive effects of CoQ10 on vascular health. The observed reductions in PBR and AIx indicate improved microvascular perfusion and reduced arterial stiffness, respectively. The notable changes in PWV and FMD further signify enhanced arterial flexibility and endothelial function in patients undergoing CoQ10 treatment. These findings not only contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the cardiovascular benefits of CoQ10 but also emphasize its potential role in ameliorating various aspects of vascular function.

### Coenzyme Q10 supplementation in orthostatic hypotension and multiple-system atrophy: a report on 7 cases [^1143g43U]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple-system atrophy is a neurologic disorder characterized by orthostatic hypotension, Parkinsonian signs, and cerebellar signs. Mutations in COQ2, an enzyme involved in coenzyme Q10 synthesis, were recently associated with familial and sporadic cases of multiple-system atrophy. I hypothesized that people with orthostatic hypotension with or without other symptoms of multiple-system atrophy might benefit from oral coenzyme Q10 administration.

Methods

Seven patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension were treated in an unrandomized manner with 257 ± 37 mg coenzyme Q10 daily for 10 ± 3 months.

Results

Before starting coenzyme Q10, patients' systolic blood pressure fell 30 ± 4 mm Hg upon standing from a sitting position. After treatment with coenzyme Q10, their systolic blood pressure decreased 7 ± 5 mm Hg upon standing from a sitting position (P = 0.007 for change in systolic blood pressure decrease by paired t test).

Conclusions

These data suggest that orthostatic hypotension could improve with coenzyme Q10 administration and that a randomized clinical trial to test this hypothesis should be begun.

### Effects of coenzyme Q10 on vascular endothelial function in humans: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112wms43]. Atherosclerosis (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of coenzyme Q10 on arterial endothelial function in patients with and without established cardiovascular disease.

Background

Endothelial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

Methods and Results

The search included MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and EMBASE to identify studies up to 1 July 2011. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials on the effects of coenzyme Q10 compared with placebo on endothelial function. Two reviewers extracted data on study characteristics, methods, and outcomes. Five eligible trials enrolled a total of 194 patients. Meta-analysis using random-effects model showed treatment with coenzyme Q10 significantly improvement in endothelial function assessed peripherally by flow-mediated dilatation (SMD 1.70, 95% CI: 1.00–2.4, p < 0.0001). However, the endothelial function assessed peripherally by nitrate-mediated arterial dilatation was not significantly improved by using fix-effects model (SMD -0.19, 95% CI: -1.75 to 1.38, p = 0.81).

Conclusion

Coenzyme Q10 supplementation is associated with significant improvement in endothelial function. The current study supports a role for CoQ10 supplementation in patients with endothelial dysfunction.

### Coenzyme Q headgroup intermediates can ameliorate a mitochondrial encephalopathy [^116SC7d8]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

The patient started treatment with 30 mg of 4-HB in a 5 mg mL⁻¹ solution (6 ml) in water on day 1. On the basis of preclinical data, the dose was rapidly increased over the first 4 days to 100 mg kg⁻¹ (600 mL of solution); that dose was maintained until day 30 of treatment. The dose was then decreased to 50 mg kg⁻¹ (300 mL of solution) for an additional 95 days and then decreased to the current dose of 25 mg kg⁻¹. The child generally tolerated the treatment well; the solution was palatable and was reported to have a sour taste. During the first 30 days of the study, on several occasions, the child had emesis shortly after drinking the 600 mL solution, attributed to the large volume of solution ingested over a short period of time (15–20 min). No further emesis occurred during the 30 days with the lower dose volume of 300 ml. Safety monitoring, including electrocardiograms and bloodwork, was reassuring; there was no substantial change in these values for the duration of treatment. The data presented include 250 days of treatment. CoQ 10 was discontinued after several months of treatment with 4-HB.

### COQ7 defect causes prenatal onset of mitochondrial coQdeficiency with cardiomyopathy and gastrointestinal obstruction [^11284bn5]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

COQ7 pathogenetic variants cause primary CoQ 10 deficiency and a clinical phenotype of encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, or multisystemic disorder. Early diagnosis is essential for promptly starting CoQ 10 supplementation. Here, we report novel compound heterozygous variants in the COQ7 gene responsible for a prenatal onset (20 weeks of gestation) of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and intestinal dysmotility in a Bangladesh consanguineous family with two affected siblings. The main clinical findings were dysmorphisms, recurrent intestinal occlusions that required ileostomy, left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy, ascending aorta dilation, arterial hypertension, renal dysfunction, diffuse skin desquamation, axial hypotonia, neurodevelopmental delay, and growth retardation. Exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous rare variants in the COQ7 gene, c.613_617delGCCGGinsCAT (p. Ala205HisfsTer48) and c.403A > G (p. Met135Val). In silico analysis and functional in vitro studies confirmed the pathogenicity of the variants responsible for abolished activities of complexes I + III and II + III in muscle homogenate, severe decrease of CoQ 10 levels, and reduced basal and maximal respiration in patients' fibroblasts. The first proband deceased at 14 months of age, whereas supplementation with a high dose of CoQ 10 (30 mg/kg/day) since the first days of life modified the clinical course in the second child, showing a recovery of milestones acquirement at the last follow-up (18 months of age). Our study expands the clinical spectrum of primary CoQ 10 deficiency due to COQ7 gene defects and highlights the essential role of multidisciplinary and combined approaches for a timely diagnosis.

### Coenzyme Q10 for the treatment of heart failure: a review of the literature [^116vjJz6]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an endogenously synthesised and diet-supplied lipid-soluble cofactor that functions in the mitochondrial inner membrane to transfer electrons from complexes I and II to complex III. In addition, its redox activity enables CoQ10 to act as a membrane antioxidant. In patients with congestive heart failure, myocardial CoQ10 content tends to decline as the degree of heart failure worsens. A number of controlled pilot trials with supplemental CoQ10 in heart failure found improvements in functional parameters such as ejection fraction, stroke volume and cardiac output, without side effects. Subsequent meta-analyses have confirmed these findings, although the magnitude of benefit tends to be less notable in patients with severe heart failure, or within the context of ACE inhibitor therapy. The multicentre randomised placebo-controlled Q-SYMBIO trial has assessed the impact of supplemental CoQ10 on hard endpoints in heart failure. A total of 420 patients received either CoQ10 (100 mg three times daily) or placebo and were followed for 2 years. Although short-term functional endpoints were not statistically different in the two groups, CoQ10 significantly reduced the primary long-term endpoint — a major adverse cardiovascular event — which was observed in 15% of the treated participants compared to 26% of those receiving placebo (HR = 0.50, CI 0.32 to 0.80, p = 0.003). Particularly in light of the excellent tolerance and affordability of this natural physiological compound, supplemental CoQ10 has emerged as an attractive option in the management of heart failure, and merits evaluation in additional large studies.

### Coenzyme Q10 [^115uvcK1]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Coenzyme Q10 is a vitamin-like substance used in the treatment of a variety of disorders primarily related to suboptimal cellular energy metabolism and oxidative injury. Studies supporting the efficacy of coenzyme Q10 appear most promising for neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and certain encephalomyopathies for which coenzyme Q10 has gained orphan drug status. Results in other areas of research, induding treatment of congestive heart failure and diabetes, appear to be contradictory or need further clarification before proceeding with recommendations. Coenzyme Q10 appears to be a safe supplement with minimal side effects and low drug interaction potential.

### Role of dietary therapies in the prevention and treatment of hypertension [^116vjFqG]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2012). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure naturally rises with increasing age. The rate of change in blood pressure with age is regulated in part by genetic factors, but can also be altered through sustained dietary modification. Dietary approaches to modify blood pressure remain an important part of cardiovascular health promotion, which is especially important given the aging of the general population coupled with the increasing prevalence of obesity and metabolic disturbances. Specific modification of dietary components such as macronutrients and micronutrients could be helpful to lower blood pressure and alter the slope of blood pressure change whereas nutritional supplements are less likely to have a substantial beneficial effect. Population-wide generalizations regarding diet are impractical as individualized strategies are more likely to be successful in facilitating long-term benefits in improving blood-pressure control. Consequently, more effort needs to be focused on evaluating data from large-scale observational and interventional studies and interpreting their information in a clinically relevant manner, which is likely to be helpful for individual patients. Providing education on the relationship between diet and blood pressure from an early age is most likely to produce tangible benefits.

### Case report: perioperative management of caesarean section for a parturient with mitochondrial myopathy [^111YHWmc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Case presentation

We report a 36-year-old Chinese parturient (height 162 cm, weight 57 kg) with mitochondrial myopathy who was scheduled for caesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation. She developed ocular muscle paralysis and exercise intolerance at age 12 and was diagnosed with mitochondrial myopathy at 29 years old. Muscle biopsy was examined and the results showed that her mitochondrial myopathy is chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO). Analysis of muscle mtDNA showed a common large deletion from nucleotides 8483–13,446. Her regular medications included a multivitamin, idebenone and coenzyme Q10. She could not continuously walk more than two flights of stairs. The examinations on admission revealed a blood pressure (BP) 111/69 mmHg with a heart rate of 75 bpm and respiratory rate of 17 bpm at rest. The muscle strength of her four limbs was level 4, and neurological examinations were normal. The electrocardiography (ECG) confirmed sinus rhythm, complete right bundle branch block, left anterior branch block and clockwise rotation. The echocardiography showed left ventricular expansion (mild), regurgitation of the mitral and tricuspid valves (mild) and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF: 50%). Arterial blood gas analysis at rest and other laboratory examinations were not obviously abnormal.

### Challenges and opportunities to bridge translational to clinical research for personalized mitochondrial medicine [^11524Jmq]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Bridging the translational gap: the long road to patient-centered clinical trials for PMDs

Advances in understanding mitochondrial biology have led to the development of supportive therapies using a cocktail of nutraceuticals with the chief objectives to enhance the mitochondrial energy metabolism and to curtail the severity and progression of the clinical manifestations (Fig. 3). However, randomized double-blinded clinical trials have shown little therapeutic benefit to these nutraceuticals. More specifically, these published clinical trials are small and mostly open-label. While coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and carnitine are the most frequently administered nutraceuticals, patients with PMDs often take additional nutraceuticals acting as OXPHOS enhancers, such as riboflavin, thiamine, biotin, niacin, and creatine, in conjunction with several antioxidants, such as lipoic acid, glutathione, vitamin A, and vitamin E.

4 DISCUSSION

T2D and its interconnected metabolic complications such as obesity are of clinical significance because of their epidemic prevalence and contribution to the rapid rise of noncommunicable‐related deaths. 31, 32 Dyslipidaemia remains the major characteristic feature of T2D, and its prevalence among diabetic patients may be high as 70% in some populations. 33 Even worse, enhanced lipid deposits on the arterial wall in patients presenting with dyslipidaemia have been associated with the development and worsening of atherosclerosis. 34 The latter is known to be the causal factor for virtually 80% of all deaths among diabetic patients. 35 At present, complex mechanisms implicated in the development of atherosclerosis in a diabetic state have been described. For example, nonenzymatic glycosylation of lipids can interfere with normal physiological function by promoting the generation of oxidative stress, which is one of the major consequences associated with deteriorated cardiac function.

Oxidative stress, through enhanced production of reactive oxygen species, can affect endothelial nitric oxide (NO) availability, and thus in the process compromise vascular function. 36 NO is broadly considered as one of the most vital molecules produced in the human body, and its acts as an essential regulator in a vast array of crucial physiological functions, especially the maintenance of vascular tone. 36, 37 Research over the years has led to the identification of several ROS generating systems that could potentially be modulated in conditions of hyperglycaemia. 35, 38, 39 However, therapeutic approaches currently being used to improve cardiovascular function, including maintenance of vascular tone such as aspirin and statins present with limited antioxidant properties to protect against oxidative stress. 40, 41 Hence, exploration of antioxidant‐rich compounds such as CoQ10 remains a plausible strategy to improve cardiac function in a diabetic state. In agreement, a previous meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials has supported the beneficial effects of CoQ10 supplementation on vascular endothelial function in humans. 10 Others have reported on the meta‐analysis data showing contradictory results on the effect of CoQ10 on glycaemic control, lipid profile or blood pressure in patients with diabetes. 42, 43, 44 Thus, highlighting the importance of updated evidence on this topic, especially understanding the impact of CoQ on metabolic and CVD‐related markers in the most vulnerable patients with T2D or metabolic syndrome.

High blood pressure — dietary and behavioral interventions in infants and adolescents show measurable blood pressure (BP) effects. In infants, a meta-analysis reported that salt reduction decreased systolic BP by 2.47 mmHg. In adolescents with prehypertension or hypertension, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet in 57 adolescents found a significantly greater decrease in systolic BP at 3-month follow-up versus usual care. Another RCT reported that a 4-month transcendental meditation intervention was effective in lowering BP on ambulatory BP monitoring in African American adolescents with high-normal baseline BP, with reassessments at 8-month follow-up. Early-life feeding patterns also influenced later BP: at 6-year follow-up an RCT found polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)–supplemented infant formula associated with lower BP versus standard formula and a breastfed reference group with lower diastolic BP than nonsupplemented infants; maternal fish oil during lactation showed no BP or pulse wave velocity differences at 2.5-year follow-up; nutrient-enriched diets in small-for-gestational-age infants were linked to higher childhood BP 6–8 years later; and a meta-analysis of 15 studies associated breastfeeding in infancy with lower BP at follow-up 3–60 years later.

### Plasma coenzyme Q10 predicts lipid-lowering response to high-dose atorvastatin [^111RTGnP]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a provitamin synthesized via the HMG-CoA reductase pathway, and thus may serve as a potential marker of intrinsic HMG-CoA reductase activity. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) decrease CoQ10, although it is unclear whether this is due to reductions in lipoproteins, which transport CoQ10.

Objectives

We evaluated whether baseline plasma CoQ10 concentrations predict the lipid-lowering response to high-dose atorvastatin, and to what extent CoQ10 changes following atorvastatin therapy depend on lipoprotein changes.

Methods

Individuals without dyslipidemia or known cardiovascular disease (n = 84) received atorvastatin 80 mg daily for 16 weeks. Blood samples collected at baseline and after 4, 8, and 16 weeks of treatment were assayed for CoQ10.

Results

Individuals with higher baseline CoQ10:LDL-C ratios displayed diminished absolute and percent LDL-C reductions at 8 and 16 weeks of atorvastatin treatment (P < 0.001 to 0.01). After 16 weeks of atorvastatin, plasma CoQ10 decreased 45% from 762 ± 301 ng/ml to 374 ± 150 ng/ml (P < 0.001). CoQ10 changes were correlated with LDL-C and apolipoprotein B changes (r = 0.27–0.38, P = 0.001–0.02), but remained significant when normalized to all lipoproteins. CoQ10 changes were not associated with adverse drug reactions.

Conclusion

Baseline CoQ10:LDL-C ratio was associated with the degree of LDL-C response to atorvastatin. Atorvastatin decreased CoQ10 concentrations in a manner that was not completely dependent on lipoprotein changes. The utility of CoQ10 as a predictor of atorvastatin response should be further explored in patients with dyslipidemia.

### Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, assessment of the efficacy and safety of dietary supplements in prehypertension [^114ju9hE]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

We aimed to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of a protocol including lifestyle modifications and a novel combination of dietary supplements in prehypertension. A prospective, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 176 subjects (103 men, aged 52 ± 10 years), with blood pressure (BP) of 130–139mmHg systolic and/or 85–89mmHg diastolic entered. After a single-blind run-in period, participants were randomised to twice daily placebo (n = 88) or a commercially available combination pill (n = 88). Primary endpoints were the differences in clinic BP between the two groups at the end of the trial. Secondary endpoints included intragroup differences in clinic BP during the study period and response rates (that is, BP < 130/85mmHg or a BP reduction > 5mmHg on week 12). Baseline characteristics were similar among the treatment groups. At 12 weeks, the supplement group had lower systolic BP (124 ± 9 versus 132 ± 7mmHg, P < 0.0001) and similar diastolic BP (81 ± 8 versus 82 ± 7mmHg, P = 0.382) compared to the placebo group. With respect to baseline measures, changes in BP with supplements were statistically significant for systolic (-9.3 ± 4.2mmHg, P < 0.0001) and diastolic values (-4.2 ± 3.6mmHg, P < 0.0001). Changes versus baseline in systolic and diastolic BP, conversely, were not different on placebo. The overall response rate at week 12 was significantly greater with supplements than placebo (58% (51 of 88) and 25% (22 of 88), respectively, P < 0.0001). This randomised trial shows that combination of supplements with BP-lowering effect is an effective additional treatment to conventional lifestyle modifications for a better control of systolic BP in prehypertension.

### The effect of pravastatin and atorvastatin on coenzyme Q10 [^116VzhNa]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant and plays an important role in the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate. Studies suggest that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors reduce CoQ10 levels; however, no studies have directly compared HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in a randomized crossover fashion.

Methods

Twelve healthy volunteers received either 20 mg pravastatin (P) or 10 mg atorvastatin (A) for 4 weeks in a randomized crossover fashion. There was a 4- to 8-week washout period between the 2 phases. CoQ10 levels and a lipid profile were obtained.

Results

There was no difference in CoQ10 levels from baseline to post-drug therapy for either P or A (0.61 ± 0.14 vs 0.62 ± 0.2 microg/mL and 0.65 ± 0.22 vs 0.6 ± 0.12 microg/mL, respectively; P > .05). There was a significant difference in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels from baseline to post-drug therapy for both P and A (97 ± 21 vs 66 ± 19 mg/dL and 102 ± 21 vs 52 ± 14 mg/dL, respectively; P < .01). There was no significant correlation between LDL and CoQ10.

Conclusions

P and A did not decrease CoQ10 despite a significant decrease in LDL levels. These findings suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors do not significantly decrease the synthesis of circulating CoQ10 in healthy subjects. Routine supplementation of CoQ10 may not be necessary when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy is administered.

### Coenzyme Q10 for the treatment of heart failure: a review of the literature [^116rkNEC]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

CoQ10 is a key component in the mitochondrial ETC for ATP generation, and exists in abundance in the myocardium, as compared to other tissues. Myocardial CoQ10 depletion has been postulated as a mechanism in development and progression of congestive heart failure (CHF). Folkers et al demonstrated that myocardial CoQ10 level was linked with symptomatic severity of CHF, with the lowest levels observed in patients of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV and the highest levels in patients in NYHA class I. Additionally, CoQ10, through its antioxidant effects, may reduce oxidative stress, which is known to adversely affect left ventricular ejection fraction and alter disease outcomes. Lastly, CoQ10 may stabilise calcium-dependent channels in the myocardium, enhancing effective ATP synthesis.

Frequently, statins and β-blockers are used in patients of CHF for prevention of cardiovascular comorbidities. These drugs have been found to decrease CoQ10 levels by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway and myocardial enzymes, respectively. In an observational study by Molyneux et al, it was shown that CoQ10 is an independent predictor of survival, whether dichotomised at the receiver operating characteristic curve cut-point (HR 2.0; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.3) or the median (HR 1.6; 95% CI 1.0 to 2.6); these findings persisted after adjustment for serum cholesterol level. Additionally, myocardial coenzyme Q10 levels in patients with chronic HF were found to be 33% lower as opposed to levels in control patients. The aforementioned evidence suggests that CoQ10 may be useful in patients with CHF by replenishing deficient levels, which may improve ATP synthesis and left ventricular function.

The reference range of reduced CoQ10 for children (younger than 18 years of age) is 320–1376 μg/L and for adults (aged 18 years or older) it is 415–1480 μg/L. The reference values for total CoQ10 for children and adults are 320–1558 μg/L and 433–1532 μg/L, respectively. The normal percentage of reduced CoQ10 in children varies from 93% to100%, while in adults it falls between 92% and 98%.

### The impact of coenzyme qon metabolic and cardiovascular disease profiles in diabetic patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112mAEJg]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

2.3 Data extraction and assessment of quality

Two investigators, PVD and TMN, independently evaluated all pertinent articles and carefully selected those that were relevant. Incongruities were resolved by consulting a third investigator, BBN. The main outcome of the study was to establish the impact of CoQ10 supplementation on CVD‐related outcomes in diabetes or metabolic syndrome. Another important objective of the study was to establish whether CoQ10 supplementation affected diabetes and metabolic syndrome‐related markers such as fasting blood glucose (FPG) or insulin levels, glycated haemoglobin (Hb1Ac) and body mass index (BMI). To accomplish this, relevant data items, from each article, such as name and year of publication, the country where the study was conducted, sample and gender distribution, as well as CoQ10 dosage used and duration of intervention, were extracted by two independent investigators (VM and KM). Furthermore, VM and KM evaluated the risk of bias using the modified Downs and Black checklist, which is appropriate for both randomized and nonrandomized studies. 15, 16 Any disagreements were resolved by consulting the third investigator, TMN. The overall total scores of each study was rated poor if the score was (≤ 13points), fair if (14‐18 points), good if (19‐23 points) and excellent if the score was (24‐27). The same investigators were also responsible for assessing the quality of evidence across the selected studies by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 17

### Hemodynamic effects of fenofibrate and coenzyme Q10 in type 2 diabetic subjects with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction [^114tGBSn]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Baseline characteristics

We randomized 74 eligible subjects to placebo (n = 20), fenofibrate (n = 19), CoQ (n = 16), or fenofibrate + CoQ (n = 19). Clinical characteristics were comparable across treatment groups (Table 1). Participants were typically overweight with satisfactory control of BP, lipids, and glycemia. Median diabetes duration was 4 years; one-third of cases were diet treated. Nearly one-half of subjects were taking antihypertensive medication, most commonly ACE inhibitors; over one-half were taking statins. On echocardiography, 12 participants (16.2%) had LV hypertrophy (LVM/height ≥ 143 g/m for men; ≥ 102 g/m for women). Most subjects (86.5%) had mild LVDD.

Clinical and biochemical responses

A total of 69 subjects completed the trial. Reasons for withdrawal were new-onset atrial fibrillation (n = 1), transaminase elevation more than three times the upper limit of normal (n = 1), and personal choice (n = 3). The subjects with adverse events were on fenofibrate alone.

Compared with placebo, neither body weight (data not shown) nor glycemia changed with any of the treatments (Table 2). Total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol and NEFAs were similarly unaltered, but fenofibrate lowered triglycerides, apoB-100, and apoC-III and increased apoA-I and apoA-II (P < 0.05). CoQ supplementation increased both plasma and cellular CoQ levels (P < 0.01).

Safety and effectiveness of quetiapine extended-release tablets are supported by studies of quetiapine tablets in children and adolescent patients 10 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.1 and 14.2)].

In a placebo-controlled quetiapine extended-release tablets clinical trial (8 weeks duration) in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the incidence of increases at any time in systolic blood pressure (≥ 20 mmHg) was 6.5% (6/92) for quetiapine extended-release tablets and 6.0% (6/100) for placebo; the incidence of increases at any time in diastolic blood pressure (≥ 10 mmHg) was 46.7% (43/92) for quetiapine extended-release tablets and 36.0% (36/100) for placebo.

In placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with schizophrenia (13 to 17 years old, 6-week duration) or bipolar mania (10 to 17 years old, 3-week duration), the incidence of increases at any time in systolic blood pressure (≥ 20 mmHg) was 15.2% (51/335) for quetiapine tablets and 5.5% (9/163) for placebo; the incidence of increases at any time in diastolic blood pressure (≥ 10 mmHg) was 40.6% (136/335) for quetiapine tablets and 24.5% (40/163) for placebo. In the 26-week open-label clinical trial, one child with a reported history of hypertension experienced a hypertensive crisis. Blood pressure in children and adolescents should be measured at the beginning of, and periodically during treatment.

### Screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112h45ir]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Benefits of early detection and treatment — no direct screening effectiveness studies were found, while short-term trials evaluated pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions. No studies directly assessed screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents or screening for secondary hypertension in asymptomatic children. Twenty randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and a meta-analysis examined treatment; thirteen fair-quality placebo-controlled RCTs and 1 meta-analysis evaluated pharmacologic treatments, with trial duration limited to 2 to 4 weeks, and studies reported greater reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure vs placebo though not all differences were significant. Pooled SBP effects were −4.38 mm Hg for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, −3.07 mm Hg for angiotensin receptor blockers, −3.20 mm Hg for β-blockers, −3.10 mm Hg for calcium channel blockers, and −0.12 mm Hg for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Exercise reduced SBP over 3 months (−6.3 mm Hg; n = 40) and 8 months (−4.9 mm Hg; n = 69) in fair-quality RCTs; a DASH-type diet resulted in reductions in SBP (−2.2 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (−2.8 mm Hg) over 3 months (P < .01; n = 57) but the effect did not persist beyond the intervention period. A combined low-dose propranolol/chlorthalidone plus lifestyle intervention over 6 months reduced SBP (−7.6 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (−6.9 mm Hg), whereas low-salt diet and progressive muscle relaxation did not achieve reductions of blood pressure. The USPSTF did not find direct evidence that treating primary childhood hypertension prevents adverse health outcomes or improves intermediate outcomes in adulthood.

### Effects of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on glycemic control: a GRADE-assessed systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113c7ZFv]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Data extraction

Two investigators (YL and QJ) independently extracted the following items from each eligible study: first author's name, year of publication, country where the study was performed, source of funding, study design and duration, sample size, intervention approach, dose of CoQ10, control approach, subject characteristics, and changes in the glycemic control outcomes aforementioned.

Mean changes and standard deviations (SDs) from baseline to the end of follow-up in both intervention and control groups were used to estimate the effect size of CoQ10. If the mean changes were not provided directly, the effect values before and after the intervention were extracted and converted into the mean changes and SDs as follows:assuming a correlation coefficient (R) = 0.5. When standard errors of the mean (SEMs) rather than SDs were reported, the SDs were estimated using the following formula:where n was the number of subjects. When the outcome measures were reported as means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), the SDs were estimated using the following formula:where n was the number of subjects. When studies were reported with median and range, we estimated SD asprovided by Cochrane Handbook recommendation. For multi-armed parallel trials, we treated each intervention group and corresponding control as an independent comparison. Crossover trials were regarded similarly to parallel trials, with separate CoQ10 and control arms.

For data extraction, two investigators (YL and QJ) processed articles independently. Inconsistency in particular information between researchers was resolved by discussion or negotiation with a third researcher (ZT).

Quality assessment

The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (Review manager version 5.4)was used to evaluate the quality assessment of included studies, including domains of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting. Other biases, including study design rationality and compliance with treatment, were also assessed. We rated studies that satisfies four or more of seven low-risk domains of bias as low risk with the rest as high risk. Two investigators (YL and ML) evaluated the risk of biases independently, with any discrepancies adjudicated by a third researcher (DZ).

### Coenzyme Q10 and heart failure: a state-of-the-art review [^11286Zse]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) with either preserved or reduced ejection fraction is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Evidence-based therapies are often limited by tolerability, hypotension, electrolyte disturbances, and renal dysfunction. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) may represent a safe therapeutic option for patients with HF. CoQ10 is a highly lipophilic molecule with a chemical structure similar to vitamin K. Although being a common component of cellular membranes, CoQ10's most prominent role is to facilitate the production of adenosine triphosphate in the mitochondria by participating in redox reactions within the electron transport chain. Numerous trials during the past 30 years examining CoQ10 in patients with HF have been limited by small numbers and lack of contemporary HF therapies. The recent publication of the Q-SYMBIO randomized controlled trial demonstrated a reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events with CoQ10 supplementation in a contemporary HF population. Although having limitations, this study has renewed interest in evaluating CoQ10 supplementation in patients with HF. Current literature suggests that CoQ10 is relatively safe with few drug interactions and side effects. Furthermore, it is already widely available as an over-the-counter supplement. These findings warrant future adequately powered randomized controlled trials of CoQ10 supplementation in patients with HF. This state-of-the-art review summarizes the literature about the mechanisms, clinical data, and safety profile of CoQ10 supplementation in patients with HF.

### Effects of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on glycemic control: a GRADE-assessed systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116wf77x]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 2
GRADE Evidence Profile for effect of CoQ10 supplementation on glycemic control.

Meta-analysis of data from 44 treatment arms suggested a significant reduction in fasting glucose level following CoQ10 supplementation (WMD: -5.22 mg/dl; 95% CI: -8.33, -2.11 mg/dl; P < 0.001; n = 2157 in 38 studies; I² = 95.10%) (Figure 2). Subgroup analysis of potentially modifying factors revealed that the most prominent effects on efficacy and heterogeneity were due to CoQ10 dosage, duration, the type of control, risk of bias, and industry funding (Table 3). The impact of CoQ10 on fasting glucose was greater at supplemental doses < 200 mg/day (WMD: -13.21 mg/dl, 95% CI: -18.43, -7.98 mg/dl, P < 0.001) compared with remaining two groups. With respect to treatment duration, the effect of CoQ10 on reducing fasting glucose level was better in the subsets of duration ≥ 12 weeks (WMD: -7.59 mg/dl, 95% CI: -11.66, -3.52 mg/dl, P < 0.001) compared with duration < 12 weeks. As for the type of control, the reduction on fasting glucose was greater at placebo group (WMD: -6.02 mg/dl, 95% CI: -9.56, -2.47 mg/dl, P < 0.001) rather than using other controls. CoQ10 had better efficacy in reducing fasting glucose level in the low risk of bias (WMD: -6.70 mg/dl, 95% CI: -11.28, -2.13 mg/dl, P < 0.001) and not receiving industry funding (WMD: -6.84 mg/dl, 95% CI: -10.70, -2.98 mg/dl, P < 0.001).

Qelbree can cause an increase in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure.

Pediatric Patients

In a clinical study in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age, 34/154 (22%) of patients treated with Qelbree 100 mg daily had a ≥ 20 beat per minute (bpm) increase in heart rate at any time point in the clinical trial, compared to 15/159 (9%) of patients who received placebo. This finding was observed in 84/268 (31%) who received the 200 mg daily dosage, compared to 39/262 (15%) of patients in the placebo group, and in 28/100 (28%) of patients who received the 400 mg daily dosage, compared to 24/103 (23%) of patients who received placebo.

In a clinical study in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age, 22/99 (22%) of patients treated with Qelbree 200 mg daily had a ≥ 20 bpm increase in heart rate at any time point in the clinical trial, compared to 15/104 (14%) of patients who received placebo. This finding was observed in 69/205 (34%) who received the 400 mg daily dosage, compared to 35/201 (17%) of patients in the placebo group. In pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age, 52/205 (25%) of patients treated with Qelbree 400 mg daily had a ≥ 15 mmHg increase in diastolic blood pressure at any time in the clinical trial, compared to 26/201 (13%) of patients in the placebo group.

Adult Patients

In a clinical study in adult patients (18 to 60 years of age), 52/178 (29%) of patients treated daily with Qelbree (200 mg to 600 mg) had a ≥ 20 beat per minute (bpm) increase in heart rate at any time point in the clinical trial, compared to 23/181 (13%) of patients who received placebo. Of patients treated daily with Qelbree (200 to 600 mg), 23/178 (13%) had a ≥ 15 mmHg increase in diastolic blood pressure at any time in the clinical trial, compared to 16/181 (9%) of patients in the placebo group.

### Does chocolate reduce blood pressure? A meta-analysis [^1171H7hG]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Analysis

Meta-analysis was conducted using the Cochrane Program Review Manager version 5. Owing to high heterogeneity between trials, we used a random effects model and considered subgroup meta-analysis by baseline mean blood pressure, similar to our recent meta-analysis of the effect of garlic on blood pressure. For systolic blood pressure, trials were divided into a hypertensive subgroup (SBP ≥ 140 mmHg) and a normotensive subgroup (SBP < 140 mmHg) at the start of treatment. For diastolic blood pressure, a division into a higher BP subgroup (DBP ≥ 80 mmHg) and lower BP subgroup (DBP < 80 mmHg) at the start of treatment allowed an even distribution of trials between subgroups and reduction in heterogeneity.

Meta-regression analyses were conducted using Stata version 10 to explore reasons for high heterogeneity in the pooled meta-analysis of all studies. The following variables were tested, as their associations with blood pressure outcomes are physiologically plausible: Dosage of polyphenols in the active treatment group (continuous variable), type of control (categorical variable: low-flavanol control as drink, tablet or bar/flavanol-free control as white chocolate, milk, or placebo capsules), duration (continuous and categorical > 2 weeks yes/no), study design (parallel versus crossover), starting SBP (continuous and categorical > 140 mmHg yes/no), starting DBP (continuous and categorical > 80 mmHg yes/no), quality score (≥ 3.5 yes/no), average body mass index (BMI) (continuous and categorical > 25 or > 30 yes/no) and average age (continuous).

If meta-regression results indicated a variable to contribute significantly to heterogeneity between studies, subgroup analysis by this variable was conducted, testing whether there was an effect of treatment on blood pressure outcomes within each subgroup. If heterogeneity was reduced, the subgroup analysis provided a more reliable estimate of pooled effect size between the treatment groups. Additionally, sensitivity analysis excluding selected trials explored the robustness of results. Publication bias or small study effect was assessed by Begg's funnel plots and Egger's regression tests.

### A randomized clinical trial of high-dosage coenzyme Q10 in early parkinson disease: no evidence of benefit [^115czQ4o]. JAMA Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), an antioxidant that supports mitochondrial function, has been shown in preclinical Parkinson disease (PD) models to reduce the loss of dopamine neurons, and was safe and well tolerated in early-phase human studies. A previous phase II study suggested possible clinical benefit.

Objective

To examine whether CoQ10 could slow disease progression in early PD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A phase III randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial at 67 North American sites consisting of participants 30 years of age or older who received a diagnosis of PD within 5 years and who had the following inclusion criteria: the presence of a rest tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity; a modified Hoehn and Yahr stage of 2.5 or less; and no anticipated need for dopaminergic therapy within 3 months. Exclusion criteria included the use of any PD medication within 60 days, the use of any symptomatic PD medication for more than 90 days, atypical or drug-induced parkinsonism, a Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) rest tremor score of 3 or greater for any limb, a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 25 or less, a history of stroke, the use of certain supplements, and substantial recent exposure to CoQ10. Of 696 participants screened, 78 were found to be ineligible, and 18 declined participation.

Interventions

The remaining 600 participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo, 1200 mg/d of CoQ10, or 2400 mg/d of CoQ10; all participants received 1200 IU/d of vitamin E.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Participants were observed for 16 months or until a disability requiring dopaminergic treatment. The prospectively defined primary outcome measure was the change in total UPDRS score (Parts I-III) from baseline to final visit. The study was powered to detect a 3-point difference between an active treatment and placebo.

Results

The baseline characteristics of the participants were well balanced, the mean age was 62.5 years, 66% of participants were male, and the mean baseline total UPDRS score was 22.7. A total of 267 participants required treatment (94 received placebo, 87 received 1200 mg/d of CoQ10, and 86 received 2400 mg/d of CoQ10), and 65 participants (29 who received placebo, 19 who received 1200 mg/d of CoQ10, and 17 who received 2400 mg/d of CoQ10) withdrew prematurely. Treatments were well tolerated with no safety concerns. The study was terminated after a prespecified futility criterion was reached. At study termination, both active treatment groups showed slight adverse trends relative to placebo. Adjusted mean changes (worsening) in total UPDRS scores from baseline to final visit were 6.9 points (placebo), 7.5 points (1200 mg/d of CoQ10; p = 0.49 relative to placebo), and 8.0 points (2400 mg/d of CoQ10; p = 0.21 relative to placebo).

Conclusions and Relevance

Coenzyme Q10 was safe and well tolerated in this population, but showed no evidence of clinical benefit.

### Mirabegron (Myrbetriq) [^115dTzbC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Increases in Blood Pressure

Increases in Blood Pressure in Adults

MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules can increase blood pressure. Periodic blood pressure determinations are recommended, especially in hypertensive patients. MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules is not recommended for use in patients with severe uncontrolled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

In two, randomized, placebo-controlled, healthy adult volunteer studies, MYRBETRIQ was associated with dose-related increases in supine blood pressure. In these studies, at the maximum recommended dose of 50 mg, the mean maximum increase in systolic/diastolic blood pressure was approximately 3.5/1.5 mm Hg greater than placebo.

In contrast, in adult OAB patients in clinical trials, MYRBETRIQ, taken as monotherapy or in combination with solifenacin succinate 5 mg, the mean increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the maximum recommended mirabegron dose of 50 mg was approximately 0.5 to 1 mm Hg greater than placebo. Worsening of pre-existing hypertension was reported infrequently in patients taking MYRBETRIQ.

Increases in Blood Pressure in Pediatric Patients 3 Years and Older

MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules can increase blood pressure in pediatric patients. Blood pressure increases may be larger in children (3 to less than 12 years of age) than in adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age). Periodic blood pressure determinations are recommended. MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules is not recommended for use in pediatric patients with severe uncontrolled hypertension, defined as a systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure above the 99 percentile plus 5 mm Hg for age, sex, and stature using appropriate referencevalues [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### The impact of coenzyme Q10 on systolic function in patients with chronic heart failure [^111q9pxB]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an endogenous cofactor in the mitochondrial energy production. CoQ10 has been touted to improve heart failure, but its effect on systolic function is controversial. Several small, randomized controlled trials evaluating CoQ10 showed variable results and were largely underpowered. We conducted a meta-analysis of these trials to evaluate the impact of CoQ10 therapy on ejection fraction and cardiac output.

Methods and Results

A systematic literature search was conducted to identify randomized, controlled trials of CoQ10 in heart failure between 1966 and June 2005. Subgroup analysis was conducted to assess clinical heterogeneity between trials. Of the 11 trials identified, 10 evaluated ejection fraction (n = 277) and 2 evaluated cardiac output (n = 42). Doses ranged from 60 to 200 mg/day with treatment periods ranging from 1 to 6 months. There was a 3.7% net improvement in ejection fraction (95% CI 1.59–5.77; P < .00001 for statistical heterogeneity). A more profound effect among patients not receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was observed (6.74% [95% CI 2.63–10.86]). Cardiac output increased an average of 0.28 L/minute (95% CI 0.03–0.53; p = 0.96 for statistical heterogeneity).

Conclusion

CoQ10 enhances systolic function in chronic heart failure, but its effectiveness may be reduced with concomitant use of current standard therapies.

Secondary causes — medication related: Over-the-counter drugs, prescription medications, alternative therapies, dietary products, and recreational drugs can increase blood pressure (BP); common prescription culprits include oral contraceptives, central nervous system stimulants, and corticosteroids. Over-the-counter decongestants such as pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine may cause a mild increase in BP with recommended dosing, but severe hypertension (HTN) has been observed as an idiosyncratic response with appropriate or excessive doses. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may antagonize the BP-lowering effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors without affecting BP in those without HTN. Recreational drugs linked with HTN include stimulants (cocaine and amphetamine derivatives) and anabolic steroids. When a child has elevated BP measurements, the practitioner should inquire about the intake of pharmacologic agents.

### Coenzyme Q10 supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia [^114b6s5z]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether supplementation with Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) during pregnancy reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia.

Methods

Women at increased risk of pre-eclampsia were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Women were assigned to receive 200 mg of CoQ10 or placebo daily from 20 weeks of pregnancy until delivery. The primary outcome was rate of pre-eclampsia. Statistical analyses were by intention-to-treat.

Results

Of the 235 women enrolled in the trial, 118 were randomized to receive CoQ10 and 117 received a placebo. A total of 197 (83.8%) women were followed-up. The overall rate of pre-eclampsia was 20% (n = 47). Thirty women (25.6%) in the placebo group developed pre-eclampsia compared with 17 women (14.4%) in the CoQ10 group, and this reduction was significant (P = 0.035) (relative risk [RR] 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.33–0.96).

Conclusion

Supplementation with CoQ10 reduces the risk of developing pre-eclampsia in women at risk for the condition.

### COQ7 defect causes prenatal onset of mitochondrial coQdeficiency with cardiomyopathy and gastrointestinal obstruction [^115CHT22]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

A muscle biopsy was performed to investigate the mitochondrial function at 4 months of age and, immediately after, supplementation with a high dose of oral CoQ 10 (30 mg/kg/day) was started with a positive effect on psychomotor development and skin desquamation. However, the patient suddenly passed away at 14 months with multiorgan failure during an episode of metabolic acidosis triggered by prolonged fasting at home.

Being informed of the recurrence risk of the condition, in their second pregnancy the parents opted to not perform a prenatal diagnosis; the second baby boy (P1.b) reached our attention at 18 +5 weeks of gestation. A fetal ultrasound revealed a perimembranous ventricular septal defect. At 25 +6 weeks of gestation, IUGR (< 5° centile) was described. The ultrasound scans performed in the third trimester of pregnancy showed multisystemic alterations with severe oligohydramnios, biventricular cardiomyopathy, tricuspid valve insufficiency and pulmonary valve dysplasia, and echogenic bowel (Fig. 1D). He was born at 36 weeks of gestational age by caesarian section. Immediately after birth, he presented mixed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.18, pCO2 59.5 mmHg, pO2 40,5 mmHg, HCO₃⁻ 18.3 mmol/L, BE −7.1 mmol/L, lactic acid 58.3 mg/dl), hypotonia, hypotension, acute kidney failure and ileal stenosis-atresia that were respectively treated with bicarbonates, dobutamine, furosemide and corrective surgery procedure with ileostomy. Kidney ultrasound revealed small asymmetrical kidneys, cortical hyperechogenicity, reduced cortico-medullary differentiation, and modest bilateral pyelic dilatation. Dysmorphic features were noted as microcephaly (head circumference < 2° pc), low-set ears, left preauricular tag, thick and arched eyebrows, and inverted epicanthus (Fig. 2D). Cardiac ultrasound confirmed biventricular cardiac hypertrophy with aspects of left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy, systolic function within normal limits (FE 55% at last follow-up at one year of age), and mild tricuspid insufficiency. Hearing assessment revealed bilateral sensorineural deafness. Supplementation with high-dose oral CoQ 10 (30 mg/kg/day) and riboflavin (150 mg/day) was started from birth.

### High blood pressure in children and adolescents… [^114KfiF7]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

The guideline, Screening and Management of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents was developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and categorized as Affirmation of Value by the American Academy of Family Physicians. Key Recommendations: Children and adolescents three years of age or older should have their blood pressured measured annually. Blood pressure checks should be performed at every health care encounter for children and adolescents who are obese, take medications that raise blood pressure, have renal disease, diabetes or a history of aortic arch obstruction or coarctation. Hypertension should be diagnosed in children and adolescents who have auscultatory-confirmed blood pressure readings greater than the 95 th percentile, based on sex, age, and height tables, at three different visits.

Children and adolescents being evaluated for high BP should have a perinatal history, appropriate nutritional history, physical activity history, psychosocial history, and family history recorded and a physical examination to identify findings suggestive of secondary causes of hypertension. Electrocardiography should not be used for initial evaluation. Children and adolescents who have been diagnosed with hypertension should be counseled regarding lifestyle modifications including diet and physical activity. Children and adolescents who fail lifestyle modifications should be prescribed pharmacologic therapy. Treatment options may include an ACE inhibitor, ARB inhibitor, long-acting calcium channel blocker, or thiazide diuretic. Treatment goals for children and adolescents who have been diagnosed with hypertension should be a reduction in blood pressure to less than the 90 th percentile and less than 130/80 in adolescents aged 13 years or older.

See the full guideline for more recommendations, blood pressure tables, and treatment algorithms. The AAFP uses the category of "Affirmation of Value" to support clinical practice guidelines that provide valuable guidance, but do not meet our criteria for full endorsement. The primary reasons for not endorsing this guideline included: These recommendations are provided only as assistance for physicians making clinical decisions regarding the care of their patients. As such, they cannot substitute for the individual judgment brought to each clinical situation by the patient's family physician. As with all clinical reference resources, they reflect the best understanding of the science of medicine at the time of publication, but they should be used with the clear understanding that continued research may result in new knowledge and recommendations. These recommendations are only one element in the complex process of improving the health of America.

To be effective, the recommendations must be implemented.

### Coenzyme Q10 for heart failure… [^114BcUUQ]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Adverse effects are generally mild and may be only slightly increased with coenzyme Q10 supplementation.

1. Practice Pointers Heart failure is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality and is classified as systolic or diastolic. Low plasma concentrations of coenzyme Q10 have been found to be an independent predictor of mortality in patients with heart failure. 4 The authors of this Cochrane review sought to assess the safety and effectiveness of coenzyme Q10 supplementation, compared with placebo or conventional therapy, in persons with heart failure. 1 This Cochrane review included 11 randomized controlled trials and 1, 573 participants. 1 The follow-up time ranged from one to 26 months.

Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, heart failure–related hospitalization, improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction, and adverse effects. Study participants included patients with any type of chronic heart failure regardless of severity. Acute heart failure was the only exclusion criterion. Patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure who received coenzyme Q10 supplementation, 300 mg per day, had lower all-cause mortality after 26 months. However, this was based on a single double-blind RCT. Supplementation with coenzyme Q10 did not significantly decrease the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke. In 2013, the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association recommended against the use of nutritional supplements for the treatment of heart failure.

5 The 2017 update to this practice guideline did not address coenzyme Q10. The approximate cost of a one-month supply of the 200-mg dose of coenzyme Q10 is $10. 6 At this time, there is insufficient evidence to support, or refute, the use of coenzyme Q10 in patients with heart failure.
