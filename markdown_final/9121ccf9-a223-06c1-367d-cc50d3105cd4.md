## Question

Long term chronic pain management trauma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about long-term chronic pain management after trauma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical problem and its epidemiology. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and transition from acute to chronic pain. Next, I will examine risk stratification and screening. After that, I need to outline a multimodal, stepped-care approach emphasizing nonpharmacologic and nonopioid strategies. I will then consider special populations, including those with preexisting opioid use disorder, older adults, and patients with traumatic brain injury. Finally, I should address discharge planning, follow-up, and implementation gaps, and close with a concise, actionable synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and its scope. Chronic pain after trauma is common and often disabling, with approximately two-thirds of hospitalized trauma patients reporting chronic pain at 12 months and three-quarters reporting pain interference with activities of daily living, underscoring the need for proactive, longitudinal management rather than acute-only approaches [^5567fd5b]. Hold on, I should verify predictors of chronicity; high-quality data indicate that early post-injury anxiety, PTSD symptoms, pain catastrophizing, and the extent of pain distribution predict poor long-term pain and disability outcomes, which supports early identification and targeted interventions [^0f385e83] [^96f1cd9b].

> I need to check the pathophysiology to guide treatment choices. The transition from acute to chronic pain involves peripheral and central sensitization, with neural plastic changes that amplify pain signaling even after tissue healing, and trauma-related injuries frequently involve neuropathic components that persist beyond the expected healing window, explaining why purely anti-nociceptive strategies often fail [^16297b1a] [^4c08a1b2]. Wait, let me verify the role of psychosocial drivers; anxiety, depression, and PTSD not only co-occur with chronic post-trauma pain but also mutually maintain symptom severity, reinforcing the need for integrated mental health care in this population [^0f385e83] [^eaf36729].

> Next, I should review risk stratification and screening. I should confirm that no single validated tool perfectly predicts chronic post-trauma pain, but combining injury severity, pain intensity and distribution, and psychosocial factors improves prognostic accuracy; early anxiety and PTSD symptoms are particularly salient predictors of poor outcomes and should trigger enhanced interventions [^0f385e83] [^96f1cd9b]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about opioid misuse risk; while tools like the Opioid Risk Tool exist, they are not validated for trauma populations, so I need to ensure we screen for mental health and substance use comorbidities and document prior opioid exposure to inform safer prescribing and follow-up plans [^a2183363] [^12e657c1].

> I will now examine the foundation of care: a multimodal, stepped approach anchored in nonpharmacologic and nonopioid strategies. Let me verify the hierarchy; guidelines consistently recommend nonpharmacologic therapies as first-line for chronic musculoskeletal pain, with psychological therapies such as CBT, acceptance-based approaches, and mindfulness yielding small-to-moderate benefits on pain and function, and exercise, yoga, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation offering additional gains, especially when tailored to patient preferences and function [^34b1f5a5] [^1bfecaf6]. I should double-check that these benefits extend to trauma populations; collaborative care models adapted for TBI demonstrate sustained reductions in pain interference, supporting team-based, nonpharmacologic-first strategies in complex trauma patients [^04a0078d] [^be5aaac1].

> Let me consider pharmacologic options within a multimodal framework. I need to ensure we prioritize nonopioid medications such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs, gabapentinoids for neuropathic pain, and SNRIs or TCAs when indicated, reserving opioids as a last resort and at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with explicit exit strategies and functional goals [^e235245a] [^42c8b20e]. Wait, I should verify opioid stewardship specifics; for patients already on chronic opioids, continue baseline therapy, treat acute pain with multimodal regimens, and plan a taper to return to baseline as soon as feasible, documenting functional targets and reassessment intervals to avoid unintentional long-term escalation [^e235245a] [^650fe23d].

> But wait, what if the patient has preexisting opioid use disorder or is on medication-assisted treatment. I should confirm that buprenorphine or methadone should be continued throughout hospitalization, with multimodal analgesia layered on top; full mu-agonists can be added for breakthrough pain while monitoring closely, and inpatient initiation of buprenorphine or methadone is appropriate when OUD is newly identified, with coordinated outpatient linkage prior to discharge [^a9497646] [^303954d7]. Hold on, I should verify switching strategies; rare switches from buprenorphine to methadone for acute pain control are described, but transitions back can be challenging, so this should be reserved for select cases with specialist oversight [^4ea4cbf1].

> I need to ensure special populations are addressed. For older adults, I should reduce opioid starting doses by about 25% at age 60 and 50% at age 80, favor nonopioid multimodal regimens, and account for renal and hepatic impairment, fall risk, and cognitive comorbidities in shared decision-making and monitoring plans [^def3df36] [^7d87bad6]. For patients with traumatic brain injury, I should confirm that chronic pain is highly prevalent and often multifocal; collaborative care that integrates CBT-based self-management, physical activation, and medication review improves pain interference and is preferred over routine long-term opioids, which can worsen cognition and sleep [^db1e7951] [^834b10c0]. For patients with prior trauma or adverse childhood experiences, I should adopt trauma-informed communication, screen for ACEs when appropriate, and anticipate higher analgesic risk profiles, adjusting treatment plans accordingly [^5d71193e] [^17331d14].

> Next, I should review discharge planning and follow-up. I need to check that discharge prescriptions should be minimized to the lowest effective dose and duration, with explicit taper plans if opioids are used beyond a few days, and that patients receive education on expectations, functional goals, and nonpharmacologic self-management strategies to mitigate transition failures and persistent pain [^e235245a] [^a40311c2]. Hold on, I should verify coordination steps; notifying the patient's chronic pain or primary care provider, confirming PDMP checks, and arranging early follow-up within 2 weeks to reassess pain, function, and opioid use are essential to close the loop and prevent drift into long-term use without indication [^17cb6854] [^e235245a].

> I should double-check implementation gaps and quality markers. Many trauma centers lack validated, trauma-specific opioid misuse screening tools, rely on clinician judgment, and report insufficient guidance for tapering and risk mitigation, which perpetuates variability and potential bias; developing and validating trauma-informed screening and integrating EMR prompts for reassessment and tapering are critical next steps [^12e657c1] [^39ac8060]. Let me reconsider whether any existing tools suffice; current risk tools are not validated for trauma, so I need to ensure we document psychosocial comorbidities, prior opioid exposure, and functional goals to guide individualized decisions until better instruments are available [^a2183363] [^12e657c1].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical approach. Chronic pain after trauma is common and multifactorial, driven by peripheral and central sensitization and amplified by anxiety, PTSD, and psychosocial stressors; therefore, care should be proactive, stepped, and multidisciplinary, starting with nonpharmacologic therapies and nonopioid medications, reserving opioids for carefully selected cases with explicit functional goals and exit plans, and embedding mental health screening and trauma-informed care throughout the continuum [^16297b1a] [^34b1f5a5]. I need to ensure we screen early for risk factors, coordinate across teams, and reassess frequently to prevent the transition to chronicity and to optimize function, recognizing that collaborative care models show promise in complex trauma populations such as those with TBI [^04a0078d] [^be5aaac1].

---

Chronic pain after trauma is common and often multifactorial, with **neuropathic, musculoskeletal, and psychosocial components** [^0f385e83]. Effective management requires a **multimodal, patient-centered approach** that prioritizes nonpharmacologic therapies (CBT, mindfulness, physical therapy, acupuncture) [^34b1f5a5] and nonopioid medications (acetaminophen, NSAIDs, gabapentinoids, SNRIs) [^5a6a556b], reserving opioids for refractory cases with close monitoring [^e235245a]. Early identification of risk factors (anxiety, PTSD, catastrophizing) [^0f385e83] and coordinated care improve outcomes; **opioids should be minimized** due to limited long-term benefit and substantial risks [^6bca2416] [^e7f53588].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

Chronic pain is highly prevalent after trauma, with **approximately 66% of trauma patients reporting chronic pain at 12 months** [^5567fd5b] and 75% experiencing pain-related interference with daily activities [^5567fd5b]. Risk factors include:

- **High initial pain intensity**: Strong predictor of chronic pain [^0f385e83].
- **Psychological factors**: Anxiety, depression, PTSD, and pain catastrophizing increase risk [^0f385e83] [^96f1cd9b].
- **Injury characteristics**: Complex injuries, nerve damage, and polytrauma are associated with persistent pain [^4c08a1b2].
- **Demographics**: Female sex, older age, and lower socioeconomic status are additional risk factors [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology

Chronic pain after trauma arises from **complex interactions** among peripheral, central, and psychosocial mechanisms:

- **Peripheral sensitization**: Persistent nociceptive input from injured tissues lowers activation thresholds [^notfound].
- **Central sensitization**: Amplification of pain signals in the CNS, leading to hyperalgesia and allodynia [^16297b1a].
- **Neuropathic pain**: Direct nerve injury contributes to chronic pain syndromes [^4c08a1b2].
- **Psychosocial factors**: Anxiety, depression, and PTSD modulate pain perception and perpetuate chronicity [^0f385e83] [^eaf36729].

---

## Assessment and diagnosis

A **comprehensive assessment** is essential to guide treatment:

- **Pain characterization**: Intensity, quality, location, and temporal pattern [^38ac017e].
- **Functional impact**: Effect on daily activities, sleep, and psychosocial functioning [^9253985d].
- **Psychological screening**: Anxiety, depression, PTSD, and pain catastrophizing [^0f385e83].
- **Neuropathic pain assessment**: Identification of neuropathic components using validated tools (e.g. DN4) [^notfound].

---

## Multimodal management strategies

### Nonpharmacologic interventions

Nonpharmacologic therapies are **first-line** and should be integrated throughout care:

| **Intervention** | **Evidence level** | **Effectiveness** |
|-|-|-|
| Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) | High | Reduces pain intensity, improves function, and addresses psychological comorbidities [^1bfecaf6] |
| Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) | Moderate | Reduces pain intensity and improves quality of life [^1bfecaf6] |
| Physical therapy | High | Improves function, reduces pain, and enhances mobility [^1bfecaf6] |
| Acupuncture | Moderate | Reduces pain intensity and opioid consumption [^92929118] |
| Virtual reality (VR) | Moderate | Effective for acute pain and anxiety reduction [^1a2cd1a5] |

---

### Pharmacologic interventions

Pharmacotherapy should be **individualized** and risk-stratified:

- **First-line agents**: Acetaminophen, NSAIDs (if not contraindicated) [^5a6a556b].
- **Adjunctive agents**: Gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin) for neuropathic pain; SNRIs (duloxetine, venlafaxine) for comorbid depression/anxiety [^5a6a556b].
- **Opioids**: Reserved for refractory pain after failure of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid therapies; use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring and tapering plans [^e235245a] [^6bca2416].

---

## Special considerations

### Patients with pre-existing opioid use disorder (OUD)

- **Continue medication-assisted treatment (MAT)**: Methadone or buprenorphine should be continued throughout hospitalization [^a9497646].
- **Multimodal analgesia**: Use nonpharmacologic and nonopioid strategies; full mu-agonists may be added for severe pain with careful monitoring [^a9497646].
- **Coordinated care**: Involve addiction specialists and plan outpatient follow-up [^17cb6854].

---

### Older adults

In older adults, **opioid-sparing strategies** are essential; initiate opioids at reduced doses (25–50% lower) and titrate cautiously [^def3df36]. Also consider age-related pharmacokinetic changes, comorbidities, and fall risk [^7d87bad6].

---

### Traumatic brain injury (TBI)

After traumatic brain injury, **collaborative care models** that integrate physical therapy, psychological interventions, and medication management are effective [^04a0078d]. Avoid opioids when possible due to cognitive and respiratory risks; prioritize nonpharmacologic strategies [^834b10c0].

---

## Barriers to effective management

- **Under-treatment**: Inadequate pain control remains common, particularly in vulnerable populations [^a4584800].
- **Over-reliance on opioids**: Persistent opioid use after trauma is common and associated with adverse outcomes [^e7f53588].
- **Lack of coordinated care**: Fragmented care impedes optimal outcomes [^db1e7951].
- **Limited access**: Nonpharmacologic therapies are often inaccessible or underutilized [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and best practices

- **Multimodal analgesia**: Combine pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies tailored to patient needs [^5a6a556b].
- **Patient education**: Set realistic expectations and emphasize self-management [^a40311c2].
- **Regular reassessment**: Monitor pain, function, and psychological status; adjust treatment accordingly [^727787b5].
- **Opioid stewardship**: Use the lowest effective dose, implement tapering plans, and monitor for misuse [^e235245a].

---

## Conclusion

Chronic pain after trauma is common and multifactorial; **effective management requires a multimodal, patient-centered approach** that prioritizes nonpharmacologic therapies and nonopioid medications, with opioids reserved for refractory cases. Early identification of risk factors, coordinated care, and adherence to guidelines improve outcomes and reduce the burden of chronic pain.

Opioid use and nonpharmacologic strategies in the emergency department emphasize that patients with a history of chronic opioid use or SUD often have greater analgesic needs than opioid-naïve patients, and providers should not withhold opioids solely due to a history of SUD. Protocols need to include pain assessment and management strategies while accounting for hemodynamic status and prioritizing resuscitation, and prioritize nonpharmacologic techniques for pain management when possible.

Acute and chronic pain in trauma patients remains a challenging entity, particularly in the setting of the escalating opioid epidemic. It has been reported that chronic opioid use increases the likelihood of hospital admissions as a result of traumatic injuries. Furthermore, patients admitted with traumatic injuries have a greater than average risk of developing opioid use disorder after discharge. Practitioners providing care to these patients will encounter the issue of balancing analgesic goals and acute opioid withdrawal with the challenge of reducing postdischarge persistent opioid use. Additionally, the practitioner is faced with the worrisome prospect that inadequate treatment of acute pain may lead to the development of chronic pain and overtreatment may result in opioid dependence. It is therefore imperative to understand and execute alternative nonopioid strategies to maximize the benefits and reduce the risks of analgesic regimens in this patient population. This narrative review will analyze the current literature on pain management in trauma patients and highlight the application of the multimodal approach in potentially reducing the risks of both short- and long-term opioid use. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Narrative review, moderate to High.

Nonpharmacologic pain management in trauma — Nonpharmacologic pain management strategies are recommended as adjuncts for pain and anxiety management in trauma to minimize opioid usage and chronic pain development, and the evidence base is stronger for cognitive rather than physical strategies. Although the evidence supporting the use of many nonpharmacologic pain management strategies in the setting of acute injury is not expansive, the interventions themselves are generally low-risk. It is recommended that these strategies be considered as adjuncts for pain and anxiety management in trauma across the entire age spectrum from children to adults, particularly in an effort to minimize opioid usage and chronic pain development. Tailor the specific treatments chosen to the needs of patients and resources available in each facility. A clear role exists for nonpharmacologic pain management in children, and multiple small, single center studies reported beneficial effects of music therapy, virtual reality environments, hypnosis, and other techniques to reduce pain and distress. However, as in adults, minimal high-quality evidence exists.

Trauma is a major cause of mortality throughout the world. In recent years, major advances have been made in the management of trauma, the end result of which has been reduced mortality and enhanced function. One of these areas is pain control. Improved pain management has not only led to increased comfort in trauma patients, but has also been shown to reduce morbidity and improve long-term outcomes. This review focuses on the treatment of pain in the setting of acute injury and on pain management in trauma patients who go on to develop chronic pain. Emphasis is placed on pharmacologic interventions, invasive and noninvasive pain management techniques, analgesia in challenging patients, and pain control in commonly encountered trauma conditions.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^a9497646]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain management in patients on chronic opioid therapy or with opioid use disorder (OUD) prioritizes risk mitigation and continuity of addiction care. Chronic opioid use increases the risk of trauma, length of stay, and likelihood of ICU admission following a traumatic event, and on discharge patients with OUD are more likely to get opioid prescriptions of longer duration. Patients with untreated OUD presenting after a traumatic injury need treatment for withdrawal as well as acute pain, and inpatient initiation of OUD treatment is safe and effective. Patients presenting on agonist medication-assisted treatment for OUD (e.g., methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone) need continuation of this treatment throughout hospitalization, and address acute pain as for any other patient using MMA, including full-agonist opioids if necessary. Plan the transition from inpatient to outpatient care by communicating with the patient's existing health care providers or referring patients with newly diagnosed OUD to outpatient treatment facilities.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^4c08a1b2]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain physiology — transition from acute to chronic pain in trauma care is described, noting this transition is most common in patients with direct injury to nerves or with complex injuries that are slow to heal, but it can also occur after relatively trivial injuries in otherwise healthy patients. In trauma care, the transition from acute to chronic pain is a common complication, leading to significant long-term functional impairment, the potential for development of a substance use disorder (SUD), and diminished long-term health. Search for evidence of chronic pain during patient follow-up visits. Carefully assess patients with continued dependence on opioid medications or obvious functional limitations despite evidence of anatomic recovery for undiagnosed injuries or other occult causes of pain, such as deep wound infection. If none are found, it is appropriate to refer the patient to a pain specialist for ongoing treatment of chronic pain syndrome, including supervised tapering from opioid medications.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^16297b1a]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain physiology — pain involves both sensation and response, beginning with activation of nociceptors and transmission via second-order pain neurons to the brain stem and cortex, with descending modulation from the cortex to the spinal cord. Perception integrates the modulated pain signal with sensory and cognitive inputs, and identical stimuli can elicit exaggerated or diminished responses based on context; patient reported self-efficacy is a better predictor of satisfaction with pain management than the nociceptive stimulus itself. Pain perception is dynamic, with continued pain producing neural changes that amplify or diminish sensation; in the spinal cord, continued pain can lead to up-regulation of receptors and an amplified response to repeated stimuli, a phenomenon thought to be important in the transition from acute pain to chronic pain. Chronic pain is continued perception of pain without an obvious or ongoing anatomic trigger; development of chronic pain is common after trauma and can lead to significant long-term functional impairment and potentially a substance use disorder. Because pain is a multidimensional emotional and sensory experience, a patient's response can vary widely based on physiologic, psychologic, and contextual factors.

Pharmacologic analgesia in trauma — key directives and risk considerations are as follows: Include acetaminophen (APAP) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in pain management unless contraindicated. Opioids are the standard comparison for effectiveness of pharmacologic analgesics to treat acute, severe nociceptive pain; however, their use may be limited by central nervous system and respiratory depression, as well as ileus and tolerance. Overreliance on opioids, specifically as monotherapy for analgesia, may contribute to opioid dependence, and factors that increase risk of chronic opioid use after trauma include prior opioid use, chronic back pain, depression, and prolonged hospital stay. Assess patients daily to determine the types of pain experienced (nociceptive, neuropathic, visceral, etc.), as well as for other systemic injuries and/or comorbidities that may necessitate caution when prescribing analgesics. Optimize the medication regimen accordingly. While nonpharmacologic pain management is recommended based on the risk versus benefit profile, most patients will require pharmacologic analgesia after traumatic injury. Opioids are effective analgesics that were considered the mainstay of treatment, and the opioid crisis in the United States (U.S.) has increased scrutiny of opioid use and highlighted the potential usefulness of multimodal analgesia (MMA) strategies.

### CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain… [^42c8b20e]. CDC (2023). Medium credibility.

4). Patients can experience persistent pain that is not well controlled. There are clinical, psychological, and social consequences associated with chronic pain including limitations in complex activities, lost work productivity, reduced quality of life, and stigma, emphasizing the importance of appropriate and compassionate patient care. Patients should receive appropriate pain treatment based on a careful consideration of the benefits and risks of treatment options. Chronic pain has been variably defined but is defined within this guideline as pain that typically lasts > 3 months or past the time of normal tissue healing, and patients receiving opioid therapy for chronic pain report some pain relief when surveyed.

This guideline provides recommendations for the prescribing of opioid pain medication by primary care clinicians for chronic pain in outpatient settings outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care. Although the guideline does not focus broadly on pain management, appropriate use of long-term opioid therapy must be considered within the context of all pain management strategies. 14, 52) initially served to directly inform the recommendation statements.

This systematic clinical evidence review addressed the effectiveness of long-term opioid therapy for outcomes related to pain, function, and quality of life; the comparative effectiveness of different methods for initiating and titrating opioids; the harms and adverse events associated with opioids; and the accuracy of risk-prediction instruments and effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies on outcomes related to overdose, addiction, abuse, or misuse.

The review focused on the following four areas: effectiveness of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic treatments; benefits and harms related to opioid therapy; clinician and patient values and preferences; and resource allocation.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management and rehabilitation of post-acute mild traumatic brain injury [^834b10c0]. DoD/VA (2021). High credibility.

Post-acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) pain — assessment and treatment: Chronic pain is sometimes interwoven with co-occurring conditions such as sleep disorders, anxiety, MDD, or PTSD, and providers may consult the VA/DoD CPG for Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain for assessment of persistent pain. Pain management is a priority and thus all individuals presenting with a history of mTBI and complaints of pain should be thoroughly assessed, with the underlying cause determined and treated, if possible. The use of non-pharmacologic therapies should be considered as first-line, rehabilitation therapies may be beneficial for the management of pain in individuals with a history of mTBI, and the use of opioid agents in chronic pain conditions should be avoided until other avenues of pain control have been given appropriate treatment trials. Providers may also consult the VA/DoD CPG for the Management of Chronic Multisymptom Illness or the VA/DoD CPG for Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain for additional strategies to manage persistent pain.

### 2017 HIVMA of IDSA clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic pain in patients living with HIV [^16c35077]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Foundational principles in chronic pain management in persons living with HIV (PLWH) state that chronic pain be initially assessed in the same manner as in persons without HIV, and that access to pain management, which includes assessment and treatment, is a fundamental human right. Named options include aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, codeine, and morphine; methadone and buprenorphine can be used for the treatment of opioid use disorders as well as chronic pain. A biopsychosocial model of medicine is an important conceptual framework that emphasizes the multidimensional nature of chronic pain, and comprehensive interdisciplinary programs rely on teams that consist of primary care providers and nurses, physical and occupational therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, and case managers. Multimodal treatments combine analgesics, physical therapy, and behavioral and psychological therapy, and the interdisciplinary team addresses biological, behavioral, and social factors to achieve functional restoration. Empathy and patient-centered communication skills are essential. Medical providers should clarify and document the presence of specific HIV-related pain syndromes, discuss the full management strategy with the patient, manage expectations about the effectiveness of various treatments, and provide clear explanations of the results of the medical record. Medical providers should understand the basic concepts of pain management, including when specific treatments should be recommended, their potential risks and benefits, and the adverse drug reactions and drug–drug interactions that can occur when pharmacotherapies are prescribed. Medical providers should maintain a nonjudgmental perspective and broad differential diagnosis when managing unexpected patient behaviors; for example, the phenomenon of "pseudo-addiction" may explain the behavior of patients who appear to be hoarding their medications or requesting early refills. Pain is exacerbated by psychosocial variables such as depression, a history of sexual abuse, trauma, and post-traumatic stress disorder, and appropriate screening and treatment for these factors are requisite for the success of a comprehensive treatment plan for chronic pain. All chronic pain patients should be screened for unhealthy substance use; if identified, their pain management may require consultation with and concomitant treatment from an addiction specialist, and higher complexity and co-occurring disorders, however, should not delay the primary HIV provider's systematic evaluation and treatment of chronic pain symptoms.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^f5534341]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain management in the intensive care unit — rationale and patient factors — the intent of these guidelines is to increase the use of multimodal analgesia (MMA) and to improve pain management for the more than 50% of patients who report inadequate pain relief while in the ICU. MMA decreases opioid requirements in the ICU, and a recent survey of trauma surgeons documented that they were prescribing fewer opioids. It is imperative to account for a patient's past medical history and comorbidities when choosing an analgesic regimen, and patients with SUD prior to admission are often an MMA challenge when attempting to manage alcohol or drug withdrawal and achieve satisfactory levels of analgesia. It is important to recognize that under- and over-treatment of pain contributes to the development of chronic pain syndromes, specifically in the ICU; chronic pain syndromes are common following trauma and surgery, and an increasing number of reports address hyperalgesia in response to opioids and the relation of hyperalgesia to chronic pain syndrome development. The goal is to avoid inadequate pain management while assuring the analgesia provided matches the severity of pain experienced by the patient.

### Acute pain management after trauma: what you need to know [^89b3ede5]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Effective acute pain control is mandatory after injury. Opioids continue to be a pillar acute pain management of strategies despite not being as effective as some nonnarcotic alternatives. An acute pain management strategy after trauma should be thoughtful, effective, and responsible. A thoughtful approach includes managing a patient's expectations for acute pain control and ensuring that interventions purposefully and rationally affect the domain of pain that is uncontrolled. An effective pain management strategy includes a multimodal approach using acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and regional anesthesia. A responsible acute pain management approach includes knowing the relative strengths of the opioids prescribed and standardized approach to opioid prescribing at discharge to minimize diversion. Acute pain management is quite understudied, and future considerations include a reliable objective measurement of pain and the evaluation of nonmedication acute pain interventions.

### AGA clinical practice update on pain management in inflammatory bowel disease: commentary [^034b3bc5]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — risk factors and provider roles in IBD chronic abdominal pain state that recognizing risk factors after a flare or surgery is critical to early and effective intervention, with highest risk in those with a history of chronic pain, prior early-life adversity or trauma (including discrimination experiences and poverty), and poor coping styles such as catastrophizing; these factors should be assessed and managed early, with close monitoring and discussion of progression risk. An understanding of the patient's social environment, including positive social support and pain-reinforcing factors such as receiving disability, substance misuse history, or worker's compensation, can hasten conversion from an acute episode to a chronic pain condition. The role of the primary IBD provider is to build empathy, trust, and shared responsibility around chronic pain management, and chronic pain in IBD is a distinct, waxing-and-waning disease state that can be managed similarly to IBD using a multidisciplinary, integrated, proactive approach; similar multidisciplinary approaches have been used successfully in all patients with chronic pain.

METHODS

Panel and Target Audience

This guideline aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of acute musculoskeletal pain. A panel of 15 members with expertise in orthopaedic trauma, pain management, or both was convened to review the literature and develop recommendations on acute musculoskeletal pain management. Chronic pain is outside the scope of this guideline.

Literature Review

The panel met in person in October 2017 to define the scope of the guideline and identify important topics for inclusion. The topics included cognitive strategies, physical modalities, opioid safety and effectiveness, multimodal pharmaceutical strategies, medical assistance therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and fracture healing, nerve/regional/field blocks, pain and sedation assessment strategies, and health care system strategies. One or 2 panel members were assigned to draft recommendations for each topic area. Literature searches were conducted through September 2018. Information about each included article is available in the Supplemental Digital Content 1 (see Table).

Grading Process

The methods described by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group were applied to each recommendation. This method yields a grade for the strength of the recommendation and a grade for the quality of the evidence. The grading of the evidence was based on the study designs, number of studies, sample sizes, and consistency of results among different studies. The panel assigned recommendations as "strong" (practices in which benefits are sure to outweigh potential harms) or "conditional" (the evidence was weaker or if the benefits do not significantly outweigh potential harms).

Approval of Guideline

Recommendations from each topic area were combined to produce a comprehensive guideline for management of acute musculoskeletal pain. All panel members reviewed and revised the combined guideline. The guideline was submitted to the Orthopaedic Trauma Association for review and was approved on October 16, 2018.

Pain assessment in trauma patients — key points include: "Consider the multidimensional nature of pain when selecting a pain assessment tool"; "During pain assessment, account for the patient's cognition and ability to communicate, which may be affected by injury, extent of illness, age, and other factors"; "Reassess pain systematically, ideally using the same appropriate tool"; and "Reevaluate significant changes in pain promptly to identify missed, new, or developing injuries". The page states that "Pain assessment is a complex process, and pain is difficult to fully quantify with any single assessment tool", that "Unidimensional scales may not accurately reflect the multidimensional nature of the patient's pain experience", and advises "Avoid changing the tool selected for the initial pain assessment unless necessary". It adds that "When assessing pain, health care providers must acknowledge their biases and navigate multiple competing interests to relieve pain, prescribe responsibly, and preserve the patient-provider relationship", and concludes that "The goal of pain management is not "zero pain" but pain that is tolerable and allows the patient to function".

Pain management in patients with depression — depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders are linked to acute and chronic pain due to injury. Nearly one in five American adults is prescribed psychotropic medication, and up to 36% of patients are prescribed psychotropics prior to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Abrupt discontinuation of psychotropic medications may cause withdrawal and is associated with increased psychiatric symptoms in hospitalized patients. In general, restart psychotropic medications as soon as possible after admission. However, because psychotropic medications may increase the risk of injury, particularly due to falls in the older adult, conduct a risk-benefit analysis of medication continuation in consultation with the patient's primary care provider or psychiatry. In one study with more than 4,000 orthopaedic trauma patients, a history of depression was documented in about 4% of them; among those with a documented depression history, two-thirds had a documented median delay of 24 hours (range 0–14 days) before their psychotropic medications were restarted, and patients with a history of depression or anxiety had a 32% longer length of stay. Patients with pre-injury depression are also more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms after injury.

### Pain management in trauma: the need for trauma-informed opioid prescribing guidelines [^16eb3261]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 3.5 million individuals report persistent opioid use in the USA, with injured individuals constituting approximately 10.6% of this population. Several populations constitute the individuals at heightened risk for prolonged opioid use and misuse, including surgical populations and traumatic injury survivors. Treatment for surgical and traumatic injury patients involves multiple providers from a variety of healthcare resources, resulting in a complex, multidimensional clinical presentation. The complexities embedded within traumatic injury necessitate specific, tailored federal guidelines to direct providers in successfully managing their patient's pain and risk for opioid misuse.

Prior research has investigated the effectiveness of federal guidelines for opioid prescription practices; however, the majority of these data have come from chronic pain populations, with limited recommendations for trauma and acute care. For instance, one recommendation within these guidelines pertinent to acute pain treatment includes prescribing the lowest effective dose of opioids possible for ≤ 3 days. However, these guidelines only applied to non-traumatic and non-surgical acute pain, failing to offer any recommendations specific to trauma and acute care populations. In lieu of these shortcomings, healthcare systems and providers have adapted their opioid prescribing practices to address the risk for opioid misuse for patients hospitalized for traumatic injury.

While the recent 2022 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) opioid prescribing guidelines do attempt to define acute pain as having a duration of less than 1 month, additional recommendations included for trauma and acute care patients are minimal. Moreover, Wisconsin requires 2 hours of opioid-related continuing medical education (CME) every 2 years to maintain licensure in the state; however, the opioid-specific CME credits are not necessarily specific to trauma-related care. In addition to complications surrounding acute and chronic pain, patients with traumatic injury often have comorbid mental health and substance use diagnoses that were either pre-existing or emergent after the trauma; such comorbidities may complicate pain management and clinical decision-making. Minimal research has elucidated the treatment needs and nuances for individuals suffering from traumatic injuries, as seen from the perspective of providers. To address this dearth in research, the present qualitative study investigated how trauma and acute care providers incorporated the 2016 opioid prescribing guidelines into patient care plans, the facilitators and barriers prescribers encountered when treating traumatic injury survivors, and the implications of study findings on current and future opioid prescribing guidelines.

Discharge opioid prescribing — when issuing prescription opioids at discharge, carefully assess the proclivity for sustained prescription opioid use by considering sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, prior history, type and nature of opioid exposure, comorbid psychiatric illness, and the type and dosage of in-hospital opioid medications required for adequate pain control; the goal is to issue a prescription that provides effective pain control with the lowest dosage and duration of prescription opioid possible, including no prescription for outpatient opioids if appropriate.

### The experience and understanding of pain management in recently discharged adult trauma patients: a qualitative study [^b9293445]. Injury (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pain following injury is often intense, prolonged and debilitating. If poorly managed, this acute pain has the potential to delay rehabilitation and lead to chronic pain. Recent quantitative Australian research recommends implementing further information and interventions to improve trauma patient outcomes, however, to ensure effectiveness, exploration of the patient perspective is imperative to ensure the success of future pain management strategies. This study aimed to gain understanding about the experience of pain management using prescribed analgesic regimens of recently discharged adult trauma patients.

Method

Semi-structured interviews were used to explore the experiences and understandings of trauma patients in managing pain using prescribed analgesic regimens during the initial post-hospital discharge period. Twelve participants were purposively selected over a 6-month period at a level one trauma outpatient clinic based on questionnaire responses indicating pain related concerns. Qualitative data were thematically analysed.

Results

The overarching finding was that injuries and inadequate pain management incapacitate the patient at home. Four main themes were developed: injury pain is unique and debilitating; patients are uninformed at hospital discharge; patients have low confidence with pain management at home; and patients make independent decisions about pain management. Patients felt they were not given adequate information at hospital discharge to support them to make effective decisions about their pain management practices at home.

Conclusion

There is a need for more inclusive and improved hospital discharge processes that includes patient and family education around pain management following injury. To achieve this, clinician education, support and training is essential.

### Pain management in trauma: the need for trauma-informed opioid prescribing guidelines [^f73f55f3]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Overall, findings underscored the marginal benefit from existing federal guidelines when prescribing opioids in the setting of traumatic injury. Across all four study sites, clinicians agreed that current opioid prescribing guidelines are insufficient and that new guidance specific to the setting of traumatic injury is necessary to improve treatment outcomes and mitigate risk for opioid misuse. Participants identified several procedures through which they sought to improve current practice, including additional screening for PTSD and/or SUD, non-opioid pain management strategies, and setting patient expectations regarding pain management. Inconsistent, ineffective, and potentially discriminatory opioid prescription practices will persist until clear and effective guidelines are established and disseminated across clinical sites.

Pain assessment — The guideline emphasizes that "and procedures must reflect these standards, to include at a minimum, the interval at which a patient is assessed and reassessed for pain, and if patients are to be awakened for pain assessments". After a pain intervention is completed, reassess patients for both pain control and adverse reactions to the intervention at an appropriate interval based on the anticipated effect (e.g., drug onset and peak effect). When a significant change in worsening pain level is reported, promptly reevaluate the patient for possible evolving or missed injury.

Discussion

A qualitative analysis of interviews was conducted with focus groups at four hospitals across the state of Wisconsin to determine the translation of opioid prescribing guidelines into clinical practice. Three major themes emerged from this analysis, including current acute treatment strategies during hospitalization, the importance of patient–provider communication surrounding pain management, and the often overlooked importance of the multifactorial nature of trauma when determining best practices for opioid prescribing.

A call to action

Together, the data serve as a call to action to establish clear guidelines surrounding opioid prescribing in the setting of trauma and acute care. Across all four sites, providers expressed concern that, while contemporaneous opioid prescribing guidelines were helpful for informing overall pain management practices, these guidelines fall short in the setting of traumatic injury. Specifically, the focus on the treatment of acute pain (duration of < 1 month) during hospitalization fails to account for the chronic nature of many traumatic injuries, as well as the frequent co-occurrence of mental health and substance use sequelae or precursors to traumatic injury. In recent years, research has begun highlighting the unique challenges to opioid prescribing in trauma. Yet, little work has been done to identify how these research findings can be translated into clinical practice to ensure patients are satisfied with their pain management while also mitigating risk for opioid misuse.

Current practices

Current strategies to account for this gap in research and guidelines were identified. Predominantly, providers indicated that discussing expectations with patients regarding the pain they would experience, the relief they can anticipate from treatment, and anticipated discharge prescription quantities is an excellent strategy to facilitate transparency between patients and providers, as well as enhance patient satisfaction with pain management. In an effort to address the complex multifactorial presentations in traumatic injury, all four sites included screening tools to detect mental health and/or substance use concerns, with interventions reported at most sites to respond to individuals identified as high risk for these co-occurring conditions. However, none of the sites employed any combined screening-intervention approach to specifically assess risk for opioid misuse. Reliance on currently unvalidated screening methods for opioid misuse poses a risk for effective pain management and may lead to iatrogenic harm for traumatic injury patients. Thus, there is an imperative need to establish evidence-based guidelines for robustly screening and mitigating risk for opioid misuse in the setting of traumatic injury.

### Nerve root injuries in patients with chronic low back pain [^af401f3a]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the nerve roots and the DRG play an important role in the pain mechanisms of patients suffering from chronic low back pain. Signs of demyelination and increased sensitization for stimuli occurs after a direct nerve root trauma, and the plasticity for the DRG also may change the response to a given peripheral stimuli when repeated frequently over a long period of time. The regeneration mechanisms of spinal nerve roots and DRG regarding function are slow, and the final grade of recurrence depends on the degree of injury. The limited regeneration mechanisms for nerve injury and the fact that "established chronic pain centers" are hard to influence after a long pain history favor an aggressive strategy for pain management. Today, a number of treatment strategies exist for chronic low back pain patients (with or without a diagnosed nerve root injury). These strategies include physiotherapy, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroids, analgesics of different types and administration routes, surgery, and other sorts of invasive treatments. Further knowledge about the nerve root, DRG, and the rest of the nervous system in these patients is necessary; for understanding how and when to treat patients with chronic low back pain, we need to understand more about what we are trying to treat.

### Chronic pain and bone-related pathologies: a narrative review [^827edd02]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Pain related to bone may occur as a result of trauma, bone fracture, genetic disease, arthritis, benign or malignant primary bone tumors and bone cancer metastases. We discuss the pathophysiology of chronic bone-related pain, treatment options and therapeutic perspectives.

Methods

Using predefined terms, we searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar for meta-analyses, evidence-based reviews, and clinical practice guidelines. This narrative article reviews pathologies linked to chronic bone pain and discusses the preventive and therapeutic strategies for better bone pain management.

Results

Pathophysiology of bone-related pain is complex, especially in cancer conditions and missing gaps are underlined. Treatment of pain, after adequate evaluation, includes classical analgesics, adjuvants for neuropathic and refractory pain, specific bone drugs, surgery and non-pharmacological approaches. Prevention of chronic bone pain encompasses prevention of central sensitization and of causal diseases.

Conclusion

Translational research, drug repurposing, an interdisciplinary approach and a person-centered assessment to evaluate, beyond pain, physical, social and functional abilities, are proposed future directions to improve chronic bone pain management and optimize independence and quality of life.

Summary

Chronic bone-related pain is frequent and is associated with an impairment of quality of life. In this review, we summarize the pathophysiology of chronic bone pain, describe treatment approaches and envisage new avenues for pain alleviation. Our article will help doctors manage chronic bone pain and address unmet needs for future research to alleviate bone-related pain.

Pain management in patients on chronic opioid therapy or with opioid use disorder — switching from buprenorphine to methadone on admission with acute pain is described as "a potential, uncommon third option", and "Methadone at 30–40 mg per day will manage the baseline opioid requirement and help prevent withdrawal for most patients, and it may allow full mu agonists such as morphine, oxycodone, and hydromorphone to provide additional pain relief more predictably"; however, "the eventual transition back to buprenorphine may be challenging with this approach".

Multimodal pain management — key points and patient counseling — emphasizes clear patient expectations, proactive assessment, scheduled nonopioid analgesics, and planned de-escalation. The page states to counsel patients that the goal of pain management is not eradication of all pain and to inform patients that pain is normal after trauma and surgery, medications are meant to alleviate but not remove pain entirely, and pain may increase as mobility increases. Key points include that patient education about expectations for management is a highly effective intervention for pain management, to promptly investigate the cause of increasing pain rather than responding by increasing the analgesic dose or adding new medications, to administer acetaminophen and ibuprofen "around-the-clock" to maintain a constant serum level, and to have a protocol for safe de-escalation of analgesics as quickly as possible. The page defines multimodal analgesia (MMA) as the use of multiple analgesics, regional analgesia, and nonpharmacologic interventions to affect peripheral and/or central nervous system loci in the pain pathway, and notes that the MMA concept may be applied across the care continuum with strategies suited to each phase of care.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^5567fd5b]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Acute pain in trauma — burden, goals, and evolving practice — is common and affects function, with the majority of trauma victims experiencing pain and acute pain impacting respiratory function, metabolic demand, wound healing, immunity, and mobility. Long-term sequelae are frequent, as Nearly two-thirds of patients report at least moderate pain 12 months after injury and three in four report pain interference with activities of daily living. The treatment goal is a tolerable pain level that allows the patient to function, not 'zero pain'. Practice has shifted over the last decade due to the opioid crisis in the United States, prompting calls from the American Medical Association (AMA), the Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA), and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) to minimize opioid use, alongside new research supporting the safety and efficacy of nonopioid analgesia. Management must be individualized because unique environments and patient populations present challenges that prevent a one-size-fits-all approach.

Implications for clinical practice

Study findings suggest that clinicians may benefit from increased guidance to setting patient expectations, incorporating non-opioid pain management techniques, and potentially screening for co-occurring substance use disorders (SUD) and other mental health factors that may increase risk for misuse. Similarly, clarifications around tapering plans for opioid prescriptions would provide expectations around the long-term utilization of opioids for acute pain. Importantly, available data are still too limited to draw robust conclusions regarding the risk factors for opioid misuse after traumatic injury; therefore, clinicians are instructed to exercise caution when interpreting findings around substance use or psychological history to determine risk for misuse. Pain is a frequent motivation for opioid misuse, and clinicians should ensure that any efforts to mitigate risk for misuse do not lead to suboptimal pain management and subsequent opioid misuse.

Recommendations for future research

Present research demonstrates an immediate need for intensive remodeling of opioid prescribing guidelines for patients with traumatic injury. Participating trauma centers repeatedly emphasized that traumatic injury is a multifactorial problem that requires solutions beyond the scope of generalized pain management approaches. Thus, future research should build on previous work to identify unique contributors and risk factors for pain severity and opioid misuse after traumatic injury, as well as develop treatment approaches to effectively intervene for this population. Moreover, traumatic injuries may instantiate a seminal event for opioid misuse, with elevated risk factors for psychosocial distress, insufficient pain management, and emergent opioid misuse that surpass other populations. Therefore, individuals suffering traumatic injury may particularly benefit from an adaptive treatment approach that aims to enhance psychosocial outcomes while mitigating risk for opioid misuse.

The multifactorial nature of traumatic injuries also warrants further exploration through a diversity and equity lens. As research continues to develop in this field and validated measures are created, researchers should contextualize these within specific populations, such as with racial, ethnic, and linguistic minorities, and consider issues of accessibility and acceptability for screening and treatment across populations suffering from traumatic injury. To that end, future clinical trials should incorporate stakeholder advisory panels, such as those included in this analysis, to evaluate the validity and accessibility of screeners and interventions across all demographics.

### Pain management in trauma: the need for trauma-informed opioid prescribing guidelines [^763c5448]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Updated opioid prescribing guidelines

Since this study was completed, new opioid prescribing guidelines have emerged, which have begun to address the need for unique guidelines in the setting of traumatic injury, including the potential need for longer duration opioid therapy for individuals for whom prolonged severe pain is anticipated. For these individuals, the updated guidelines have addressed the extension of opioid prescriptions, including a suggested protocol for evaluation of the transition from acute (duration of < 1 month) to chronic pain (duration of > 3 months) after traumatic injury. Moreover, these new guidelines underscore the importance of evaluating mental health and substance use conditions that may increase likelihood of opioid misuse, as well as provision of alternative treatments focused on these conditions rather than focusing treatment solely on patient-reported pain. However, these guidelines fail to provide any clear path to evaluating nor intervening for these potential risk factors of opioid misuse.

Results of the present study are in line with the recommendations proposed in the 2022 guidelines, such as the need for consideration of confounding mental health symptoms in opioid prescribing and the multifactorial decision-making process of prolonged opioid prescribing. Study findings suggest that trauma and acute care providers may benefit from using the current guidelines as a foundation on which to build inpatient and discharge prescribing plans from. Implementing these guidelines for defining acute versus chronic pain, the ancillary use of non-opioid pain treatments, and assessing risk for opioid harms and misuse may prove beneficial in the setting of trauma, as supported by the presented findings.

Findings from the present study suggest that these new guidelines are a starting point for improving patient care and pain management in the setting of traumatic injury. Moreover, data suggesting providers prescribe based on 'gut feeling' echo concerns of provider biases when prescribing opioids. However, at the time of writing this article, the authors are unaware of any validated and implemented methods for screening for risk of opioid misuse in the setting of traumatic injury; the lack of evidence-based methods for detecting opioid misuse risk poses a serious threat to effective pain management and perpetuates the risk for discriminatory prescribing practices. Moreover, while current guidelines address the benefits of monitoring for signs and symptoms of opioid misuse, as well as the treatment needs for opioid use disorder, they fail to offer guidance for proactively intervening to prevent opioid misuse. In the present qualitative analysis, all four sites indicated that an evidence-based method of screening and intervening for opioid misuse risk would be a welcomed addition to ensuring patient safety and well-being both during hospitalization and, especially, after discharge.

Influence of the multifactorial nature of trauma on pain management

A common theme among provider recommendations for approaching opioid prescribing in the trauma and acute care setting is the need for trauma-specific initiatives (n = 4). The multifactorial nature of traumatic injuries (eg, acute and chronic pain, polytrauma, psychosomatic factors) reportedly adds layers of complexity to the already multifaceted patient care planning (n = 3). Providers at all four study sites have noted that there remains minimal evidence or guidance for supporting trauma and acute care patients. Outside of general guidance surrounding PDMP use for monitoring current narcotic use and prescription history, participating sites (n = 1) were reportedly unaware of any official guidance for incorporating national databases or screening tools into care plans for traumatic injury victims.

Additionally, trauma and acute care patients are at an acute risk for substance misuse and mental health symptoms related to their injuries and hospitalization. Thus, these characteristics and risk factors should be considered when prescribing opioids and creating care plans. With these factors in mind, increased federal guidance for opioid prescribing in the setting of trauma and acute care would benefit from individualized approaches to patient care to account for the many complexities (eg, multifactorial nature of care, polytrauma injuries) of this patient population.

Screening tools for pain and relevant factors

I mean, if we [had] a validated tool that was effective in identifying at-risk patients [for opioid misuse], certainly there'd be value in using that screen universally. (East)

Each site noted that implementing an opioid misuse screening tool in the setting of trauma would help facilitate communication between clinicians and patients. While not validated in this setting, sites (n = 3) explicitly stated that mental health and substance use diagnoses or symptoms are also relevant to trauma patients. Hence, all four sites indicated using brief screeners for relevant psychological and substance sequelae (eg, depression/anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and alcohol screens) to extrapolate potential risk factors for opioid misuse. The use of these screening tools reportedly helps clinicians create individualized care plans for patients and prescribe medications based on the risk stratification estimated by clinician judgment (n = 3). Notably, there may be potential iatrogenic harms in extrapolating the results from measures beyond their validated purpose to approximate risk for opioid misuse, further highlighting the need for guidelines and validated screening measures in this population.

### Collaborative care for chronic pain after traumatic brain injury: a randomized clinical trial [^db1e7951]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain, defined as pain experienced more than one-half of the days for at least 3 months, is present in more than one-half of individuals following traumatic brain injury (TBI) of any severityand includes headache, musculoskeletal, and neuropathic pain. In a study of moderate-to-severe TBI, approximately 46% of 3804 participants endorsed current chronic pain, with back pain occurring most frequently (65%) followed by head pain (47%). Participants reported a median of 4 pain locations, suggesting a complex picture of pain. The prevalence of pain symptoms after TBI and their association with poor outcomes highlight chronic pain management as an important treatment target after TBI. There are currently no clinical practice guidelines for chronic pain treatment after TBI. In our own previous work, pain was endorsed by 73% of individuals 1 year after moderate-to-severe TBI, with 55% reporting pain interference with important daily activities. Chronic pain has been found to disrupt cognition, activities of daily living, sleep, mood, and social engagement in individuals with TBI and other populations.,

Multiple barriers exist to access clinicians with TBI expertise, including lack of coordinated communication across clinicians; travel distance to clinicians; financial barriers; impact of cognitive, psychologic, and physical barriers to care; and social support limitations. Therefore, patients with chronic pain and TBI often do not receive effective, coordinated treatment.,

Given the multiple types of posttraumatic pain (eg, headache, musculoskeletal, and neuropathic)that individuals with TBI experience, as well as common comorbid conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and sleep difficulties, optimal treatment needs to be accessible, multimodal, and matched to current patient needs and goals. Ideally, this is a shared decision-making process based on validated symptoms measures. Therefore, with input from persons with TBI and the expertise of our TBI specialists, we opted to test a collaborative care (CC) approach to treatment of chronic pain, including headache, in individuals with TBI.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^d24e563a]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Trauma patients with chronic opioid use or opioid use disorder (OUD) show high prevalence and worse outcomes. Over the past 15 years a marked increase in opioid use is noted, and chronic opioid use is particularly prevalent in patients presenting with traumatic injuries. Between 4 and 5% of all adults in the U.S. use opioids regularly, yet 16–18% of patients presenting to a trauma center were taking opioids pre-injury, and the increased incidence of opioid mentions in emergency department admissions far outpaced the increase in opioid prescriptions. In a retrospective review of 4,352 consecutive adults admitted to a level 1 trauma center over one year, preinjury opioid use was linked to a significant increase in length of stay with lower levels of trauma severity, and such patients required more operative interventions, were more likely to be admitted to the ICU, had a longer length of stay, and experienced more major complications and unplanned readmissions.

### Understanding buprenorphine for use in chronic pain: expert opinion [^e3fa6b12]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

An expert panel convened to reach a consensus on common misconceptions surrounding buprenorphine, a Schedule III partial µ-opioid receptor agonist indicated for chronic pain. The panel also provided clinical recommendations on the appropriate use of buprenorphine and conversion strategies for switching to buprenorphine from a full µ-opioid receptor agonist for chronic pain management.

Methods

The consensus panel met on March 25, 2019, to discuss relevant literature and provide recommendations on interpreting buprenorphine as a partial µ-opioid receptor agonist, prescribing buprenorphine before some Schedule II, III, or IV options, perioperative/trauma management of patients taking buprenorphine, and converting patients from a full µ-opioid receptor agonist to buprenorphine.

Results

The panel recommended that buprenorphine's classification as a partial µ-opioid receptor agonist not be clinically translated to mean partial analgesic efficacy. The panel also recommended that buprenorphine be considered before some Schedule II, III, or IV opioids in patients with a favorable risk/benefit profile on the basis of metabolic factors, abuse potential, and tolerability and that buprenorphine be continued during the perioperative/trauma period. In addition, switching patients from a full µ-opioid receptor agonist to buprenorphine should be considered with no weaning period at starting doses that are based on the previous opioid dose.

Conclusions

These recommendations provide a framework for clinicians to address most clinical scenarios regarding buprenorphine use. The overall consensus of the panel was that buprenorphine is a unique Schedule III opioid with favorable pharmacologic properties and a safety profile that may be desirable for chronic pain management.

### Role of inhaled methoxyflurane in the management of acute trauma pain [^a4584800]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain management is a human right of all patients, regardless of the nature and origin of pain (cancer pain, non-cancer chronic pain or acute trauma pain). This concept can be found in various reports and standards from the United Nations and other regional human rights organizations, and has direct implications on the practice of medicine and on the access to pain management resources.

Acute trauma pain has usually limited duration and has a rapid onset caused by a specific event. Trauma patients frequently report pain: up to 70% in the pre-hospital setting, and 60–90% in the emergency department (ED). Pain itself is one of the main reasons why patients seek treatment from the ED.–

Besides ethical considerations, pain relief is a therapeutic endpoint per se, and an efficient management of acute trauma pain is a medical need: pain can be an obstacle to effective trauma treatment, since a patient with pain may be unable to provide his medical history, may have movement restrictions, and may be agitated, frustrated, or aggressive. The under-treatment of acute pain may result in tachycardia, hypertension, delayed recovery, inability to sleep, reduced mobility, worse quality of life, reduced immunity, and pain chronification.–

However, acute trauma pain is often overlooked, and not adequately assessed, and/or undertreated (oligoanalgesia), both in pre-hospital and ED settings.–Inadequate assessment and under-treatment of acute pain may be attributed to a number of reasons, including lack of specific training, unavailability of analgesic drugs, reluctance to prescribe certain drugs (e.g. opioids), failure to adhere to pain management guidelines or protocols, overcrowding of the ED.–

The availability of a non-narcotic, well-tolerated, rapid-acting, effective and easy to use treatment option may help overcome at least some of these barriers and improve acute trauma pain management.

### A capsule history of pain management [^965c69ac]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Pain is a complex clinical problem. Assessment depends on verbal report, and the patient's physical perceptions may be modified by cognitive and affective factors. The salience of pain as a problem in its own right has grown since 1945 and new therapeutic alternatives have developed from research and from new theoretical perspectives. This short historical review of the highlights of the history of pain management gives particular emphasis to the 20th century and to chronic and cancer pain.

### The evolution of pain management in the critically ill trauma patient: emerging concepts from the global war on terrorism [^2808156d]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The evolution of military medical care to manage polytrauma, critically ill-wounded warriors from the greater war on terrorism has been accompanied by significant changes in the diagnosis, management, and modulation of acute and chronic trauma-related pain. A paradigm shift in pain management includes early treatment of pain at the point of injury and throughout the continuum of care with a combination of standard and novel therapeutic interventions. These concepts are important for all critical care providers because they translate to most critically ill patients, including those resulting from natural disasters. Previous authors have reported a high incidence of moderate to severe pain and poor analgesia in intensive care units associated with sleep disturbances, tachycardia, pulmonary complications, increased stress response with thromboembolic incidents, and immunosuppression, increased intensive care unit and hospital stays, and needless suffering. Although opioids have traditionally been the cornerstone of acute pain management, they have potential negative effects ranging from sedation, confusion, respiratory depression, nausea, ileus, constipation, tolerance, opioid-induced hyperalgesia as well as potential for immunosuppression. Alternatively, multimodal therapy is increasingly recognized as a critical pain management approach, especially when combined with early nutrition and ambulation, designed to improve functional recovery and decrease chronic pain conditions.

Discussion

Multimodal therapy encompasses a wide range of procedures and medications, including regional analgesia with continuous epidural or peripheral nerve block infusions, judicious opioids, acetaminophen, anti-inflammatory agents, anticonvulsants, ketamine, clonidine, mexiletine, antidepressants, and anxiolytics as options to treat or modulate pain at various sites of action.

Summary

With a more aggressive acute pain management strategy, the military has decreased acute and chronic pain conditions, which may have application in the civilian sector as well.

### Pain management for in-office uterine and cervical procedures: ACOG clinical consensus no. 9 [^24726b8e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

In-office gynecologic procedures, such as intrauterine device insertion, endometrial biopsy, hysteroscopy, intrauterine imaging, and cervical biopsy, among others, are common procedures experienced by many patients. There is an urgent need for health care professionals to have a better understanding of pain-management options and to not underestimate the pain experienced by patients and for patients to have more autonomy over pain-control options during in-office procedures. The way pain is understood and managed by health care professionals is also affected by systemic racism and bias of how pain is experienced. Specific populations, such as adolescents and those with a history of chronic pelvic pain, sexual violence or abuse, and other pain conditions, may also have increased or decreased tolerance of pain and resistance to pain medications. Several pain-management interventions being used have limited or conflicting evidence supporting their effectiveness at providing adequate pain control during in-office gynecologic procedures. Health care professionals therefore must be cautious when extrapolating data on what works for one procedure to another. Shared decision making with the patient should be practiced when discussing pain-management options because options that work for one patient may not work for another. Future research on pain and the management of pain must be more racially and ethnically diverse. Studies should include gender-diverse participants, focus on patient preferences and goals, and consider the needs of patients of various ages and those who have a history of trauma.

### Population-based multistate modelling of peritraumatic opioid use among trauma patients from the Norwegian trauma registry [^e7f53588]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Medical indications for posttraumatic long-term opioid use

Although LTU can be indicated in contexts such as OMT and palliative care, its use for treating subacute and chronic non-malignant pain is highly controversial, as associated risks and drawbacks outweigh the benefits for most patients. We were able to identify a medical indication for LTU for 55% of our cohort: 6% were receiving palliative care, 13% were receiving OMT, and 36% had chronic non-malignant pain. As pain is the major indication for opioid treatment, it is, however, reasonable to assume that a certain proportion of patients without an identifiable medical indication for LTU in our data were prescribed opioids long-term for subacute or chronic pain as well. Finding this group's median opioid dosages similar to that of chronic pain but not palliative care patients further supports this assumption. Our results thus suggest that subacute and chronic non-malignant pain is the primary reason for posttraumatic LTU among trauma patients. A recent Norwegian qualitative study showed that despite guidelines mandating re-evaluation of opioid treatment for acute pain after 4 weeks, several previously opioid-naïve trauma patients continued using opioids beyond 18 months after injury without reassessment. Given that trauma patients using opioids beyond 2 months after injury have been shown to experience increased pain, emotional distress, and disability, and considering the numerous risks associated with LTU, these findings are concerning. Against this background, we advocate for enhanced opioid stewardship for trauma patients. Citing the 2022 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, priority should be given to nonpharmacological and nonopioid strategies for acute pain management, with opioids considered only if these options prove inadequate and the benefits are anticipated to outweigh the risks for the individual patient. Moreover, given the multifaceted nature of posttraumatic pain, future research should concentrate on developing pain management strategies that provide trauma patients with effective alternatives to opioid treatment.

Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics of Patients

Regarding pain characteristics, almost every patient reported pain at T1 and T2 (Table 2). In the last 7 days before questionnaire administration, the mean most intense pain, the mean general pain and the mean neuropathic pain score were moderate to severe at T1 (9.3; 5.4; 35.1), and mild to moderate at T2 (4.7; 2.6; 18.4). Participants experienced pain interference with many of their living activities, but those with the highest mean scores at T1 and T2 were: pain interference with general activities, mobility, work, and recreational activities. For most patients, pain relief was achieved through medication in the last 7 days at T1 (72.5% ± 21.6), but this score decreased at T2 (60.7% ± 33.5). According to the SF-12V2 at T2, the mean score for the physical functioning and the role physical domains were 36.5 ± 36.8 and 35.7 ± 32.9, respectively. These scores were below the mean score of 50 found in the healthy populationwhile the scores for other domains were comparable to those of the healthy population.

### Chronic noncancer pain management and systemic racism: time to move toward equal care standards [^17331d14]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary and Conclusions

Based on our review, it is clear that the history of systemic racism in pain medicine has been an ugly and unfortunate one, resulting in needless suffering by so many patients simply because of their race/ethnicity. The current Coronavirus pandemic – together with the ongoing protests regarding the need for social justice – has highlighted the persistent detrimental effects of systemic racism, including the impact of long-standing stress and trauma. Yet, we should not lose sight of these unfortunate times representing an opportunity to create sustained and meaningful change toward delivering equitable pain care. Implicit bias remains a contributor to healthcare disparities, broadly. Given that patients suffering from chronic pain are already stigmatized and marginalized, BIPOC chronic pain patients are particularly vulnerable. Provider self-awareness of bias, understanding the cultural context of pain, showing empathy, using a softer tone, listening, and allowing patients to voice their concerns are all important strategies to reduce stress and improve pain management outcomes. On a broader level, evening the playing field will also require the incorporation of BIPOC patients into policy decisions, increasing the availability of BIPOC pain care professionals in the American health care system, and a paradigmatic revision in the models under which pain care professionals are trained. Each of these transformations will be imperative if pain care is to ever adhere to the bioethical principle of justice. Our expectation is not that this analysis will result in an immediate and dramatic revision of the system in which BIPOC patients with pain are treated. However, we are hopeful that by bringing these issues to the attention of policymakers and pain care professionals, the unique plights of BIPOC patients with pain will begin to be more widely recognized and addressed.

### Collaborative care for chronic pain after traumatic brain injury: a randomized clinical trial [^04a0078d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Results of the current randomized clinical trial suggest that our CC intervention, TBI Care, had a significant positive impact on pain interference and pain severity compared with UC, with CC participants maintaining significantly lower pain interference scores up to 8 months after randomization. Pain interference scores were reduced by at least 30% in 56% of the CC group at 4 months and by 61% at 8 months compared with 27% and 38% at 4 and 8 months, respectively, in the UC group, suggesting sustained improvement. CC is a promising approach for the treatment of pain after TBI, especially given the high engagement and participant satisfaction in this study, along with the high level of pain complexity in this population, with multiple pain sites and comorbid conditions. Given that clinical practice guidelines are not currently available to guide pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic treatment of chronic pain after TBI, CC was designed to focus on patient-centered nonpharmacological approaches, including targeted cognitive behavioral treatment strategies, engagement in physical activity, and other behavioral interventions, with a goal to develop individual skills for symptom management in the reduction of pain interference. Similar to other CC trials, medication use was considered one of the many tools for pain self-management and was reviewed consistently by the expert team to make recommendations to participant's clinicians. We adapted CC to address chronic pain after TBI by placing the primary focus on an individual's use of evidence-based nonpharmacological approaches, which has been shown to decrease pain interference in daily life. In addition, we sought to encourage and engage patients toward meaningful goals in their lives.

### A systematic review of neurophysiological sensing for the assessment of acute pain [^02a38204]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

There are also opportunities to use an objective assessment of acute pain to assist in the diagnosis of chronic pain. In general, acute pain can be considered less complex to be assessed since it has a specific, treatable cause (e.g. broken bone, torn ligament) and is generally sudden and intense. For instance, acute pain typically originates from a response to an injury, illness, trauma, or medical procedure. Acute pain lasts for a short period of time, and often ceases when the underlying problem has healed. When pain persists longer than expected, beyond the expected time for healing, it is commonly referred to as chronic pain. Chronic pain can continue even after the injury or illness that caused it has healed or gone away, with pain signals remaining active for months or years. Chronic pain includes conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome, phantom limb pain, chronic low back pain, and fibromyalgia syndrome. It is unlike acute pain, which plays a protective role by eliciting motivation to minimise harm. Rather, chronic pain is considered a disease in itself. Some people experience chronic pain even with no previous illness or apparent trauma. The assessment of chronic pain is complex and often comprises several domains, including physiological indicators and contributing factors, with physicians and other clinicians assessing patients for function, quality of life, mental and emotional health, and factors that aggravate or alleviate pain. In addition, the chronic pain data captured by neurophysiological devices will not be as responsive and conclusive as that of acute pain. Chronic pain is, therefore, considered a complex problem, multifaceted, with multifactorial causes. In this context, the assessment of acute pain can facilitate early diagnosis, monitoring of disease progression, and overall effective therapeutic evaluation. In addition, pain assessment serves other important functions in the management of pain such as, documenting the intensity and severity of the pain condition, tracking the course of pain in time, and providing mechanistic information. Therefore, reliable and valid assessments of pain can generate important historical information that can assist clinicians in identifying patients who may develop persistent pain and, thus, in designing early interventions for the management of chronic pain.

### Multi-modal analgesic strategies for trauma (MAST): protocol for a pragmatic randomized trial [^c6c6cc52]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pain management after injury is critically important for functional recovery. Although opioids have been a mainstay for treatment of pain, they are associated with adverse events and may contribute to long-term use or abuse. Opioid-minimizing multimodal pain regimens have the potential to reduce exposure to opioids without compromising pain control. This article details an ongoing clinical trial comparing two pill-based, opioid-minimizing, multimodal pain strategies.

Methods

This is a single-center, parallel-group, randomized, controlled comparative effectiveness trial comparing two multimodal pain regimens in adult trauma patients. All patients 16 years and older admitted to the Red Duke Trauma Institute are eligible unless they are pregnant, a prisoner, under observation status, or a non-acute trauma patient. At admission to the trauma service, patients are enrolled and randomized to one of two multimodal pain regimens. The primary outcome is opioid use, measured by morphine milligram equivalents per patient per day. The secondary outcomes include pain scores, ventilator days, hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay, occurrence of opioid-related complications, hospital and pharmacy costs, and incidence of hospital discharge with opioid prescription. Outcomes will be compared using Bayesian methods.

Discussion

This trial will determine the effectiveness of two multimodal pain treatment strategies on reducing in-hospital opioid exposure in adult trauma patients. Furthermore, it will compare the two strategies on pain control and patient safety. Knowledge gained in this study can improve quality of care at this hospital and other trauma centers regardless of which medication regimen proves superior.

Pharmacologic analgesia — opioid safety and co-administration guidance — Opioids remain the standard of effectiveness comparison for the treatment of acute, severe nociceptive pain but are associated with dose-dependent respiratory and central nervous system (CNS) depression. Avoid opioid use concomitantly with other CNS depressants outside of specific clinical scenarios in highly monitored settings, and because opioid use delays return of bowel function and increases risk of ileus, a bowel regimen containing a stimulant laxative is recommended for all patients receiving opioids unless contraindicated. Repeated use increases risk of dependence and addiction, and chronic opioid use after surgery remains a significant concern.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^e235245a]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

Nontraumatic, nonsurgical acute pain can often be managed without opioids (see Recommendation 1).
Opioids are sometimes needed for treatment of acute pain (see Recommendation 1). When the diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant use of opioids, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. For many common causes of nontraumatic, nonsurgical pain, when opioids are needed, a few days or less are often sufficient, and shorter courses can minimize the need to taper opioids to prevent withdrawal symptoms at the end of a course of opioids. However, durations should be individualized to the patient's clinical circumstances.
Clinicians should generally avoid prescribing additional opioids to patients just in case pain continues longer than expected.
For postoperative pain related to major surgery, procedure-specific opioid prescribing recommendations are available with ranges for amounts of opioids needed (on the basis of actual use and refills and on consensus).
To minimize unintended effects on patients, clinicians, practices, and health systems should have mechanisms in place for the subset of patients who experience severe acute pain that continues longer than the expected duration. These mechanisms should allow for timely reevaluation to confirm or revise the initial diagnosis and adjust pain management accordingly. Clinicians, practices, and health systems can help minimize disparities in access to and affordability of care and refills by ensuring all patients can obtain and afford additional evaluation and treatment, as needed.
Longer durations of opioid therapy are more likely to be needed when the mechanism of injury is expected to result in prolonged severe pain (e.g. severe traumatic injuries).
Patients should be evaluated at least every 2 weeks if they continue to receive opioids for acute pain.
If opioids are continued for ≥ 1 month, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed and that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach. Clinicians should refer to recommendations on subacute and chronic pain for initiation (Recommendation 2), follow-up (Recommendation 7), and tapering (Recommendation 5) of ongoing opioid therapy.
If patients already receiving long-term opioid therapy require additional opioids for superimposed severe acute pain (e.g. major surgery), opioids should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days.
If opioids are used continuously (around the clock) for more than a few days for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe a brief taper to minimize withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation of opioids.
If a taper is needed, taper durations might need to be adjusted depending on the duration of the initial opioid prescription (see Supporting Rationale for this recommendation for additional details).
Tapering plans should be discussed with the patient before hospital discharge and with clinicians coordinating the patient's care as an outpatient. (See Recommendation 5 for tapering considerations when patients have taken opioids continuously for > 1 month.)

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^6bca2416]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Younger adults and long-term opioid therapy — There is large variability in patient preferences regarding the recommendation against long-term use of opioids for younger adults, but younger age is not an absolute contraindication to the use of opioids, and there may be some situations in which the benefits of long-term use of opioids outweigh the risks of opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose. Examples and patient factors include that hospitalized patients recovering from battlefield injuries are known to have less chronic pain, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when pain is aggressively managed starting soon after injury, and patients may prefer not to taper opioids due to risk of withdrawal symptoms and temporary increase of pain. Balancing harms and benefits, the potential catastrophic harms of long-term use of opioids in younger adults outweighed the potential benefits, and the Work Group decided upon a Strong against recommendation.

### Prospective audit of a pathway for in-patient pain management of chronic abdominal pain: a novel and cost-effective strategy [^00d54acc]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Unexplained abdominal pain is a common cause of hospital admission and utilizes significant resource. Current in-patient pain management of acute exacerbation of chronic abdominal pain is primarily directed at pharmacological and psychological management strategies in this group of complex patients. We adopted a novel approach that proved to be both clinically effective and cost-effective.

Design

Adult patients admitted to a surgical ward with acute exacerbation of chronic abdominal pain referred to in-patient pain management were prospectively audited over a two-year period at a single tertiary centre.

Methods

Management strategy focused on a somatic source as the predominant pain generator. Patients were offered ultrasound-guided trigger point injection with steroids within 48hours of referral and were discharged when pain control was achieved. Subsequent care by the pain physician included targeted treatment of somatic component (repeated trigger point injection with steroids or pulsed radiofrequency treatment of trigger points).

Results

We audited 43 patients referred to the inpatient pain management service over a two-year period. Four patients refused to undergo the diagnostic trigger point injection. Three patients with active visceral disease had a transient response to the injection. Thirty-six patients were diagnosed with abdominal myofascial pain syndrome, and two-thirds of these patients were discharged home within 36hours of the intervention.

Conclusions

Abdominal myofascial pain syndrome is a poorly recognized cause of chronic abdominal pain, especially in patients with a past history of visceral inflammation. The novel strategy resulted in a significant reduction in opioid consumption, length of stay, and readmission rate.

### Predicting pain outcomes after traumatic musculoskeletal injury [^96f1cd9b]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

Traumatic musculoskeletal injury results in a high incidence of chronic pain; however, there is little evidence about the nature, quality, and severity of the pain. This study uses a prospective, observational, longitudinal design to (1) examine neuropathic pain symptoms, pain severity, pain interference, and pain management at hospital admission and 4 months after traumatic musculoskeletal injury (n = 205), and (2) to identify predictors of group membership for patients with differing moderate-to-severe putative neuropathic pain trajectories. Data were collected on mechanism of injury, injury severity, pain (intensity, interference, neuropathic quality), anxiety (anxiety sensitivity, general anxiety, pain catastrophizing, pain anxiety), depression, and posttraumatic stress while patients were in-hospital and 4 months after injury. A third of patients had chronic moderate-to-severe neuropathic pain 4 months after injury. Specifically, 11% of patients developed moderate-to-severe pain by 4 months and 21% had symptoms immediately after injury that persisted over time. Significant predictors of the development and maintenance of moderate-to-severe neuropathic pain included high levels of general anxiety while in-hospital immediately after injury (P < 0.001) and symptoms of posttraumatic stress 4 months after injury (P < 0.001). Few patients had adequate pharmacological, physical, or psychological pain management in-hospital and at 4 months. Future research is needed among trauma patients to better understand the development of chronic pain and to determine the best treatment approaches.

### Stepped collaborative care for pain and posttraumatic stress disorder after major trauma: a randomized controlled feasibility trial [^e9a1b514]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Strengths

This study evaluated the feasibility of interventions that have already been found to have significant population reach and impact in other countries. The project team included expert input from experienced clinicians, researchers and people with lived experience of trauma and disability, who altogether supported the adaptation of study processes and communications in order to improve the acceptability of the intervention to patients. We successfully enrolled patients into the study who had a range of social and clinical complexities and trauma-related concerns, 13 of whom would traditionally be excluded from trials of psychologically-informed interventions due to their substance use histories, prior psychiatric diagnoses or prior chronic pain. However, in the present study these people were purposely invited to participate as they are known to be at higher risk of persistent pain or PTSD post-injury, and they represent a significant proportion of the trauma population.

### Rational integration of pharmacologic, behavioral, and rehabilitation strategies in the treatment of chronic pain [^056cb075]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Historically, the concept of a mind-body duality in medicine, which supports a biomedical approach to pain management, has impeded the development of adequate treatments for persistent pain conditions and diseases. Although usually there is an initiating pathophysiologic nociceptive cause of pain, over time, the conditioning of neurophysiologic and affective systems by environmental and internal events can promote chronicity and frustrate the efforts of physicians to attenuate nociceptive processes. A full elucidation of the environmental and psychological factors contributing to pain and suffering may prove difficult using a traditional biomedical approach. Prevention of chronicity, by early identification and treatment of pain generators and the pain response to tissue injury and by recognition of those general factors that contribute to risk for chronicity (e.g., depressive illness, poor pain control), is crucial for any healthcare system that wishes to reduce the morbidity and costs of persistent pain. Goal-directed, outcomes-focused biopsychosocial treatment plans that efficiently integrate physical, behavioral, and medical approaches more frequently achieve better pain control and improved function. The following article presents a general overview of evidence for effectiveness of these approaches and some central principles of integrated treatment planning.

### Stepped collaborative care for pain and posttraumatic stress disorder after major trauma: a randomized controlled feasibility trial [^eaf36729]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Survival rates and functional outcomes following traumatic injury have significantly improved in recent years. However, recent research has shown that two thirds of people continue to report persistent or worsening mental health or pain problems post-injury, and most do not receive timely treatment for those problems, especially people living outside major cities. Moreover, pain and mental health conditions, especially posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), often co-occur after injury. Several theories have been proposed to explain the cooccurrence of pain and PTSD. The mutual maintenance model proposes that shared factors maintain both chronic pain and PTSD, for example, due to attentional biases toward threatening internal or external stimuli, as well as heightened anxiety or the tendency to have catastrophic beliefs about pain. Similarly, shared vulnerability models propose that heightened sensitivity to anxiety-related symptoms, in addition to unhelpful thoughts about pain and somatic symptoms, increase the risk of both pain and PTSD. While there is inconsistent evidence for the directional relationships between pain and PTSD symptoms after injury proposed in these models, there is evidence that both outcomes appear to influence each other over time perhaps due to common mechanisms (e.g. central sensitization and anxiety sensitivity). As such, it appears that treatments that target the physiological, psychological and social factors associated with both pain and PTSD are warranted.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that our CC intervention, TBI Care, is a promising approach to the treatment of chronic pain in individuals with TBI. The ability to engage in multimodal care with both skill development for self-management of chronic pain and symptom-guided expert adjustments based on response to treatment was associated with reduced pain interference that was maintained for many months after treatment was completed. Further research is needed to test the cost-effectiveness and implementation of TBI Care in a range of health care settings and to evaluate additional TBI-related comorbidities and outcomes.

CC is a patient-centered, team-based approach to providing evidence-based care. CC includes coordination of services and proactive outreach to engage, activate, and promote self-management and treatment adherence toward specified treatment targets. Importantly, CC ensures timely treatment adjustments based on ongoing assessment of response to treatment. CC was developed to deliver coordinated physical and mental health care within a primary care setting and has been adapted for a wide range of clinical settings and conditions. Multiple high-quality clinical trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews, have demonstrated that CC is an effective approach to treating depression, anxiety, PTSD, substance abuse, and other chronic conditions in diverse medical settings. Several rigorous clinical trials, also suggest that it is beneficial in chronic pain.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use the CC approach to treat chronic pain in individuals with TBI. Given the lack of clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of pain after TBI, our team monitored and updated recommendations for medications targeting each participant's pain conditions (eg, headache, neuropathy, or osteoarthritis) in the context of TBI and emphasized nonpharmacological pain management. Our version of CC, called TBI Care, used a care manager (CM; M.C.) to provide cognitive behavioral interventions for pain, modified as appropriate for individuals with cognitive difficulties commonly seen after TBI and individually tailored to specific needs. CC was set within rehabilitation medicine clinics to maximize the likelihood that TBI-trained clinicians would address comorbid conditions. We tested the hypothesis that CC vs usual care (UC) would reduce pain interference, as measured by the Pain Interference Scale of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), which assesses the extent to which pain hinders engagement in important life activities, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Secondary aims focused on the effectiveness of CC on decreasing pain intensity, comorbid depression and anxiety symptoms, sleep difficulties, utilization of emergency department (ED) visits, and increasing community participation and satisfaction with care.

### Postoperative opioid prescribing practices in US adult trauma patients: a systematic review [^04e16437]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Opioids have been proven effective in pain management, but overprescription can lead to addiction and abuse. Although current guidelines regarding opioid prescription for chronic and acute pain are available, they fail to address the use of opioids for pain management in traumatic injury patients who undergo operations. The primary objective of this study was to examine opioid prescribing practices for US adult trauma patients who require surgical management, based on prior history of opioid use, type of surgical practice, and age.

Methods

PubMed and Cochrane Journals were used to identify relevant articles between October 2010 and December 29, 2020. Our primary outcome was discrepancies of morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) prescribed to trauma patients. Significance was defined as p < 0.05.

Results

Eleven studies on US trauma patients prescribed opioids were evaluated, creating a total of 30,249 patients stratified by prior opioid use, age, and race. Patterns seen among patients with prior opioid use include higher MMEs prescribed, lower likelihoods of opioid discontinuation, higher mortality rates, and higher complication rates. Orthopedic surgeons prescribed higher values of MMEs than nonorthopedic surgeons.

Conclusion

Higher incidences of opioid prescriptions are seen with orthopedic trauma surgery and prior opioid use by the patient. We recommend further development of national protocol implementation for acute pain management for the US trauma population.

### Estimating risk of chronic pain and disability following musculoskeletal trauma in the United Kingdom [^0f385e83]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic injury is a leading cause of death and disability globally. Most people with traumatic injuries severe enough to require hospital admittance are known to develop long-term sequalae. Pain is one such sequelae, with approximately two-thirds of these individuals developing chronic pain. Advances in the care of major trauma patients have improved survival rates. Consequently, an increasing incidence of posttrauma sequelae, including chronic disabling pain, seems inevitable.

Presently, mechanisms underlying the transition from acute to chronic posttrauma pain are not fully understood. Traumatic injuries differ from common nontraumatic musculoskeletal pain conditions, such as low back pain, in 3 important ways. First, traumatic injuries are always accompanied by a discernible causal event, whereas two-thirds of low back pain cases are not. Second, tissue damage is invariably present following trauma, and its extent and location are readily identifiable, whereas an unclear relationship with pain and tissue damage exists in low back pain. Third, posttraumatic stress symptoms are common and appear to play an important role in the development and maintenance of chronic posttrauma pain.,

Research, across a range of musculoskeletal pain conditions has identified other variables associated with poor outcomes, including high pain intensity, spatial extent of pain, indicators of central sensitization, and the number of previous pain episodes, which are likely to play a role following traumatic injuries. Understanding which factors operate early after traumatic injury and how they might influence the development of chronic pain is, therefore, worthy of exploration. Such knowledge could facilitate the development and implementation of more effective early posttrauma interventions with the ultimate goal of preventing poor long-term outcomes. The aims of this study were to (1) describe early variables associated with poor long-term outcome for posttrauma pain and disability and (2) present a screening tool for estimating patients at risk of developing a poor long-term pain outcome.

### Differential diagnosis of facial pain and guidelines for management [^0d321cb0]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of facial pain below the eye can be very different dependant on whether the patient visits a dentist or medical practitioner. A structure for accurate diagnosis is proposed beginning with a very careful history. The commonest acute causes of pain are dental and these are well managed by dentists. Chronic facial pain can be unilateral or bilateral and continuous or episodic. The commonest non-dental pains are temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), especially musculoskeletal involving the muscles of mastication either unilaterally or bilaterally; they may be associated with other chronic pains. A very wide range of treatments are used but early diagnosis, reassurance and some simple physiotherapy is often effective in those with good coping strategies. Dentists will often make splints to wear at night. Neuropathic pain is usually unilateral and of the episodic type; the most easily recognized is trigeminal neuralgia. This severe electric shock like pain, provoked by light touch, responds best to carbamazepine, and neurosurgery in poorly controlled patients. Trauma, either major or because of dental procedures, results in neuropathic pain and these are then managed as for any other neuropathic pain. Red flags include giant cell arteritis which much be distinguished from temporomandibular disorders (TMD), especially in > 50 yr olds, and cancer which can present as a progressive neuropathic pain. Burning mouth syndrome is rarely recognized as a neuropathic pain as it occurs principally in peri-menopausal women and is thought to be psychological. Chronic facial pain patients are best managed by a multidisciplinary team.

Nonpharmacologic pain management — hypnosis is a cognitive technique designed to heighten an individual's responsiveness to suggestion and is used extensively for chronic pain syndromes, with evidence existing to support its use in acute injury; several randomized controlled trials demonstrated that preoperative and perioperative hypnotherapy provided a small-to-medium effect on pain and emotional distress, and randomized controlled trials have documented a reduction in pain and anxiety with hypnosis as an adjunct for both adult and pediatric burn patients, while lower-quality data suggests similar effects with successive sessions in patients with multiple long bone fractures.

### Self-management interventions for chronic widespread pain including fibromyalgia: a systematic review and qualitative evidence synthesis [^8941297f]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Chronic widespread pain (CWP) is diagnosed when persistent pain is reported over multiple body sites. It is a key feature of conditions, such as fibromyalgia, where it is accompanied by other symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, fatigue, and cognitive issues. The reported prevalence of CWP in the general population falls between 9.6% and 15%. Fibromyalgia, at the more severe end of the CWP spectrum, has a prevalence around 2% to 4%, with the highest prevalence in those aged between 40 and 60 years. In addition to pain, fatigue, disrupted sleep, difficulties with concentration, anxiety, and depression are also characteristics of fibromyalgia. The aetiology and pathogenesis of CWP remains unclear; however, a genetic influence has been demonstrated, and central sensitisation, which refers to an abnormal amplification of neural signalling within the central nervous system, may be a primary mechanism. In addition, there is an association between chronic pain and life traumas, especially childhood trauma.

Increasing emphasis is being placed on the need to support people with CWP to effectively engage with psychosocial and behavioural self-management: guidelines recommend a limited range of pharmacotherapies to treat severe symptoms, with a primary focus now placed on nonpharmacological interventions as first-line care. Self-management is a complex construct and has been defined as a patient-directed approach with the overarching aim of enhancing participants' health status or quality of life. Self-management approaches seek to bolster participants' skills and knowledge, enabling them to apply these enhanced abilities in various aspects of their lives beyond the intervention itself. These interventions often include multiple components, such as exercise and psychological elements, and are designed to improve outcomes directly.

A systematic review of randomised controlled trials of self-management for CWP including fibromyalgia demonstrated small to moderate beneficial effects of self-management interventions on physical function and pain when compared with usual care in both the short and long term. Another systematic review showed similar findings of multicomponent interventions, including psychological and physical activities with short-term effects in people with fibromyalgia. However, there was considerable variability in the outcomes reported. To determine how this variance could be reduced and to improve the overall effectiveness of self-management approaches, there is a need for greater understanding of intervention processes and mechanisms that may drive or hinder benefit from these interventions.

Executive summary — background — chronic pain is characterized as among the most prevalent, disabling, and costly conditions, and chronic musculoskeletal pain is described as the most common among chronic pain conditions and one of the most frequent reasons individuals seek health care; the heterogeneity of pain experiences highlights the importance of taking an individualized, person-centered approach to treatment that considers how systemic factors and personal background characteristics shape care and create a pathway to maximize outcomes; given the public health significance of chronic musculoskeletal pain, it is imperative to have guidance on evidence-based options, and the guideline strives to provide comprehensive, evidence-based information within the scope of the systematic reviews used to providers, patients and their families, and the broad public.

Pharmacologic analgesia — opioid selection, patient-controlled analgesia, and tapering in trauma patients are individualized. "No "ideal" opioid exists". "Base selection on patient-specific factors such as organ dysfunction (e.g., avoiding morphine in patients with renal compromise) and desired duration of action (i.e., fentanyl for premedication in shorter procedures such as chest tubes, but morphine or hydromorphone for breakthrough pain)". "Some guidance on starting opioid doses is provided in Table 7", but dosing and tapering "vary by injury pattern, organ dysfunction, operative schedules, and several other clinical and demographic factors". "Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) provides fast pain relief leading to higher patient satisfaction and has safeguards in place to prevent additional doses from being administered in patients who are not oxygenating adequately", though "concern exists that patients may use higher amounts of opioids with PCA administration compared to conventional therapy", and "PCAs may be a useful adjunct in trauma patients who are unable to take enteral pain medications". For discontinuation, "Guide opioid tapering by the duration of opioid use (acute vs. chronic) as well as anticipated duration of pain", and "individualize each patient's taper plan".

Across reviews, the main outcomes were pain, function, and quality of life. Harms varied depending on the therapy evaluated but included serious adverse events when reported; for opioids, key harms included overdose and harms related to opioid use disorder. The reviews of therapies for chronic pain assessed outcomes at short-, intermediate-, and long-term follow-up. Benefits Chronic Low Back Pain. The review found psychological therapies associated with small improvements versus usual care or an attention control for function and pain at short-, intermediate-, and long-term follow-up.

Exercise, low-level laser therapy, spinal manipulation, massage, yoga, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation were associated with improvements in function at short- and intermediate-term follow-up versus usual care, placebo, waiting list, or inactive therapies; effects on pain were small for all therapies except yoga, for which benefits were moderate. Massage, mindfulness-based stress reduction, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation were associated with small short-term improvement in pain versus control; exercise, low-level laser therapy, and yoga also were associated with small to moderate short-term improvement in pain, although evidence was not as strong.

At intermediate term, spinal manipulation, yoga, multidisciplinary rehabilitation and exercise and mindfulness-based stress reduction were associated with improved pain versus sham, usual care, or attention control; effects were small for all therapies except for yoga, for which effects were moderate. Compared with exercise, multidisciplinary rehabilitation was associated with small improvements in function and pain at short and intermediate terms. Chronic Neck Pain. The AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review found low-level laser therapy and massage associated with improved short-term function and pain for chronic neck pain. The magnitude of effect was moderate for low-level laser therapy and small for massage. Effects on intermediate-term function were moderate for cognitive behavioral therapy and small for the other therapies.

At long term, multidisciplinary rehabilitation was associated with persistent small improvement in function versus usual care but not for pain. Tai chi was associated with small improvement in function versus exercise at short- to intermediate-term follow-up.

Management of patients receiving treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) with methadone — Use of multimodal analgesia (MMA) is recommended, and patients on medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with methadone need to continue their treatment throughout the period of acute pain, with confirmation of the methadone dose by the outpatient health care provider. Treat all patients on MAT with acute pain with an MMA approach, including pharmacological and nonpharmacological modalities, and for moderate to severe pain further opioid analgesia can be provided as IV PCA or as an oral short-acting full mu agonist on an as-required basis. Given the unique pharmacology of methadone, it is reasonable to divide the total daily dose and administer every 8 to 12 hours. Do not titrate chronic MAT for acute pain analgesia.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^5a6a556b]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Multimodal pain management in trauma patients — multimodal analgesia (MMA) emphasizes scheduled nonopioid dosing, inclusion of specific agents, patient engagement, and coordinated care. Administer nonopioid analgesics on a scheduled basis rather than "as needed", and agents such as ketamine and systemic lidocaine are described as safe and effective components of an MMA strategy. Successful MMA should offer acetaminophen (APAP), NSAIDs, opioids, adjuvant analgesics, local and regional analgesia, cognitive modalities, and physical modalities. A key aspect is patient engagement with counseling that APAP and NSAIDs are truly analgesic medications, and not "just over‑the‑counter medications", and clinicians should establish realistic expectations including a de‑escalation regimen as early as possible in the course of therapy. Ideally, the trauma service should collaborate with pain specialists, nonpharmacologic treatment providers, and psychiatrists/addictionologists to create a patient pathway for comprehensive pain management and safe de‑escalation in patients with complex pain management needs.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^a2183363]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Considerations for pharmacologic analgesics — risk assessment for sustained prescription opioid use at discharge: Ideally, health care providers have an accessible and pragmatic means of determining the risk of sustained prescription opioid use that can be directly applied in clinical practice and used to inform the type and duration of prescription opioids issued at discharge. Several tools exist for the determination of risk for sustained opioid use, but none are definitively validated, and their performance may vary depending on the population assessed. An automated score, calculated by an algorithm that pulls characteristics directly from the electronic medical record (EMR) or smartphone app is envisioned as a means to modulate opioid prescribing at discharge, and Seymour et al., described this in the form of EMR prescribing alerts (akin to allergy alerts), but more as a general warning highlighting a potential for misuse or abuse. Another option, the Opioid Risk Tool, takes into account patient family history, prior history of drug use, and psychosocial comorbidities.

### Acupuncture therapy as an evidence-based nonpharmacologic strategy for comprehensive acute pain care: the academic consortium pain task force white paper update [^92929118]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

A crisis in pain management persists, as does the epidemic of opioid overdose deaths, addiction, and diversion. Pain medicine is meeting these challenges by returning to its origins: the Bonica model of multidisciplinary pain care. The 2018 Academic Consortium White Paper detailed the historical context and magnitude of the pain crisis and the evidence base for nonpharmacologic strategies. More than 50% of chronic opioid use begins in the acute pain care setting. Acupuncture may be able to reduce this risk.

Objective

This article updates the evidence base for acupuncture therapy for acute pain with a review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses on postsurgical/perioperative pain with opioid sparing and acute nonsurgical/trauma pain, including acute pain in the emergency department.

Methods

To update reviews cited in the 2018 White Paper, electronic searches were conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for "acupuncture" and "acupuncture therapy" and "acute pain", "surgery", "peri-operative", "trauma", "emergency department", "urgent care", "review(s)", "systematic review", "meta-analysis", with additional manual review of titles, links, and reference lists.

Results

There are 22 systematic reviews, 17 with meta-analyses of acupuncture in acute pain settings, and a review for acute pain in the intensive care unit. There are additional studies of acupuncture in acute pain settings.

Conclusion

The majority of reviews found acupuncture therapy to be an efficacious strategy for acute pain, with potential to avoid or reduce opioid reliance. Future multicenter trials are needed to clarify the dosage and generalizability of acupuncture for acute pain in the emergency department. With an extremely low risk profile, acupuncture therapy is an important strategy in comprehensive acute pain care.

### Pain in cancer survivors [^a08d2849]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Pain is a common problem in cancer survivors, especially in the first few years after treatment. In the longer term, approximately 5% to 10% of survivors have chronic severe pain that interferes with functioning. The prevalence is much higher in certain subpopulations, such as breast cancer survivors. All cancer treatment modalities have the potential to cause pain. Currently, the approach to managing pain in cancer survivors is similar to that for chronic cancer-related pain, pharmacotherapy being the principal treatment modality. Although it may be appropriate to continue strong opioids in survivors with moderate to severe pain, most pain problems in cancer survivors will not require them. Moreover, because more than 40% of cancer survivors now live longer than 10 years, there is growing concern about the long-term adverse effects of opioids and the risks of misuse, abuse, and overdose in the nonpatient population. As with chronic nonmalignant pain, multimodal interventions that incorporate nonpharmacologic therapies should be part of the treatment strategy for pain in cancer survivors, prescribed with the aim of restoring functionality, not just providing comfort. For patients with complex pain issues, multidisciplinary programs should be used, if available. New or worsening pain in a cancer survivor must be evaluated to determine whether the cause is recurrent disease or a second malignancy. This article focuses on patients with a history of cancer who are beyond the acute diagnosis and treatment phase and on common treatment-related pain etiologies. The benefits and harms of the various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options for pain management in this setting are reviewed.

### Impact of adverse childhood experiences on analgesia-related outcomes: a systematic review [^5d71193e]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Our review aligns with previously published work reporting the impact of ACEs on long-term health outcomes, and advances our knowledge on the specific field of ACEs and chronic pain. It lends additional weight to the benefit of adopting a trauma-informed model of care, in which the potential long-term impacts of negative experiences in childhood are acknowledged in the assessment and management of disease.

Although widespread screening for ACEs is contro-versial, assessment of ACEs in chronic pain settings may have benefits by identifying those at greater risk of analgesic harms — either in those who are newly starting medication or in those who are established on analgesics and who may benefit from a prescribing review. At the very least, it provides some context for management discussions between individuals living with chronic pain and healthcare professionals. However, we should keep in mind that the evidence about the impact of ACEs on the effectiveness of analgesics and the harms of non-opioid analgesics is still patchy at best.

### Chronic pelvic pain in women: a review [^654e5cc1]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a challenging condition that affects an estimated 26% of the world's female population. Chronic pelvic pain accounts for 40% of laparoscopies and 12% of hysterectomies in the US annually even though the origin of CPP is not gynecologic in 80% of patients. Both patients and clinicians are often frustrated by a perceived lack of treatments. This review summarizes the evaluation and management of CPP using recommendations from consensus guidelines to facilitate clinical evaluation, treatment, improved care, and more positive patient-clinician interactions.

Observations

Chronic pelvic pain conditions often overlap with nonpelvic pain disorders (eg, fibromyalgia, migraines) and nonpain comorbidities (eg, sleep, mood, cognitive impairment) to contribute to pain severity and disability. Musculoskeletal pain and dysfunction are found in 50% to 90% of patients with CPP. Traumatic experiences and distress have important roles in pain modulation. Complete assessment of the biopsychosocial factors that contribute to CPP requires obtaining a thorough history, educating the patient about pain mechanisms, and extending visit times. Training in trauma-informed care and pelvic musculoskeletal examination are essential to reduce patient anxiety associated with the examination and to avoid missing the origin of myofascial pain. Recommended treatments are usually multimodal and require an interdisciplinary team of clinicians. A single-organ pathological examination should be avoided. Patient involvement, shared decision-making, functional goal setting, and a discussion of expectations for long-term care are important parts of the evaluation process.

Conclusions and Relevance

Chronic pelvic pain is like other chronic pain syndromes in that biopsychosocial factors interact to contribute and influence pain. To manage this type of pain, clinicians must consider centrally mediated pain factors as well as pelvic and nonpelvic visceral and somatic structures that can generate or contribute to pain.
