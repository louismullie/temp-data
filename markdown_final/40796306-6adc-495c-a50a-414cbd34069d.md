## Question

based on AAFP gidelain and AAP guidelines what are checklist of things that should be done in a 2yo old well child visit

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a checklist of what should be done at a 24-month well-child visit based on AAFP and AAP guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching visit framework from Bright Futures and the Periodicity Schedule. Then, I should verify core measurements and growth/BMI components. Next, I will review immunizations, developmental and autism-specific screening, and targeted health screenings at this age, including lead, anemia risk, TB risk, and blood pressure. After that, I will consider oral health, nutrition and sleep, safety and media guidance, and family/psychosocial supports. Finally, I will ensure documentation, follow-up, and quality improvement elements are aligned and supported by evidence.

> Let me anchor the visit in the Bright Futures/Periodicity Schedule to ensure the 24-month template is structurally sound, because that will guide which elements are universal versus risk-based at this age and help avoid scope creep that belongs to older ages or different risk profiles [^117A1muN].

> For core measurements and the physical exam, I should confirm that weight and recumbent length or standing height are obtained, BMI is calculated with age- and sex-specific percentiles, and growth is trended on appropriate charts; head circumference can still be measured when clinically indicated at 24 months, especially if there are developmental or neurological concerns, and a complete head-to-toe exam remains standard of care [^112PrSUq].

> I need to check immunizations next; the safest way is to adhere strictly to the 2025 ACIP Child and Adolescent Schedule by reconciling the record, administering needed vaccines, and using the tables, notes, and addendum together rather than relying on memory, while addressing caregiver questions and providing vaccine education to support shared decision-making and catch-up if needed [^112WgDW4].

> Developmental and behavioral surveillance should occur at every visit, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about formal screening intervals without verifying the Periodicity Schedule; formal developmental screening is recommended at 9, 18, and 30 months, and an autism-specific screen is recommended at both 18 and 24 months, so at this visit I should complete an ASD screener such as the M-CHAT-R and perform surveillance and milestone assessment, with tool choice guided by feasibility and validated options like ASQ where appropriate [^117SQv5C] [^117A1muN].

> Let me verify language and milestone interpretation at exactly 24 months; normative data and recent work using milestone checklists at age two support structured milestone review to detect delays in communication, motor, problem-solving, and social domains, and integrating a validated autism screener at this specific age helps capture missed concerns from the 18-month window [^116wxFTX] [^114gMjKM].

> For health screening tests, I should double-check lead practices because "universal screening" varies by jurisdiction; many programs require blood lead testing at 12 and 24 months for Medicaid-enrolled children and in high-prevalence areas, while others use risk assessment with testing if positive, and point-of-care workflows can meaningfully raise screening rates at 24 months, so I should align to local and payer policy while maintaining a low threshold to test in higher-risk settings [^1143uCHZ] [^117SQv5C].

> I need to ensure blood pressure is approached correctly; routine BP screening generally begins at age 3, but in 2-year-olds with specific risk factors it is reasonable to obtain BP, and for children with overweight/obesity, the AAP obesity guidance emphasizes careful BP measurement and cardiometabolic risk assessment with age-appropriate thresholds and timing, so I will limit 24-month BP to those with clear risk profiles and plan universal BP from age 3 [^114qyq3A] [^114nnd2Q].

> I should confirm anemia and tuberculosis risk assessments; at 24 months, a focused anemia risk review is appropriate if not previously screened or if dietary risk persists, and TB testing is risk-based using local epidemiology and exposure history rather than universal testing, with laboratory testing triggered by a positive risk assessment, which I will document to close the loop [^117SQv5C].

> Oral health deserves explicit attention here; I need to review dental home status, perform caries risk assessment, apply fluoride varnish when indicated, reinforce twice-daily brushing with a smear of fluoride toothpaste, and coordinate referral if no dental home is established by age one to two years, as Bright Futures incorporates these preventive oral health steps into routine visits at this age [^117SQv5C].

> Nutrition and lifestyle counseling should be practical and specific; I will assess diet quality and iron intake, address picky eating, limit juice to less than 4 ounces per day, avoid sugar-sweetened beverages, and target about 16–24 ounces per day of milk unless obesity risk or dietary context suggests otherwise, while using growth trends and BMI-for-age to guide counseling and early obesity prevention strategies [^112PrSUq] [^117HJwcY].

> For sleep, I should review routines and duration because inadequate or irregular sleep can amplify behavior concerns at this age; the target is roughly 11–14 hours per 24 hours including naps, and I will counsel on consistent bedtime routines and elimination of bottles or sippy cups in bed to protect dental health and sleep consolidation [^117HJwcY] [^117SQv5C].

> Safety and injury prevention advice needs to be age- and device-specific; I will verify rear-facing car seat use until the child reaches the seat's height or weight limits, discuss drowning prevention and water safety, safe medication and chemical storage with poison control access, sun protection, smoke detector function, and safe firearm storage consistent with family context and local norms, documenting the counseling provided [^117HJwcY] [^117SQv5C].

> Screen time and media use should be addressed thoughtfully; I will recommend limiting total daily screen time to less than one hour of high-quality programming, avoiding screens during meals and before bedtime, and encouraging co-viewing to improve content quality and language interaction, while discouraging non-interactive screens for children under 18 months except for video chatting [^117HJwcY] [^117SQv5C].

> Anticipatory guidance at 24 months should cover toilet training readiness signs and approach, positive behavior strategies for tantrums, daily shared reading and language enrichment, social play and early sharing skills, promotion of active play for at least an hour per day, and routine dental hygiene with a plan for regular dental visits, tailoring the depth based on family priorities and the time available during the visit [^117SQv5C] [^115NLNbc].

> Family and psychosocial support are integral; I need to screen for social determinants of health such as food security, housing, and transportation, assess caregiver stress, and consider postpartum depression follow-up if not previously addressed, because systematic approaches and team-based models, including community health workers, can improve anticipatory guidance, screening, and overall experience of care in families with young children [^115pzUAP] [^115Vdie4] [^112Z1ZRh].

> Let me verify documentation and follow-up workflows; I will record all screening results, counseling provided, and immunizations given, supply an after-visit summary with milestones and next steps, schedule the next preventive visit at 30 months if available in the practice or at 3 years per local implementation of the Periodicity Schedule, and set concrete follow-up for any abnormal findings, leveraging structured QI approaches shown to improve Bright Futures delivery at the 24-month visit [^117SQv5C] [^117A1muN] [^115o1VkD].

> But wait, time and workflow constraints can undermine quality; longer visits are associated with more anticipatory guidance and higher parent satisfaction, and adding validated developmental screening does not necessarily lengthen visits and may improve parent–clinician communication, so I should consider pre-visit tools, team-based care, or health educator support to protect content within typical visit lengths [^116y48o8] [^111KCQUh] [^1154Cvic].

> I should double-check a few nuanced points to avoid overreach at 24 months: lipid and glucose screening are not universal at this age and should be reserved for clearly at-risk children per cardiometabolic risk guidance, with broader universal lipid screening occurring later in childhood, and blood pressure measurement should be routine beginning at age 3 unless specific risk factors are present now, which I will document explicitly to maintain clarity and reduce unnecessary testing [^114qyq3A] [^114nnd2Q] [^117SQv5C].

> Finally, let me reconsider alignment with the user's original checklist; the structure covering measurements, immunizations, development including autism screening at 24 months, targeted health screens such as lead and BP based on risk, oral health, nutrition, sleep, safety, media, anticipatory guidance, family supports, and robust documentation and follow-up is consistent with Bright Futures and contemporary AAP/ACIP recommendations, with local adaptation for lead testing practices and scheduling to ensure fidelity to guidelines and jurisdictional requirements [^117SQv5C] [^112WgDW4] [^1143uCHZ] [^112PrSUq].

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for children and adolescents aged 18 years or younger - United States, 2025 [^112WgDW4]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). High credibility.

At its October 2024 meeting, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) approved the Recommended Immunization Schedule for Child and Adolescent Ages 18 Years or Younger, United States, 2025. The schedule supports health care providers, as well as public health and other professionals, by providing a consolidated summary of ACIP recommendations for vaccinating children and adolescents. The 2025 schedule includes several updates to the cover page, tables, notes, and appendix. The addendum remains part of the schedule and will be used to summarize new or updated ACIP recommendations that occur before the next annual schedule update. Health care providers are strongly encouraged to use all parts of the schedule (the cover page, tables, notes, appendix, and addendum) together when making recommendations for individual patients. The 2025 child and adolescent immunization schedule can be found on the CDC website (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/index.html).

### Point-of-care testing improves lead screening rates at 1- and 2-year well visits [^1143uCHZ]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

To increase blood lead level screening rates in children at 12- and 24-month well visits, provider education and the implementation of a point-of-care (POC) lead screening program were carried out in four primary care practice offices located in and near counties with a ≥ 5% prevalence of blood lead levels ≥ 5 μg/dL.

Baseline data were collected from July 2017 to June 2018. In July 2018, all providers received education on screening recommendations and the local prevalence of elevated blood lead levels. POC testing began in June 2019 at one of the four practice sites. Screening rates were measured through electronic medical record abstraction and plotted monthly on statistical process control charts during implementation. Logistic regression was used under an interrupted time series approach for program evaluation.

There was a small but significant increase in screening following provider education (OR 1.04 per month, 95% CI 1.02–1.07). POC testing was associated with a substantial immediate increase (OR 4.17, 95% CI 2.45–7.09) and a continued significant increase (OR 1.34 per month, 95% CI 1.17–1.54) in screening at the site that implemented POC.

POC testing significantly increases blood lead level screening rates at 12- and 24-month well visits and may be beneficial in other primary care settings.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^112PrSUq]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of childhood obesity, the AAP 2023 guidelines recommend measuring height and weight, calculating BMI, and assessing BMI percentile. This should be done using age- and sex-specific growth charts or growth charts for children with severe obesity. These assessments should occur at least annually to screen for overweight, obesity, and severe obesity in all children aged 2–18 years.

### Adherence to pediatric screening [^114qyq3A]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Risk-based screenings for lipids and blood glucose are crucial in pediatric healthcare. For each child aged 2 years who attended a well-child visit and had a history of a relevant risk factor for which screening of blood pressure (BP) is recommended, the receipt of both systolic and diastolic BP measurements was assessed. Similarly, for each child between 2 and 8 years who attended a well-child visit and had a history of a relevant risk factor for which screening of lipids is recommended, the receipt of a total cholesterol and HDL measurement was assessed. For children aged 10 to 12 years who attended a well-child visit and had a history of a relevant blood glucose risk factor, the receipt of a fasting blood glucose or HbA1c measurement was assessed.

Comorbidities, used to identify "at-risk" children eligible for screening, were identified via ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes and carried forward if detected. For BP, these included premature birth, congenital heart disease, urinary tract infections, hematuria, proteinuria, renal disease or urologic malformations, solid-organ transplant, malignancy or bone marrow transplant, or other systemic illnesses associated with hypertension such as neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, or sickle cell disease. For lipids, these included diabetes, hypertension, obesity (defined as ≥ 95th percentile in BMI using height and weight measured at the most recent visit), chronic kidney disease, cardiac transplant, Kawasaki disease with or regressed coronary aneurysms, or chronic inflammatory disease. For blood glucose, these included ≥ 85th percentile in BMI (measured at the most recent visit).

### Trends in the use of standardized tools for developmental screening in early childhood: 2002–2009 [^113XxmjJ]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Early identification of developmental delays is essential for optimal early intervention. An American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2002 Periodic Survey of Fellows found that fewer than 25% of respondents consistently used appropriate screening tools. Over the past five years, new research and educational programs have promoted the implementation of screening. In 2006, the AAP issued a revised policy statement with a detailed algorithm. Since the 2002 Periodic Survey, no national surveys have examined the effectiveness of policy, programmatic, and educational enhancements.

- **Objective**: The goal of this study was to compare pediatricians' use of standardized screening tools from 2002 to 2009.

- **Methods**: A national, random sample of non-retired US AAP members were mailed Periodic Surveys (2002: N = 1617, response rate: 55%; 2009: N = 1620, response rate: 57%). χ² analyses were used to examine responses across survey years. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to compare differences in using ≥ 1 formal screening tool across survey years while controlling for various individual and practice characteristics.

- **Results**: Pediatricians' use of standardized screening tools increased significantly between 2002 and 2009. The percentage of those who self-reported always/almost always using ≥ 1 screening tool increased over time (23.0%-47.7%), as did the use of specific instruments (e.g. Ages & Stages Questionnaire, Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status). No differences were noted on the basis of physician or practice characteristics.

- **Conclusions**: The percentage of pediatricians who reported using standardized screening tools increased substantially during the study period, indicating a positive trend in adopting these practices.

### Community health workers in early childhood well-child care for Medicaid-insured children: A randomized clinical trial [^112Z1ZRh]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

An intervention model called the Parent-focused Redesign for Encounters, Newborns to Toddlers (the PARENT intervention) for well-child care that integrates a community health worker into preventive care services may enhance early childhood well-child care. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of the PARENT intervention versus usual care for parents with children younger than 2 years of age.

A cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted between March 2019 and July 2022. Of the 1,283 parents with a child younger than 2 years of age presenting for a well-child visit at one of the ten clinic sites (two federally qualified health centers in California and Washington) approached for trial participation, 937 were enrolled. Five clinics implemented the PARENT intervention, which is a team-based approach to care that uses a community health worker in the role of a coach (i.e. health educator) as part of the well-child care team to provide comprehensive preventive services, and five clinics provided usual care.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: There were two primary outcomes: the score for parent-reported receipt of recommended anticipatory guidance during well-child visits (score range, 0–100) and emergency department (ED) use (proportion with ≥ 2 ED visits). The secondary outcomes included psychosocial screening, developmental screening, health care use, and parent-reported experiences of care.

Of the 937 parents who were enrolled, 914 remained eligible to participate (n = 438 in the intervention group and n = 476 in the usual care group).

### The child with ADHD: Using the AAP clinical practice guideline [^115ohTqZ]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics developed an evidence-based clinical practice guideline that provides recommendations for the assessment and diagnosis of school-aged children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This guideline, the first of two guidelines to provide recommendations on this condition, is intended for use by primary care clinicians. The second set of guidelines will address the treatment of children with ADHD.

- **Six recommendations for diagnosis of ADHD**:
	1. In a child six to 12 years of age who presents with inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, academic underachievement, or behavior problems, primary care clinicians should initiate an evaluation for ADHD.
	2. The diagnosis of ADHD requires that a child meet the criteria for ADHD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.
	3. The assessment of ADHD requires evidence directly obtained from parents or caregivers regarding the core symptoms of ADHD in various settings, the age of onset, duration of symptoms, and degree of functional impairment.
	4. The assessment of ADHD also requires evidence directly obtained from a teacher (or other school professional) regarding the core symptoms of ADHD, duration of symptoms, degree of functional impairment, and associated conditions.
	5. Evaluation of the child with ADHD should include assessment for coexisting conditions.
	6. Other diagnostic tests are not routinely indicated to establish the diagnosis of ADHD but may be used for the assessment of coexisting conditions.

### Well-child visits for infants and young children [^117HJwcY]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

The well-child visit allows for a comprehensive assessment of a child and the opportunity for further evaluation if abnormalities are detected. A complete history during the well-child visit includes information about birth history, prior screenings, diet, sleep, dental care, and medical, surgical, family, and social histories. A head-to-toe examination should be performed, including a review of growth. Immunizations should be reviewed and updated as appropriate.

Screening for postpartum depression in mothers of infants up to six months of age is recommended. Based on expert opinion, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends developmental surveillance at each visit, with formal developmental screening at nine, 18, and 30 months and autism-specific screening at 18 and 24 months; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation.

Well-child visits provide the opportunity to answer parents' or caregivers' questions and to provide age-appropriate guidance. Car seats should remain rear-facing until two years of age or until the height or weight limit for the seat is reached. Fluoride use, limiting or avoiding juice, and weaning to a cup by 12 months of age may improve dental health. A one-time vision screening between three and five years of age is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to detect amblyopia. The American Academy of Pediatrics guideline, based on expert opinion, recommends that screen time be avoided, with the exception of video chatting, in children younger than 18 months and limited to one hour per day for older children.

### Five-year trends in US children's health and well-being, 2016–2020 [^115av263]. JAMA Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

More work remains to achieve the nation's goals to improve children's health and well-being. The findings of this study can be used to inform programmatic investments and priorities, and support stakeholders in making data-informed decisions. For instance, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the federal agency that sponsors the NSCH, also administers several programs that address some of the significant health-related challenges highlighted here.

- **Pediatric Mental Health Care Access Program**: Expands access to pediatric mental health care by integrating telehealth services into pediatric practices in states, territories, and tribal regions to support primary care clinicians to diagnose, treat, and refer children and youth for mental health conditions.

- **Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program**: Addresses parental stress and promotes family well-being by supporting people during pregnancy and the early childhood years. Health, social service, and child development resources and skill development are offered through regular home visits to address families' wide-ranging needs.

- **Bright Futures Program**: Disseminates age-specific, evidence-based guidelines for comprehensive well-child visits, including guidelines on developmental screening and surveillance, behavioral, social, and emotional assessment, and screening for maternal postpartum depression.

In response to the decline in children's preventive care during the pandemic, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau launched the Promoting Pediatric Primary program.

### Hypertension screening during healthcare pediatric visits [^1115qdXr]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines in both Europe and the United States recommend screening for hypertension during child care pediatric visits in children above 3 years old. The aims of the study were to assess the frequency of blood pressure (BP) measurement during preventive or chronic care pediatric visits and determine the factors that may associate with screening.

- **Method**: We prospectively included in the study consecutive children hospitalized in our department. Anthropometric measurements were performed in all children. Office BP was measured in children above 5 years old and mothers and/or fathers. Personal and family history, and self-reported BP screening during pediatric visits were recorded.

- **Results**: Hypertension screening had been performed at least once in 45.3% of the children during pediatric visits. Fifty percent of the children with elevated BP levels had never been screened for hypertension. Low birth weight, history of prematurity, or chronic disease was not associated with increased frequency of screening, whereas screening was more likely in children above 3 years old with positive personal history (odds ratio 2.35, 95% confidence interval 1.07–5.15, P < 0.05). Obesity tended to increase the frequency of hypertension screening in all ages (odds ratio 2.60, 95% confidence interval 0.93–7.28, P = 0.06). Moreover, 37.5% of children without positive personal history exhibited BP levels above the 90th percentile, and 13.5% of mothers and 31.1% of fathers were not aware of their own elevated BP levels.

These findings suggest that hypertension screening does effectively identify children with elevated BP levels who may otherwise go unnoticed. Early detection is crucial to manage and prevent long-term health issues associated with hypertension in children.

### "Are you available for the next 18 months?" - Methods and aims of a longitudinal birth cohort study investigating a universal developmental surveillance program: The 'Watch Me Grow' study [^114LtD5r]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Universal developmental surveillance programs aimed at early identification and targeted early intervention significantly improve short- and long-term outcomes in children at risk of developmental disorders. However, a significant challenge remains in providing sufficiently rigorous research and robust evidence to inform policy and service delivery. This paper describes the methods of the 'Watch Me Grow' study that aims to maximize accurate early detection of children with developmental disorders through a partnership formed between policymakers, service providers, and researchers.

- **Methods/design**: A mixed methods study design was developed consisting of:
	1. A qualitative study of parents and health service providers to investigate barriers and enablers of developmental surveillance.
	2. Recruitment of a birth cohort and their longitudinal follow-up to 18 months of age to:
		- a) Assess risk factors for not accessing existing developmental surveillance programs
		- b) Estimate the prevalence of children identified with developmental risk.
	3. Comparison of surveillance outcomes with a reference standard at 18 months of age to assess the diagnostic test accuracy of existing and alternative developmental surveillance tools.
	4. Comparison of developmental surveillance models to inform policy recommendations. Data linkage will be used to determine the uptake and representativeness of the study participant group versus non-participants.

- **Discussion**: The Watch Me Grow study is expected to provide a collaborative opportunity to enhance universal developmental surveillance.

### The prenatal visit [^1162CWmQ]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

A pediatric prenatal visit during the third trimester is recommended for all expectant families as an important first step in establishing a child's medical home, as recommended by *Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents, Fourth Edition*. As advocates for children and their families, pediatricians can support and guide expectant parents in the prenatal period. Prenatal visits allow general pediatricians to establish a supportive and trusting relationship with both parents, gather basic information from expectant parents, offer information and advice regarding the infant, and identify psychosocial risks early, as well as high-risk conditions that may require special care. There are several possible formats for this first visit. The format used depends on the experience and preference of the parents, the style of the pediatrician's practice, and pragmatic issues of payment.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^115HrDaN]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

For pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly regarding the screening for obstructive sleep apnea, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend screening for symptoms of sleep apnea at each visit. If symptoms are identified, patients should be referred to a pediatric sleep specialist for evaluation and potentially a polysomnogram. Treatment for obstructive sleep apnea is advised when it is documented.

### Ten recommendations for child-friendly visiting policies in critical care [^112bpGW7]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

**Documentation of children's visits and family rounds**: Clinicians document children's visits, including decisions, planning, and involvement of children and parents, as well as an evaluation in patients' charts. All staff members have access to this information.

### Establishing new norms for developmental milestones [^114gMjKM]. Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Pediatric surveillance of young children relies on providers' assessment of developmental milestones; however, normative data are sparse. The objectives of this study were to develop new norms for common milestones to aid in the clinical interpretation of milestone attainment.

- **Methods**: We analyzed responses to the developmental screening form of the Survey of Well-being of Young Children from 41,465 screens across three states. Associations between developmental status and a range of child characteristics were analyzed, and norms for individual questions were compared to guidelines regarding attainment of critical milestones from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

- **Results**: A contemporary resource of normative data for developmental milestone attainment was established. Lower developmental status was associated with child age in the presence of positive behavioral screening scores (P < .01), social determinants of health (P < .01), Medicaid (P < .01), male sex (P < .01), and child race (P < .01). Comparisons between Survey of Well-being of Young Children developmental questions and CDC guidelines reveal that a high percentage of children are reported to pass milestones by the age at which the CDC states that "most children pass", and that an even higher percentage of children are reported to pass milestones by the age at which the CDC advises parents to "act early". An interactive data visualization tool that can assist clinicians in real-time developmental screening and surveillance interpretation is also provided.

Conclusions have been truncated.

### Quality of evidence and strength of recommendations in American Academy of Pediatrics' guidelines [^112FqLUX]. Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Summarizing the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations in the American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) clinical practice guidelines reveals important insights into their construction and application.

- **Methods**: We identified the AAP's clinical practice guidelines from its website. Three independent reviewers abstracted each recommendation, the quality of evidence supporting it, and its strength from every guideline. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus, and results were analyzed using descriptive statistics.

- **Results**: We identified 14 clinical practice guidelines. Individual guidelines make between 1 and 39 recommendations (with a mean of 16.9 and a median of 15), totaling 236 recommendations. Twenty-five (10.6%) recommendations are based on Level A evidence (well-designed and conducted trials, meta-analyses), 112 (47.5%) on Level B (trials with minor limitations; consistent findings from multiple observational studies), 64 (27.1%) on Level C (single or few observational studies or multiple studies with inconsistent findings or major limitations), 15 (6.4%) on Level D (expert opinion, case reports, reasoning from first principles), and 20 (8.5%) on Level X (exceptional situations where validating studies cannot be performed and there is a clear preponderance of benefit or harm). Eighty-two (34.7%) recommendations are strong, 117 (49.6%) moderate, and 37 (15.7%) weak. Fifty of the 117 (42.7%) moderate recommendations are based on Level C evidence, and 10 of the 82 (13%) strong recommendations are based on Level X evidence.

- **Conclusion**: A minority of recommendations in the AAP's clinical practice guidelines are strongly supported, highlighting the varying levels of evidence underlying these recommendations.

### Effect of an electronic health record transition on the provision of recommended well child services in pediatric primary care practices [^115o1VkD]. Clinical Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

We sought to determine the effect of transitioning between electronic health record (EHR) systems on the quality of preventive care in a large pediatric primary care network. To study this, we performed a retrospective chart analysis of 42 primary care practices from the Pediatric Physicians' Organization at Children's who transitioned EHRs. We reviewed 24 random encounters per week distributed evenly across six age categories before, during, and following a transition period. We reviewed encounter documentation for age-appropriate well child services, per American Academy of Pediatrics/Bright Futures guidelines. Logistic regression and statistical process control analysis were used.

In the pretransition period, 84.5% of all recommended elements were documented versus 86.4% posttransition (P = 0.04). Documentation of age-appropriate anticipatory guidance showed significant positive change (69.0% to 80.2%, P = 0.005), but it was the only subdomain with a statistically significant increase. These increases suggest that EHR transitions have the opportunity to affect the delivery of preventive care.

### Evaluation of a learning collaborative to improve the delivery of preventive services by pediatric practices [^115dNKDi]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Effective delivery of preventive services is an essential component of high-quality pediatric health care. However, both variation in and deviation from accepted guidelines have been reported. Learning collaboratives (LCs) have been shown to result in improvement in several aspects of pediatric care. The objective of this study was to determine whether pediatric practices that participated in a preventive services LC would improve their delivery of preventive services.

- **Methods**: After conducting an initial audit of the medical records of twenty 2-year-olds and twenty 4-year-olds for documentation of preventive services on the basis of national standards, practice teams attended a quality improvement workshop. They were presented with evidence to support the value of preventive services and the results of their audits and were taught quality improvement methods, e.g. rapid cycles of change. Each team developed plans to improve one or more services. Brief audits with feedback and monthly conference calls were used to support practices to conduct rapid cycles of change, discuss barriers and solutions, and monitor progress. The results of final chart audits of twenty 2-year-olds and 4-year-olds were compared with the initial chart audits. A Preventive Service Score (PSS) was assigned to each practice on the basis of the number of services provided, and initial to final comparisons were made.

- **Results**: Fourteen practices participated. PSSs improved for all practices after the LC. The mean PSS for 2-year-olds increased from 4.0 ± 1.1 to 4.9 ± 1.2, and for 4-year-olds increased…

### Quality of pediatric clinical practice guidelines [^111GE7Zm]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

The AGREE II instrument consists of 23 key items across six domains to capture different dimensions of clinical practice guideline (CPG) quality. These domains include scope and purpose (items 1–3), stakeholder involvement (items 4–6), rigor of development (items 7–14), clarity of presentation (items 15–17), applicability (items 18–21), and editorial independence (items 22–23). Each item is scored on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree, when no relevant information is provided) to 7 (strongly agree, when all criteria of the item are met). The more criteria that are met, the higher the scores are assigned.

According to the AGREE II instrument, the scores for each domain are calculated by dividing the difference between the actually obtained score and the minimum possible score by the difference between the maximum possible score and the minimum possible score. Reviewers provided two overall assessments of the CPG based on the quality of the six domains. They assigned an overall quality score from 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating higher quality, taking into account the total scores from each domain as well as personal judgment.

If the overall assessment scores given by the two reviewers differed by 1 point, the lower score was assigned. If it varied by 2 points, the average of the scores was assigned, and if it differed by 3 or more points, the reviewers engaged in discussion to reach an agreement. To reach the recommended level, CPGs needed to achieve overall assessment scores of 6 or 7 (above 80% of a score of 7). With an overall score of 4 or 5 (60 to 80% of a score of 7), the level was "recommended with modifications".

### Pediatric screening urinalysis: A difference-in-differences analysis of how a 2007 change in guidelines impacted use [^111LafyA]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Screening urinalysis before and after the 2007 AAP policy statement was examined. Overall, the adjusted proportion of visits including screening urinalysis prior to the 2007 AAP policy statement were similar in preventive care visits by children aged 4–18 years and visits by young adults aged 19–32 years. Adjusted screening urinalysis proportions before and after the 2007 recommendation remained flat in child visits, from 20.4% before to 22.5% after, but increased in young adult visits, from 20.1% to 27.0%, resulting in a differential impact on child visits of -4.8 percentage points (95% confidence interval, -9.0 to -0.5, p = 0.03).

- **Differential impact by gender and visit setting**: After stratifying analyses by visit setting and patient gender, adjusted screening urinalysis proportions in female child visits to private practices differentially decreased by 7.6 percentage points (95% CI -13.7 to -1.5, p = 0.02). In male child visits to private practices, proportions differentially decreased by 0.5 percentage points (95% CI -10.6 to 9.6, p = 0.93). In community health center visits by female children, proportions differentially decreased by 17.4 percentage points (95% CI -27.9 to -6.8, p = 0.001); in community health center visits by male children, proportions differentially decreased by 33.5 percentage points (95% CI -47.4 to -19.7, p < 0.001).

Of note, sample sizes were small for some cells, leading to imprecise estimates.

### Universal lipid screening among 9- to 11-year-old children: Screening results and physician management [^1161nEUD]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

We conducted a retrospective chart review of the electronic medical record (EMR) of all 9- to 11-year-old children who presented for a well-child visit between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016. This study included visits that occurred during a successful year-long QI project designed to increase universal lipid screening (ULS) among children aged 9 to 11 years during well-child visits in 2014, and the two subsequent years, 2015 and 2016. These children presented to the University of California, San Diego Pediatrics Clinic, a large academic practice with two sites that serve as the main outpatient teaching sites for UC San Diego medical students, pediatric residents, and medicine-pediatric residents. These clinics have 14 full-time and part-time faculty pediatricians who care for a diverse population in San Diego County, averaging more than 18,000 visits annually.

### Adherence to pediatric screening [^1128Hw5q]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Here, we describe adherence to universal age‐based and risk‐based CVD screening guidelines using EHRs from 197,559 well‐child visits from children aged 2 to 12 years in a diverse, urban population. Adherence to BMI screening guidelines — the only CVH metric that is always recommended for universal age‐based screening — was most prevalent, with roughly 8 out of 10 well‐child visits including a complete screening. However, we found that only approximately 1-in-3 eligible visits included BP screening, and 1-in-10 included screening for lipids and blood glucose according to recommended universal or risk‐based guidelines.

To our knowledge, no descriptive studies of adherence to BMI screening in pediatric EHRs have been conducted. Similar ambulatory visit BP screening adherences (35 per 100) were found in comparable studies. Universal lipid screening rates in similar studies ranged from 4 per 100 eligible children to 20 per 100 standard‐risk children and 47 per 100 high‐risk children. Risk‐based blood glucose screening adherence was higher in a similar study, with 34 in 100 eligible children aged 10 to 18 years receiving screening.

Universal age‐based pediatric screening for CVD risk factors is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, AHA/American College of Cardiology, American Diabetes Association, and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute for identifying and addressing risk factors, increasing health equity, and improving health outcomes. Early identification of the loss of ideal CVD risk factors could lead to earlier interventions, potentially preventing worsening of these factors.

### Assessing development in the pediatric office [^1163M6HY]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

To determine the proportion of children aged 10 to 35 months who were reported ever to have received a developmental assessment (DA) and to examine characteristics of the child, family, and health care setting associated with the receipt of a DA, a study was conducted using data from the National Survey of Early Childhood Health in 2000. This survey involved 2,068 parents of children aged 4 to 35 months.

Children were classified as having received a DA if parents reported that the child's pediatric provider ever mentioned conducting a "developmental assessment" and/or if parents recalled explicit components of a DA, such as stacking blocks or throwing a ball. The parent-reported receipt of a DA was assessed in relation to child and family characteristics, health care access, other measures of health care content and process, and measures of quality and satisfaction.

Approximately 57% of children aged 10 to 35 months had ever received a DA. Forty-two percent of parents recalled ever being told by their child's pediatric provider that a DA was being done, and 39% recalled their child being asked to perform specific tasks routinely included in a DA. Bivariate analysis indicates that the receipt of a DA is not associated with child or family sociodemographic characteristics, such as maternal education and household income, except for race/ethnicity. Less acculturated Hispanic parents reported a DA more frequently than parents in other racial/ethnic groups (66% vs. 56%). A smaller proportion of parents whose children used community health centers reported similar patterns.

### Evaluating the implementation of expert committee recommendations for obesity assessment [^1131V2wp]. Clinical Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity and their associated morbidities are well established, yet rates of diagnosis and screening for related conditions by clinicians are low. Expert Committee recommendations were released in 2007 to facilitate management of pediatric overweight and obesity. From well-child visits to a Massachusetts multisite group practice, we randomly selected one visit per child in 2006 (n = 56,374) and in 2008 (n = 69,681) and used electronic health record data to identify children with incident overweight or obesity (BMI ≥ 85th percentile). We ascertained whether clinicians assigned relevant ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision) codes and ordered laboratory tests recommended for children 10 years and older.

In the year following the release of recommendations, a large majority of children 2 to 17 years old with a BMI ≥ 85th percentile lacked diagnosis codes for overweight or obesity and recommended laboratory orders for assessment of obesity-related comorbidities for children 10 years and older. This suggests the need to augment approaches to increase the uptake of guidelines.

### Developmental milestone attainment in US children before and during the COVID-19 pandemic [^113kWhwi]. JAMA Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

The restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the lives of young children; however, the association between the pandemic and any changes in early childhood developmental milestone achievement in the United States remains unclear. This study aims to determine the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in developmental screening scores among US children aged 0 to 5 years. It also investigates whether caregivers self-reported more worries about their children or concerns about children's behavior during the pandemic, regardless of milestone achievement.

This was a cohort study using an interrupted time series analysis. It compared the prepandemic period (March 1, 2018, to February 29, 2020), the interruption period (March 1 to May 31, 2020), and the intrapandemic period (June 1, 2020, to May 30, 2022) among 50,205 children. These children were randomly sampled from a population of 502,052 children aged 0 to 5 years, whose parents or caregivers completed developmental screening at pediatric visits at US pediatric primary care practices participating in a web-based clinical process support system.

- **Exposure**: COVID-19 pandemic period.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Age-standardized Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Third Edition (ASQ) domain scores (communication, personal-social, problem-solving, gross motor, and fine motor). The rate of caregivers' concerns about the child's behavior or worries about the child was measured on the ASQ.

A total of 50,205 children (25,852 [51.5%] male; mean [SD] age, 18.6 [16.0] months) and 134,342 ASQ observations were included in the study.

### Challenges in developing U.S. Preventive Services Task Force child health recommendations [^112DK6FQ]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) uses an objective, evidence-based approach to develop recommendations. As part of this process, the USPSTF also identifies important research gaps in scientific evidence. In March 2016, the USPSTF convened an expert panel to discuss its portfolio of child and adolescent recommendations and identify unique methodological issues when evaluating evidence regarding children and adolescents.

The panel identified key domains of challenges, including:

- **Measuring patient-centered health outcomes**: Identifying intermediate outcomes predictive of important health outcomes.
- **Evaluating the long time horizon**: Needed to assess the balance of benefits and harms.
- **Understanding trajectories of growth and development**: Resulting in unique windows of time when expected benefits or harms of a preventive service can vary.
- **Considering perspectives**: Involving other individuals who might be affected by the delivery of a preventive service to a child or adolescent.

Although the expert panel expressed an interest in being able to make more recommendations for, or against preventive services for children and adolescents, it also reinforced the importance of ensuring recommendations are based on sound and sufficient evidence to ensure the greatest benefit and minimize unnecessary harms. Accordingly, the need to highlight areas with insufficient evidence is as important as making recommendations. Having identified these key challenges, the USPSTF and other organizations issuing guidelines have an opportunity to advance their methods of evidence synthesis and identification.

### A practice-based intervention to enhance quality of care in the first 3 years of life: The Healthy Steps for Young Children program [^115NLNbc]. JAMA (2003). High credibility.

There is growing concern regarding the quality of health care available in the United States for young children, and specific limitations have been noted in developmental and behavioral services provided for children in the first 3 years of life.

- **Objective**: To determine the impact of the Healthy Steps for Young Children Program on quality of early childhood health care and parenting practices.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was a prospective controlled clinical trial enrolling participants between September 1996 and November 1998 at six randomization and nine quasi-experimental sites across the United States. Participants were 5,565 children enrolled at birth and followed up through age 3 years.

- **Intervention**: Incorporation of developmental specialists and enhanced developmental services into pediatric care during the participants' first 3 years of life.

- **Main outcome measures**: Quality of care was operationalized across four domains: effectiveness (e.g. families received ≥ 4 Healthy Steps-related services or discussed ≥ 6 anticipatory guidance topics), patient-centeredness (e.g. families were satisfied with care provided), timeliness (e.g. children received timely well-child visits and vaccinations), and efficiency (e.g. families remained at the practice for ≥ 20 months). Parenting outcomes included responses to child misbehavior (e.g. use of severe discipline) and practices to promote child development and safety (e.g. mothers at risk for depression discussed their sadness with someone at the practice).

- **Results**: Of the 5,565 enrolled families, 3,737 (67.2%) responded to an interview.

### Ten recommendations for child-friendly visiting policies in critical care [^112TqeNn]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

**Integrate quality and risk management**: Proactive quality and risk management, along with structured quality control, are essential for the successful implementation of children's visits to the ICU. Potential contraindications must be discussed and considered. Children's visits can be defined as part of a protocol to determine the desired quality of the visit and the process.

### Visitor guidelines in US children's hospitals during COVID-19 [^113KT9ZC]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

To examine visitor guidelines among children's hospitals in the United States in response to the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, **methods**: a retrospective assessment was conducted of visitor guidelines in 239 children's hospitals in the United States.

- **Results**: In this study, we present an analysis of 239 children's hospital visitor guidelines posted to hospitals' websites during one week in June 2020. Of the 239 hospitals, only 28 did not have posted guidelines for review. The guidelines were analyzed and grouped by how they were updated in response to COVID-19. Parental visitation was restricted to one parent in 116 of the posted guidelines (49%). There were no obvious similarities among guidelines associated with their geographical (e.g. state or local) location. As of February 2021, 33 of 55 (60%) randomly selected hospitals had not changed their visitor policy since our initial review.

- **Conclusions**: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered changes in publicly reported visitor guidelines across the majority of children's hospitals. With our findings, we suggest wide variation in policies and practices in how guidelines were updated. More work is needed to understand how to optimize public safety and preserve family-centered care and parental authority in times of crisis.

### Quality of pediatric clinical practice guidelines [^115TEMfM]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

The "rigor of development" domain is crucial for creating qualified clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) as it involves gathering and synthesizing evidence, promoting recommendations, and setting update schedules. The AGREE II manual and RIGHT checklist offer various suggestions for CPG development and reporting, such as systematic methods, evidence criteria, review procedures, and update schedules. These resources should be consulted and followed during the proposal, development, report, review, and update procedures of a CPG.

Recently, several studies have raised concerns that conflicts of interest could affect the quality of CPGs. However, only a limited number of CPGs describe the management of financial conflicts of interest. Komesaroff et al. proposed the concept of "conflicts of interests" as "the condition that arises when two coexisting interests directly conflict with each other; that is, when they are likely to compel contrary and incompatible outcomes"; while Grundy et al. and Wiersma et al. suggested that "non-financial conflicts of interests" should also receive awareness in health and medicine. The AGREE II provides a domain called "editorial independence" to evaluate whether funding bodies have influenced the content and whether conflicts of interest among CPG development group members have been recorded and addressed.

Our study showed that the "editorial independence" domain achieved a mean score of only 35.26% for pediatric CPGs. Furthermore, several previous studies highlighted that the "editorial independence" domain of AGREE II in pediatric CPGs had inappropriate quality, with a mean score ranging from 17% to 48%.

### The new morbidity revisited: a renewed commitment to the psychosocial aspects of pediatric care. Committee on psychosocial aspects of child and family health [^11297Vyi]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

In 1993, the American Academy of Pediatrics adopted the policy statement "The Pediatrician and the 'New Morbidity'. Since then, social difficulties, behavioral problems, and developmental difficulties have become a main part of the scope of pediatric practice, and recognition of the importance of these areas has increased. This statement reaffirms the Academy's commitment to prevention, early detection, and management of behavioral, developmental, and social problems as a focus in pediatric practice.

### AAP updates recommendations for routine preventive pediatric health care [^111APPVN]. American Family Physician (2016). High credibility.

Run by January 2017, the updated AAP recommendations for routine preventive pediatric health care emphasize the importance of developmental screenings and immunizations. These guidelines also highlight the need for personalized care plans to address individual child health needs, ensuring that healthcare providers can offer the most appropriate preventive measures for each child. The changes aim to enhance the overall quality and effectiveness of pediatric preventive care.

### A longitudinal study of developmental and behavioral screening and referral in North Carolina's Assuring Better Child Health and Development participating practices [^114WaKev]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Screening children for developmental and behavioral delays is an important part of primary care practice. Well-child visits provide an ideal opportunity to engage parents and conduct periodic screening, which can identify children who may be at risk and in need of further evaluation.

In North Carolina's Assuring Better Child Health and Development project's best-practices process, screening was incorporated as a routine part of well-child visits regardless of payor. The schedule for screenings, using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, was set at the ages of 6, 12, 18 or 24, 36, 48, and 60 months. From the practice population, a cohort of 526 children, screened from the age of 6 months during August 2001 through November 2003, was retrospectively reviewed.

The main objectives of this descriptive study were to:

- **Determine the number of children screened**: Evaluate whether the screening rate improved over time.
- **Observe patterns and trajectories**: Focus on children identified at risk in one or more of the five developmental domains.
- **Examine referral rates and physician referral patterns**.

### Duration of a well-child visit: Association with content, family-centeredness, and satisfaction [^116y48o8]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Studies of pediatric primary care suggest that time is an important limitation to the delivery of recommended preventive services. Given the increasingly frenetic pace of pediatric practice, there is an increased need to monitor the length of pediatric visits and the association of visit length with content, family-centered care, and parent satisfaction with care.

- **Objective**: To examine the length of well-child visits and the associations of visit length with content, family-centered care, and parent satisfaction among a national sample of children.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cross-sectional telephone survey of parents of children aged 4 to 35 months from the 2000 National Survey of Early Childhood Health (n = 2068).

- **Results**: One-third (33.6%) of parents reported spending ≤ 10 minutes with the clinician at their last well-child visit. Nearly half (47.1%) spent 11 to 20 minutes, and 20.3% spent > 20 minutes. Longer visits were associated with more anticipatory guidance, more psychosocial risk assessment, and higher family-centered care ratings. A visit of > 20 minutes was associated with 2.4 (confidence interval [CI]: 1.5–3.7) higher odds of receiving a developmental assessment, 3.2 (CI: 1.7–6.1) higher odds of recommending the clinician, and 9.7 (CI: 3.5–26.5) higher odds of having enough time to ask questions.

- **Conclusions**: Many well-child visits are of short duration, and shorter visits are associated with reductions in content, quality of care, and parent satisfaction with care. Efforts to improve preventive services will require strategies that address the time constraints faced by clinicians.

### Guiding principles for team-based pediatric care [^1154Cvic]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recognizes that children's unique and ever-changing needs depend on a variety of support systems. Key components of effective support systems address the needs of the child and family in the context of their home and community and are dynamic, reflecting, monitoring, and responding to changes as the needs of the child and family evolve. The AAP believes that team-based care involving medical providers and community partners (e.g. teachers and state agencies) is a crucial and necessary component of providing high-quality care to children and their families.

Team-based care builds on the foundation of the medical home by reaching out to a potentially broad array of participants in the life of a child and incorporating them into the care provided. Importantly, the AAP believes that a high-functioning team includes children and their families as essential partners. The overall goal of team-based care is to enhance communication and cooperation among the varied medical, social, and educational partners in a child's life to better meet the global needs of children and their families, helping them achieve their best potential. In support of the team-based approach, the AAP urges stakeholders to invest in infrastructure, education, and privacy-secured technology to meet the needs of children. This statement includes limited specific examples of potential team members, including health care providers and community partners, which are meant to be illustrative and do not represent a complete or comprehensive listing of all team members.

### Universal lipid screening among 9- to 11-year-old children: Screening results and physician management [^114L7JEn]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The NHLBI/AAP guidelines recommend lipid screening for children aged 2 to 8 years with a family history of CVD or dyslipidemia, or for children with diabetes, hypertension, and/or elevated BMI. However, these guidelines had rarely been followed in our clinic population before the study period. Consequently, almost no children had undergone lipid screening before the ages of 9 to 11 years. Therefore, all children aged 9 to 11 years were eligible for inclusion, regardless of previous screening due to family history or medical conditions. Children in this age group who completed lipid screening during the study period were excluded if they presented for another well-child visit within the same period.

Point-of-care testing and in-clinic phlebotomy were unavailable, requiring all children to visit an off-site laboratory for lipid screening. Abnormal non-fasting lipid screens and FLP results were determined based on the NHLBI/AAP guidelines. Pediatricians could order the initial lipid screen as either a non-fasting lipid screen, including non-fasting total cholesterol (TC) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, or a FLP. If the initial non-fasting lipid screen was abnormal, the pediatrician was expected to order a FLP for confirmatory testing. A child was considered to have an abnormal lipid screen if either the initial non-fasting lipid screen or the initial FLP was abnormal. A child was considered to have dyslipidemia if either the confirmatory FLP result or the initial FLP was abnormal.

### Quality of pediatric clinical practice guidelines [^115X1p3t]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

The included clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) achieved a mean score of 4.26 out of 7 points (60.86%) in the overall AGREE II assessment. Only 6.48% of the CPGs reached the "recommend" level, while 69.91% required modifications before reaching the "recommend" level, and 23.61% of the CPGs were not recommended.

- **Clarity of presentation**: This domain achieved the highest mean score of 66.77%.
- **Applicability**: This domain had the poorest mean quality, only achieving a mean score of 21.26%.

CPGs compiled by developed countries or regions and under specific organizations or groups achieved higher scores in different domains. Evidence-based CPGs achieved significantly higher scores across nearly all domains, overall assessment scores (p < 0.001), and recommendation levels (p < 0.001) compared to non-evidence-based CPGs.

The scores of overall CPGs and subgroups are not presented in Table 2. The CPGs that achieved lower recommendation levels were insufficient in "applicability" and "rigor of development".

### Improving delivery of Bright Futures preventive services at the 9- and 24-month well child visit [^117A1muN]. Pediatrics (2015). High credibility.

To determine if clinicians and staff from 21 diverse primary care practice settings could implement the 2008 Bright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents, 3rd edition recommendations, at the 9- and 24-month preventive services visits, a study was conducted.

- **Methods**: Twenty-two practice settings from 15 states were selected from 51 applicants to participate in the Preventive Services Improvement Project (PreSIP). Practices participated in a 9-month modified Breakthrough Series Collaborative from January to November 2011. Outcome measures reflect whether the 17 components of Bright Futures recommendations were performed at the 9- and 24-month visits for at least 85% of visits. Additional measures identified which office systems were in place before and after the collaborative.

- **Results**: There was a statistically significant increase for all 17 measures. Overall, participating practices achieved an 85% completion rate for the preventive services measures except for discussion of parental strengths, which was reported in 70% of the charts. The preventive services score, a summary score for all the chart audit measures, increased significantly for both the 9-month (7 measures) and 24-month visits (8 measures).

- **Conclusions**: Clinicians and staff from various practice settings were able to implement the majority of the Bright Futures recommended preventive services at the 9- and 24-month visits at a high level after participation in a 9-month modified Breakthrough Series collaborative.

### 2017 recommendations for preventive pediatric health care [^117SQv5C]. Pediatrics (2017). High credibility.

The 2017 recommendations for preventive pediatric health care (Periodicity Schedule) have been approved by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and represent a consensus of AAP and the Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule Workgroup. Each child and family is unique; therefore, these recommendations are designed for the care of children who are receiving competent parenting, have no manifestations of any significant health problems, and are growing and developing satisfactorily. Developmental, psychosocial, and chronic disease issues for children and adolescents may require frequent counseling and treatment visits separate from preventive care visits. Additional visits may also become necessary if circumstances suggest deviations from normal.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^114nnd2Q]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for childhood obesity, specifically in the evaluation for comorbidities, the AAP 2023 guidelines recommend eliciting a comprehensive patient history, obtaining mental and behavioral health screening, evaluating social determinants of health, and conducting a physical examination. The following diagnostic studies are advised to evaluate for obesity-related comorbidities in patients aged 2–18 years with overweight or obesity:

- **Dyslipidemia**: Obtain a fasting lipid panel to evaluate for dyslipidemia in adolescent and pediatric patients aged ≥ 10 years with obesity or overweight. Consider evaluating for lipid abnormalities also in patients aged 2–9 years with obesity.

- **Diabetes**: Obtain fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose following a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, or HbA1c to evaluate for abnormal glucose metabolism in adolescent and pediatric patients aged ≥ 10 years with obesity or with overweight in the presence of risk factors for T2DM or MASLD.

- **MASLD**: Obtain an alanine transaminase measurement to evaluate for abnormal liver function in adolescent and pediatric patients aged ≥ 10 years with obesity or with overweight in the presence of risk factors for T2DM or MASLD.

- **Hypertension**: Measure blood pressure at every visit starting at 3 years of age to evaluate for hypertension in pediatric and adolescent patients with overweight and obesity.

### Developmental screening: Is there enough time [^111KCQUh]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine developmental screening in well-child care. Providers cite time restraints as a limitation preventing its widespread adoption. The objectives were to determine whether routine screening lengthened well-visits and was associated with changes in parent satisfaction and report of anticipatory guidance.

- **Methods**: Visits before and after implementation of routine screening were timed. Parents whose children were seen before or after the screening began were contacted to query their perceptions of the visit.

- **Results**: There was no change in visit lengths after the screener was included. With screening, more parents reported their provider talked about their concerns and that their questions were answered. There were no changes in parent satisfaction ratings or reports of anticipatory guidance discussions.

- **Conclusions**: The perceived obstacle that routine screening requires more time than pediatricians have should not prevent its adoption. Screening tools may empower some parents otherwise reluctant to raise concerns unsolicited.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^11291DfP]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of childhood obesity, the AAP 2023 guidelines provide the following recommendations for diagnosing overweight and obesity in pediatric patients aged 2–18 years. The diagnosis is based on BMI and BMI percentiles using age- and sex-specific growth charts:

- **Overweight**: BMI ≥ 85th to < 95th percentile.
- **Obesity**: BMI ≥ 95th percentile.
- **Severe obesity**: BMI ≥ 120% of the 95th percentile for age and sex.

### Ten recommendations for child-friendly visiting policies in critical care [^113K8cut]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

**Recommendation 4: Prepare, accompany, and follow-up the visit of children**: The date for the visit is known to everyone involved; the patient and the room are prepared. A designated person in the medical/care team supervises the entire visit. During the visit, children are respected and supported to do what they are confident in, e.g. touching the loved one, asking questions, chatting, or terminating the visit. After each visit, a short separate debriefing with the children and the team is recommended.

### Quality of reporting and evidence in American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines [^116gyz7t]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The primary objectives were to evaluate the quality of development and reporting of American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines and to determine the level of evidence underlying the recommendations.

- **Methods**: Two reviewers scored each guideline using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE-II) instrument and determined the level of evidence for each recommendation in each guideline. Subgroup analyses compared AAP guidelines published before and after key changes in AAP guideline development policy and compared internal with endorsed guidelines.

- **Results**: For the 28 guidelines, the highest average scores on AGREE-II were in scope and purpose (75%) and clarity of presentation (73%). The lowest average scores were in editorial independence (17%) and applicability (30%). The only domain that improved after AAP policy updates was editorial independence (P = 0.01). Of the 190 treatment recommendations, 43% were based on experimental studies, 30% on observational studies, and 27% on expert opinion or no reference. Compared with early guidelines, late guidelines included a higher proportion of treatment recommendations based on experimental studies (P = 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: There was no clear improvement in the quality of development and reporting of AAP clinical practice guidelines over time. Routine application of AGREE-II to guideline development could enhance guideline quality. The proportion of guideline recommendations based on experimental evidence has increased slightly over time. Pediatric research agendas should be matched more closely with guideline needs.

### Agamree [^11283U1k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Assessments prior to first dose of Agamree**: Administer all immunizations according to immunization guidelines prior to starting Agamree. Administer live-attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting Agamree [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

- **Dosing information**: The recommended dosage of Agamree is 6 mg/kg taken orally once daily, preferably with a meal, up to a maximum daily dosage of 300 mg for patients weighing more than 50 kg. Some patients may respond to a dose of 2 mg/kg daily. Doses may be titrated down to 2 mg/kg/day as needed, based on individual tolerability.

- **Recommended dosage for hepatic impairment**: The recommended dosage of Agamree in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) to moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment is 2 mg/kg taken orally once daily, preferably with a meal, up to a maximum daily dosage of 100 mg for patients weighing more than 50 kg [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Doses may be titrated down based on individual tolerability.

- **Important preparation and administration instructions**: Shake Agamree oral suspension well for about 30 seconds before administration. Use only the oral syringe provided with the product. After withdrawing the appropriate dose into the oral syringe, dispense directly into the mouth. Discard any unused Agamree oral suspension remaining after 3 months of first opening the bottle.

- **Switching from corticosteroid treatment to Agamree**: Patients can be switched from oral corticosteroid treatment (such as prednisone or deflazacort) to Agamree.

### The role of well-child visits in detecting developmental delay in preschool children [^113JsVhf]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Developmental delay (DD) is one of the most frequent disorders in early childhood, with a prevalence of about 15%. Children with DD may suffer from a variety of impairments that are likely to develop into multiple chronic and lifelong conditions, including intellectual disability, speech problems, socio-communicative deficits, sensory impairments, other physical complications, and behavioral and emotional disorders. A wide body of literature underlines the importance of early identification of affected children in order to counsel parents, enable diagnostic work-up, and initiate appropriate therapeutic support for infants with or at risk of DD. Children diagnosed with DD have better health and educational outcomes if detected and treated at younger ages. Therefore, intervening early offers substantial long-term advantages and economic benefits for society. Children who participate in a developmental screening program are more likely to be identified with DD, referred to early intervention (EI), and eligible for EI services in a timelier fashion than children who received surveillance alone. However, despite improvements in rates of developmental screening, referral rates of children with developmental concerns to medical and developmental professionals and for initiation of developmental intervention remain low.

One important opportunity for detecting developmental delays, as well as sensory impairments and behavioral problems early, are well-child visits, which involve systematic assessment of a child. Guidelines from pediatric and family practitioners' associations emphasize the importance of these assessments.

### Adherence to pediatric screening [^117Lvc7p]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

The study examined the prevalence (95% CI) of receiving various health measurements per 100 eligible well-child visits, focusing on (A) BMI, (B) BP, (C) lipids, and (D) blood glucose under both universal age-based and risk-based screening guidelines (CAPRICORN EHR 2010–2018).

Key points include:

- Open circles represent universal age-based screening
- "X" denotes risk-based screening
- Horizontal bars indicate 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated using generalized estimating equations (GEE) models with an exchangeable working correlation structure

The prevalence per 100 of receiving a BMI measurement varied by age (P < 0.001), although it did not increase linearly with age (P = 0.070). Similarly, the prevalence per 100 of receiving a BP measurement differed by age (P < 0.001) but did not increase linearly with age (P = 0.415).

Eligible sample sizes for BMI screening:

- **Ages 2–6**: 27,937 visits (age 2), 23,266 visits (age 3), 22,633 visits (age 4), 20,778 visits (age 5), 14,711 visits (age 6)
- **Ages 7–9**: 13,957 visits (age 7), 13,371 visits (age 8), 12,996 visits (age 9)
- **Ages 10–12**: 13,901 visits (age 10), 19,545 visits (age 11), 14,464 visits (age 12)

Eligible sample sizes for BP screening:

- **Age 2**: 1,350 visits
- **Ages 3–6**: 23,266 visits (age 3), 22,633 visits (age 4), 20,778 visits (age 5), 14,711 visits (age 6)
- **Ages 7–9**: 13,957 visits (age 7), 13,371 visits (age 8), 12,996 visits (age 9)
- **Ages 10–12**: 13,901 visits (age 10), 19,545 visits (age 11), 14,464 visits (age 12)

The data illustrates significant variability in screening practices across different age groups.

### Well-child care clinical practice redesign for serving low-income children [^112eDXXq]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Our objective was to conduct a rigorous, structured process to create a new model of well-child care (WCC) in collaboration with a multisite community health center and two small, independent practices serving predominantly Medicaid-insured children. Working groups of clinicians, staff, and parents, called "Community Advisory Boards" (CABs), used perspectives of WCC stakeholders and a literature review of WCC practice redesign to create four comprehensive WCC models for children ages 0 to 3 years. An expert panel, following a modified version of the Rand/UCLA Appropriateness Method, rated each model for potential effectiveness on four domains: receipt of recommended services, family-centeredness, timely and appropriate follow-up, and feasibility and efficiency. Results were provided to the CABs for the selection of a final model to implement.

The newly developed models rely heavily on a health educator for anticipatory guidance and developmental, behavioral, and psychosocial surveillance and screening. Each model allots a small amount of time with the pediatrician to perform a brief physical examination and to address parents' physical health concerns. A secure web-based tool customizes the visit to parents' needs and facilitates previsit screening. Scheduled, non-face-to-face methods, such as text and phone communications, for parent interaction with the health care team are also critical to these new models of care. A structured process that engages small community practices and community health centers in clinical practice redesign can produce comprehensive, site-specific, and innovative solutions.

### USPSTF perspective on evidence-based preventive recommendations for children [^115QDara]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

The development and use of evidence-based recommendations for preventive care by primary care providers caring for children is an ongoing challenge. This issue is further complicated by the fact that a higher proportion of recommendations by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for pediatric preventive services, in comparison with adult services, have insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the service. One important root cause for this problem is the relative lack of high-quality screening and counseling studies in pediatric primary care settings. The paucity of studies limits the development of additional evidence-based guidelines to enhance best practices for pediatric and adolescent conditions.

In this article, we describe the following:

- **Evidence-based primary care preventive services**: As a strategy for addressing important pediatric morbidities.
- **The process of making evidence-based screening recommendations by the USPSTF**
- **The library of USPSTF recommendations for children and adolescents**
- **Factors influencing the use of USPSTF recommendations and other evidence-based guidelines**: By clinicians.

Strategies to accelerate the implementation of evidence-based services and areas of need for future research to fill key gaps in evidence-based recommendations and guidelines are highlighted.

### Pediatrician and parental evaluation of child neurodevelopment at 2 years of age [^116wxFTX]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

For the pediatric assessment, family practitioners (FPs), in addition to routine questions on physical growth and health care checks, fill in the CDC's Learn the Signs, Act Early Milestones (LTSAE) Checklist at two years. This checklist was adapted from the American Academy of Pediatrics' Bright Futures Developmental Milestones checklist. To adhere to the Istituto Superiore di Sanità (Italian National Institute of Health – ISS) recommendations, four additional questions (included in the 18–24 months checklist) were incorporated into the CDC checklist:

1. The child walks alone and kicks the ball or another object
2. The child gets off the ground without support
3. The child holds a pencil or a stick and scribbles on paper or the ground/floor
4. When the child is denied something and/or exhibits reactions of frustration, he can usually be calmed down quickly

Moreover, two additional questions regarding the child's development were included. The first question investigated the loss of competencies compared to the previous assessment, while the second focused on the detection of hyperactivity signs by the FP.

FPs identified toddlers as "positive" for high risk if the total number of items that failed during the FP's assessment was eight or more. This cutoff was defined by classifying scores in percentiles and considering the ones above the 95th percentile as a warning sign.

For the parental assessment, parents completed the "Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised" (M-CHAT-R), a screening tool for the early detection of warning signs in children, validated in Italian by Salomone, Cecil, and Muratori (2014).

### A children's book for emergent literacy screening during well-child visits [^112zqNBQ]. Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends literacy promotion and developmental assessment during well-child visits. Emergent literacy skills are well defined, and the use of early screening has the potential to identify children at risk for reading difficulties and guide intervention before kindergarten.

- **Methods**: The Reading House (TRH) is a children's book designed to screen emergent literacy skills. These are assessed by sharing the book with the child and using a 9-item, scripted scoring form. Get Ready to Read! (GRTR) is a validated measure shown to predict reading outcomes. TRH and GRTR were administered in random order to 278 children (mean: 43.1 ± 5.6 months; 125 boys, 153 girls) during well-child visits at seven primary care sites. Parent, child, and provider impressions of TRH were also assessed. Analyses included Rasch methods, Spearman-ρ correlations, and logistic regression, including covariates age, sex, and clinic type.

- **Results**: Psychometric properties were strong, including item difficulty and reliability. Internal consistency was good for new measures (rCo-α = 0.68). The mean TRH score was 4.2 (± 2.9; range: 0–14), and mean GRTR was 11.1 (± 4.4; range: 1–25). TRH scores were positively correlated with GRTR scores (rs = 0.66; high), female sex, private practice, and child age (P < .001). The relationship remained significant controlling for these covariates (P < .05). The mean TRH administration time was 5:25 minutes (± 0:55; range: 3:34–8:32). Parent, child, and provider impressions of TRH were favorable.

- **Conclusions**: TRH is feasible and valid for use in identifying emergent literacy skills during well-child visits.

### Effectiveness of targeted anticipatory guidance during well-child visits: A pilot trial [^1142uo6s]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Anticipatory guidance, an important function of well-child visits, is often brief and not tailored to parents' concerns. This targeted pilot trial evaluated a new method of anticipatory guidance.

- **Methods**: Using an experimental/control study design, we surveyed 137 parents and 31 physicians, comparing their responses to targeted anticipatory guidance (physician-provided education based on parents' concerns) versus usual anticipatory guidance (standard physician lecture on parenting, safety, and nutritional topics).

- **Results**: Overall, physicians appeared less satisfied than parents with the educational component of well-child visits, and they desired changes in the educational aspect of these visits. While physicians believed the targeted approach was easier, control group parents appeared more satisfied with usual anticipatory guidance. The number of anticipatory guidance topics covered in the control group was less than half of that covered in the experimental group.

- **Conclusions**: Our targeted method of anticipatory guidance during well-child visits covered more educational topics and resulted in visits that were easier for physicians, but less satisfactory for parents. Further research is needed to identify methods of anticipatory guidance that are effective and satisfactory for both parents and physicians.

### Effectiveness of compliance with pediatric preventive care guidelines among Medicaid beneficiaries [^1163PY61]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the association between adherence to prevailing guidelines for periodic health supervision and adverse health outcomes, as indicated by the incidence of avoidable hospitalizations. This was due to a lack of confirmed research linking compliance with health supervision in infancy to improved health outcomes.

- **Methods**: This was a historic cohort study of 308,131 children enrolled in Medicaid at birth in California, Georgia, and Michigan in 1990, using Medicaid records linked across three years. We used avoidable hospitalizations as indicators of health in a survival analysis. The analysis used variables representing the completeness and timeliness of well-child visits and immunizations, using AAP guidelines for health supervision as the gold standard.

- **Results**: When the children in this cohort were up-to-date for age on their schedule of well-child visits, they were less likely to have an avoidable hospitalization (race, illness, and level of poverty-adjusted hazard ratios: 0.52 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50–0.55] in California, 0.54 [95% CI: 0.50–0.55] in Georgia, and 0.70 [95% CI: 0.69–0.79] in Michigan). Among children who were not up-to-date with well-child visits, a sporadic preventive care visit conferred a mild benefit. Immunizations and race/ethnicity had no consistent relationship with the incidence of avoidable hospitalizations.

- **Conclusions**: A series of well-child visits maintained during the first two years of life has a positive effect on health outcomes, as indicated by a decrease in avoidable hospitalizations among poor and near-poor children.

### Assessing health system provision of well-child care: The Promoting Healthy Development Survey [^111MfjtX]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Preventive care guidelines for children include parent education and counseling, developmental assessment, and screening for psychosocial and safety risks. Health care providers are in a unique position to identify and follow up on potential problems and to influence parenting knowledge, attitudes, and behavior to ensure the healthy development of young children. Few quality measures are available to assess health care system performance in this important area.

- **Objective**: To develop a feasible, valid, and reliable methodology for evaluating health care system performance in providing family-centered anticipatory guidance and child and family assessment services for children from birth through 48 months old.

- **Methods**: The Promoting Healthy Development Survey (PHDS) was developed and tested with a diverse group of families in three managed care organizations (n = 1478). A standard mail administration protocol was used, including an informed consent with a waiver of documentation, two mailings, a postcard reminder, and telephone reminders. The 36-item parent survey assesses whether health care providers (1) talk with parents about topics recommended in Bright Futures and the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for health supervision, (2) provide follow-up for children who may be at risk for developmental problems, and (3) address psychosocial well-being and safety within the family. The PHDS also assesses the degree to which parent interactions with providers are family-centered, helpful, and facilitate parental confidence.

### Detection of postpartum depressive symptoms by screening at well-child visits [^115Vdie4]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

To assess the feasibility of universal postpartum depression screening during well-child visits in the first year of life, the prevalence of postpartum depressive symptoms among mothers attending these visits was evaluated. This assessment also focused on the detection of postpartum depressive symptoms in a pediatric clinic before and after implementing universal screening at each first-year well-child visit, alongside social work referrals before and after universal screening.

- **Methods**: The practice instituted universal screening for postpartum depressive symptoms during first-year well-child visits using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Researchers randomly selected 110 infant medical records before (cohort 1) and 110 after (cohort 2) screening was initiated. Measures included demographics, notation of depression or depressive symptoms in well-child visit notes, and referrals for depression. EPDS scores were collected for cohort 2 only. Comparisons before and after were made for the detection of depression or depressive symptoms and mental health referrals.

- **Results**: The EPDS was included in the medical record in 46% of well-child visits, with 88% of these forms being completed. Twenty-one percent of completed EPDS forms had scores ≥ 10, and 27% of women who completed the EPDS scored ≥ 10 at some point during the postpartum year. There was a significant increase in documentation of depressive symptoms with the EPDS following the initiation of universal screening (1.6% of visits for cohort 1 vs. 8.5% for cohort 2). Social work referrals for mental health reasons increased significantly.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^115pzUAP]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

The 2023 guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) emphasize the importance of medical management for childhood obesity. They specifically recommend obtaining an initial and longitudinal assessment of individual, structural, and contextual risk factors. This approach allows for individualized and tailored treatment plans for pediatric and adolescent patients dealing with overweight and obesity.

### Quality of pediatric clinical practice guidelines [^112Qn8fn]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Several studies have suggested that clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) developed in regions with differing levels of economic development may influence the quality of those guidelines. This study also found that CPGs from developing countries or regions often had poorer quality, particularly in domains related to "scope and purpose", "stakeholder involvement", "applicability", and "editorial independence". Furthermore, many CPGs from these regions did not adhere to a strict and comprehensive development procedure, and some failed to employ evidence-based methods, impacting their overall quality.

In contrast, most high-quality CPGs were developed by countries or organizations with significant funding and resources. A previous study indicated that the American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) internal CPGs had significantly higher total scores compared to endorsed CPGs. These high-quality CPGs were created using a rigorously completed, evidence-based development procedure. Additionally, the CPG committees included clinical experts, methodologists, and other professionals from various fields, which enhanced rigor in development and applicability in practice.

For resource-limited developing countries, assembling a complete expert group for CPG development can be challenging. One potential solution for these regions is to adapt existing high-quality CPGs. Furthermore, international collaboration could be a viable strategy for developing CPGs. However, given the nuances in healthcare systems worldwide, agencies should consider adjustments to accommodate local conditions, which might preclude the direct implementation of international CPGs.

### Quality of pediatric clinical practice guidelines [^113t6e4q]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

The present study had several limitations. Firstly, because the primary purpose was to evaluate the quality of recent pediatric clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), we only assessed CPGs published in the past three years, limiting the evaluation of changes in the quality over time. Additionally, only English-language CPGs were included; therefore, further research should analyze CPGs in different languages when possible.

The AGREE II assessment relied on personal judgment by reviewers, which might introduce selection bias. To counter this, we conducted strict training and test assessment procedures. A re-assessment procedure was also performed to reduce selection bias. Furthermore, AGREE II has inherent limitations. AGREE II scores depend on reporting, and some CPG committees may comply with requirements but do not report. AGREE II focuses on the quality of developing and reporting procedures but does not evaluate the evidence behind the recommendations. Therefore, AGREE II alone is not sufficient to ensure that CPG recommendations are appropriate and accurate. Several studies suggested that a new version of AGREE, with an evaluation of CPG content, should be proposed. This would require significant effort and collaboration.

We recommend that healthcare providers closely follow new versions of well-developed tools for CPG appraisal. Before the release of such tools, healthcare providers should assess CPG quality using tools like AGREE II and evaluate CPG content and local adaptations before implementing recommendations.
