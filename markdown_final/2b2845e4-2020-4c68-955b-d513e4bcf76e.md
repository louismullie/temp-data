## Question

Serum tumor markers for bladder cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about serum tumor markers in bladder cancer, including their current status, performance, and guideline-backed recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why serum markers are attractive yet challenging. Then, I should verify which serum markers have credible evidence and what their diagnostic or prognostic performance looks like. Next, I will examine guideline positions on serum markers, including ctDNA, and clarify where they fit or do not fit. After that, I should compare serum markers with urinary markers and cystoscopy to avoid overpromising. Finally, I will synthesize practical, risk-stratified recommendations and note ongoing research that could change practice soon.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the unmet need. Bladder cancer surveillance is intensive and costly due to high recurrence, and cystoscopy remains the diagnostic cornerstone; serum-based tests are attractive because they are noninvasive and could theoretically reduce cystoscopic burden, but to date no serum marker has displaced cystoscopy or cytology in routine care, and guidelines remain cautious about adopting unproven biomarkers into algorithms [^1124KNXJ] [^111QDxqG] [^112JZZ7h].

> I will now examine which serum markers have the most credible signals, starting with circulating tumor DNA. Wait, let me verify the guideline stance: NCCN acknowledges that ultrasensitive ctDNA assays may track response and progression in advanced disease and may have prognostic value after cystectomy, but explicitly states there are insufficient data to use ctDNA to alter surveillance or discontinue therapy, and routine somatic testing in MIBC is not recommended unless it enables trial enrollment; EAU similarly finds insufficient evidence to support molecular diagnostics broadly in urothelial cancer management, reinforcing that ctDNA remains investigational for decision-making outside trials [^1126AiFj] [^1115qt6S] [^115wgnid] [^116tpCBs] [^115hrwGG] [^114aYEWt].

> Next, I should review conventional serum tumor markers. CYFRA 21–1 shows a marked stage gradient with low positivity in locally invasive disease and higher positivity in metastatic disease, and in a metastatic cohort it tracked chemotherapy response; however, its low sensitivity in earlier stages limits diagnostic utility and it is not recommended for screening or routine surveillance, so I need to be careful not to overinterpret isolated signals in advanced cohorts [^114tv25F]. CA 19–9 and CA-125 have been linked to extravesical and nodal disease in pre-cystectomy cohorts, with CA-125 showing particularly strong odds ratios for predicting extravesical and node-positive disease; but again, these are not validated for routine staging or surveillance and should be viewed as exploratory adjuncts rather than standards of care [^111npCCe]. DR-70, a fibrin-degradation product assay, has reported sensitivity around 73% and specificity around 67% at a 1 U/mL cutoff, suggesting moderate performance that does not meet the thresholds to replace cystoscopy or cytology in practice [^112JonfW]. LDH has prognostic associations with worse outcomes in bladder cancer cohorts, but it is nonspecific and better framed as a general prognostic marker rather than a bladder-specific diagnostic tool [^114kwxNL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about serum proteomics. MALDI-TOF serum protein pattern studies have reported high sensitivity and specificity in small cohorts, but these exploratory platforms lack external validation, standardization, and regulatory-grade assays; thus, they remain promising research tools rather than clinically actionable tests today [^113F8gdU].

> I need to check inflammatory and angiogenic serum markers as well. CRP has repeatedly shown independent prognostic value in invasive urothelial carcinoma, and serum VEGF correlates with stage and metastasis with high discrimination for metastatic disease in small studies; however, these associations have not translated into guideline-endorsed management changes, so they should be interpreted as prognostic signals rather than validated decision biomarkers [^111u7R5q] [^112eGX8H].

> Let me consider circulating miRNAs briefly. Downregulation of miR-99a has been reported in plasma and tissues, supporting the biological plausibility of serum miRNAs as disease signatures, but the evidence base is early and heterogeneous, so these remain investigational and not ready for clinical adoption [^112zUGf9] [^113KBfK4].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my conclusions align with standards. NCCN emphasizes that prognostic biomarkers may inform risk discussions but should not replace cystoscopy; ctDNA can be considered for tracking in advanced disease but should not be used to alter or stop therapy; routine somatic testing in MIBC is discouraged unless for trial eligibility; and for NMIBC, urinary biomarkers may be considered in select scenarios but should not replace cystoscopic surveillance, which remains mandatory at guideline-recommended intervals [^1124KNXJ] [^1126AiFj] [^1115qt6S] [^115hrwGG] [^112hieJa] [^111QDxqG]. AUA/SUO similarly advises against substituting urinary biomarkers for cystoscopy in NMIBC surveillance, underscoring that no serum marker has cleared that bar either [^115cDYVU] [^112MYiZ1]. EAU notes insufficient evidence for molecular diagnostics broadly in urothelial cancer management, aligning with a conservative stance on serum-based molecular tests [^111RngrD] [^114aYEWt].

> I should double-check the comparative landscape with urinary markers to avoid overstating serum advantages. Urine-based assays like BTA-stat and NMP22 have modest sensitivity and specificity and are not replacements for cystoscopy; multiplex and proteomic urine panels are under active study but still require prospective validation before routine use, reinforcing that serum markers face an even steeper evidentiary climb given lower analyte concentrations and biological noise in blood [^115eZzqF] [^112BXkBc] [^116DfcBk] [^116drLDG].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations by risk and scenario. For low-risk NMIBC, do not obtain routine serum tumor markers; surveillance should be cystoscopy-based with guideline-concordant intervals, and urinary cytology or biomarkers are not recommended routinely either [^112Rqt71] [^112JZZ7h]. For intermediate- to high-risk NMIBC, cystoscopy with adjunct cytology remains standard; urinary urothelial tumor markers may be considered in select contexts but should not replace cystoscopy, and there is no validated role for serum markers in this setting [^112hieJa] [^117Mvvjq]. For MIBC, serum markers like CYFRA 21–1, CA-125, or CA 19–9 may be obtained for prognostic context or clinical suspicion of advanced disease, but they should not guide surgical decisions or systemic therapy selection outside of a trial; somatic tumor testing is reserved for unresectable/metastatic disease to inform targeted therapy or trial options, and ctDNA can be tracked in trials but not used to modify or stop therapy based on clearance alone [^1147cUvq] [^116tpCBs] [^1126AiFj] [^1115qt6S]. For post-cystectomy surveillance, no serum marker is validated to direct surveillance intensity, and routine laboratory surveillance should focus on renal function and nutritional parameters rather than unproven tumor markers [^113w3jDN].

> But wait, what about emerging directions that could change this soon. Ultrasensitive ctDNA assays, multi-analyte serum proteomic panels, and integrated circulating biomarker strategies are under active investigation; NCCN explicitly calls for randomized trials to test whether biomarker-informed management changes improve outcomes, which is the critical missing link before serum markers can move from prognostic curiosity to predictive tools that alter care [^1126AiFj] [^1124KNXJ] [^117HDbCL].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and guideline-concordant. Currently, there are no serum tumor markers validated to replace cystoscopy or cytology for bladder cancer diagnosis or surveillance; ctDNA shows promise for tracking in advanced disease but should not be used to change therapy outside trials; conventional serum markers like CYFRA 21–1, CA-125, CA 19–9, DR-70, LDH, CRP, and VEGF may carry prognostic information in selected contexts but lack the sensitivity, specificity, and prospective validation required for routine clinical decision-making, so management should continue to follow cystoscopy-based algorithms with biomarkers, if used, as adjuncts within trials or carefully selected scenarios [^1124KNXJ] [^111QDxqG] [^115cDYVU].

Serum tumor markers are **not recommended for routine diagnosis or surveillance** of bladder cancer due to limited sensitivity and specificity [^112JonfW] [^1167Q7K3]. The most studied serum markers — CEA, CA 125, CA 19–9, CYFRA 21–1, and DR-70 — may show elevated levels in advanced disease but are **not reliable for early detection or surveillance** [^114tv25F] [^111npCCe]. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is promising for prognosis and treatment monitoring in advanced disease, but it is not yet validated to guide management decisions [^1126AiFj] [^115wgnid]. Current guidelines emphasize cystoscopy and urine cytology as the gold standard, with serum markers reserved for research or select clinical scenarios [^111QDxqG] [^115cDYVU].

## Commonly studied serum tumor markers

Several serum tumor markers have been investigated in bladder cancer, including:

| **Marker** | **Description** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|
| CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) | Glycoprotein elevated in gastrointestinal and other cancers | Limited sensitivity/specificity; not for routine use [^notfound] |
| CA 125 (cancer antigen 125) | Mucin glycoprotein elevated in ovarian and other cancers | Limited utility; may correlate with advanced disease [^111npCCe] |
| CA 19–9 (carbohydrate antigen 19–9) | Lewis antigen elevated in gastrointestinal cancers | Limited utility; may correlate with advanced disease [^111npCCe] |
| CYFRA 21–1 (cytokeratin 19 fragment) | Cytokeratin fragment elevated in lung and other cancers | Moderate utility in advanced disease; not for early detection [^114tv25F] |
| DR-70 (fibrin degradation products) | Marker of coagulation/fibrinolysis activation | Moderate sensitivity/specificity; investigational [^112JonfW] |

---

## Clinical utility and limitations

Serum tumor markers for bladder cancer have **significant limitations**:

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: Most markers have low sensitivity and specificity, limiting their utility for early detection and surveillance [^112JonfW] [^1167Q7K3].
- **Advanced disease correlation**: Markers like CYFRA 21–1, CA 125, and CA 19–9 may be elevated in advanced or metastatic disease but are not reliable for early-stage detection [^114tv25F] [^111npCCe].
- **Lack of standardization**: Variability in assay methods and lack of standardized cutoffs hinder clinical adoption [^115dAhUx].

---

## Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)

ctDNA has emerged as a promising biomarker for bladder cancer. It offers **real-time insights** into tumor burden and treatment response. Clinical utility includes potential prognostic value in advanced disease and post-cystectomy settings, and it may track treatment response and disease progression. However, it is not yet validated to guide management decisions, and further research is needed [^1126AiFj] [^115wgnid].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the following:

- **Cystoscopy and cytology**: Cystoscopy with urine cytology remains the gold standard for diagnosis and surveillance [^113251Qs].
- **Limited role of serum markers**: Serum tumor markers are not recommended for routine clinical practice due to limited evidence supporting their utility [^notfound].
- **Research and clinical trials**: Serum markers, including ctDNA, may be considered in research settings or clinical trials, but not for routine clinical decision-making [^1126AiFj] [^115wgnid].

---

## Future directions and ongoing research

Ongoing research focuses on **improving sensitivity and specificity** of serum markers through multiplex assays and novel biomarkers, integrating serum markers with other clinical and molecular data for personalized medicine, and validating ctDNA assays in larger prospective studies to guide clinical decisions [^1115qt6S] [^113F8gdU].

---

Serum tumor markers are **not recommended for routine diagnosis or surveillance** of bladder cancer due to limited sensitivity and specificity. ctDNA shows promise but requires further validation. Cystoscopy and urine cytology remain the gold standard for clinical management [^112JonfW] [^1115qt6S] [^113251Qs].

The hallmark of precision medicine involves tailoring the treatment to the patient and/or tumor-specific biomarkers. Candidate biomarkers in bladder cancer are abundant, but few have been validated in clinical practice. Significant obstacles to precision medicine in bladder cancer include the limited predictive value of candidate biomarkers, lack of standardization in biomarker assessment, heterogeneity in biomarker expression and function, and limited insight into the biologic factors that influence biomarker expression and predictive capacity. This review summarizes key biomarkers explored in bladder cancer and outlines innovative trial designs to approach these obstacles.

### The detection of genetic markers of bladder cancer in urine and serum [^1136HdMN]. Current Opinion in Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the most recent publications focusing on the use of genetic markers (DNA, RNA and nucleosides) in urine and serum and provide an opinion on their potential utility for screening, diagnosis and prognosis of urothelial carcinoma.

Recent Findings

Several studies have shown the diagnostic utility of urine tests based on improved microsatellite analysis of loss-of-heterozygosity, detection of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 mutations, detection of single RNA and multiple gene signatures as well as nucleoside profiles. Although of interest, all these studies lack appropriate controls and validation before being considered as serious candidate clinical biomarkers. The presence of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 mutations in tumors was identified as a hallmark of tumors of low malignant potential. Serum DNA analysis of hypermethylation of a set of genes shows promise as an indicator of cancer progression and mortality. Finally, a case-control study of 775 patients and 397 controls showed that DNA hypomethylation of blood cells combined with smoking habits can provide stratification of cancer risk that may be very helpful in conceiving bladder cancer screening studies.

Summary

The challenge is not so much to identify better markers or methods but rather to commit to implementing them into clinical practice by stimulating and funding the clinical trials required.

### Urinary markers / cytology: what and when should a urologist use [^115gx9KN]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

As of 2012, bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer afflicting men and ninth most common cancer in women. Nearly 80% of all bladder cancer diagnoses are non-muscle invasive at presentation, most of whom will develop recurrent disease within 5 years of initial diagnosis. Urinary tumor markers provide a noninvasive method for both screening and surveillance of bladder cancer. This article reviews the current Food and Drug Administration-approved urinary biomarkers for detection of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.

### Inflammatory biomarkers and bladder cancer prognosis: a systematic review [^111u7R5q]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Host immune response has an impact on tumour development and progression. There is interest in the use of inflammatory biomarkers (InfBMs) in cancer care. Although several studies assessing the potential prognostic value of InfBMs in cancer have been published in the past decades, they have had no impact on the management of patients with urothelial bladder carcinoma (UBC).

Objective

To review and summarise the scientific literature on the prognostic value of tumour, serum, urine, and germline DNA InfBMs on UBC.

Evidence Acquisition

A systematic review of the literature was performed searching the Medline and Embase databases for original articles published between January 1975 and November 2013. The main inclusion criterion was the provision of a survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier and/or Cox) according to the Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies guidelines for the assessment of prognostic markers. We focused on markers assessed at least twice in the literature. Findings are reported following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines.

Evidence Synthesis

Overall, 34 publications, mostly retrospective, fulfilled the main inclusion criterion. Main limitations of these studies were missing relevant information about design or analysis and heterogeneous methodology used. Inflammatory cells, costimulatory molecules in tumour cells, and serum cytokines showed prognostic significance, mainly in univariable analyses. High C-reactive protein values were consistently reported as an independent prognostic factor for mortality in invasive UBC.

Conclusions

There is a dearth of studies on InfBMs in UBC compared with other tumour types. Evidence suggests that InfBMs may have an impact on the management of patients with UBC. Currently, methodological drawbacks of the studies limit the translational potential of results.

Patient Summary

In this review, we analysed studies evaluating the impact of inflammatory response on bladder cancer progression. Despite methodological limitations, some inflammatory biomarkers should be further analysed because they hold promise to improve patient care.

### Monitoring high-risk bladder cancer [^114DQFfc]. Current Opinion in Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Monitoring high-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is challenging since currently used clinical and pathological risk parameters are not accurate enough to address the individual risk of progression.

Recent Findings

In NMIBC, the use of urinary interleukin-2 and fluorescence in-situ hybridization predicts response to bacille-calmette-guerin treatment. In both NMIBC and MIBC, the detection of circulating tumor cells at initial diagnosis allows improved monitoring since its presence is associated with higher tumor stages, concomitant carcinoma in situ and shorter time to recurrence. Molecular urine markers, such as fluorescence-in-situ hybridization, help to identify high-risk cases early on. In MIBC, serum C-reactive protein and thrombocytosis have been recently incorporated into basic prognostic models and demonstrated an increase in the predictive accuracy of standard pathological risk factors.

Summary

New serological and urine-based markers have been identified for monitoring high-risk bladder cancer, and demand incorporation into established clinicopathological risk models to tailor surveillance regimens and provide improved prognostication for the need of adjuvant treatment.

### Serum proteomic profiling in patients with bladder cancer [^113F8gdU]. European Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Despite continuing research for accurate bladder cancer biomarkers, the analytes suffer from lack of sensitivity and specificity.

Objective

To search for discriminating protein patterns in serum, we used magnetic bead-based separation followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) to identify patients with bladder cancer.

Design, Setting and Participants

In total, serum samples from 105 patients with bladder cancer, 98 healthy controls, and 45 prostate cancer patients were included in this study.

Measurements

Serum samples were fractionated by means of surface-activated magnetic beads and were subsequently analyzed with MALDI-TOF MS. Multidimensional data analysis was done to generate algorithms capable of distinguishing between cancer patients and healthy individuals. The algorithms were trained using a training set of 41 bladder cancer patients and 39 healthy controls and were validated with an independent test set of 64 bladder cancer patients and 59 healthy controls. Additionally, 45 prostate cancer samples were used as a third test set.

Results and Limitations

In the training set, patients with bladder cancer could be identified with an overall sensitivity of 94.1% and specificity of 89.2%. Similar results could be achieved for the test set, showing 96.4% sensitivity and 86.5% specificity. Even the presence of low-stage tumors could be predicted with 96% sensitivity and could be distinguished from higher stage or grade tumors with a sensitivity of 77.3%. Distinction between other tumor stages, however, resulted in lower sensitivity values.

Conclusions

These findings demonstrate that screening for serum protein patterns using MALDI-TOF MS shows high sensitivity and specificity in identifying patients with bladder cancer, regardless of tumor stage. Due to high-throughput capability, the identified differential protein panel may improve the detection of bladder cancer.

### DNA alterations in body fluids as molecular tumor markers for urological malignancies [^117UZrKG]. European Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

DNA-based tumor markers are characterized by unique specificity rendering them an attractive target for molecular diagnosis of cancer in body fluids like blood serum/plasma and urine. Both cell-free tumor DNA circulating in plasma/serum and cellular tumor DNA are detectable by minimally invasive measures.

Methods

Three main detection methods, microsatellite analysis, mutation analysis in genomic or mitochondrial DNA and gene promoter hypermethylation analysis are applied. Detection of gene promoter hypermethylation by methylation-specific PCR enables the best methodical sensitivity requiring a ratio of tumor DNA within normal DNA of less than 1:1000.

Results/Conclusions

Tumor DNA derived from renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer or prostate cancer is detectable in considerably more than 50% of plasma/serum samples and more than 70% of urine samples from these patients. Because the targeted DNA alterations are absent or very rare in controls, the specificity of DNA-based tumor detection methods reaches almost 100%. Although the methodology currently is experimental, automatization will make it easier and less expensive. This review is focused on the potential clinical value of DNA-based analysis of body fluids for the initial diagnosis and the follow-up of urologic cancer patients.

### Treatment of non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer: AUA / ASCO / SUO guideline (2017; amended 2020, 2024) [^114ckEy9]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Future directions — detection and markers: Improved imaging modalities are needed to better locally stage tumors and define extent of disease, including cystoscopic and radiographic imaging of local disease and more effective and accurate evaluation techniques of regional lymphatics and distant sites; the role of MRI, vesical imaging-reporting and data system (VI-RADS) for local staging, defining the role of PET imaging and the best PET imaging agent, and investigation/validation of novel technologies are high priorities. Urine cytology can monitor for recurrence after TURBT and cystectomy but its usefulness after bladder removal is limited by interpretation difficulties after urinary diversion; radiation therapy can alter shed cell appearance and produce atypical results, and current urinary markers have a limited role after radical cystectomy due to false positive rate. Future studies should focus on developing urinary and serum-based markers to identify early urothelial based and/or distant recurrences.

### Bladder tumor markers beyond cytology: international consensus panel on bladder tumor markers [^1112UCMz]. Urology (2005). Low credibility.

This is the first of 2 articles that summarize the findings of the International Consensus Panel on cytology and bladder tumor markers. The objectives of our panel were to reach a consensus on the areas where markers are needed, to define the attributes of an ideal tumor marker, and to identify which marker(s) would be suitable for diagnosis and/or surveillance of bladder cancer. Our panel consisted of urologists and researchers from Europe, Asia, and the United States who reviewed original articles, reviews, and book chapters on individual bladder tumor markers published in the English language mainly using the PubMed search engine. Panel members also met during 3 international meetings to write recommendations regarding bladder tumor markers. The panel found that the most practical use of noninvasive tests is to monitor bladder cancer recurrence, thereby reducing the number of surveillance cystoscopies performed each year. Markers also may be useful in the screening of high-risk individuals for early detection of bladder cancer. However, more prospective studies are needed to strengthen this argument. Case-control and cohort studies show that several markers have a higher sensitivity to detect bladder cancer. However, cytology is the superior marker in terms of specificity, although some markers in limited numbers of studies have shown specificity equivalent to that of cytology. Our panel believes that several bladder tumor markers are more accurate in detecting bladder cancer than prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is in detecting prostate cancer. However, bladder tumor markers are held to a higher standard than PSA. Therefore, use of bladder tumor markers in the management of patients with bladder cancer will require the willingness of both urologists and clinicians to accept them.

### Developing biomarkers for improved diagnosis and treatment outcome monitoring of bladder cancer [^117W4Tqe]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Importance Of The Field

A non-invasive marker for the follow-up and diagnosis of bladder cancer is highly needed. Several markers have been studied with regard to sensitivity and specificity in detecting bladder cancer. Comparison of studies is complicated by limited data on tumor characteristics and treatment details. Many studies do not differentiate between primary and recurrent tumors, nor is the performance of the studied marker assessed separately in superficial and invasive or high- versus low-grade tumors.

Areas Covered In This Review

The field of bladder cancer biomarker research from the past 15 years. WHAT THE READER GAIN: A summary of the current field of bladder biomarker research with concluding remarks on some specific challenges in developing biomarkers for improved diagnosis and monitoring the disease.

Take Home Message

In general, the best new markers give higher sensitivity than urinary cytology, but specificity is usually lower. By using new markers, the intervals between follow-up cystoscopies can be increased and the detection of relapse can be improved. But to date no non-invasive biomarker has proven to be sensitive and specific enough available to replace cystoscopy, neither in the diagnosis nor in the follow-up of bladder cancer. However, new marker combinations and algorithms for risk assessment hold promise for the future.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: bladder cancer, version 3.2024 [^115XCWE9]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for bladder cancer - NCCN, more specifically with respect to aalternative risk classifiers and biomarkers (general principles), NCCN 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that prognostic biomarkers are agnostic to the treatments received, and evidence supporting their use may be derived from retrospective studies, prospective registries, or prospective clinical trials. Consider using prognostic biomarkers in treatment intensification or deintensification decisions. Carefully weigh the quality and size of the studies that led to their development and validation when using them as clinical tools to aid in determining the frequency of surveillance monitoring, treatment intensification, or deintensification decisions. Ensure that the test informs the patient of the absolute risk of the event of interest, such as metastasis or progression.

### Urinary markers in the detection of bladder cancer: what's new? [^111qqpWk]. Current Opinion in Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bladder cancer is one of the most common genitourinary malignancies and is a potentially life-threatening diagnosis. For many patients, however, the diagnosis of bladder cancer entails a lifetime of vigilant, costly, and invasive surveillance for recurrent and/or progressive disease. In the context of relative limitations of the current standard of cystoscopy and cytology, there has been burgeoning activity in the development of novel molecular urine-based markers for bladder cancer detection.

Recent Findings

A large number of candidate bladder cancer biomarkers have emerged as our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of the disease has evolved. Many of these are in the relatively earlier phases of development but several have received the approval of the United States Food and Drug Administration for clinical use and are already being applied to patients in clinical practice.

Summary

Urine-based markers for bladder cancer detection represent an area of substantial innovation and discovery with potentially profound scientific, clinical, and economic implications. As more of these tests become standardized and undergo evaluation in large multicenter trials, it is conceivable that a novel marker or panel of markers will emerge as a major enhancement to the current standard of care.

### Diagnostic value of serum DR-70 levels, a new fibrin-related biomarker, in bladder cancer patients [^112JonfW]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The characteristics of an ideal tumor marker for bladder cancer have been previously described by Huben. The marker should be present in urine, serum, or tumor tissue in decreasing order of preference. The marker should accurately predict the presence of a tumor as well as its extent. Marker levels should correlate with disease severity. High sensitivity and specificity are critical criteria for the utility of a test, but several other essential characteristics must also be met for a marker to be clinically applicable and useful for routine practice.

Urinary cytology, which is considered a non-invasive diagnostic method for the diagnosis of bladder cancer, has low sensitivity (16%) in low-grade disease. However, urinary cytology has a sensitivity of up to 46–84% in high-grade disease. The reasons for these different sensitivity rates may be that cytology preparation is user dependent, varies in conditions such as urinary stones and infection, and is affected by intravesical instillation treatments. When the cut-off value is taken as 1 U/mL, DR-70 has 73.3% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity in determining bladder cancer. According to these results, DR-70 could be promising compared with urinary cytology, and better results can be obtained with studies evaluating the combination of these tests. In addition to urinary cytology, a number of biomarkers that can be measured in urine, serum or both have been studied. One of these tests, UroVysion™, offers a sensitivity of 13–100% and a specificity of 63–100% in the presence of symptoms that raise suspicion of bladder cancer. None of these are recommended as routine tests for diagnosis or follow-up. It is preferred to evaluate these non-invasive tests together with cystoscopy and imaging methods.

### Biomarkers for bladder cancer aggressiveness [^113b1qZB]. Current Opinion in Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bladder cancer is associated with high recurrence and mortality rates. Development of accurate surveillance tests to evaluate disease aggressiveness and for prognosis of disease recurrence and progression is a major clinical need. At the molecular level bladder cancer displays a vast heterogeneity as reflected by the presence of multiple potential biomarkers associated with various disease phenotypes. The scope of this review is to briefly summarize the latest findings on biomarkers potentially beneficial in disease stratification based on aggressiveness and prognosis.

Recent Findings

Multiple potential biomarkers for bladder cancer have been identified corresponding to chromosome, DNA, and epigenetic alterations, as well as changes in RNA, miRNAs, and protein expression levels and modifications. We summarize some of the main biomarker findings reported in the past year that are considered to be potentially correlated to disease aggressiveness. A comparison to existing latest evidence from the classical US Food and Drug Administration-approved bladder cancer detection markers is made.

Summary

Potential biomarkers detected noninvasively in urine specimens, as well as in excised tissue specimens following initial treatment, are briefly reported. The prognostic information provided may be significant, as multiple markers by now have been found to correlate with disease outcome. However, the studies presented were in general either too small, and/or the performance of the single biomarkers was moderate. The information presently available suggests that single biomarkers may be insufficient for effective monitoring and patient management. A concerted effort to establish panels of biomarkers based on the ample existing knowledge, and validate them in proper clinical trials is urgently needed.

### Comprehensive proteomics and platform validation of urinary biomarkers for bladder cancer diagnosis and staging [^112mkFEa]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Bladder cancer (BC) is the fourth most common cancer diagnosed in men in the United States. The incidence rate of the disease is four times higher in men than in women and approximately twice as high in White men compared to Black men. It is estimated that 6% of all new cancer diagnoses in men in the year 2022 will be BC. Overall, 81,180 people are expected to be newly diagnosed with BC in 2022, of which 61,700 being male and 19,480 being female. It is also estimated that 17,100 people will die from the disease in 2022. The risk of developing BC increases with age with the highest risk being in 80-year-old males and females. The 5-year relative survival rate for those with BC is 77%. If the tumor is non-invasive, the 5-year survival increases to 96%. However, 51% of all cases are diagnosed after this occurrence.

### Microsatellite analysis of free tumor DNA in urine, serum, and plasma of patients: a minimally invasive method for the detection of bladder cancer [^112PM9NU]. Clinical Cancer Research (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Tumor cells may release DNA into circulation, which is subsequently carried as free DNA and enriched in blood and urine. The detection of tumors by microsatellite analysis of free DNA offers a possibility to establish a minimally invasive method for the detection of bladder cancer.

Experimental Design

We performed microsatellite analysis of free DNA of urine, serum, and plasma in comparison with DNA of lymphocytes and tumors of 40 patients with conspicuous bladder lesions. Six microsatellite markers were used for the detection of alterations on chromosomes 4, 9, and 17.

Results

Twenty-six of 36 bladder tumor tissue samples showed alterations. Microsatellite changes matching those in the tumor tissues were detected in at least one of the body fluids in 23 cases.

Conclusions

The study indicates that simultaneous and multiple investigations of microsatellite markers on free DNA of urine and blood could have clinical relevance as a minimally invasive method for diagnosis and screening of bladder cancer.

### Current concepts of tumor markers in bladder cancer [^1127pqAU]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The critical issue in characterizing the usefulness of tumor markers in screening or monitoring for urothelial cancer and in determining prognosis revolves around the question, "What do we need to know?" During surveillance of patients with low-risk disease, highly sensitive markers may detect disease persistence or early recurrence (on the basis of field-effect changes or tumor cell implantation); however, they may not indicate the possibility of progression. If cystoscopy is negative in these instances, is it appropriate to treat? Does earlier treatment actually prevent recurrence or progression? Some investigators have suggested a positive answer to the former question, although lead-time bias may a role. The issue in the latter question may be moot because low-risk disease is by definition unlikely to progress. A corresponding question is whether one should treat the patient if the marker has a low specificity. In such instances, a marker with low specificity may incur more frequent instrumentation and a panoply of additional costs. A marker may have some value in providing earlier diagnosis in low-risk disease if treatments are available to prevent clinical expression and recurrence. A tumor marker would have additional value if it could detect biologic change from low-risk to high-risk disease and permit a corresponding change in treatment. Moreover, if a marker could provide earlier diagnosis in high-risk disease, it might permit identification of those patients likely to progress at earlier and curable stages of disease. To be successful, such markers must have high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis. It has been suggested that "a simple noninvasive highly sensitive and specific method for detecting bladder cancer would decrease the morbidity associated with current surveillance methods, improve quality of life for patients, and reduce costs by substituting a less expensive test for the more expensive endoscopic procedures" (Dr. M. Soloway, personal communication 2000). In considering this statement, it is tempting to question some of its implications. The term "simple" suggests that point-of-care tests may be the easiest, but tests that are available may be inconsistent and not sufficiently sensitive or specific. The need for a "highly sensitive and specific" test is of critical importance for applicability in the individual, even when such tests are based on the results in large populations. When considering the "morbidity of current methods", it is tempting to question whether cystoscopy is that morbid a procedure. Given the information it provides, it seems improbable that it can be readily replaced. Currently, no markers provide information over and above that provided by cystoscopy and histology- or cytology-based understanding of the biology of the disease especially in considering distinctions between low-risk and high-risk disease. The ability to "improve quality of life" will depend on the use of the predictive value made on the basis of a test's sensitivity and specificity. A false-positive test may lead to anxiety and extensive unnecessary evaluation, whereas a false-negative test may lead to missed diagnosis, delayed treatment, and the possibility of disease progression until accurate diagnosis is obtained. In each case, quality of life is compromised. "Substituting a less expensive test" depends on the benefits of that substitution and the practicality of omitting or delaying standard assessment. Costs depend on the frequency of testing, those incurred by false-positive tests, and those incurred by false-negative tests. Several caveats emerge when taking into account these various considerations. In screening for low-risk disease, the urgency of diagnosis may be less important. High sensitivity is of less importance because the risk of a missed diagnosis has less ominous repercussions. Nevertheless, high specificity is important to avoid unnecessary frequent instrumentations. In considering surveillance for low-risk disease, cytology may be more useful in indicating a change from negative (persistent or recurrent low-risk disease) to positive (high-risk disease) with the consequent need for more aggressive treatment approach. No urinary "screening" markers reliably provide this information. In considering surveillance for high-risk disease, sensitive markers would detect persistence or early recurrence. If such markers are negative, intervals between repeated cystoscopies may be prolonged; however, a high specificity is needed to ensure the validity of a truly negative interpretation. Otherwise, diagnosis may be missed and the risk from progression and the development of incurability increased. Markers for urothelial cancer must be expressed exclusively as a consequence of the presence of cancer cells. The test must be sensitive in detecting disease and must be validated in nonselected populations. It must be sensitive in excluding nondisease, and noncancer conditions must have little influence on its accuracy. There must be little or no interassay or intra-assay variability. Interpretation of an assay for a tumor marker should be all or none, or based on a threshold level. The assays must have sufficient sensitivity and specificity in populations and in the individual to have practical clinical applicability.

### Screening for bladder cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^111oUmQA]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

USPSTF bladder cancer screening — clinical summary for asymptomatic adults states the population is Asymptomatic Adults with the recommendation No recommendation and Grade: I (Insufficient Evidence). Risk factors for bladder cancer include smoking, occupational exposure to carcinogens, male sex, older age, white race, infections caused by certain bladder parasites, and family or personal history of bladder cancer. Screening tests for bladder cancer include microscopic urinalysis for hematuria, urine cytology, and urine biomarkers. The principal treatment for superficial disease is transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, and radical cystectomy, often with adjuvant chemotherapy, is used for surgically resectable invasive bladder cancer. There is inadequate evidence that treatment of screen-detected bladder cancer leads to improved morbidity or overall mortality, and there is inadequate evidence on harms of screening for bladder cancer.

Bladder cancer — principles of alternative risk classifiers and biomarkers state that a physician's expertise and patient's preferences are critical to management, and the panel acknowledges that risk classifiers may provide additional prognostic information for estimating outcomes after diagnosis or treatment. These risk classifiers include, but are not limited to, staging systems derived from routinely available clinical information and nomograms, commercially available molecular tests, radiologic evaluations, and emerging artificial intelligence models, and they should be restricted to use in cases where there is concern that delivering guideline-directed practices or therapy may lead to over- or under-treatment or unacceptable toxicity.

### MicroRNA-99a acts as a tumor suppressor and is down-regulated in bladder cancer [^112zUGf9]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Bladder cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies in the world. The most common type of bladder cancer is urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Chromosomal anomalies, genetic polymorphisms, genetic and epigenetic alterations have been reported to be included in the tumorigenesis and progression of bladder cancer. Many molecules involved in these alterations may serve as diagnostic markers of tumor growth and disease progression. Currently, many protein-coding genes and specific genomic regions are the most popular used molecular markers of bladder cancer, such as members of the RAS family, differentially methylated DNA locus.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that play crucial roles in multiple biological processes through regulating mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. Recent studies have documented that miRNAs acted as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in a variety types of cancer, such as lung, breast, hepatic, and pancreatic cancer. Several innate properties of miRNAs make them attractive as potential biomarkers. MiRNAs can be detected easily in small amount samples using specific and sensitive quantitative real-time PCR; miRNAs are stable against degradation and can be detectable in bodily fluids including serum, plasma, saliva, urine and tears. Furthermore, expression profiles of miRNAs would be changed in the plasma and/or serum of cancer patients and miRNAs have been shown to be released from tumor cells to the circulation. So circulating miRNAs will be a novel class of non-invasive biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, the expression profile of miRNAs in bladder cancer and miRNAs which may serve as diagnostic markers of bladder cancer are less reported compared with the abroad reports in other cancer types.

### Diagnostic value of serum DR-70 levels, a new fibrin-related biomarker, in bladder cancer patients [^113eYLRB]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the male population, whereas it is the ninth most common cancer in both populations. The age-standardized incidence (per 100.00 person/years) worldwide is 9.5 in men and 2.4 in women. At the time of diagnosis, 75% of bladder cancer cases are limited to the mucosa (Ta, T1, Carcinoma in situ = CIS). Compared with muscle-invasive bladder tumor patients, the non-muscle invasive patients have higher survival rates and lower cancer-specific mortality rates. As in other cancer types, hyperactivation of the coagulation system is present in bladder cancer. This effect is based on the ability of tumor cells to activate the coagulation system. Procoagulan and fibrinolytic mediators produced by tumor cells and released into the circulation play a role in activating the coagulation and fibrinolytic system. It has also been shown that tumor invasion damages the endothelial layer and releases subendothelial procoagulative factors. An angiogenic mediator called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is produced in bladder cancer cells. When large case series are examined, studies have shown that VEGF levels increase in bladder cancer patients and this increase is related to tumor grade. VEGF increases endothelial passage and allows the passage of proteins such as tissue factor and coagulation factor into the extravascular space. As a result, lysine fragments that activate plasminogen are released with the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. When plasminogen binds to the released lysine fragments, its active state becomes plasmin. Plasmin converts fibrin into fibrin degradation products, and these fibrin degradation products can be detected in blood and urine. DR-70 is a type of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test that can measure all monomers of circulating fibrin degradation products and the sum of initial plasmin degradation products (IPDPs) released in the fibrinolysis cascade. The advantage of the DR-70 test is that it can measure all subtypes of fibrin and fibrin degradation products in human serum at one time. It is based on the principle of detecting increased fibrin degradation products as a result of the hypercoagulability of cancer cells. In this way, it has been used as a biomarker in various cancers. It is not specific for cancer type, but its elevated levels may be a warning sign for suspicion of malignancy. It can also be used to evaluate the response to treatment and to predict recurrence after treatment –. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of DR-70 protein in the diagnosis of bladder cancer and to evaluate the relationship with the grade of disease.

### Developing proteomic biomarkers for bladder cancer: towards clinical application [^112tpVtw]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical use of proteomic biomarkers has the potential to substantially improve the outcomes of patients with bladder cancer. An unmet clinical need evidently exists for noninvasive biomarkers, which might enable improvements in both the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with bladder cancer, as well as improved monitoring of patients for the presence of recurrence. Urine is considered the optimal noninvasive source of proteomic biomarkers in patients with bladder cancer. Currently, a number of single-protein biomarkers have been detected in urine and tissue using a variety of proteomic techniques, each having specific conceptual considerations and technical implications. Promising preclinical data are available for several of these proteins; however, the combination of single urinary proteins into multimarker panels might better encompass the molecular heterogeneity of bladder cancer within this patient population, and prove more effective in clinical use.

### Diagnostic, prognostic and surveillance urinary markers in nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer: any role in clinical practice? [^116drLDG]. Current Opinion in Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize the current knowledge about the clinical role of novel urinary markers in bladder cancer (BCa) management, from diagnosis to follow-up, from prognosis of oncological outcomes to response to intravesical therapy.

Recent Findings

Urinary markers have been developed to overcome the limitations of the current available tools for the diagnosis and surveillance of BCa patients. However, to date, because of their limited performances, urinary markers are not generally used in clinical practice. For a marker to be of clinical benefit, it needs to be better, easier, faster and cheaper. The differential requirements for a marker's diagnostic performances depend on goals for clinical utility. Their most promising role seems to be in settings such as in case of equivocal cystoscopy/cytology during follow-up of nonmuscle invasive tumors. Newer markers are available or in development using panels of markers of RNA expression or methylation.

Summary

To date, there are multiple urine markers that have improved sensitivity over cytology but there is lack of validation of clinical utility. Some of the recently developed markers aim to change the paradigm of BCa follow-up by replacing or reducing the need of invasive investigations. Further prospective validations are needed to confirm these findings.

### Serum CYFRA 21–1 in patients with invasive bladder cancer and its relevance as a tumor marker during chemotherapy [^114tv25F]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Previous studies have shown that serum levels of the degradation products of cytokeratins could be used as surrogate markers in the diagnosis and followup of patients with solid tumors, including tumors of the bladder.

Materials and Methods

The soluble cytokeratin 19 fragment CYFRA 21–1 was measured by solid phase radioimmunoassay in the serum of 142 patients with invasive transitional cell cancer of the bladder. Of the patients 56 had clinical stage I to III locally confined disease (T1–4aN0M0) and 86 had stage IV metastatic disease with lymph node and/or distant metastases. A control group consisted of 33 healthy volunteers. In a subgroup of 49 patients with metastatic disease receiving combined platinum based chemotherapy serum CYFRA 21–1 was determined prior to the initiation of therapy and after the documentation of response.

Results

Abnormal CYFRA 21–1 was observed in 7% of patients with locally invasive disease and in 66% of those with metastatic disease (p < 0.0001). There was no correlation of CYFRA 21–1 with tumor differentiation. Patients with abnormal CYFRA 21–1 showed statistically significant worse median overall survival. Moreover, in the subgroup of patients with metastatic disease receiving chemotherapy CYFRA 21–1 levels correlated with the response to treatment.

Conclusions

Patients with transitional cell cancer of the bladder with evidence of distant metastases showed a significant increase in serum CYFRA 21–1. During chemotherapy CYFRA 21–1 appears to be a potentially sensitive and useful indicator for monitoring treatment response.

### Urine biomarkers in bladder cancer-current status and future perspectives [^112BXkBc]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2023). High credibility.

Urine markers to detect bladder cancer have been the subject of research for decades. The idea that urine - being in continuous contact with tumour tissue - should provide a vector of tumour information remains an attractive concept. Research on this topic has resulted in a complex landscape of many different urine markers with varying degrees of clinical validation. These markers range from cell-based assays to proteins, transcriptomic markers and genomic signatures, with a clear trend towards multiplex assays. Unfortunately, the number of different urine markers and the efforts in research and development of clinical grade assays are not reflected in the use of these markers in clinical practice, which is currently limited. Numerous prospective trials are in progress with the aim of increasing the quality of evidence about urinary biomarkers in bladder cancer to achieve guideline implementation. The current research landscape suggests a division of testing approaches. Some efforts are directed towards addressing the limitations of current assays to improve the performance of urine markers for a straightforward detection of bladder cancer. Additionally, comprehensive genetic analyses are emerging based on advances in next-generation sequencing and are expected to substantially affect the potential application of urine markers in bladder cancer.

### Usefulness of tissue polypeptide antigen in the follow-up of bladder cancer [^1167Q7K3]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of serum tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA) as a tumor marker for monitoring tumor recurrence in a prospective Phase II study.

Methods

This study consisted of 421 subjects allocated to three groups: 241 patients treated for bladder cancer between 1991 and 1995, 126 subjects with a previous history of bladder tumor but with no recurrence at the time of study enrollment, and 54 healthy volunteers. Soluble TPA concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay.

Results

On the basis of receiver operating characteristic plot analysis, the normal test threshold was set at 63 U/L. For bladder cancer detection, the TPA specificity was 73% and sensitivity was 45%. TPA levels correlated with tumor stage (P < 0.01), histologic grade, nodal stage, and metastatic stage and with urinary cytology in univariate analysis. In the subsets of patients with a history of bladder cancer and normal TPA levels, 34.9% experienced a relapse compared with 37.5% of patients with elevated TPA levels (no statistically significant difference). Among the patients with normal TPA levels who experienced recurrence, the mean disease-free interval was 30.6 months compared with 25.1 months in patients with elevated TPA levels (no statistically significant difference). Multivariate analysis showed that TPA was not an independent prognostic biomarker for tumor relapse.

Conclusions

In patients with bladder cancer, the TPA serum level correlated with initial tumor stage and grade, but it was not useful for detecting or monitoring relapses.

### Economic impact of tumor markers in bladder cancer surveillance [^117AkKi9]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Bladder cancer invokes the highest cost per patient from diagnosis to death and is the fifth most expensive cancer to treat overall, exceeding $3.4 billion annually. Current surveillance regimens require intense follow-up contributing to high cost and emotional burden. Bladder tumor markers hold the promise to reduce these costs, yet have not been widely adopted in oncological practice. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of bladder tumor markers in surveillance routines.

Methods

A MEDLINE search of all available literature concerning bladder tumor markers and cost-effectiveness was performed. We reviewed retrospective and prospective studies, reviews, opinion papers, decision analyses, and cost-effectiveness analyses.

Results

Bladder tumor markers exist in various stages of development and efficacy. Sensitivity and specificity values have been reported across a wide range, with tumor markers generally possessing a higher sensitivity and lower specificity than urine cytology. Several cost-effectiveness analyses have shown tumor markers significantly lower the cost of bladder cancer surveillance when using a modified regimen that lengthens intervals between cystoscopies. However, many of the studies rely on overconfident sensitivity and specificity estimates and do not incorporate data specific to recurrent bladder cancer. No comprehensive study incorporating utility analysis has been performed.

Conclusions

Bladder tumor markers cannot definitively replace cystoscopy in surveillance regimens given the current evidence. Recent reports suggest potential for tumor markers to control the financial and emotional cost of bladder cancer care and improve quality of life. Until prospective analyses incorporating quality of life outcomes are performed, wider adoption of bladder tumor markers will be hampered.

### Molecular biomarkers in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder: are we there yet? [^1146bpbm]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2011). Medium credibility.

The unprecedented advances in cancer genetics and genomics are rapidly affecting the clinical management of solid tumors. Molecular diagnostics are now an integral part of routine clinical management for patients with lung, colon, and breast cancer. In sharp contrast, molecular biomarkers have been largely excluded from current management algorithms for urologic malignancies. The need for new treatment options that can improve upon the modest outcomes currently associated with muscle-invasive bladder cancer is evident, and validated prognostic molecular biomarkers that can help clinicians to identify patients in need of early, aggressive management are lacking. Robust predictive biomarkers that are able to forecast and stratify responses to emerging targeted therapies are also needed.

### Highly specific urine-based marker of bladder cancer [^113mGWwb]. Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Bladder cancer represents a major health problem throughout the world, but advances in tumor biomarker development are revolutionizing how physicians diagnose the disease. We previously used an indirect immunoassay to demonstrate that the bladder cancer specific biomarker, BLCA-4, is present in urine samples from patients with bladder cancer, but not in samples from healthy individuals. In this study, a sandwich immunoassay was used to measure BLCA-4 in urine samples from patient populations with various urologic conditions and healthy individuals.

Methods

Urine was collected from healthy individuals and from patients with bladder cancer, benign urologic conditions, or prostate cancer. BLCA-4 levels were evaluated by a sandwich immunoassay using two antibodies directed against distinct epitopes on BLCA-4.

Results

Using a prospectively determined cutoff of an absorbance unit (OD) of 0.04, 67 of the 75 samples from patients with bladder cancer were positive for BLCA-4, resulting in an assay sensitivity of 89%. Also, 62 of the 65 samples from individuals without bladder cancer were negative for BLCA-4, resulting in an assay specificity of 95%.

Conclusions

The high sensitivity and specificity of the sandwich BLCA-4 immunoassay may allow for earlier detection and treatment of disease, thus greatly improving patient care.

### A prognosis marker MUC1 correlates with metabolism and drug resistance in bladder cancer: a bioinformatics research [^1133v1GV]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bladder cancer (BC) is a malignant tumor that seriously endangers human health. There are approximately 573,000 new cases of BC each year worldwide, and the number of deaths caused by BC is approximately 213,000 ranking tenth among all tumors. BC is divided into muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) according to the depth of invasion. BC mainly includes transitional cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma on the basis of the pathological type, among which transitional cell carcinoma accounts for more than 90%. There are plenty of risk factors in the development of BC, including gender, smoking prevalence, occupational carcinogen exposure, Schistosoma haematobium infection, etc. Recently, researchers have considered the interaction of hypoxia and tumor, immune cell infiltration and immune microenvironment as the key step in the occurrence and development of BC. Currently, early diagnosis of BC can rely on serum markers, urine markers, and cystoscopy. However, the lack of clear markers and poor patients' compliance make the early diagnosis of BC very difficult. Despite the 5-year survival rate for BC is as high as 77%, the recurrence rate of BC is still high, and the 5-year survival rate for metastatic BC is less than 5%. Therefore, it is particularly urgent to find highly sensitive biomarkers for BC.

MUC1 encodes a type I transmembrane protein with a polar distribution, called Mucin 1. N-terminal alpha subunit of Mucin1 functions in cell adhesion and the C-terminal beta subunit is involved in cell signaling. Recent studies have found that MUC1 plays an important role in tumor hypoxia microenvironment and tumor metabolism. MUC1 can not only mediate hypoxia-driven angiogenesis by regulating a variety of angiogenic factors; it can also stabilize and activate hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) to promote the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. Recently, studies have developed antibody–drug conjugated (ADC) based on MUC1 employed in the treatment trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer patients. Besides, a multitargeted recombinant Ad5 PSA/MUC-1/brachyury-based immunotherapy vaccine developed by Bilusic et al. was recently introduced into phase I trials. The types and abundance of immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment have proved to be very different from normal tissues. Studies have found that the expression of MUC1 induces immune suppression in colon cancer, and this suppression can be reversed by blocking the PD1/PDL1 pathway. MUC1 has shown a strong potential in the diagnosis and treatment of tumors.

### Novel biomarkers to predict response and prognosis in localized bladder cancer [^111j9mZd]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

This review summarizes recent developments in diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Although the number of new biomarkers increases continuously, none are included in practice guidelines. Most NMIBC biomarkers show a higher sensitivity than urinary cytology, but lower specificity. Some protein and chromosome markers have been approved for screening and follow-up of patients in combination with cystoscopy. The long interval required for validation, testing, and approval of the assays and the lack of standardization could explain present issues in biomarker research. To enhance the development of new biomarkers, a more structured approach is required.

### MicroRNA-99a acts as a tumor suppressor and is down-regulated in bladder cancer [^113KBfK4]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Earlier studies discovered that extracellular miRNAs circulated in the bloodstream and the circulating miRNAs were remarkably stable. Detection of elevated levels of tumor associated miRNAs in serum of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma leads to wide investigation of circulating miRNAs in many human cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and renal cell carcinoma and so on. The expression profile of miRNAs in serum/plasma of the patients with bladder cancer was also investigated and some important circulating miRNAs in bladder cancer had been identified. These studies support the use of serum/plasma miRNAs as noninvasive means of bladder cancer detection. However, there are rare reports about miRNAs down-regulated in the plasma of patients with bladder cancer relative to the extensive studies of miRNAs up-regulated in plasma. We found that the levels of miR-99a in the plasma of bladder cancer was decreased which was consistent with its low level in the cancer tissues although it was unknown how the down-regulation of miR-99a in a relatively small number of tumor cells can affect the plasma miR-99a levels. We think there are two possible explanations for that: 1) The down-regulation of miR-99a in the cancer tissue was significant enough to be able to affect plasma miR-99a levels, meanwhile, the Taqman probe stem-loop real-time PCR was sensitive enough to detect the faint change of miR-99a levels in plasma. 2) The down-regulation of miR-99a in the plasma not only origin from the tumor cells but also from the immunocytes in the tumor microenvironment which needs to be improved further. The decreased expression of miR-99a in the plasma and cancer tissues of bladder cancer patients supported that miR-99a can be developed as a new diagnostic marker for bladder cancer detection.

### Current status of urinary biomarkers for detection and surveillance of bladder cancer [^115R5ecN]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The standard of care for detection and surveillance of bladder cancer consists of cytology and cystoscopy, but both examinations suffer from many limitations, including issues related to accuracy, invasiveness, and cost. Several noninvasive methods for detection and surveillance of bladder cancer have been developed and urine-based biomarkers seem the most promising. This nonsystematic review critically analyzes the commercially available biomarkers and highlights some upcoming investigational biomarkers. To date, none of these biomarkers has sufficient validation to serve as a reliable alternative to cystoscopy.

### Screening for bladder cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^117BPQAa]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) bladder cancer screening — potential harms and current practice emphasizes that false-positive test results may result in anxiety and unneeded evaluations, diagnostic-related harms from cystoscopy and biopsy, harms from labeling or unnecessary treatments (such as transurethral resection of a bladder tumor, intravesical chemotherapy, or biologic therapies), and overdiagnosis. Screening tests feasible for use in primary care include urine dipstick or microscopic urinalysis for hematuria, urine cytology, and tests for urine biomarkers. Tests for urine biomarkers are not commonly used in primary care in part because of their cost, although this varies substantially. Patients with positive screening results are typically referred to a urologist for further evaluation, which may include cystoscopy (and biopsy if a tumor is found), imaging, and other studies.

### Urine-based markers for detection of urothelial cancer and for the management of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer [^116QiPsS]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Currently, evaluation for hematuria is driven by the AUA/SUFU guidelines, and urine markers are not recommended for routine evaluation. Bladder cancer is a disease characterized by a high recurrence rate that is impacted by stage and grade. The use of urine markers within the guidelines is recommended for very specific indications such as atypical cystoscopic findings or atypical cytologic findings. Routine use is also not recommended for patients undergoing surveillance. Many protein, DNA and RNA, and molecular biomarkers have been examined as an adjunct to cystoscopy and cytology in the diagnosis and surveillance of bladder cancer, and several FDA-approved tumor markers are now available. The role of biomarkers remains an important area of further study to enhance the diagnosis and surveillance of bladder cancer. Beyond this, tumor markers may also play an important role in risk stratification and prediction of treatment response, allowing for personalized care for patients with bladder cancer. This article reviews the urine biomarkers currently available in the diagnosis and surveillance of bladder cancer.

### Serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor as a prognostic factor in bladder cancer [^112eGX8H]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Vascular endothelial growth factor is an overriding growth factor mediating tumor angiogenesis. We correlated serum vascular endothelial growth factor in patients with bladder cancer with clinical parameters.

Materials and Methods

Serum vascular endothelial growth factor in 58 patients with bladder cancer, including superficial and invasive tumors in 42 and 16, respectively, and 41 healthy controls was measured by sandwich enzyme immunoassay.

Results

Significant differences in serum vascular endothelial growth factor were observed in healthy controls and patients with bladder cancer (mean 248 versus 100 pg./ml., p < 0.001). The serum level was significantly associated with tumor stage (p < 0.0001), grade (p < 0.002), vascular invasion (p < 0.001) and carcinoma in situ (p < 0.01). Patients with metastasis had a significantly higher levels than those with localized diseases (mean 582 versus 194 pg./ml., p < 0.0001). At a cut-off of 400 pg./ml. the sensitivity and specificity of the test for differentiating patients with and without metastatic diseases was 87.5% and 98%, respectively (p < 0.0001). Univariate statistical analysis showed that an increase in serum vascular endothelial growth factor level greater than 400 pg./ml. was significantly related to disease-free survival. On multivariate analysis only stage remained as an independent prognostic factor.

Conclusions

Although vascular endothelial growth factor did not remain an independent prognostic factor on multivariate analysis, our data indicate that the level of vascular endothelial growth factor may be a valuable angiogenic marker for identifying metastatic bladder cancer. It may be used as a new predictor of disease.

### Non-invasive urine based tests for the detection of bladder cancer [^114WWSNV]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Bladder cancer is the fourth most frequently diagnosed malignant neoplasm and cause of cancer-related deaths in men and eighth in women. Patients with bladder cancer undergo repeated cystoscopic examinations of the bladder to monitor for tumour recurrence which is invasive, costly and lacks accuracy. Therefore, the development of non-invasive urine based tests for the early detection of bladder cancer would be of tremendous benefit to both patients and healthcare systems. A number of urine based markers are available for the early diagnosis of bladder cancer. The diagnosis of bladder cancer relies on identifying malignant cells in the urine. All urinary markers have a higher sensitivity as compared with cytology but they score lower in specificity. Many soluble and cell based markers have been developed. Only two of the soluble and cell based markers have obtained the Food and Drug Administration approval. In the current review, the most recent literature of urinary markers is summarised. This article reports some of the more prominent urine markers and new technologies used nowadays.

### Can biological markers replace cystoscopy? An update [^111d5VmG]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Cystoscopy is currently considered the gold standard for the detection of bladder tumors. The role of urine cytology in the initial detection and follow-up of patients is under discussion. New elaborative and rapid assays are available that may circumvent the low sensitivity and poor reproducibility of urine cytology. The methods that have been tested extensively are the nuclear matrix protein (NMP22) assay, the BTA stat assay, and the BTA TRAK enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Both outperform cytology in the detection of low-grade lesions. The specificity of both assays, however, lags behind that of cytology. The data from retrospective analyses are insufficient to justify clinical integration, and the need to replace cystoscopy with these novel assays remains to be proven.

### IL-8 as a urinary biomarker for the detection of bladder cancer [^1173eKD3]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Cancer of the urinary bladder is among the five most common malignancies worldwide. Urothelial cell carcinomas constitute approximately 95% of all bladder cancer cases, and associated with tobacco exposure. At presentation, more than 80% of bladder tumors are non-muscle invasive papillary tumors (Ta or T1), which harbor a 5-year survival rate of approximately 94%, however, approximately 70% of patients with these lesions develop tumor recurrence within two years of initial diagnosis. The recurrence phenomenon of non-muscle invasive BCa makes it one of the most prevalent cancers world-wide (in America it is second only to colorectal cancer) and is, therefore, a great burden to healthcare systems. Once BCa is detected and treated, patients will routinely get frequent surveillance cystoscopy to monitor for tumor recurrence. If left untreated these initially non-invasive tumors can progress to muscle-invasive tumors which have significantly reduced 5-year survival rate. Thus, early detection, ideally through non-invasive urine-based analysis, remains one of the most urgent issues in BCa research.

### Current bladder tumor tests: does their projected utility fulfill clinical necessity? [^11416neo]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

We reviewed currently available bladder cancer tests in the context of the clinical expectations of a noninvasive bladder cancer test.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed the literature on bladder cancer tests that are commercially available or have shown clinical usefulness and examined how each test compares with standard methods of bladder cancer diagnosis.

Results

The clinical necessity for a noninvasive test for bladder cancer is 2-fold, including the early detection of high grade bladder tumors before muscle invasion and monitoring tumor recurrence or new onset. An ideal noninvasive test should be sensitive, specific, rapid, technically simple and have low intra-assay and interassay variability. Urine cytology has high specificity but limited applicability due to its relatively low sensitivity and subjective nature. Hematuria detection by Hemastix dipstick is sensitive but not specific for detecting bladder cancer. Molecules associated with bladder tumor growth and progression may serve as a basis for designing noninvasive diagnostic tests. The Food and Drug Administration approved BTA Stat and BTA TRAK tests, which detect human complement factor H and a related protein in urine, have 60% to 80% sensitivity and 50% to 70% specificity (lower in symptomatic patients) for bladder cancer. The Food and Drug Administration approved NMP22 test, which measures the level of nuclear mitotic apparatus protein in urine, has 50% to 100% sensitivity and 60% to 90% specificity. Accu-Dx detects fibrin degradation products, fibrin and fibrinogen in urine, although this test is no longer commercially available. The Immunocyt test combines cytology with an immunofluorescence technique to improve the sensitivity of cytology for detecting low grade tumors. The telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay for telomerase in exfoliated cells has 70% to 86% sensitivity and 60% to 90% specificity for bladder cancer. However, the low stability of telomerase in urine affects its sensitivity. The hyaluronic acid and hyaluronidase (HA-HAase) test, which measures the urinary level of hyaluronic acid and hyaluronidase, has 90% to 92% sensitivity and 80% to 84% specificity for bladder cancer. Quanticyt karyometry evaluates nuclear shape and DNA content of exfoliated cells to detect bladder cancer. The list of bladder tumor markers is growing rapidly and large multicenter trials are essential to assess their usefulness.

Conclusions

Although currently noninvasive bladder cancer tests cannot replace cystoscopy, some have shown a promise of being clinically useful. One or a combination of these tests-markers may prove to be a prostate specific antigen for bladder cancer provided that patients and, more importantly, clinicians accept it.

### New diagnostic and prognostic tools in bladder cancer [^111gB6nJ]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Many efforts have been made to increase the detection rates and to predict the outcome of bladder cancer. Although to date cystoscopy remains the gold standard method for the detection of new or recurrent bladder cancer, its limitations were emphasized by the results of studies using fluorescence endoscopy that showed an increased detection rate and decreased recurrence after tumor resection. Urine cytology has high specificity and is used routinely as an adjunct to cystoscopy to detect invisible tumors. However, to improve on the low sensitivity of urine cytology, a number of marker tests have been developed. Optimal diagnostic accuracy appears to result from the synergistic combination of cytological markers with urine cytology. The evaluation of new and previously reported markers remains a very active field, but is still limited to inconclusive studies. Tissue and DNA microarrays represent a technological step forward for the analysis of a large number of markers and cohorts of patients that will be required definitively to establish the clinical utility of prognostic tests.

### Tumor-specific Zr-89 immuno-PET imaging in a human bladder cancer model [^116WuZDv]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2018). Low credibility.

Carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA 19.9) is a common tumor-associated antigen of hepatobiliary, colorectal, lung, and bladder cancers. Serum CA19.9 is significantly increased in 35–58% of patients with known urothelial carcinoma and is significantly increased in > 70% of muscle-invasive cases versus non-muscle-invasive cancers, making a potentially important prognostic marker. While several serum and cytology markers for urothethial cancers have been identified, they lack the sensitivity needed for appropriate screening. In fact, serum CA 19.9 suffers similar limitations. To address these limitations, we have previously demonstrated the value in being able to image this antigen in situ. Our group has taken HuMab-5B1 (MVT-5873), a CA19.9-specific human antibody, and confirmed the feasibility and efficacy of targeting CA19.9 for both imaging and therapy in pancreatic cancer models. Here, we demonstrate the utility of our immuno-PET probe, [89 Zr]DFO-HuMab-5B1 (MVT-2163), which, like serum CA19.9, can confirm the presence of CA19.9-expressing human bladder cancer cells, but, unlike serum CA19.9, also identifies the specific anatomical location of these lesions in situ, in vivo, and in real time, and unlike [18 F]FDG PET, is tumor specific.

### MicroRNA-99a acts as a tumor suppressor and is down-regulated in bladder cancer [^112ayZun]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Increasing evidences have documented that microRNAs (miRNAs) act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in a variety types of cancer. The discovery of tumor associated miRNAs in serum of patients gives rise to extensive investigation of circulating miRNAs in many human cancers which support the use of plasma/serum miRNAs as noninvasive means of cancer detection. However, the aberrant expression of miRNAs and the circulating miRNAs in bladder cancer are less reported.

Methods

We used Taqman probe stem-loop real-time PCR to accurately measure the levels of miR-99a in bladder cancer cell lines, 100 pairs of bladder cancer tissues, the adjacent non-neoplastic tissues and plasma collected from bladder cancer patients or control patients. miR-99a mimics were re-introduced into bladder cancer cells to investigate its role on regulating cell proliferation which was measured by CCK-8 assay and cell cycle analysis.

Results

miR-99a was significantly down-regulated in bladder cancer tissues, and even the lower expression of miR-99a was correlative with the more aggressive phenotypes of bladder cancer. Meanwhile, enforced expression of miR-99a can inhibit the cell proliferation of bladder cancer cells. Furthermore, investigation of the expression of miR-99a in plasma of bladder cancer patients showed that miR-99a was also decreased in plasma of bladder cancer patients. The results strongly supported miR-99a as the potential diagnostic marker of bladder cancer.

Conclusions

Our data indicated that miR-99a might act as a tumor suppressor in bladder cancer and was significantly down-regulated in development of bladder cancer.

### Bladder cancer. II. molecular aspects and diagnosis [^113251Qs]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

The current system used to classify bladder carcinoma by stage and histological grade is very useful, yet still has limited ability to predict the natural history, or treated natural history, of a bladder tumor. Cystoscopy and urine cytology are currently the gold standard in the diagnosis and follow-up of bladder cancer. Classical urine cytology, however, at least in the diagnosis of G1 tumors, is definitely characterized by a relative low sensitivity. The low sensitivity and subjective interpretation of cytology led to the development of several tests to detect bladder cancer in urine. We provide a current, comprehensive review of the literature on bladder tumor markers and summarize their diagnostic potential. In conclusion, under the premise that cystoscopy has never been subjected to evaluation, no diagnostic marker with a sensitivity and specificity comparable to cystoscopy currently exists. The combined analysis of several tumor markers, as in the Immunocyt test, seems to be the most promising approach. In the future, rather highly sensitive tests may be able to replace cystoscopy or prolong the intervals of cystoscopies in the follow-up of selected patients.

### Prediction of extravesical disease by preoperative serum markers in patients with clinically organ confined invasive bladder cancer [^111npCCe]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

We assessed the value of preoperative levels of CEA, CA-125 or CA 19–9 in patients with clinically organ confined bladder cancer to predict pathological extravesical and/or node positive disease.

Materials and Methods

Serum levels of CEA, CA-125 and CA 19–9 were measured prospectively in all patients scheduled for cystectomy for clinically organ confined bladder cancer between September 1999 and May 2004. Biomarker expression was compared between patients with pathologically organ confined disease (pT2 or less, pN0) and patients with extravesical disease (greater than pT2, or pN1 or greater), and between patients with pathologically node negative (any pT, pN0) and node positive disease (any pT, pN1 or greater).

Results

Of the 91 patients enrolled, 46 had (51%) pathologically organ confined tumors, 45 (49%) had extravesical disease and 17 (19%) had positive lymph nodes. Preoperative serum levels of all markers were significantly higher in cases of extravesical disease than in organ confined disease. On multivariate analysis CEA with an odds ratio of 8.6 (95% CI 1.51–48.6) and CA-125 with an OR of 29.5 (95% CI 3.6–242.6) proved independent predictors of extravesical disease. CA-125 and CA 19–9 levels were significantly higher in patients with node positive disease than in those with node negative disease. On multivariate analysis CA-125 with an OR of 22.2 (95% CI 3.8–129) and CA 19–9 with an OR of 5.2 (95% CI 1.09–24.76) proved independent predictors of node positive disease.

Conclusions

Increase in serum tumor markers before cystectomy in patients with clinically organ confined muscle invasive bladder cancer is a strong indicator of the presence of extravesical and node positive disease.

### Serum laminin γ 2 monomer as a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^115G7rHS]. BJC Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive malignancies and has a 5-year survival rate of < 10%. Its incidence is continuing to increase, and it is now the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Currently, the only potentially curative therapy is curative resection; however, few patients are eligible for this treatment. Therefore, the early detection of PDAC is critical to improving patient outcomes.

Serological markers have been widely used as first step for detection of cancers. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) are tumor markers that are commonly used in the diagnosis of PDAC. However, they show limited usefulness for PDAC because of their relatively low sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, the identification of a more effective serum marker for PDAC is an urgent issue.

Laminin (Lm)-332 is a heterotrimeric basement membrane protein composed of Lm-α3, β3, and γ2 laminin chains. Basement membrane proteins are crucial for epithelial cell maintenance. We previously reported that Lm-γ2 is strongly expressed as a monomer in the tumor cell infiltrate in gastric adenocarcinoma but not in normal cells. We further found that serum Lm-γ2 monomer (LG2m) may be a new diagnostic marker for hepatocellular carcinoma and bladder cancer. However, the role for LG2m as a biomarker in PDAC remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential utility of LG2m as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in PDAC.

### Plasma glutathione S-transferase pi 1–1 AND alpha 1–1 levels in patients with bladder cancer [^116GipT3]. The Journal of Urology (2000). Low credibility.

Purpose

Transitional cell carcinomas of the human bladder and many gastrointestinal tumors often contain high amounts of the detoxification enzyme glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP1–1). Elevated levels of GSTP1–1 have been found in serum and plasma from patients with gastrointestinal, lung or head and neck cancer. GSTP1–1 and glutathione S-transferase alpha (GSTA1–1) have been reported to be increased in 10 of 15 patients (67%) with bladder cancer. We evaluate the role of GSTP1–1 and GSTA1–1 as plasma tumor markers in 50 patients with bladder cancer before and after treatment.

Materials and Methods

Blood from patients with bladder cancer was sampled in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tubes. Plasma GSTA1–1 and GSTP1–1 were measured using the sensitive and specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Results

Respective plasma GSTA1–1 and GSTP1–1 levels were above the upper normal reference limit in 2 (4%) and 14 (28%) of the 50 patients with bladder cancer. No significant decrease in plasma GSTA1–1 or GSTP1–1 was noted in matched pairs of plasma samples collected before and after treatment.

Conclusions

In contrast to earlier reports, only a limited number of patients with bladder cancer had increased plasma GSTA1–1 or GSTP1–1, which did not decrease after tumor resection. These findings argue against the use of GSTP1–1 or GSTA1–1 as plasma markers for bladder cancer.

### Screening for bladder cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113YKNtC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) bladder cancer screening — research needs and gaps indicate that cohort studies are needed to evaluate the natural history of early-stage, untreated bladder cancer to clarify potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment associated with screen-detected bladder cancer, and studies that compare the diagnostic accuracy of urine screening tests in representative populations are needed, as are studies that assess the effect of screening on incidence, tumor characteristics, and subsequent treatments. Randomized, controlled trials or well-designed case–control studies that evaluate clinical outcomes in screened versus unscreened populations have highest priority, and targeting populations at increased risk because of patient characteristics or occupational exposure may be preferred to enhance feasibility and maximize clinical relevance. A better understanding of the harms related to screening and treatment are needed, with suggested methods including observational studies based on patient registries or large pharmacoepidemiologic databases; prospective cohort studies are needed to identify early-stage cancer with a high risk for progression; and future research should also clarify the trade-offs of using less-toxic treatments earlier and more frequently versus using treatments with greater toxicity that are typically reserved for symptomatic or advanced tumors.

### Screening for bladder cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115FqTNo]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) bladder cancer screening — scope of review, screening tests, and evidence gaps notes that to update its 2004 recommendation on screening for bladder cancer in asymptomatic persons, the USPSTF reviewed the current state of the evidence and identified new evidence that addresses previously identified gaps. Primary care–feasible screening tests for bladder cancer include urinalysis for hematuria, urine cytology, and tests for other urine biomarkers, but no evidence was found regarding the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests in asymptomatic persons. The USPSTF found no direct evidence that bladder cancer screening is associated with improved health outcomes compared with no screening, and the USPSTF could not evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for screen-detected bladder cancer because of a lack of studies that compare clinical outcomes associated with treatment versus no treatment.

### Does the biomarker search paradigm need re-booting? [^1165fFWd]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Bladder cancer is the most expensive cancer to manage from diagnosis to death from any cause, mainly because bladder cancer also is one of the most recurrent cancers, with some studies showing over half of patients will recur within 5 years. The most widely held etiologic hypothesis is that superficial bladder cancer arises from mutations in fibroblastic growth factor 2 receptor and ras signaling, whereas the aggressive track has been thought to arise from mutations in the p53 and Rb signaling system. Even though over 75% of bladder cancers are superficial at initial diagnosis, the problem of recurrence is particularly insidious because some 15 to 25% of patients progress to aggressive invasive disease that may be responsible for half the deaths from bladder cancer. Poor patient compliance with cystoscopic monitoring begs for noninvasive biomarkers with sensitivity near 95%. Anything less than 95% sensitivity is asking patients to bet their lives on a test with worse sensitivity than the routine "gold standard" of cystoscopy. No product has reached the commercial market that meets these criteria. Screening of high risk populations, such as smokers or workers exposed to industrial bladder carcinogens, requires high specificity to control costs but can be cost-effective even when sensitivity is 50% or less. Prognostic markers to detect disease that is progressing need to emphasize sensitivity over specificity.

Because urine is readily available and contains both cells exfoliated from the normal and pathological urothelium as well as proteins from either secretion or cell lysis, bladder cancers have been early targets for biomarker development. Historically, tumor-associated antigens (TAA) and markers of abnormal ploidy using exfoliated cells were targeted. Cytology itself, although highly specific, lacks sensitivity. Some of the TAA biomarkers such as M344, DD23 and 19A211 achieved excellent sensitivity when combined with abnormal ploidy markers such as chromosomal loss or rare event cells with > 5C DNA. Quantitative fluorescence image analysis techniques combining two or three markers have actually reached the requisite sensitivity and specificity. Technology platforms have been barriers to commercialization because quantitation and rare event detection were both seen as keys to improving sensitivity and specificity, and until recently the technology for quantitative fluorescence microscopy has not been widely available.

### Proteomic studies of urinary biomarkers for prostate, bladder and kidney cancers [^1159KJPJ]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2013). Medium credibility.

Urine is an ideal body fluid for the detection of protein markers produced by urological cancers as it can be sampled noninvasively and contains secreted and directly shed proteins from the prostate, bladder and kidney. Major challenges of working with urine include high inter-individual and intra-individual variability, low protein concentration, the presence of salts and the dynamic range of protein expression. Despite these challenges, significant progress is being made using modern proteomic methods to identify and characterize protein-based markers for urological cancers. The development of robust, easy-to-use clinical tests based on novel biomarkers has the potential to impact upon diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring and could revolutionize the treatment and management of these cancers.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: bladder cancer, version 3.2024 [^116Dx4Bb]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) — biomarkers and surveillance: Biomarkers have a limited role in the initial evaluation and management of NMIBC, and any suspected patient with bladder cancer should undergo cystoscopy, TURBT, and EUA for diagnosis/disease risk stratification, which will drive subsequent treatment options offered to patients. Office cystoscopy at recommended intervals is a critical diagnostic and surveillance tool for NMIBC, and omission or delay of cystoscopy is acceptable only if a predictive biomarker has been tested and found to be non-inferior in a prospective randomized clinical trial. Currently, there is no routine role for obtaining urine cytology or other urinary biomarkers in low-risk NMIBC. The ability of biomarkers to replace urine voided cytology in the surveillance of NMIBC (in the intermediate or greater risk stratification groups) remains uncertain, and randomized clinical trials are required to conclusively address such questions. The use of certain biomarkers can be considered in the evaluation and workup of gross hematuria, but this is outside the scope of this guideline. Biomarkers have the greatest clinical value in the further evaluation of patients with subjective findings at the time of office cystoscopy or in the context of abnormal voided cytology, and this is left to the discretion and clinical judgment of board-certified practicing urologists to determine if and when such biomarkers may be clinically used in their practice.

### Cancer antigen 125 expression enhances the gemcitabine / cisplatin-resistant tumor microenvironment in bladder cancer [^114AYHq9]. The American Journal of Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cancer antigen 125 (CA125) is one of the mucin family proteins and is a serum tumor marker for various tumors, such as ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, pancreatic cancer, and bladder cancer. CA125 is used to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors, monitor the response to chemotherapy, and detect relapse after initial treatment. Recently, CA125 was reported to be involved in chemoresistance through the physical characteristics of mucin or by modifying the immune tumor-microenvironment. However, the relationship between CA125 expression and chemoresistance in bladder cancer is still unclear. In this study, the clinicopathologic features of bladder cancer with CA125 expression and the status of the tumor-microenvironment related to gemcitabine/cisplatin resistance were investigated using publicly available data sets (Cancer Genome Atlas Expression, GSE169455 data set) from the cBioPortal website, the National Center for Biotechnology Information website, and an in-house case collection of bladder cancer. The cases with CA125 expression had poorer disease-free and overall survival rates than those without CA125 expression. A mucinous area surrounding cancer cells was frequently detected in cases with CA125 expression (81%; 13/16 cases). CA125 expression was also related to the immunosuppressive tumor-microenvironment through the infiltration of immunosuppressive immune cells, such as regulatory T cells and M2 macrophages. These results suggest that the status of tumor-microenvironment associated with CA125 is involved in gemcitabine/cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer.

### The early detection and diagnosis of bladder cancer: a critical review of the options [^115nBwpp]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Bladder cancer has a high worldwide incidence matched by a tendency to recur, necessitating close and regular follow-up. Current methods of investigation of bladder cancer involve cystoscopy, ultrasound scanning and contrast urography, with additional information provided by cytology. These methods, although having a high detection rate, are expensive, time-consuming, invasive and uncomfortable. There is, therefore, a need for an inexpensive, noninvasive, quick and simple investigation with a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of bladder cancer. There are an increasing number of molecular assays available for the detection of bladder cancer. From bladder tumour antigens to nuclear matrix proteins to adhesion molecules, cytoskeletal proteins and growth factors, urology has looked at them all to support the early detection and diagnosis of bladder cancer. This review critically discusses both the commercial as well as the research-based diagnostic assays available (their mode of action, overall accuracy - both by stage and grade, and their uses and limitations from both a clinical as well as a practical point of view). Aiming to give an insight into the options currently available for noninvasive bladder cancer diagnosis, it also provides prospective comment on what new methods/technologies may be useful in the medium term.

### Urinary markers in bladder cancer [^116DfcBk]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Many markers for the detection of bladder cancers have been tested. Almost all urinary markers reported are better than cytology with regard to sensitivity, but they score lower in specificity. The purpose of this review is to highlight the most important urinary biomarkers studied and reported recently.

Methods

Literature on bladder cancer markers has been reviewed regularly in the last few years. In the current review we have tried to summarise the most recent literature of urinary markers.

Results

The results of this review show that the first-generation urinary markers did not add much to urinary cytology. The current generation of markers is promising but larger clinical trails are needed. The future of marker development is bright with new techniques emerging, but the perfect marker is still to be found.

Conclusion

Currently, no single marker can yet guide us in surveillance and lower the frequency of urethrocystoscopy.

### Comprehensive proteomics and platform validation of urinary biomarkers for bladder cancer diagnosis and staging [^115eZzqF]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Research over the past several years has uncovered potentially important urine biomarkers and tests for BC, including BTA and NMP22. BTA-stat, an FDA-approved urine biomarker, is used clinically to detect bladder tumor-associated antigen (human complement factor H-related protein) in the urine. A meta-analysis of BTA stat reported a specificity of 67% and a sensitivity of 75% after reviewing 13 studies. The sensitivity levels of BTA-stat have been shown to positively correlate with increasing grade of BC. However, BTA-stat has several limitations. These include lower specificity values and issues relating to false-positive results in benign conditions. Hence, urine BTA-stat may have limitations in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. Similarly, NNP22 is an FDA-approved urine biomarker designed to detect the NMP22 protein levels which are high due to cell turnover from tumor apoptosis. A meta-analysis of 19 studies has identified this marker to have a pooled specificity of 88% and a sensitivity of 56%.

### Multi-country clinical practice patterns, including use of biomarkers, among physicians' treatment of BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) [^115ZGKT1]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Bladder cancer is the tenth most common cancer worldwide, with an estimated 573,278 newly diagnosed cases and 212,536 deaths in 2020. Bladder cancer is classified as non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) or muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), depending on the presence or absence of invasion of the primary tumor into the muscle wall of the bladder. Following diagnosis and tumor staging, NMIBC tumors are stratified as 'low-', 'intermediate-', or 'high-risk' according to risk of recurrence and/or progression, based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) scoring tables. Patients in the 'high-risk' group have an increased 5-year risk of recurrence (up to 78%) and progression (up to 45%) according to the EORTC risk stratification tables.

### Sensitivity and specificity of commonly available bladder tumor markers versus cytology: results of a comprehensive literature review and meta-analyses [^114ejk5Q]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the clinical utility of urine-based bladder tumor markers (UBBTMs) and cytology in the treatment of patients with transitional cell carcinoma on the basis of their statistical performance.

Methods

A comprehensive literature review was performed using Medline (1966 to current) and other search engines. Data regarding the statistical performance of UBBTMs were double extracted and rectified. Studies addressing comparable patient populations were combined and hierarchical Bayesian meta-analyses performed to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of commonly used UBBTMs, as well as urinary cytology. Patient populations were stratified by tumor stage and grade when data were presented in an extractable fashion.

Results

The literature review yielded 54 publications, 338 distinct patient groups (controls, screening population, patients with cancer, strata based on grade and stage) and more than 10,000 patients. The number of groups varied from 1 to 18, and the number of patients ranged from less than 100 to more than 1500 for the various markers. All UBBTMs have better sensitivity compared with cytology, especially for low-grade/stage disease, but do not match cytology regarding specificity. In patients with grade 1 and 2 tumors, several UBBTMs are significantly superior statistically in terms of sensitivity compared with cytology. The sensitivity for transitional cell carcinoma in situ (Tis) is surprisingly poor for all UBBTMs.

Conclusions

UBBTMs can be used for follow-up of low-grade/stage tumors but should not replace cystoscopy. All UBBTMs have better sensitivity than cytology and could potentially replace routine cytology during patient follow-up.

### Comprehensive proteomics and platform validation of urinary biomarkers for bladder cancer diagnosis and staging [^112riYHH]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Given these metrics, there is a need for better biomarkers for BC. Urine biomarkers are promising as a non-invasive test for BC. Urine can be obtained non-invasively, is a readily available biological fluid, and is close to the site of pathology. This allows for repeated tests as deemed necessary for both diagnosis and potential monitoring of disease progression. Urine is also advantageous for potential cost-effective point-of-care tests. Emerging urine point-of-care tests may empower individuals to monitor their health from the comfort of their own homes.

As opposed to previous studies in the field examining a handful of proteins selected based on their known properties, here, we report the first and largest use of a comprehensive aptamer-based proteomic screen of urine samples from 42 subjects. This platform has been successfully applied in biomarker screens of several other diseases. Additionally, in the present study, we have executed the largest ELISA validation study in BC, interrogating 30 protein biomarkers in an independent cohort consisting of 68 subjects (31 urology clinic controls (UC) and 37 BC (10 Ta, 10 Tis, 10 T1, and 7 T2–T4)). The study has uncovered novel urine protein biomarkers that have not been reported in BC patients before and that out-perform current biomarkers used in clinical practice. The reported urine biomarkers may be useful for the initial diagnosis of BC and possibly for the surveillance of the disease.

### Treatment of non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer: AUA / ASCO / SUO guideline (2017; amended 2020, 2024) [^114R76Xg]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/ASCO/SUO muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) surveillance — laboratory values and urine markers: "Following therapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, clinicians should monitor laboratory assessment at three to six month intervals for two to three years and then annually thereafter. (Expert Opinion)". After cystectomy and diversion, "all patients should undergo assessment of electrolytes and renal function" and "vitamin B 12 levels should be assessed… in patients with resection of > 60 cm of ileum and in those patients in whom the terminal ileum is utilized". "Routine frequent complete blood count and liver function testing for cancer surveillance has not been validated". For urine cytology, a meta-analysis estimated "it would require 2,000 urinary cytological examinations in order to find a single invasive upper tract cancer", and while it "can be used to monitor for recurrence after cystectomy", "its sensitivity is low for upper tract cancer, and there is difficulty with interpretation after urinary diversion". Interpretation may be further limited because "urine collected from intestinal urinary diversion or previously irradiated bladders may contain desquamated intestinal epithelial cells or atypia due to therapy, which may lower the diagnostic specificity". Overall, "there is insufficient data to support the routine use of cytology or urine-based tumor markers in detection of upper tract urothelial cancers". Although newer biomarkers exist ("either protein-based or cell-based"), "the sensitivity and specificity of these biomarkers does not support the routine use for MIBC post-therapy surveillance", and "these assays have not been thoroughly tested or validated for patients following prior cystectomy with urinary diversion or following bladder preserving therapy".

### Development and characteristics of preclinical experimental models for the research of rare neuroendocrine bladder cancer [^112njWUz]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

For rare cancers such as neuroendocrine bladder cancer treatment options are limited due partly to the lack of preclinical models. Techniques to amplify rare primary neuroendocrine bladder cancer cells could provide novel tools for the discovery of drug and diagnostic targets. We developed preclinical experimental models for neuroendocrine bladder cancer.

Materials and Methods

Fresh tumor tissue from 2 patients with neuroendocrine bladder cancer was used to establish in vitro and in vivo models. We analyzed additional archived tissues in the National Center of Tumor Diseases tissue bank from patients with neuroendocrine bladder cancer. Primary tumor samples were collected during radical cystectomy. PHA-665752 was used to inhibit MET in animal models and cell cultures. The expression of markers and drug targets in neuroendocrine bladder cancer was determined by flow cytometry. The growth of neuroendocrine bladder cancer in vitro was determined by counting live cells. Tumor growth in mice was assessed by measuring tumor volume. Groups were compared using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test.

Results

Xenograft models and serum-free cultures of neuroendocrine bladder cancer cells allowed screening for cell surface markers and drug targets. We found expression of the HGF receptor MET in neuroendocrine bladder cancer cultures, xenograft models and primary patient sections. The growth of neuroendocrine bladder cancer spheroids in vitro depended critically on HGF. Treatment of neuroendocrine bladder cancer bearing mice with a MET inhibitor significantly decreased tumor growth compared to that in control treated mice.

Conclusions

Neuroendocrine bladder cancer xenografts and serum-free cultures provided suitable models in which to identify diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. Using the models, we noted HGF dependent growth of human neuroendocrine bladder cancer and identified MET as a new treatment target for neuroendocrine bladder cancer.

### Serum tissue polypeptide antigen in bladder cancer as a tumor marker: a prospective study… [^117NDJAo]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract Purpose Tissue polypeptide antigen is a differentiation and proliferation tissue marker of epithelia. Increased serum levels were found in some patients with invasive bladder cancer. We present the results of a prospective study that evaluated the role of serum TPA in bladder carcinoma. Patients and Methods The series included 167 patients treated for invasive bladder cancer between 1989 and 1996. S-TPA concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay before treatment, at the end of treatment, and during follow-up evaluation. The upper normal limit of the test was set at 80 UI/L. Results With a specificity of 100%, the diagnostic sensitivity was 46%. Pretherapeutic S-TPA levels were significantly correlated with tumor stage, with nodal stage, and with metastatic stage, but not with histologic grading.

In the subset of patients with normal pretherapeutic S-TPA levels, 95% had no residual disease at the end of treatment, compared with 53% of patients with initial elevated S-TPA. Among patients who achieved a complete response, 27% experienced a relapse, with an increase of S-TPA in 72% of cases. The mean follow-up time was 20 ± 17 months. For patients with normal pretherapeutic S-TPA levels, 3-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 76% and 67% respectively. These were 46% and 25%, respectively, for patients with high pretherapeutic S-TPA. Multivariate analysis showed that S-TPA was an independent prognostic factor for survival. Conclusion In invasive bladder cancer, S-TPA level is correlated with initial tumor stage. It is a valuable parameter for follow-up evaluation and appears to be a prognostic factor in multivariate analysis.

### Tumor markers… [^116ie165]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

CEA A blood test measuring the presence of an antigen in malignancies arising in entodermal or gastrointestinal tissue. Persistent elevated levels indicate residual or recurrent metastatic carcinoma. CEA assay is nonspecific for identifying a primary site, but it does indicate the presence of malignancy. Smokers may have an elevated CEA without malignant disease; smoking may affect accuracy of CEA results. Normal range: < 2. 5 ng/ml. Normal range may vary somewhat depending on the brand of assay used. Levels > 10 ng/ml suggest extensive disease and levels > 20 ng/ml suggest metastatic disease. Flow Cytometry See DNA Studies. Gastrin Differentiates gastrin secreting non-beta islet cell tumors of pancreas; levels above 1000 pg/ml are diagnostic of gastrinoma; also found in some benign conditions. Glucagon Differentiates alpha-cell tumors; levels above 900 are diagnostic of glucagonoma; also present in diabetes and other conditions.

Beta Subunit HCG A serum test used as a tumor marker for choriocarcinoma and for testicular carcinoma. Beta-HCG levels are never found in normal men. When the presence of B-HCG is detected in serum it always indicates a malignancy. Also called: &-HCG, beta-HCG, beta chain HCG. In patients with testicular cancer who have had an orchiectomy, the presence of beta-HCG will confirm the patient has residual cancer that requires further treatment. However, when beta-HCG does not exist in the serum, the presence of active cancer cannot be excluded, especially in patients who have been previously treated. Normal range: 0 ng/ml. LDH1:

18. **1% to 29% of the total LDH2**:
29. 4% to 37. 5% of the total LDH3:
18.
