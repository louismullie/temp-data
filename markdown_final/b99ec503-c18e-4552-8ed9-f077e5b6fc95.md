## Question

Is propylthiouracil indicated for managing hyperparathyroidism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether propylthiouracil (PTU) is indicated for managing hyperparathyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about PTU's FDA-labeled indications and pharmacology. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of hyperparathyroidism to see if there is any plausible therapeutic overlap. Next, I will review guideline-supported treatments for primary hyperparathyroidism, including both surgical and medical options. After that, I should consider special scenarios such as pregnancy, where confusion between thyroid and parathyroid management commonly occurs. Finally, I will synthesize the evidence and confirm whether PTU has any role at all in hyperparathyroidism management.

> Let me first confirm the drug's identity and labeled uses. PTU is an antithyroid thioamide that inhibits thyroid peroxidase to reduce thyroid hormone synthesis and also decreases peripheral T4-to-T3 conversion, and it is approved for Graves' disease with hyperthyroidism and toxic multinodular goiter, as well as perioperative control or when methimazole is not appropriate, and it is used in thyroid storm dosing protocols, but there is no labeled or guideline-supported indication for any parathyroid disorder including hyperparathyroidism [^115CtzdW] [^116WwBdD] [^1129TjKb] [^116BsELq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should align mechanism with disease biology. Hyperparathyroidism is driven by autonomous or dysregulated parathyroid hormone secretion from parathyroid tissue, producing hypercalcemia and end-organ effects, whereas PTU targets thyroid hormone synthesis and conversion, which does not influence the parathyroid hormone axis or the calcium-sensing receptor pathway implicated in hyperparathyroidism, so mechanistically PTU has no therapeutic target in this disease [^114guUzo] [^115CtzdW].

> Next, I should review what is actually recommended for primary hyperparathyroidism. I need to check the surgical standards first. The only curative therapy is parathyroidectomy, and major guidelines recommend surgery for symptomatic patients and many asymptomatic patients who meet criteria such as calcium at least 1 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal, skeletal or renal involvement, or age below 50 years, which directly addresses the disease biology by removing the hypersecreting parathyroid tissue [^111yQyJ6] [^116tzkNS] [^114guUzo].

> I will now examine nonsurgical options when surgery is deferred or contraindicated. Wait, let me verify the preferred agents. Cinacalcet, a calcimimetic, is guideline-recommended to lower serum calcium in primary hyperparathyroidism, and the FDA label documents its efficacy in surgical candidates who cannot undergo parathyroidectomy, while antiresorptives such as bisphosphonates or denosumab are used to improve bone mineral density and vitamin D repletion is advised if deficient, but none of these recommendations include antithyroid drugs like PTU [^1152z3aX] [^117254cz] [^113LsBWi] [^111Gy74C] [^1163j2zS].

> But wait, what if the confusion is pregnancy-related. I should confirm the distinction. In pregnancy, PTU is preferred early for the management of maternal hyperthyroidism to reduce teratogenic risk relative to methimazole, whereas for hyperparathyroidism during pregnancy, the guidance emphasizes surgery as the definitive therapy and cautions that data for cinacalcet are very limited and that bisphosphonates and denosumab should be avoided, and again, there is no role for PTU in the management of hyperparathyroidism even in pregnancy [^112fq8aj] [^111T89sC] [^114s8iNK].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could altering thyroid status indirectly impact calcium and create a rationale for PTU. Let me reconsider and double-check. Although thyroid hormones influence bone turnover, the hypercalcemia and complications in primary hyperparathyroidism are driven by excessive parathyroid hormone secretion, and controlling thyroid hormone synthesis with PTU neither normalizes PTH nor treats the autonomous parathyroid source, so this does not provide a therapeutic justification for PTU in hyperparathyroidism [^114guUzo].

> Synthesizing the evidence, I need to ensure my conclusion is consistent across labels, mechanisms, and guidelines. PTU is indicated for hyperthyroidism and thyroid storm, not for parathyroid disorders, while evidence-based hyperparathyroidism management relies on parathyroidectomy for cure and cinacalcet or antiresorptives for selected nonsurgical scenarios, so PTU has no role in managing hyperparathyroidism [^116WwBdD] [^111yQyJ6] [^1152z3aX] [^113LsBWi].

Propylthiouracil (PTU) is **not indicated for hyperparathyroidism** [^1129TjKb] because it does not affect parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion [^115CtzdW] or calcium metabolism. PTU is an antithyroid drug [^116BsELq] used for hyperthyroidism, not hyperparathyroidism [^116WwBdD]. The recommended medical therapy for hyperparathyroidism is **cinacalcet** [^1152z3aX], which lowers serum calcium [^117254cz] by activating the calcium-sensing receptor. PTU should not be used for hyperparathyroidism due to lack of efficacy and risk of serious adverse effects [^116KgFPQ], including severe liver injury and agranulocytosis [^114stPbk].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of propylthiouracil

PTU inhibits **thyroid hormone synthesis** by blocking **thyroid peroxidase** [^115CtzdW] and peripheral conversion of **T4 to T3**, thereby reducing thyroid hormone levels and the symptoms of hyperthyroidism [^116BsELq]. It has no effect on PTH secretion or calcium metabolism and is therefore not appropriate for hyperparathyroidism.

---

## Clinical indications for propylthiouracil

PTU is indicated for:

- **Graves' disease or toxic multinodular goiter** [^116BsELq] when methimazole is not tolerated or surgery/RAI is not appropriate [^116WwBdD].
- **Preoperative preparation** for thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine therapy in methimazole-intolerant patients [^116WwBdD] [^116u3PPR].
- **First trimester of pregnancy** [^111T89sC] when antithyroid therapy is needed [^112fq8aj].

PTU is **not indicated** for hyperparathyroidism [^1129TjKb].

---

## Current medical management of hyperparathyroidism

Medical management of hyperparathyroidism focuses on reducing serum calcium and PTH levels [^114guUzo]. The primary pharmacological agent is **cinacalcet** [^1152z3aX], a calcimimetic that activates the calcium-sensing receptor, thereby reducing PTH secretion and serum calcium. Cinacalcet is recommended [^1152z3aX] for patients who are not surgical candidates or as adjunctive therapy [^111Gy74C].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines do not recommend **PTU** for **hyperparathyroidism**. PTU is indicated for hyperthyroidism, not hyperparathyroidism; instead, cinacalcet is recommended [^1152z3aX] to lower serum calcium and PTH levels [^114guUzo].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of propylthiouracil

PTU has **significant adverse effects**, including:

- **Severe liver injury**, liver failure, and death [^114stPbk] [^116u3PPR].
- **Agranulocytosis** and severe infections [^114stPbk] [^116KgFPQ].
- **Vasculitis** and other serious complications.

Given these risks and lack of efficacy, **PTU should not be used for hyperparathyroidism** [^1129TjKb].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

PTU is **not indicated** for hyperparathyroidism because it does not affect PTH secretion or calcium metabolism [^115CtzdW]. Cinacalcet is the **recommended medical therapy** [^1152z3aX], which effectively lowers serum calcium and PTH levels. Given its lack of efficacy and significant adverse effects, PTU should not be used for hyperparathyroidism [^114stPbk].

### Propylthiouracil [^115CtzdW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Propylthiouracil inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones and is thus effective in treating hyperthyroidism. The drug does not inactivate existing thyroxine and triiodothyronine stored in the thyroid or circulating in the blood, nor does it interfere with the effectiveness of thyroid hormones administered orally or by injection. Propylthiouracil inhibits the conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine in peripheral tissues, and may therefore be an effective treatment for thyroid storm.

Propylthiouracil is readily absorbed and is extensively metabolized. Approximately 35% of the drug is excreted in the urine, in both intact and conjugated forms, within 24 hours.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^117MfMgy]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Mild pHPT is often overtly asymptomatic but can cause silent organ damage, which progresses over time. It is known that some patients will suffer progressive hypercalcemia or organ damage, but, even today, there is no way of predicting which patients with biochemically mild pHPT will benefit from surgery. Therefore, it is important to evaluate every indication for treatment, even in patients with mild pHPT.

A study in a North American specialist clinic reported the same frequency of nephrolithiasis in normocalcemic patients as in those with hypercalcemia. However, bone density was higher in the normocalcemic patients. In a group consisting of 52 patients with pHPT, but not meeting any indications for treatment at baseline, 27% of conservatively managed patients developed at least one indication for surgery over a 10-year period. Surgery also had the same effect on normalizing serum calcium and PTH, as well as on self-reported symptoms, regardless of whether patients were normocalcemic or hypercalcemic before surgery. One study reported that the effect of parathyroidectomy on quality of life in patients with mild pHPT was at least as good as in hypercalcemic patients.

Based on these facts, international guidelines recommend careful investigation of possible organ damage and symptoms after considering differential diagnoses and establishing the diagnosis of pHPT. Selected cases should be offered surgery, and those not meeting indications for treatment should be offered regular checks of serum calcium and monitoring for the development of organ damage.

### Hyperparathyroidism in pregnancy: options for localization and surgical therapy [^116Y9uwP]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism in pregnancy poses a significant threat to the health of both mother and fetus. Mothers commonly suffer from nephrolithiasis, hyperemesis, or even a hypercalcemic crisis. If untreated, the disease can complicate fetal development, with fetal death being a significant risk. Treatment options, including medical and surgical therapy, are widely debated in the literature.

- **Methods**: This is a case series comprising seven patients with primary hyperparathyroidism in pregnancy. Data collected included symptoms at diagnosis, biochemical abnormalities, pathological findings, treatment regimens, and subsequent maternal and fetal outcomes.

- **Results**: Seven women, aged 20 to 39 years, presented with hyperparathyroidism during pregnancy. The earliest presentation was at 8 weeks, and the latest at 38 weeks. Four of the seven patients experienced renal calculi. Calcium levels ranged from 2.7 to 3.5 mmol/l. All were found to have solitary parathyroid adenomas, with two located in ectopic sites. Fetal complications included three preterm deliveries and one fetal death, with no cases of neonatal tetany. Maternal and fetal complications could not be predicted based on the duration or severity of hypercalcemia. Three patients underwent surgery during pregnancy, two of whom required reoperations for ectopic glands using a novel approach with Tc-99m sestamibi scanning during pregnancy to assist in localizing the abnormal gland. Four cases were treated postpartum with a combination of open and minimally invasive approaches after localization. There were no operative complications or fetal loss related to surgical intervention.

### Methodology for the guidelines on evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism [^114jRBXb]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

To develop guidelines for hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism, a panel of experts in parathyroid disorders, general endocrinologists, representatives of the Hypoparathyroidism Association, and systematic review and guideline methodologists was assembled. The guideline panel adhered to a formal process following the Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) methodology to issue GRADEd recommendations. In this approach, panelists and methodologists formulated the questions, conducted systematic reviews, evaluated risk of bias, assessed the certainty of evidence, and presented a summary of findings in a transparent fashion.

For most recommendations, the task forces employed a less structured approach largely based on narrative reviews to issue non-GRADEd recommendations. The panel issued eight GRADEd recommendations (seven for hypoparathyroidism and one for hyperparathyroidism). Each GRADEd recommendation is linked to the underlying body of evidence and judgments regarding the certainty of evidence, strength of recommendations, values and preferences, and considerations of costs, feasibility, acceptability, and equity. This article summarizes the methodology for issuing GRADEd and non-GRADEd recommendations for patients with hypoparathyroidism or hyperparathyroidism.

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: Evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^112cGVE2]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

HypoPTH most commonly occurs after irreversible damage or removal of parathyroid glands during neck surgery for thyroid goiter, head and neck cancer, or hyperparathyroidism. There are multiple definitions of postsurgical HypoPTH (PH) reported in literature. According to Asari et al, the term refers to a decrease of PTH with or without symptoms related to hypocalcemia, or to the neuromuscular symptoms related to postoperative calcium levels between 1.9 and 2.1 mmol/L. However, it is best defined as an undetectable or inappropriately low postoperative PTH combined with hypocalcemia, with or without hypocalcemic symptoms.

- **Classification**: It is classified into two subtypes, depending on the duration of symptoms:
	- Transient HypoPTH persists for a period of ≤ 12 months and appears within 48 hours of surgery.
	- Permanent HypoPTH persists for > 12 months, accounting for the minority of cases.

If PTH values are > 10 pg/mL 12–24 hours postoperatively, the development of permanent HypoPTH is very unlikely. Although it usually occurs early postoperatively, cases of HypoPTH presentation years after neck surgery have been described. Hypocalcemia is the most frequent complication after thyroidectomy. It is estimated that transient HypoPTH occurs in 25.4–83% of patients worldwide after neck surgery, whereas permanent HypoPTH occurs in 0.12–4.6% of patients. The profound variation in incidence highlights the need for increased awareness of the condition. Extensive or repeated neck operations, Graves' disease history, and total thyroidectomy are high-risk factors.

### The management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^114h1XPC]. Clinical Endocrinology (2002). Low credibility.

Recent improvements in parathyroid imaging have led to renewed interest in the criteria for and the surgical approach to parathyroidectomy. It therefore seemed appropriate to review evidence relating to the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism for those working within a general endocrine service. The recommendations are based on an electronic search spanning the past decade using the search terms hyperparathyroidism, management, and parathyroidectomy/surgery. However, we have also included key publications outside this period. The findings have been graded systematically (Appendix) according to the quality of the information available to indicate the level of evidence on which they are based.

### Role of parathyroid intervention in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism [^1157Dzhz]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Measurement of the size of the parathyroid glands is mandatory for the selection of the optimal therapy for secondary hyperparathyroidism. Surgical parathyroidectomy or parathyroid intervention is indicated for patients with nodular hyperplasia, as this form is seldom responsive to medical therapy. Selection of the intervention should be determined by the number, size, and location of the parathyroid glands with nodular hyperplasia, including ectopic glands.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: What is the role of parathyroid surgery [^117UPCBt]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

A key question remains as to whether normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism (nPHPT) should be considered a different entity from hypercalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism (hPHPT) or if they can be managed using a single approach. Studies have reported that nPHPT presents differently from hPHPT, such as with a higher incidence of multi-glandular disease; however, other studies have shown that a proportion of normocalcaemic patients will progress to hypercalcaemia. In line with this, a standardized approach to managing primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) irrespective of serum calcium appears appropriate, and the aforementioned NICE guidance for PHPT surgical referral remains applicable for nPHPT. However, it is important that discussions regarding surgery are individualized and patient expectations are comprehensively explored. This involves counseling the patient to ensure an adequate understanding of both the positive (a reduction in end-organ effects) and adverse (risk of surgical complications) outcomes that may occur following surgery.

For clinicians, it is also important to avoid routinely screening parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels unless there is evidence to suggest measurement would be appropriate. This includes evidence of calcium homeostasis disturbance, renal dysfunction, and occasionally if there is vitamin D deficiency.

- **Limitations of the literature**: Many of the studies investigating the role of surgery in the treatment of nPHPT consist of a relatively small cohort of patients. This is compounded by comparative studies in the field generally having a significantly larger number of hPHPT patients relative to nPHPT patients. Future studies should address these limitations to provide clearer guidance.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for definitive management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^111yQyJ6]. JAMA Surgery (2016). High credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is a common clinical problem for which the only definitive management is surgery. Surgical management has evolved considerably during the last several decades. The objective is to develop evidence-based guidelines to enhance the appropriate, safe, and effective practice of parathyroidectomy.

A multidisciplinary panel conducted an evidence review by using PubMed to review the medical literature from January 1, 1985, to July 1, 2015. Levels of evidence were determined using the American College of Physicians grading system, and recommendations were discussed until consensus was reached.

- **Findings**: Initial evaluation should include 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurement, 24-hour urine calcium measurement, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and supplementation for vitamin D deficiency. Parathyroidectomy is indicated for all symptomatic patients, should be considered for most asymptomatic patients, and is more cost-effective than observation or pharmacologic therapy.

	- **Operative planning**: Cervical ultrasonography or other high-resolution imaging is recommended. Patients with nonlocalizing imaging remain surgical candidates. Preoperative parathyroid biopsy should be avoided. Surgeons who perform a high volume of operations have better outcomes. The possibility of multigland disease should be routinely considered. Both focused, image-guided surgery (minimally invasive parathyroidectomy) and bilateral exploration are appropriate operations that achieve high cure rates.

For minimally invasive parathyroidectomy, intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring is conducted via a reliable protocol.

### Cinacalcet to prevent parathyrotoxic crises in hypercalcaemic patients awaiting parathyroidectomy [^112wvLUB]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the third most common endocrine disorder. Hypercalcaemia exceeding 3 mmol/L is a major risk factor for parathyrotoxic crises, and the management of patients at risk remains a medical challenge. The authors recently managed three such patients referred for severe nephrolithiasis, all of whom had severe hypercalcaemia (at least 3 mmol/L).

Instead of the usual management, which involves hospitalization in an intensive care environment for about 5–7 days for rehydration and infusion of intravenous bisphosphonates, followed by emergency parathyroidectomy, the three patients received ambulatory cinacalcet (not an approved indication), 30 mg twice a day. The serum calcium normalized in two cases and declined to a safe level in the third case, allowing minimally invasive parathyroidectomy to be performed at a date chosen according to the patients' and surgeon's respective schedules. The authors consider that cinacalcet may benefit severely hypercalcaemic patients awaiting surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Clinical and practical use of calcimimetics in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism [^113mZBwt]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CKD-related mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBDs) are associated with high cardiovascular and mortality risks. In randomized clinical trials (RCTs), no single drug intervention has been shown to reduce the high mortality risk in dialysis patients. However, several robust secondary analyses point toward important potential beneficial effects of controlling CKD-MBD-related factors and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

The advent of cinacalcet, which has a unique mode of action at the calcium-sensing receptor, represented an important step forward in controlling CKD-MBD. New RCTs have conclusively shown that cinacalcet improves the achievement of target levels for all of the metabolic abnormalities associated with CKD-MBD and may also attenuate the progression of vascular and valvular calcifications in dialysis patients. However, a final conclusion on the effect of cinacalcet on hard outcomes remains elusive.

Tolerance of cinacalcet is limited by frequent secondary side effects such as nausea, vomiting, hypocalcemia, and oversuppression of parathyroid hormone, which may cause some management difficulties, especially for those lacking experience with the drug. Against this background, this review aims to summarize the results of studies on cinacalcet, up to and including the publication of the recent ADVANCE and EVOLVE RCTs, as well as recent post hoc analyses. It also offers practical guidance on how to improve the clinical management of the most frequent adverse events associated with cinacalcet, based on both currently available information and personal experience.

### Safety and efficacy of PTH 1–34 and 1–84 therapy in chronic hypoparathyroidism: A meta-analysis of prospective trials [^116VHx2w]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Our meta-analysis of the largest available number of treated patients demonstrates that PTH replacement therapy is well tolerated, safe, and effective in the management of hypoparathyroidism. Unlike conventional supplementation, it has beneficial effects on serum phosphate, calcium-phosphate product, and urinary calcium excretion, which are currently unmet needs in chronic hypoparathyroidism. Based on available data, no significant differences between PTH 1–34 and PTH 1–84 have been demonstrated in most outcomes, except for a beneficial effect of PTH 1–84 in reducing the calcium-phosphate product. It also improves several extrarenal outcomes, such as quality of life (QoL) and bone turnover. In addition to its indication as second-line treatment in patients with refractory hypocalcemia, our results support the use of PTH replacement therapy in patients for whom hyperphosphatemia and increased urinary calcium excretion are clinical concerns.

### Management of thyroid disorders in pregnancy: Green-top guideline no. 76 [^112fq8aj]. BJOG (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of thyroid disease in pregnancy, specifically concerning the management of hyperthyroidism, the RCOG 2025 guidelines recommend initiating propylthiouracil as the preferred antithyroid drug during early pregnancy if treatment is required. It is advised to switch to propylthiouracil if conception occurs on carbimazole, ensuring this change happens as soon as possible before 10 weeks of gestation. The recommended dose ratio for this switch is 1:20 (carbimazole:propylthiouracil). However, if the presentation occurs after 10 weeks of gestation, a switch to propylthiouracil is not recommended.

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: New issues and new questions — bridging the past with the future [^11266dkG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

The earliest clinical descriptions of PHPT pointed to an inexorably progressive disorder. Now, in many asymptomatic individuals who do not meet any surgical guidelines, PHPT in general does not seem to be progressive. Most asymptomatic patients seem to remain asymptomatic over many years of observation.

In those with major clinical manifestations, nephrolithiasis is by far the most common. In these patients, surgery is clearly indicated. Bone densitometry is an indispensable component of the evaluation and monitoring because there is evidence of bone involvement in most patients. This contrasts with the skeletal X-ray, which is invariably negative. Nevertheless, patients with PHPT can show a bone mass measurement either at the cortical or cancellous skeleton that is more than 2 SDs below age- and sex-matched control subjects. Bone density, serum calcium concentration, and/or urinary calcium excretion per se can show evidence for progression in as many as 25% of patients with asymptomatic PHPT.

There are newer pharmacologic approaches to PHPT that are the subject of intense investigation. The bisphosphonates and the calcimimetics show particular promise in this regard. Unanswered questions include whether the lower bone density in milder patients will increase substantially as in those who undergo successful parathyroidectomy and whether fracture risk would therefore be reduced. Can medical therapy reduce serum calcium, parathyroid hormone levels, and other biochemical indices of PHPT? Can medical therapy improve bone density without the need for surgery?

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: What is the role of parathyroid surgery [^111JjFxX]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Patient work up and assessment with regard to candidates for surgery is essential. At present, for PHPT as a whole, referral for surgery is deemed necessary if patients are symptomatic, if there is end-organ involvement, or if serum calcium levels are greater than 2.85 mmol/L. NICE also recommends to "consider" surgery for those who do not fulfill the above criteria. This appears to be a reasonable starting point for nPHPT patients, as those who may stand to benefit from prevention of progression of end-organ effects can be referred for surgery. Questions remain, however, on whether surgery is beneficial in reducing the risk of various non-skeletal and renal outcomes in nPHPT and whether alternative criteria should be developed.

- **Localisation studies**: Prior to surgery, ultrasonography and radionuclide scanning are utilized in an attempt to localize a parathyroid adenoma. However, studies have shown that imaging in nPHPT is less successful compared with hPHPT, posing an additional challenge from a surgical perspective. In their case series of 616 patients, Trinh et al. reported a significantly higher incidence of multi-glandular disease (p = 0.002) in nPHPT patients, with 12% of nPHPT patients having multi-glandular disease compared with 4% of hPHPT patients. Moreover, Gómez-Ramírez et al. reported that parathyroid adenomas of nPHPT patients weighed on average 656 mg less than those of hPHPT patients (p = 0.058). These findings of a greater incidence of multi-glandular disease and smaller adenomas in nPHPT patients highlight significant surgical challenges.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^114guUzo]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2018). High credibility.

In this review, we describe the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), with a focus on recent advances in the field. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone. Most often, the presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic in regions of the world where serum levels of calcium are routinely measured. In addition to mild hypercalcemia, PHPT can manifest with osteoporosis, hypercalciuria, vertebral fractures, and nephrolithiasis, both of which can be asymptomatic. Other clinical forms of PHPT, such as classical disease and normocalcemic PHPT, are less common.

Parathyroidectomy, the only curative treatment for PHPT, is recommended for patients with symptoms and those with asymptomatic disease who are at risk of progression or have subclinical evidence of end-organ sequelae. Parathyroidectomy results in an increase in bone mineral density (BMD) and a reduction in nephrolithiasis. Various medical therapies can increase BMD or reduce serum levels of calcium, but no single drug can do both. More data are needed regarding the neuropsychological manifestations of PHPT and the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to sporadic PHPT, as well as on risk factors for complications of the disorder. Future work that advances our knowledge in these areas will improve management of the disorder.

### Natpara (parathyroid hormone) [^112Euznm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these signs and symptoms of high or low blood calcium levels.

What is Natpara?

Natpara is a prescription parathyroid hormone (PTH) used with calcium and vitamin D to control low blood calcium (hypocalcemia) in people with low PTH blood levels (hypoparathyroidism). Natpara is only for people who do not respond well to treatment with calcium and active forms of vitamin D alone, because it may increase the possible risk of bone cancer (osteosarcoma). Natpara was not studied in people with hypoparathyroidism caused by calcium-sensing receptor mutations. Natpara was not studied in people who develop sudden hypoparathyroidism after surgery.

It is not known if Natpara is safe and effective for children 18 years of age and younger. Natpara should not be used in children and young adults whose bones are still growing.

Do not use Natpara if you are allergic to parathyroid hormone or any of the ingredients in Natpara. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in Natpara.

Before you start using Natpara, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

### Sensipar [^117254cz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Sixty-seven patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) who met the criteria for parathyroidectomy based on corrected total serum calcium levels (> 11.3 mg/dL [2.82 mmol/L] and ≤ 12.5 mg/dL [3.12 mmol/L]), but were unable to undergo parathyroidectomy, participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 33 patients were randomized to receive Sensipar, while 34 patients were assigned to placebo. The mean age of the patients was 72 years; 52% were female, 61% were Caucasian, and 5% were Black.

- **Study phases**: The study began with a 12-week titration phase, followed by a 16-week efficacy-assessment phase. Cinacalcet was initiated at a dose of 30 mg twice daily and titrated to maintain a corrected total serum calcium concentration within the normal range.

During the efficacy period, a significantly higher percentage of cinacalcet-treated patients, compared to placebo-treated patients, achieved a mean corrected total serum calcium concentration (≤ 10.3 mg/dL [2.57 mmol/L], 75.8% vs. 0%, p < 0.001) and a ≥ 1 mg/dL [0.25 mmol/L] decrease from baseline in mean corrected total serum calcium concentration (84.8% vs. 5.9%, p < 0.001). The median dose of Sensipar at the completion of the study was 60 mg/day.

### Medical management of primary hyperparathyroidism: Proceedings of the fourth international workshop on the management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism [^1163j2zS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The only available definitive therapy is parathyroidectomy, which is appropriate to consider in all patients. The purpose of this report is to provide an update on calcium and vitamin D supplementation and medical management for those patients with PHPT who cannot or do not want to undergo surgery.

- **Methods**: Questions were developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken, and relevant articles published between 2008 and 2013 were reviewed in detail. The questions were addressed by the panel of experts, and consensus was established at the time of the workshop.

- **Conclusions**: The recommended calcium intake in patients with PHPT should follow guidelines established for all individuals. It is not recommended to limit calcium intake in patients with PHPT who do not undergo surgery. Patients with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be repleted with doses of vitamin D aiming to bring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to ≥ 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) at a minimum, but a goal of ≥ 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) also is reasonable.

	- Pharmacological approaches are available and should be reserved for those patients in whom it is desirable to lower the serum calcium, increase bone mineral density (BMD), or both. For the control of hypercalcemia, cinacalcet is the treatment of choice. Cinacalcet reduces serum calcium concentrations to normal in many cases, but has only a modest effect on serum PTH levels. However, bone mineral density (BMD) does not change. To improve BMD, bisphosphonate therapy may be considered.

### Hemodialysis patients' preferences for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism [^113BgLLJ]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) ask patients to choose among hypothetical treatment options defined by attributes that can take on different levels. By analyzing the pattern of responses to a series of hypothetical treatment-choice questions, it is possible to infer the tradeoffs patients are willing to make among treatment attributes.

- **Survey instrument development**: Five steps were involved in developing the DCE survey instrument: a literature review, a review of patient resources issued by the National Kidney Foundation (NKF), nephrologist input, and a focus group and qualitative pretest interviews with ESRD patients with SHPT to ensure that the survey questions were clear and comprehensible and to identify any refinements that were necessary before administration of the survey. The first three steps informed the preliminary selection of potentially relevant SHPT attributes. The Additional file 1: appendix provides additional details about the focus group and qualitative pretests and presents the final survey instrument.

The DCE survey instrument, consistent with good research practices, was developed to elicit respondents' preferences for three hypothetical treatment options — surgery and two medication alternatives — in a series of questions. The hypothetical treatments were defined by efficacy, safety and tolerability, mode of administration, and out-of-pocket cost attributes.

### Mild primary hyperparathyroidism: A literature review [^115ACQ1q]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

The biochemical profile of classic primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) consists of both elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. The standard of care is parathyroidectomy unless prohibited by medical comorbidities. Because more patients are undergoing routine bone density evaluation and neck imaging studies for other purposes, there is a subset of people identified with a biochemically mild form of the pHPT that expresses itself as either elevated calcium or parathyroid hormone levels. These patients often do not fall into the criteria for operation based on the National Institutes of Health consensus guidelines and can present a challenge of diagnosis and management.

The purpose of this paper is to review the available literature on mild pHPT in an effort to better characterize this patient population and to determine whether patients benefit from parathyroidectomy. Evidence suggests that there are patients with mild pHPT who have overt symptoms that improve after parathyroidectomy. There is also a group of patients with biochemically mild pHPT who are found to progress to classic pHPT over time; however, it is not predictable which group of patients this will be. Early intervention for this group with mild pHPT may prevent progression of bone, psychiatric, and renal complications, and parathyroidectomy has proven safe in appropriately selected patients at high volume centers.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: An update on diagnostic and management challenges [^114Tu7pc]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition that can present with intermittent hypercalcemia or may evolve into hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. This milder biochemical entity remains incompletely understood because of a lack of long-term health outcomes regarding both medical and surgical approaches to its management. Medical therapies have shown some efficacy. A limited number of studies have found that bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density, and calcimimetics may decrease the risk of nephrolithiasis in patients with normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism.

Studies have also described patient outcomes after applying the same surgical criteria used for patients with hypercalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism to those with the normocalcaemic form of the disease. These studies suggest that parathyroid surgery appears to be effective in normalizing elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentrations and decreasing adverse renal and skeletal outcomes in patients with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism.

Given the available data and overall lack of consensus regarding the optimal management of these patients, a reasonable approach is to tailor treatment to the individual patient by considering their risk factors for new or accelerated bone loss, kidney stones, diminished quality of life, and cardiovascular disease.

### Thyroid disease in pregnancy: ACOG practice bulletin, number 223 [^111T89sC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperthyroidism, particularly in pregnant patients, the ACOG 2020 guidelines recommend initiating thioamides, either propylthiouracil or methimazole, in pregnant patients with overt hyperthyroidism. The choice of medication should depend on the trimester of pregnancy, response to prior therapy, and whether the thyrotoxicosis is predominantly T4 or T3.

### Safety and efficacy of 5 years of treatment with recombinant human parathyroid hormone in adults with hypoparathyroidism [^111hiVMH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) plays a central role in mineral homeostasis by stimulating renal reabsorption of calcium, promoting renal phosphate excretion, and stimulating the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D), the fully active form of vitamin D. Moreover, 1,25[OH]2D enhances the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, PTH is a potent regulator of bone turnover, which is the coupled process of bone resorption and bone formation. Deficiency of PTH results in decreased bone turnover.

Conventional therapy for hypoparathyroidism includes oral calcium and active vitamin D (e.g. calcitriol), as well as thiazide diuretics and magnesium supplementation as needed. Although this approach can correct the hypocalcemia associated with hypoparathyroidism, it does not replace other functions of PTH and can lead to or worsen hypercalciuria. Other concerns with conventional therapy include unpredictable episodes of hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia, increased serum calcium-phosphorus (Ca × P) product, and complications such as extraskeletal calcifications, nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and decreased kidney function. Reduced quality of life and symptoms of hypocalcemia are consistent findings among patients with hypoparathyroidism receiving conventional treatment.

### When would I use medical therapies for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism [^112DEB6V]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Although there may be controversy surrounding the indications for parathyroidectomy in primary hyperparathyroidism, it remains the only accepted definitive therapy. However, even if parathyroidectomy is indicated, some patients refuse surgery, are medically unfit, or have residual or recurrent disease inaccessible to further surgery. Some of these patients may be suitable for long-term observation, but others require intervention for the management of symptomatic or moderate to severe hypercalcemia, loss of bone mineral density, or renal calculi. The selection of a suitable therapy for each patient should be individualized.

### Approach to the patient: Management of parathyroid diseases across pregnancy [^112GUCcN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Parathyroid disorders during pregnancy are relatively rare and are characterized by disturbances in calcium and mineral metabolism. In primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), elevated or inappropriately high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels increase serum calcium concentrations, while in hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT), reduced or inadequately low PTH levels lead to hypocalcemia. PHPT is a common endocrine disease with a female predominance and an age-dependent increase in prevalence, whereas HypoPT is a rare condition that is mainly caused by anterior neck surgery.

Management of parathyroid disorders during pregnancy can be challenging and significantly differs in various ways from nonpregnant patients. Scientific evidence from systematic evaluations regarding this issue is very limited, particularly concerning maternal management and fetal outcomes. Clinicians taking care of pregnant patients with parathyroid disorders not only require sufficient knowledge of the pathophysiology of the diseases themselves but also need to understand the physiology of pregnancy. Pregnancy induces fundamental changes in bone and mineral metabolism in women during pregnancy and lactation.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^114xjQLs]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether patients presenting with laboratory results consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) are managed in accordance with guidelines.

The methods involved searching the laboratory database at a hospital in Sweden, serving 127,000 inhabitants, for patients with biochemically determined pHPT. In 2014, a total of 365 patients with biochemical laboratory tests consistent with pHPT were identified. Patients with possible differential diagnoses or other reasons for not being investigated according to international guidelines were excluded after scrutinizing records, new blood tests, and clinical assessments by endocrine surgeons.

The results showed that 92 patients had been referred to specialists and 82 had not. The latter group had lower serum calcium (median 2.54 mmol/L) and PTH (5.7 pmol/L). Out of these 82 cases, 9 patients were diagnosed with pHPT or had some sort of long-term follow-up planned as outpatients.

In conclusion, primary hyperparathyroidism is overlooked and underdiagnosed in a number of patients in the clinical setting. It is important to provide local guidelines for the management of patients presenting with mild pHPT to ensure that these patients receive proper evaluation and follow-up according to research.

### The treatment of renal hyperparathyroidism [^116D1XNZ]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2020). Low credibility.

Renal hyperparathyroidism (rHPT) is a complex and challenging disorder. It develops early in the course of renal failure and is associated with increased risks of fractures, cardiovascular disease, and death. It is treated medically, but when medical therapy cannot control the hyperparathyroidism, surgical parathyroidectomy is an option.

In this review, we summarize the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and medical treatment of rHPT; we describe the effects of renal transplantation; and discuss the indications and strategies in parathyroidectomy for rHPT. Renal hyperparathyroidism develops early in renal failure, mainly as a consequence of lower levels of vitamin D, hypocalcemia, diminished excretion of phosphate, and inability to activate vitamin D.

Treatment consists of supplying vitamin D and reducing phosphate intake. In later stages, calcimimetics might be added. RHPT refractory to medical treatment can be managed surgically with parathyroidectomy. Risks of surgery are small but not negligible. Parathyroidectomy should likely not be too radical, especially if the patient is a candidate for future renal transplantation. Subtotal or total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation are recognized surgical options. Renal transplantation improves rHPT but does not cure it.

- **Hypercalciuria**: A 24-hour urine calcium level greater than 400 mg/dL with increased stone risk.
- **Impaired renal function**: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 mL/min.

### New perspectives in the management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^1116jEy2]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a biochemical syndrome caused by the inappropriate or unregulated overproduction of parathyroid hormone, leading to hypercalcemia. It was previously considered a relatively rare disorder, with clinical manifestations dominated by renal and/or bone disease. However, in modern times, the diagnosis is most frequently recognized coincidentally on biochemical testing in patients evaluated for unrelated complaints. Parathyroidectomy is the only curative treatment for PHPT, with improved outcomes in symptomatic patients following this procedure. However, surgical intervention in patients with no clear clinical features remains controversial.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) have developed consensus guidelines giving specific indications for when surgery is recommended in patients with asymptomatic PHPT. This article examines the impact of treatment on asymptomatic PHPT, focusing on bone disease, neurocognitive function, quality of life, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. Medical treatment options, including bisphosphonates and cinacalcet, are also discussed.

### Nonsurgical management of mild primary hyperparathyroidism - a reasonable option [^1139fnCF]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a relatively common disorder often diagnosed incidentally and characterized in the majority of those affected by mild, stable biochemical abnormalities and a lack of symptoms. Nephrolithiasis and bone loss, leading to an increased risk of fracture, are generally accepted complications of PHPT. Some epidemiological studies report associations between PHPT and a wide range of common diseases, but these relationships may be confounded by the increased body weight observed in PHPT.

Because there is a dearth of controlled clinical trial evidence in PHPT, optimal management is controversial. For individuals with mild, stable PHPT, low fracture risk, and no renal stones, observation without intervention is reasonable. Surgical treatment is clearly indicated for patients at risk of severe hypercalcaemia or with nephrolithiasis.

For individuals with increased risk of fracture, antiresorptive therapies improve bone mineral density to a similar degree to surgical treatment. Calcimimetic agents may have a role in managing patients with symptomatic PHPT who cannot undergo, or fail, surgical treatment. There is a need for additional randomized clinical trials to inform the management of PHPT.

### Propylthiouracil [^116u3PPR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

If you get pregnant while taking propylthiouracil, call your doctor right away about your therapy.

Propylthiouracil is a prescription medicine used to treat people who have Graves' disease with hyperthyroidism or toxic multinodular goiter. Propylthiouracil is used when certain other antithyroid medicines do not work well, when thyroid surgery or radioactive iodine therapy are not treatment options, and to decrease symptoms of hyperthyroidism in preparation for a thyroidectomy (removal of the thyroid gland) or radioactive iodine therapy. Propylthiouracil is not recommended for use in children.

- **Who should not take propylthiouracil**: Do not take propylthiouracil if you are allergic to propylthiouracil or any of its ingredients. See the end of this medication guide for a complete list of ingredients in propylthiouracil.

- **What should I tell my doctor before taking propylthiouracil**: Before you take propylthiouracil, tell your doctor if you plan to have surgery, have any other medical conditions, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Propylthiouracil may harm or cause death to your unborn baby. Propylthiouracil can pass into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby if you take propylthiouracil.

### Imaging techniques in parathyroid surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism [^117SAzJp]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2011). Low credibility.

As more patients present with the incidental diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism due to biochemical screening, treatment guidelines have been developed for the treatment of hyperparathyroidism. The management of primary hyperparathyroidism has evolved in recent years, with considerable interest in minimally invasive approaches. Successful localization of the diseased gland(s) by nuclear imaging and anatomical studies, along with rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay, has allowed for focused and minimally invasive surgical approaches. Patients in whom the localization studies have identified a single-gland adenoma or unilateral disease are candidates for such focused approaches instead of the traditional approach of bilateral exploration. These imaging techniques have also been critical in the successful management of patients with persistent or recurrent disease.

### Management of hypoparathyroidism: Summary statement and guidelines [^111L7Zex]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare disorder characterized by hypocalcemia and absent or deficient PTH. This report presents a summary of information about epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, clinical features, and management, and proposes guidelines to help clinicians diagnose, evaluate, and manage this disorder.

Participants in the First International Conference on the Management of Hypoparathyroidism represented a worldwide constituency with acknowledged interest and expertise in key basic, translational, and clinical aspects of hypoparathyroidism. Three workshop panels were constituted to address questions for presentation and discussion at the conference held in Florence, Italy, from May 7 to 9, 2015. At that time, a series of presentations were made, followed by in-depth discussions in an open forum. Each workshop panel also met in closed sessions to formulate the three evidence-based reports that accompany this summary statement. An expert panel then considered this information, developed summaries, guidelines, and a research agenda that constitutes this summary statement.

Preceding the conference, each workshop panel conducted an extensive literature search as noted in the individual manuscripts accompanying this report. All presentations were based upon the best peer-reviewed information, taking into account historical and contemporary literature.

This report represents the expert panel's synthesis of the conference material, placed in a context designed to be relevant to clinicians and those engaged in cutting-edge research.

### Management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^112EhSbW]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

Since the last international guidelines were published in 2014 on the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), new information has become available with regard to evaluation, diagnosis, epidemiology, genetics, classical and nonclassical manifestations, surgical and nonsurgical approaches, and natural history. To summarize these developments, an international group of over 50 experts in these various aspects of PHPT was convened. This paper provides the results of the task force that was assigned to review the information on the management of PHPT.

For this task force on the management of PHPT, two questions were the subject of systematic reviews using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. The full report addressing surgical and nonsurgical management of PHPT, utilizing the GRADE methodology, is published separately in this series. In this report, we summarize the results of that methodological review and expand them to encompass a much larger body of new knowledge that did not specifically fit the criteria of the GRADE methodology.

Together, both the systematic and narrative reviews of the literature, summarized in this paper, provide the most complete information available at the time of writing. A panel of experts then considered the last set of international guidelines in light of the newer data and assessed the need for their revision. This report provides the evidentiary background to the guidelines report. In that report, evidence from all task forces is synthesized into a comprehensive overview.

### Calcium citrate versus calcium carbonate in the management of chronic hypoparathyroidism: A randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial [^116jzWQ6]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

This randomized, double-blind, crossover, single-center study was conducted from October 2019 to April 2020. Subjects with postsurgical chronic hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) were consecutively screened at the bone outpatient clinic of Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus Bio-Medico. The diagnosis of postsurgical chronic HypoPT was established at least 6 months after surgery based on clinical and biochemical features, including low or inappropriately normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels with low calcium levels on at least two prior occasions separated by an interval of at least 30 days.

All patients underwent thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer, nontoxic goiter, or Graves' disease. Subjects who were initially included met the following criteria: men or women, aged 18 to 75 years; no change of treatment (calcium supplements: calcium carbonate and active vitamin D) over a 3-month period before enrollment; stable serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations and absence of hypocalcemic symptoms over the 3 months before enrollment; and a requirement for active vitamin D (calcitriol ≥ 0.25 mcg daily) and oral calcium (≥ 1000 mg daily). All subjects had 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) values higher than 20 ng/mL, as suggested by the European Society of Endocrinology guidelines for the management of hypoparathyroidism.

We excluded patients with a clinical history and/or ultrasound evidence of kidney stones, liver or renal failure (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 30 mL/min), hypercalcemia detected in the last year, hyperthyroidism from any cause, other calcium metabolism disorders, and/or using th.

### Skeletal effects of primary hyperparathyroidism [^112xV9qE]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

To review the effect of primary hyperparathyroidism on bone mass and the occurrence of fractures, as well as the advances in medical management of this relatively common condition, we conducted a MEDLINE search of peer-reviewed publications from 1960 to 1999. The studies reviewed evaluated bone mass and fracture risk in primary hyperparathyroidism in both male and female populations. Additionally, studies that assessed interventions with hormone replacement therapy, bisphosphonates, calcimimetic agents, and surgical treatment and their effects on bone mass and fractures were reviewed. Preference was given to prospective studies, but retrospective, cross-sectional, and case-control studies were also evaluated.

Most densitometry studies completed at the time of writing have been limited by their design. Some cross-sectional studies that used both single-photon absorptiometry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry have demonstrated preferential bone loss at cortical skeletal sites, while bone density seems to be relatively well-preserved at cancellous bone sites. The absence of large prospective controlled trials makes it difficult to evaluate fracture incidence associated with hyperparathyroidism. Retrospective and case-control studies have found conflicting results relative to fracture incidence in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroidectomy has been shown to be of value in improving bone mineral density at both the lumbar spine and the femoral neck. Hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with primary hyperparathyroidism has al

### Is minimally invasive parathyroid surgery an option for patients with gestational primary hyperparathyroidism [^111bkNco]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Gestational primary hyperparathyroidism (GPHPT) is a rare and often unrecognized condition. Surgical treatment is the optimal and definitive treatment for GPHPT and has been shown to reduce the incidence of life-threatening maternal and fetal complications such as preeclampsia, miscarriage, and hypercalcemic crisis. Surgery during pregnancy is indicated for all patients with GPHPT, even if hypercalcemia is mild and there are no established complications. Open bilateral neck exploration represents the gold standard for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism. However, in the last decade, a variety of minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) techniques have been developed. In selected patients, MIP has shown similar cure rates to open bilateral neck exploration but with less postoperative pain, shorter postoperative stay, reduced overall patient distress, and better cosmetic outcomes.

- **Review of GPHPT**:
	- We review the clinical significance of GPHPT along with the indications and timing of surgery. Additionally, we review the different MIP options available for the treatment of GPHPT and present one patient with GPHPT successfully treated, with bilateral neck exploration performed using a minimally invasive video-assisted technique.

- **Case report**:
	- A 38-year-old pregnant woman, at 9 weeks of gestation, was admitted to the hospital with severe hyperemesis, thirst, and polyuria. Routine investigations showed low TSH 0.04 mIU/l (0.4–4), mildly elevated free T4 23.4 pmol/l (10.6–20.5), normal free T3 5.6 pmol/l (3.3–6.2), and elevated corrected calcium 2.61 mmol/l (2.17–2.46).

### Thyroid disease in pregnancy: ACOG practice bulletin, number 223 [^114V7ZVK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of thyroid disease in pregnancy, specifically in managing hyperthyroidism, the ACOG 2020 guidelines recommend initiating thioamides, either propylthiouracil or methimazole, in pregnant patients with overt hyperthyroidism (Level A). The choice of medication depends on the trimester of pregnancy, response to prior therapy, and whether the thyrotoxicosis is predominantly T4 or T3 (Level B).

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for definitive management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115b2HTc]. JAMA Surgery (2016). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for primary hyperparathyroidism, particularly in the context of parathyroidectomy (a minimally invasive surgery), the AAES 2016 guidelines recommend conversion to bilateral exploration if any of the following conditions are encountered during minimally invasive parathyroidectomy:

- **Discovery of multigland disease**: An indicator of more complex pathology requiring thorough exploration.
- **Inability to identify an abnormal gland**: This necessitates a broader exploration to ensure all affected glands are assessed.
- **Failure to achieve an appropriate intraoperative PTH monitoring decrease**: Indicates possible residual hypersecreting tissue, prompting further exploration.

### Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: Summary statement from the fourth international workshop [^111dqGvZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is routinely encountered in clinical endocrinology practices worldwide. This report updates information on diagnostics, clinical features, and management of this disease into a set of revised guidelines.

Participants representing an international constituency, with interest and expertise in various facets of asymptomatic PHPT, formed four workshop panels that developed key questions to be addressed. They convened in an open three-day conference from September 19–21, 2013, in Florence, Italy, where a series of presentations and discussions addressed these questions. A smaller subcommittee, the Expert Panel, then met in a closed session to reach an evidence-based consensus on how to address the questions and data aired in the open forum.

Preceding the conference, each question was addressed through a relevant, extensive literature search. All presentations and deliberations of the workshop panels and the Expert Panel were based on the latest information from this literature search. The Expert Panel considered all the evidence provided by the individual workshop panels and then reached a consensus.

In view of new findings since the last International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic PHPT, guidelines for management have been revised. The revised guidelines include recommendations for more extensive evaluation of the skeletal and renal systems and criteria for skeletal and/or renal involvement as determined by further evaluation.

### Sensipar [^115yKtfs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hypocalcemia**: In 26-week studies of patients with secondary HPT and CKD on dialysis, 66% of patients receiving Sensipar, compared with 25% receiving placebo, developed at least one serum calcium value less than 8.4 mg/dL. Furthermore, 29% of patients receiving Sensipar, compared with 11% of patients receiving placebo, developed at least one serum calcium value less than 7.5 mg/dL. Less than 1% of patients in each group permanently discontinued the study drug due to hypocalcemia.

- **Extended study results**: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving patients with secondary HPT and CKD receiving dialysis, patients were treated for up to 64 months (with a mean duration of 21 months in the cinacalcet group). In this study, 75% of patients receiving Sensipar, compared with 29% of those receiving placebo, developed at least one serum calcium value less than 8.4 mg/dL. Additionally, 33% of cinacalcet patients, compared with 12% of patients receiving placebo, had at least one serum calcium value less than 7.5 mg/dL. Most severe hypocalcemia cases, defined as less than 7.5 mg/dL (21/33 = 64%), occurred during the first six months. Notably, 1.1% of patients receiving Sensipar and 0.1% of those receiving placebo permanently discontinued the study drug due to hypocalcemia.

- **52-week study**: During the placebo-controlled part of a 52-week study in patients with primary HPT who met criteria for parathyroidectomy based on corrected total serum calcium (> 11.3 mg/dL), further observations were made on the effects of Sensipar.

### What medical options should be considered for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115Ndujv]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common, often asymptomatic, endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcemia in the presence of a nonsuppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. For individuals with symptomatic disease or those meeting surgical criteria, parathyroidectomy is the preferred treatment option. However, patients who do not meet surgical criteria, or cannot or choose not to undergo surgery, must be managed medically. The medical management of PHPT includes:

- **Continual assessment**: Determine who will benefit from surgical intervention.
- **Replacement of vitamin D**: Support overall health and calcium regulation.
- **Treatment of parathyroid bone disease**: Address complications arising from the disorder.
- **Management of hypercalcemia and renal stone disease**: Prevent further complications and maintain kidney health.

This comprehensive approach ensures that patients receive appropriate and effective care tailored to their specific needs.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: Cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^113r2BDi]. Endocrine Practice (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, particularly concerning thyroid replacement therapy (choice of agent and dosing), the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering starting levothyroxine in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism at generally lower doses (25–75 mcg/day, depending on the degree of TSH elevation) than required in the treatment of overt hypothyroidism. Further adjustments should be guided by clinical response and follow-up laboratory determinations, including TSH values.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: Summary statement and guidelines from the fifth international workshop [^116tzkNS]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for primary hyperparathyroidism, particularly concerning parathyroidectomy, the PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend performing surgery in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism when one or more of the following conditions are present, including those who are asymptomatic, if there are no contraindications:

- **Serum calcium levels**: ≥ 1 mg/dL (≥ 0.25 mmol/L) above the upper limit of normal (ULN).

- **Skeletal involvement**: Such as a fracture identified by vertebral fracture assessment or vertebral X-ray, or bone mineral density with a T-score ≤ -2.5 at any site.

- **Renal involvement**: Such as decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis on imaging studies, or elevated urinary calcium excretion (> 250 mg/day in women; > 300 mg/day in men).

- **Age criterion**: Age < 50 years (no other indications are necessary; age < 50 years is a sufficient indication).

### Sensipar [^111KFxga]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Monitoring for hypocalcemia**: Once the maintenance dose has been established, serum calcium should be measured approximately monthly for patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism with CKD on dialysis, and every 2 months for patients with parathyroid carcinoma or primary hyperparathyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

	- For secondary hyperparathyroidism patients with CKD on dialysis, if serum calcium falls below 8.4 mg/dL but remains above 7.5 mg/dL, or if symptoms of hypocalcemia occur, calcium-containing phosphate binders and/or vitamin D sterols can be used to raise serum calcium. If serum calcium falls below 7.5 mg/dL, or if symptoms of hypocalcemia persist and the dose of vitamin D cannot be increased, withhold administration of Sensipar until serum calcium levels reach 8.0 mg/dL and/or symptoms of hypocalcemia have resolved. Treatment should be reinitiated using the next lowest dose of Sensipar [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Modern trends for primary hyperparathyroidism: Intervening on less biochemically severe disease [^117LTAW7]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is defined by autonomous parathyroid hormone secretion, which has broad physiologic effects. Parathyroidectomy is the only cure and is recommended for patients demonstrating symptomatic disease and/or end organ damage. However, there may be a benefit to intervening before the development of complications. We sought to characterize institutional trends in the biochemical and symptomatic presentation of PHPT and the associated cure and complication rates.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 1087 patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for PHPT, evaluating patients at 2-year intervals between 2002 and 2019. We identified signs and symptoms of PHPT based on the 2016 American Association of Endocrine Surgery Guidelines. Trends were evaluated with Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-square tests, and Fisher's exact tests.

- **Results**: Patients with PHPT are presenting with lower parathyroid hormone (P = 0.0001) and calcium (P = 0.001) in the era. Parathyroidectomy is more commonly performed for borderline guideline-concordant patients with osteopenia (40.2%) and modest calciuria (median 246 mg/dL/24 h). 93.7% are cured, with no difference over time or between groups by guideline concordance.

- **Conclusions**: Parathyroidectomy is increasingly performed for patients who demonstrate modest bone and renal dysfunction. Patients experience excellent cure rates and rarely experience postoperative hypocalcemia, suggesting a role for broader surgical indications.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^114UfBxq]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of X-linked hypophosphatemia, particularly in relation to tertiary hyperparathyroidism:

- **Calcimimetic usage**: The XLH-EG 2025 guidelines recommend considering the administration of calcimimetics in patients with severe hyperparathyroidism despite normocalcemia, or in those with hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism that has failed to respond to other treatments.

Use cinacalcet with caution in patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia, as it has been associated with severe adverse effects, namely hypocalcemia and increased QT interval.

### Natpara (parathyroid hormone) [^1138aANe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Natpara is a parathyroid hormone indicated as an adjunct to calcium and vitamin D to control hypocalcemia in patients with hypoparathyroidism.

- **Indications and usage**: Natpara is recommended only for patients who cannot be well-controlled on calcium supplements and active forms of vitamin D due to the potential risk of osteosarcoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. It was not studied in patients with hypoparathyroidism caused by calcium-sensing receptor mutations. Additionally, Natpara was not studied in patients with acute post-surgical hypoparathyroidism.
