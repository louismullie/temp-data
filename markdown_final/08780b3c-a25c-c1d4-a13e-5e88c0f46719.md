## Question

will next years flu vaccine be fully accurate or is it unknown

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether next year's flu vaccine will be "fully accurate" or if that remains unknown. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "fully accurate" means in the context of influenza vaccines. Then, I should verify how vaccine strains are selected and why that process is inherently uncertain. Next, I will review historical vaccine effectiveness data to quantify how often mismatches occur and how much they matter. After that, I should consider biological and manufacturing constraints that limit accuracy. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and outline what is known versus unknown about the upcoming season's match and effectiveness.

> Let me first confirm what "fully accurate" implies here. In influenza vaccination, "accuracy" is best understood as the antigenic match between the vaccine strains chosen months in advance and the viruses that actually circulate in the upcoming season, which directly influences vaccine effectiveness in preventing medically attended influenza illness [^a24a34e1] [^8a6e91e8].

> I need to check the strain selection process and its timing, because that drives uncertainty. The WHO meets about six to eight months before each hemisphere's season to choose candidate vaccine viruses based on surveillance, antigenic characterization, and forecasting. However, influenza viruses evolve continuously via antigenic drift, so the circulating strains in the target season can diverge from those selected months earlier, creating a mismatch risk that is not predictable with certainty [^8a6e91e8] [^43b540ca].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify how often mismatches happen and how much they reduce effectiveness. Historical U.S. effectiveness estimates vary widely by season, with VE ranging from roughly 19% to 60% when assessed against outpatient medically attended influenza, and several seasons have shown markedly reduced VE due to poor antigenic match, particularly for H3N2, including the 2014–2015 season with VE around 19% and the 2021–2022 season with nonsignificant VE against H3N2, underscoring that "fully accurate" matches are not guaranteed and do not occur every year [^a24a34e1] [^e55eb34d] [^a02d2a5f].

> Wait, let me verify the biological and manufacturing constraints that further limit accuracy. Egg-based production can introduce egg-adaptation mutations in hemagglutinin that alter antigenicity and reduce match to circulating viruses, and even cell-based and recombinant platforms must anticipate which clades will predominate months ahead, a prediction problem that remains fundamentally probabilistic rather than deterministic [^7a9eb257] [^8a6e91e8].

> I should double-check whether any current or emerging tools can reliably ensure a perfect match. Computational approaches like beth-1 and VaxSeer show promise for improving strain selection and correlating with better antigenic match, but these are supportive tools that refine, rather than eliminate, the inherent uncertainty of forecasting viral evolution months in advance, so they do not guarantee "full accuracy" for a given season [^31794db5] [^19666384].

> Let me consider the upcoming season specifically. For 2025–2026, the H3N2 component has been updated while H1N1 and B/Victoria are unchanged, and public health authorities expect the strains to match circulating viruses, but that expectation is based on the best available surveillance and modeling. It is not a guarantee, and the true match will only be known retrospectively after circulation begins and VE estimates are generated [^1f073f1e] [^2a8ee84c].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. No, next year's flu vaccine will not be "fully accurate" with certainty, because strain selection must be made months before circulation, influenza viruses evolve unpredictably, and historical effectiveness varies substantially by season. However, modern surveillance and emerging computational tools improve the odds of a good match, and vaccination remains worthwhile even in partial-mismatch seasons because it still reduces illness, hospitalizations, and deaths across the population [^a24a34e1] [^8a6e91e8] [^0e89d901].

---

It is **unknown** whether next year's flu vaccine will be fully accurate because influenza viruses constantly evolve through antigenic drift and shift [^e65f06dc], making it impossible to predict circulating strains with certainty months in advance [^982b3ee8]. Vaccine effectiveness varies by season and is typically **40–60% when well matched** [^a24a34e1], but can be lower in mismatch years [^e55eb34d]. Manufacturers and public health agencies update vaccine strains each year based on global surveillance [^43b540ca], yet perfect alignment with circulating viruses cannot be guaranteed [^8a6e91e8]. Even in partial mismatch, vaccination still reduces severe outcomes, so annual immunization remains recommended [^3aedaaec].

---

## Factors influencing vaccine accuracy

Several factors influence the accuracy of influenza vaccine predictions:

- **Antigenic drift and shift**: Influenza viruses undergo continuous antigenic drift (minor changes) and occasional antigenic shift (major changes), altering their surface proteins and potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness [^e65f06dc].

- **Strain selection timing**: Vaccine strains are selected 6–8 months before the influenza season based on surveillance data and predictions, allowing time for manufacturing but increasing the risk of mismatch due to viral evolution [^8a6e91e8].

- **Manufacturing process**: Most vaccines are produced in eggs, which can introduce mutations that may affect antigenicity and reduce effectiveness, particularly for H3N2 strains [^7a9eb257].

- **Circulating virus diversity**: Multiple influenza strains circulate each season, and predicting which will predominate is challenging, further complicating vaccine accuracy [^8a6e91e8].

---

## Historical vaccine effectiveness

Vaccine effectiveness (VE) varies by season, depending on the match between vaccine strains and circulating viruses:

| **Season** | **Vaccine effectiveness (%)** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| 2010–2011 | 60 | Well-matched season |
| 2014–2015 | 19 | Poor match, particularly for H3N2 |
| 2016–2017 | 43 | Moderate match |
| 2019–2020 | 45 | Moderate match |
| 2021–2022 | 16 | Low effectiveness against H3N2 |

---

These data illustrate that **VE typically ranges from 19% to 60%**, with lower effectiveness in mismatch years [^a24a34e1].

---

## Current predictive methods and their limitations

Current methods for predicting circulating influenza strains include:

- **Global surveillance**: WHO coordinates a global surveillance network to monitor circulating strains and guide vaccine strain selection [^db561359].

- **Predictive models**: Computational models incorporating antigenic cartography and evolutionary dynamics are used to forecast viral evolution and guide strain selection [^e677abf6].

- **Artificial intelligence**: Emerging AI-based models, such as VaxSeer, show promise in improving strain selection by predicting antigenic match and vaccine effectiveness [^19666384].

Despite these efforts, **limitations remain**:

- **Uncertainty in viral evolution**: Predicting exact viral mutations and their impact on antigenicity remains challenging [^e677abf6].

- **Limited data**: Incomplete surveillance data, particularly from low-resource settings, can hinder accurate predictions [^c99c1fe7].

- **Time lag**: The 6–8 month gap between strain selection and vaccine administration remains a significant limitation [^8a6e91e8].

---

## Impact of vaccine mismatch

Vaccine mismatch occurs when circulating strains differ significantly from vaccine strains, reducing effectiveness. However, even in mismatch years, vaccination provides partial protection and reduces the severity of illness, hospitalizations, and deaths [^3aedaaec]. For example, during the 2014–2015 season, despite low overall effectiveness, vaccination prevented an estimated 7.1 million illnesses, 3.7 million medical visits, 109,000 hospitalizations, and 8,000 deaths in the United States [^549f5086].

---

## Ongoing research and improvements

Research efforts focus on developing **universal influenza vaccines** that target conserved viral epitopes, potentially providing broader and longer-lasting protection [^b524a7d1]. Advances in mRNA technology and novel adjuvants are also being explored to improve vaccine effectiveness and reduce production time [^e21b1358].

---

## Conclusion

It is **unknown** whether next year's flu vaccine will be fully accurate due to the inherent unpredictability of influenza virus evolution and the limitations of current prediction methods. However, ongoing surveillance, predictive modeling, and advances in vaccine technology continue to improve the likelihood of a good match. Even in years with partial mismatch, vaccination remains beneficial in reducing the burden of influenza-related illness and complications [^0e89d901].

### Influenza (flu) vaccine safety… [^dd6ef47f]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Overview Influenza can be a mild or severe illness, and its complications can result in hospitalization or death. Some people are at a higher risk for developing serious flu complications, including older adults, young children, and people with certain health conditions. You can protect against severe flu illness with vaccination. CDC, working with FDA and other federal agencies, continuously monitors flu vaccines using several safety systems. Available vaccines CDC recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone ages 6 months and older. Types of flu vaccines There are two types of flu vaccines for use in the United States: injectables and nasal spray. Injectables Injectables include inactivated influenza vaccines, high-dose IIV, adjuvanted flu vaccines, cell-based flu vaccines, and recombinant flu vaccines. Injectable flu vaccines do not contain live flu viruses.

For people ages 65 years and older FDA has approved the following flu vaccines for people ages 65 years and older:

- Fluad Quadrivalent, an adjuvanted flu vaccine
- Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent, a quadrivalent vaccine that contains four times the antigen of standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines. Who should & should not get the vaccine CDC recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone ages 6 months and older with any flu vaccine licensed by FDA that is appropriate for the recipient's age and health status. Vaccination is particularly important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from the flu. See information for:

- People who can get the flu vaccine
- People who should not get a flu vaccine
- People who should talk to their healthcare provider before getting a flu vaccine Keep Reading: Who Needs a Flu Vaccine.

A closer look at the safety data Fact Findings from vaccine safety monitoring systems and scientific studies have shown that flu vaccines have an excellent safety profile. Hundreds of millions of Americans have safely received flu vaccines for more than 50 years. The body of scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports their safety. CDC and FDA monitor the safety of flu vaccines. FDA must license the vaccine, and it must be appropriate for the recipient's age and health status before it can be made available for public use. Below, you will find additional safety information on Guillain-Barré Syndrome, maternal and infant safety, febrile seizures, and narcolepsy. Guillain-Barré Syndrome The data on an association between seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine and GBS varies from season to season. When there has been an increased risk, it has been in the range of 1–2 additional GBS cases per million flu vaccine doses administered.

The data also show that a person is more likely to get GBS after flu disease than after getting a flu vaccine. Keep Reading: Vaccines and Guillain-Barré Syndrome.
- CDC and other scientific institutions have conducted multiple studies that have examined the risk of miscarriage following flu vaccination. The extensive body of evidence does not suggest a link between flu vaccination and miscarriage. Keep Reading: Flu & Pregnancy. Narcolepsy after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine In response to the events in Europe, CDC reviewed data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and the Vaccine Safety Datalink and found:

- There was no indication of any association between U. S. -licensed H1N1 or seasonal flu vaccine and narcolepsy.
- Flu vaccines containing the 2009 H1N1 virus strain used in the United States did not increase the risk for narcolepsy.

Vaccination prevents a substantial number of influenza-related illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths annually. However, better protection and improved vaccination coverage are needed to realize the full potential of influenza vaccines. Evaluation of influenza vaccine effectiveness is an essential component of ongoing efforts to improve influenza vaccines. Influenza activity remains elevated in the United States, highlighting the importance of vaccination. CDC will continue to monitor influenza disease throughout the season to better understand the impact of vaccination, identify factors associated with reduced protection, and support efforts to improve influenza vaccines.

### Public health-driven research and innovation for next-generation influenza vaccines, European union [^8d914e40]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite existing for 80 years, influenza vaccines have substantial shortcomings related to their availability and effectiveness. The reasons include their production from embryonated eggs and a lengthy manufacturing process. Another challenge is in the efficacy of the vaccines themselves, which is related to the immune response they elicit, in particular the waning of vaccine-specific antibodies, as well as the antigenic drift and the unpredictability of annual vaccine strain selection and the lack of accurate correlates of protection for influenza vaccines. The fact that current seasonal influenza vaccines fail to protect against drifted seasonal influenza viruses or novel pandemic viruses is a major issue. During recent influenza seasons, overall vaccine effectiveness has been as low as 19% (in 2014–15 in the Northern Hemisphere). Moreover, effectiveness of influenza vaccines is particularly low in the elderly, a group that is most susceptible to the disease and its complications. Aging is associated with the progressive deterioration of the immune system, referred to as immunosenescence, and with a chronic low-grade proinflammatory state, inflammaging. These 2 interrelated phenomena are an important cause of low influenza vaccine effectiveness in this age group. In addition, uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine in risk groups in the WHO European Region is low and even declining in several EU countries.

Although the idea seems counterintuitive, recent studies point to a so-called pandemic paradox, finding that previous exposure to influenza virus strains can enhance susceptibility during pandemics. The occurrence of vaccine-associated antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection is of concern and has implications for the design of multiple boost vaccination schedules from a clinical perspective.

Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) also face particular challenges with influenza. These countries often have restricted funding for vaccine provision and low or absent regional vaccine manufacturing capacity, which means they often have limited capacity to stockpile influenza vaccines or to respond adequately to seasonal or pandemic influenza. Surveillance data on the influenza burden in LMICs are limited, but a recent report suggested that seasonal influenza was associated with 28,000–111,500 deaths globally from acute lower respiratory infections in children < 5 years of age and that 99% of these deaths occurred in LMICs. This stark imbalance highlights the need to improve influenza vaccination in a way that will benefit those who suffer the greatest burden. To address this situation, WHO, within the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework, has reached agreements with vaccine manufacturers for pledges of over 400 million doses of pandemic vaccine in real time during the next pandemic.

### Influenza vaccines in adults [^416e9eb9]. Occupational Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Available influenza vaccines contain inactivated viruses, either whole or in parts, and are administered parenterally or intranasally. Their composition varies yearly because of viral antigenic shifts and drifts. Vaccines with a composition matching yearly World Health Organization recommendations are 72% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 54–83%] efficacious (prevention of influenza cases caused by influenza viruses A and B). Their effectiveness [capacity to prevent clinical influenza, or influenza-like illness (ILI)] is lower, at 37% (95% CI = 18–52%). A decision to vaccinate an adult population has to take into account the efficacy of the vaccines and their effectiveness (the likely proportion of ILI caused by influenza A and B viruses, amenable to prevention by vaccination), as well as costs and likely compliance. As the yearly levels of circulating A and B viruses are difficult to predict during the decision time for a vaccination campaign, there is a considerable element of uncertainty regarding the likely effectiveness of 'this year's' vaccine.

### Current and future influenza vaccines [^e65f06dc]. Nature Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Although antiviral drugs and vaccines have reduced the economic and healthcare burdens of influenza, influenza epidemics continue to take a toll. Over the past decade, research on influenza viruses has revealed a potential path to improvement. The clues have come from accumulated discoveries from basic and clinical studies. Now, virus surveillance allows researchers to monitor influenza virus epidemic trends and to accumulate virus sequences in public databases, which leads to better selection of candidate viruses for vaccines and early detection of drug-resistant viruses. Here we provide an overview of current vaccine options and describe efforts directed toward the development of next-generation vaccines. Finally, we propose a plan for the development of an optimal influenza vaccine.

### Universal influenza vaccines: a realistic option? [^810e9cb1]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

The extensive antigenic drift displayed by seasonal influenza viruses and the risk of pandemics caused by newly emerging antigenically distinct influenza A viruses of novel subtypes has raised considerable interest in the development of so-called universal influenza vaccines. We review options for the development of universal flu vaccines and discuss progress that has been made recently.

### Interim estimates of 2021–22 seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness-United States, February 2022 [^a70b8f8f]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Although influenza virus circulation and laboratory-confirmed influenza associated hospitalizations declined from late December 2021 through January 2022, some regions of the United States have seen increases in influenza activity since that time. Influenza activity is difficult to predict, and strategies to prevent influenza illness remain important to reduce strain on health care services. Vaccination against seasonal influenza might protect against other influenza viruses that could circulate later in the season and their potentially serious complications. Clinicians should consider diagnostic testing for patients with ARI, especially among hospitalized patients and those at increased risk for complications. All hospitalized patients and all outpatients at higher risk for serious complications from influenza should be treated as soon as possible with a neuraminidase inhibitor medication if influenza is suspected. Physicians should not wait for confirmatory influenza laboratory testing, and the decision to use antiviral medication should not be influenced by patient influenza vaccination status. Clinicians should be aware that influenza activity might continue or increase, and influenza should be considered as a possible diagnosis in all patients with ARI.

### Interim estimates of 2017–18 seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness-United States, February 2018 [^37f297b4]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

In the United States, annual vaccination against seasonal influenza is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months (1). During each influenza season since 2004–05, CDC has estimated the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine to prevent laboratory-confirmed influenza associated with medically attended acute respiratory illness (ARI). This report uses data from 4,562 children and adults enrolled in the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (U.S. Flu VE Network) during November 2, 2017-February 3, 2018. During this period, overall adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) against influenza A and influenza B virus infection associated with medically attended ARI was 36% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 27%-44%). Most (69%) influenza infections were caused by A(H3N2) viruses. VE was estimated to be 25% (CI = 13% to 36%) against illness caused by influenza A(H3N2) virus, 67% (CI = 54%-76%) against A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and 42% (CI = 25%-56%) against influenza B viruses. These early VE estimates underscore the need for ongoing influenza prevention and treatment measures. CDC continues to recommend influenza vaccination because the vaccine can still prevent some infections with currently circulating influenza viruses, which are expected to continue circulating for several weeks. Even with current vaccine effectiveness estimates, vaccination will still prevent influenza illness, including thousands of hospitalizations and deaths. Persons aged ≥ 6 months who have not yet been vaccinated this season should be vaccinated.

### Reproducible and later vaccine strain selection can improve vaccine match to A / H3N2 seasonal influenza viruses [^8a6e91e8]. NPJ Vaccines (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seasonal influenza virus infections lead to considerable health and economic burdens every year, causing an estimated 291,000 to 646,000 respiratory deaths and affecting 5–15% of the global population. The most common strategy for protection against seasonal influenza viruses is vaccination. However, due to the evolutionary capacity of seasonal influenza viruses, frequent changes to its antigenic phenotype to escape immune responses raised to prior infections and vaccinations necessitate regular vaccine updates. Currently available seasonal influenza vaccines target the immunodominant hemagglutinin (HA) surface protein, with most vaccines being produced in chicken eggs. The manufacturing process of these egg-based vaccines requires 6–8 months, As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) convenes biannually in February and September to select the influenza vaccine strains for the upcoming seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively. The WHO selects one strain for each influenza subtype, including A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm, and B/Victoria. The vaccine strains are selected by expert consensus based on a variety of evidence, including molecular and surveillance data, antigenic hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assay data, structural protein modeling data, growth characteristics, immunogenicity, and forecasts/predictions of virus circulation and clade frequencies at the start of the next influenza season.

Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) varies from season to season, depending on a variety of factors such as the match between the vaccine strain and the circulating strains, population exposure history, antigenic drift, and an assortment of other host- and virus-specific factors –. In the United States (US), VE estimates fluctuated between 19% and 60% between the 2010–2011 season and the 2022–2023 season, with the exclusion of the COVID-19 pandemic 2020–2021 season. Estimates for VE in Europe varied from 14.4% to 61% between the 2010–2011 season and the 2022–2023 season, excluding the 2020–2021 season –. In Australia, the VE was estimated to fluctuate between 37% and 60% between the 2012 season and the 2019 season –. Overall, VE estimates for A/H3N2 tend to be lower compared to the other subtypes. During some seasons with low VE, a mismatch between the vaccine strain and the circulating strain has been reported.

### Influenza vaccines: past, present, and future [^45b8bd59]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Globally, infection by seasonal influenza viruses causes 3–5 million cases of severe illness and 290,000–650,000 respiratory deaths each year. Various influenza vaccines, including inactivated split- and subunit-type, recombinant and live attenuated vaccines, have been developed since the 1930s when it was discovered that influenza viruses could be cultivated in embryonated eggs. However, the protection rate offered by these vaccines is rather low, especially in very young children and the elderly. In this review, we describe the history of influenza vaccine development, the immune responses induced by the vaccines and the adjuvants applied. Further, we suggest future directions for improving the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in all age groups. This includes the development of an influenza vaccine that induces a balanced T helper cell type 1 and type 2 immune responses based on the understanding of the immune system, and the development of a broad-spectrum influenza vaccine that can increase effectiveness despite antigen shifts and drifts, which are characteristics of the influenza virus. A brighter future can be envisaged if the development of an adjuvant that is safe and effective is realized.

### Interim estimates of 2013–14 seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness-United States, February 2014 [^30f707df]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, vaccination status included self-report at three of five sites; dates of vaccination were available only for persons with documented vaccination obtained from medical records or immunization registries. Verification of vaccination status at all sites will be available for end-of-season VE estimates, which might differ from interim estimates. Second, information from medical records and immunization registries is needed to evaluate VE for fully versus partially vaccinated children (certain children aged < 9 years require 2 vaccine doses) and by vaccine type (e.g. inactivated compared with live attenuated), as well as to evaluate the effects of prior season vaccination; end-of-season analysis of VE for the two most common vaccine types and effects of partial or prior season vaccination is planned. Third, the observational study design has greater potential for confounding and bias than do randomized clinical trials. However, a recent study found that the study design used by the U.S. Flu VE Network produced unbiased VE estimates when applied to analysis of data from randomized placebo-controlled trials. In this interim report, adjustment for age, study site, and potential confounding factors identified in previous studies resulted in adjusted estimates that were similar to crude estimates, although final estimates will adjust for additional potential confounders, such as chronic medical conditions, for which information was not available for interim estimates. Finally, end-of-season VE estimates could change as additional patient data become available or if there is a change in circulating viruses late in the season. Also, the VE estimates in this report are limited to the prevention of outpatient medical visits, rather than more severe illness outcomes, such as hospitalization or death; additional studies to measure VE against more severe outcomes are warranted.

### Poor immunogenicity, not vaccine strain egg adaptation, may explain the low H3N2 influenza vaccine effectiveness in 2012–2013 [^7a9eb257]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Vaccination is one of the most important public health interventions to mitigate the annual threat of influenza. Each season, an estimated 4% of individuals aged < 65 years seek outpatient care for influenza-related symptoms, and 12000–56000 people die from influenza infection in the United States. Vaccination in the US population has been increasing, with coverage in the 2016–2017 season ranging from 76% in those aged 6–23 months to 33.6% in individuals aged 18 to 49 years and 65.3% in individuals aged ≥ 65 years. However, the vaccine effectiveness (VE) continues to be modest, particularly against the A(H3N2) viruses, with a recent metaanalysis reporting pooled VE of 33% (95% confidence interval [CI] 26–39) for A(H3N2), 61% (57–65) for A(H1N1pdm09), and 54% (46–61) for B.

What explains this modest effectiveness, particularly for the H3N2 subtype? A common explanation is that the vaccine and circulating strains are antigenically different, implying that vaccination protects against the vaccine strain but is less protective against antigenically distinct circulating strains. Metaanalyses have indicated that VE to antigenically drifted viruses is worse than to matched viruses. Mismatches can arise from inaccurate prediction of the future strains that will dominate a season and/or the significant antigenic diversity of cocirculating strains.

Antigenic mismatches can also be caused by mutations that arise as human vaccine strains are propagated in fertilized chicken eggs for large-scale vaccine production. For example, the egg-adapted 2016–2017 H3N2 vaccine strain was antigenically distinct compared with circulating H3N2 strains due to a single hemagglutinin (HA) mutation that arose as the vaccine strain was adapted to replicate efficiently in eggs. Many humans who received the 2016–2017 vaccine produced antibodies that recognized the egg-grown H3N2 vaccine strain but not circulating H3N2 strains. It has been proposed that egg adaptations also contributed to lowered VE during the H3N2-dominated 2012–2013 season, when influenza VE was estimated to be 39% (95% CI, 29–47). The 2012–2013 egg-adapted A/Victoria/361/2011-IVR-165 (IVR-165) vaccine strain differed from the cell-cultured A/Victoria/361/2011 (Vic/361) strain at several residues in exposed regions of the HA head near the receptor-binding site (H156Q, G186V, S219Y).

### Host immune response-inspired development of the influenza vaccine [^a189561b]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the current and future development of influenza vaccines.

Data Sources

PubMed searches were performed cross-referencing the keywords influenza, influenza vaccine, host immune response, correlates of protection, vaccine development, vaccine efficacy. Articles were reviewed for additional citations.

Study Selections

Articles were reviewed and selected on the basis of relevance to subject matter.

Results

In this review, we first introduce the influenza virus, its nomenclature, and the concepts of antigenic drift and shift. Second, we discuss the status of currently licensed influenza virus vaccines. We briefly focus on influenza vaccine responses beyond hemagglutination inhibition that may correlate with protection against influenza viruses of different subtypes. Third, we explain how studying host responses to influenza infection and vaccination with advanced serologic methods, B-cell receptor sequencing, and transcriptomic profiling can guide the development of improved influenza virus vaccines. Fourth, we provide 2 suggestions on how current influenza vaccines can be optimized by redirecting immune responses toward conserved viral antigens and the use of adjuvants.

Conclusion

Influenza vaccine design can benefit from novel insights obtained from the study of host responses to influenza virus infection and vaccination. Integration of the large amount of available clinical and preclinical data requires systems approaches that can elucidate novel correlates of protection and will guide further development of influenza vaccine.

### Next-generation influenza vaccines: opportunities and challenges [^b524a7d1]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2020). High credibility.

Seasonal influenza vaccines lack efficacy against drifted or pandemic influenza strains. Developing improved vaccines that elicit broader immunity remains a public health priority. Immune responses to current vaccines focus on the haemagglutinin head domain, whereas next-generation vaccines target less variable virus structures, including the haemagglutinin stem. Strategies employed to improve vaccine efficacy involve using structure-based design and nanoparticle display to optimize the antigenicity and immunogenicity of target antigens; increasing the antigen dose; using novel adjuvants; stimulating cellular immunity; and targeting other viral proteins, including neuraminidase, matrix protein 2 or nucleoprotein.

### Influenza vaccines: successes and continuing challenges [^79a52ce3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Influenza vaccines have been available for over 80 years. They have contributed to significant reductions in influenza morbidity and mortality. However, there have been limitations in their effectiveness, in part due to the continuous antigenic evolution of seasonal influenza viruses, but also due to the predominant use of embryonated chicken eggs for their production. The latter furthermore limits their worldwide production timelines and scale. Therefore today, alternative approaches for their design and production are increasingly pursued, with already licensed quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccines produced in cell cultures, including based on a baculovirus expression system. Next-generation influenza vaccines aim at inducing broader and longer-lasting immune responses to overcome seasonal influenza virus antigenic drift and to timely address the emergence of a new pandemic influenza virus. Tailored approaches target mechanisms to improve vaccine-induced immune responses in individuals with a weakened immune system, in particular older adults.

Main

Twice a year, a panel of experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) gathers to recommend vaccine strains for the upcoming influenza seasons. To reduce the disease burden of influenza, the goal of the panel is to optimize 'vaccine effectiveness', which is defined as the reduction in the odds of influenza infection among vaccinated individuals compared to those who are not vaccinated. After each season, influenza vaccine effectiveness is estimated by institutions such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through observational test-negative studies involving participants with medically attended outpatient illness. If the vaccine strains that were selected turned out to be well aligned with the distribution of viral strains that were circulating during the influenza season, the effectiveness of an inactivated influenza vaccine may reach up to 40–60% in that season. However, despite decades of research in prevention and surveillance, current influenza vaccines provide limited protection. CDC estimates from the US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network reveal that overall vaccine effectiveness across subtypes and age groups dropped below 40% in five of the 10 years from 2012 to 2021 (refs. –), with a concurrent rise in influenza-related hospitalization rates (Extended Data Fig. 1). For instance, during the 2014–2015 winter season, vaccine effectiveness was only 19%.

### Successes and failures of the live-attenuated influenza vaccine: can we Do better? [^44752837]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Seasonal influenza viruses continue to pose significant disease and economic burden, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimating between 12 000 and 56 000 deaths per year and between 9.2 and 35 million illnesses per year in the United States. Due to the constant mutation of influenza viruses, the currently available influenza vaccines, the inactivated injectable influenza vaccine and a live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), are updated annually.

Early studies comparing the effectiveness of LAIV and inactivated influenza vaccine found the former to have a much better effectiveness in children than the latter, prompting the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) preferentially to recommend the use of LAIV in healthy 2- to 8-year-old children in 2014. The United Kingdom started a universal pediatric vaccination program with LAIV in 2013, and 1 year later, LAIV was offered in Finland to 2-year-olds for the first time. However, vaccine-effectiveness studies done in the United States showed mixed LAIV effectiveness during the 2013–2016 influenza seasons, ranging from 0% to 50% effectiveness. As a result, the ACIP suspended the recommendation of LAIV for the next 2 seasons but resumed it for the 2018–2019 season. In contrast, studies done in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Finland told a very different story, with effectiveness ranging from 31% to 57.6%.

The reasons for these discrepancies remain largely unknown, with some attributing them to a reduction in fitness in the vaccine strain, problems with vaccine production, mismatches between the vaccine and the circulating (challenge) strain, or pre-existing immunity affecting the vaccine's immunogenicity. The latter is called negative interference.

Negative interference has been well studied for inactivated influenza vaccines, with studies showing that, depending on the year and circulating serotype, people who have been vaccinated in the previous year(s) have a decreased vaccine efficacy compared with those who have not been vaccinated. In a seminal paper in 1999, Smith et al used a mathematical model to provide a quantification of negative interference for repeated influenza vaccination with inactivated vaccine. This phenomenon has been less studied for LAIV. Here, we use mathematical models to explore how the antigenic distance hypothesis can be used to explain differences in the vaccine effectiveness of LAIV. We hypothesize that differences seen in vaccine effectiveness across influenza seasons and across different countries arise from the interplay of 3 antigenic distances: the distances between the vaccine strain, pre-existing immunity, and the challenge strain.

### Interim estimates of 2018–19 seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness-United States, February 2019 [^549f5086]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

In the United States, annual vaccination against seasonal influenza is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/whoshouldvax.htm). Effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine varies by season. During each influenza season since 2004–05, CDC has estimated the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine to prevent laboratory-confirmed influenza associated with medically attended acute respiratory illness (ARI). This interim report uses data from 3,254 children and adults enrolled in the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (U.S. Flu VE Network) during November 23, 2018-February 2, 2019. During this period, overall adjusted vaccine effectiveness against all influenza virus infection associated with medically attended ARI was 47% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 34%-57%). For children aged 6 months-17 years, overall vaccine effectiveness was 61% (44%-73%). Seventy-four percent of influenza A infections for which subtype information was available were caused by A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated to be 46% (30%-58%) against illness caused by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. CDC recommends that health care providers continue to administer influenza vaccine because influenza activity is ongoing and the vaccine can still prevent illness, hospitalization, and death associated with currently circulating influenza viruses, or other influenza viruses that might circulate later in the season. During the 2017–18 influenza season, in which influenza A(H3N2) predominated, vaccination was estimated to prevent 7.1 million illnesses, 3.7 million medical visits, 109,000 hospitalizations, and 8,000 deaths (1). Vaccination can also reduce the severity of influenza-associated illness (2). Persons aged ≥ 6 months who have not yet been vaccinated this season should be vaccinated.

### Comparing influenza vaccine efficacy against mismatched and matched strains: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^339cb6da]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Influenza is a major public health threat. It is widely accepted that an annual influenza vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza. Among adults, for example, the inactivated influenza vaccine was reported to have a vaccine efficacy (VE) of 59% (95% confidence interval (CI) 51 to 67).

Recommendations for influenza vaccine composition currently include two type A influenza strains (A-H3N2 and A-H1N1) and one type B influenza strain, which are updated annually. Strains are selected by scientists convened by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the months before the next epidemic season is expected. This procedure includes consideration of antigenic mismatch between vaccine strains and actual epidemic strains.

Although it is accepted that matched strains provide the best protection, data on the protective efficacy of unmatched strains, or cross protection, are sparse. These data are of particular importance, given that influenza B vaccine strains did not match circulating strains in six influenza seasons between 2000 and 2011 in the USA. Mismatched seasons may lead to reduced uptake of influenza vaccination, reduced VE, and more severe influenza epidemics. Therefore, estimating prevention that can be achieved during mismatched influenza seasons is of prime public health importance. This information cannot be gleaned from previous reviews on the efficacy of the influenza vaccines because they did not specifically examine vaccine efficacy for mismatched seasons. As such, in the present work we aimed to determine the cross protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza through vaccination.

### Early estimates of seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness – United States, January 2013 [^e3882ef1]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

In the United States, annual vaccination against seasonal influenza is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months. Each season since 2004–05, CDC has estimated the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine to prevent influenza-associated, medically attended acute respiratory infection (ARI). This season, early data from 1,155 children and adults with ARI enrolled during December 3, 2012-January 2, 2013 were used to estimate the overall effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine for preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection associated with medically attended ARI. After adjustment for study site, but not for other factors, the estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) was 62% (95% confidence intervals [CIs] = 51%-71%). This interim estimate indicates moderate effectiveness, and is similar to a summary VE estimate from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trial data; final estimates likely will differ slightly. As of January 11, 2013, 24 states and New York City were reporting high levels of influenza-like illness, 16 states were reporting moderate levels, five states were reporting low levels, and one state was reporting minimal levels. CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices routinely recommend that annual influenza vaccination efforts continue as long as influenza viruses are circulating. Persons aged ≥ 6 months who have not yet been vaccinated this season should be vaccinated. However, these early VE estimates underscore that some vaccinated persons will become infected with influenza; therefore, antiviral medications should be used as recommended for treatment in patients, regardless of vaccination status. In addition, these results highlight the importance of continued efforts to develop more effective vaccines.

### Interim estimates of 2019–20 seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness-United States, February 2020 [^8cabc504]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

During the 2019–20 influenza season, influenza-like illness (ILI)* activity first exceeded the national baseline during the week ending November 9, 2019, signaling the earliest start to the influenza season since the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. Activity remains elevated as of mid-February 2020. In the United States, annual vaccination against seasonal influenza is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months (1). During each influenza season, CDC estimates seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza associated with medically attended acute respiratory illness (ARI). This interim report used data from 4,112 children and adults enrolled in the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (U.S. Flu VE Network) during October 23, 2019-January 25, 2020. Overall, vaccine effectiveness (VE) against any influenza virus associated with medically attended ARI was 45% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 36%-53%). VE was estimated to be 50% (95% CI = 39%-59%) against influenza B/Victoria viruses and 37% (95% CI = 19%-52%) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, indicating that vaccine has significantly reduced medical visits associated with influenza so far this season. Notably, vaccination provided substantial protection (VE = 55%; 95% CI = 42%-65%) among children and adolescents aged 6 months-17 years. Interim VE estimates are consistent with those from previous seasons, ranging from 40%-60% when influenza vaccines were antigenically matched to circulating viruses. CDC recommends that health care providers continue to administer influenza vaccine to persons aged ≥ 6 months because influenza activity is ongoing, and the vaccine can still prevent illness, hospitalization, and death associated with currently circulating influenza viruses as well as other influenza viruses that might circulate later in the season.

### Making better influenza virus vaccines? [^111eadde]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Killed and live influenza virus vaccines are effective in preventing and curbing the spread of disease, but new technologies such as reverse genetics could be used to improve them and to shorten the lengthy process of preparing vaccine seed viruses. By taking advantage of these new technologies, we could develop live vaccines that would be safe, cross-protective against variant strains, and require less virus per dose than conventional vaccines. Furthermore, pandemic vaccines against highly virulent strains such as the H5N1 virus can only be generated by reverse genetics techniques. Other technologic breakthroughs should result in effective adjuvants for use with killed and live vaccines, increasing the number of available doses. Finally, universal influenza virus vaccines seem to be within reach. These new strategies will be successful if they are supported by regulatory agencies and if a robust market for influenza virus vaccines against inter-pandemic and pandemic threats is made and sustained.

### Influenza vaccines: successes and continuing challenges [^0e89d901]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

INFLUENZA VACCINE DEVELOPMENT — A GLOBAL ACHIEVEMENT

The history of influenza vaccination is a success story that started almost a century ago (Figure 1). The first influenza vaccines were a monovalent inactivated influenza A vaccine produced in embryonated chicken eggs and a live-attenuated vaccine in the mid-1930s, only a few years after the first isolations of influenza viruses from pigs and humans, respectively. Influenza B virus was discovered in 1940. The first bivalent vaccine containing 1 influenza A and 1 influenza B strain and was produced and tested by the US army from 1942 onward. It became available for the general population in the United States by 1945. Split and subunit vaccines were subsequently developed beginning in the 1960s. Trivalent vaccines, incorporating 2 influenza A subtypes and 1 influenza B strain, became available in 1978. It was not until 2012 that the first quadrivalent vaccines incorporating 2 influenza A subtypes and 2 influenza B strains was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In the following year, the first recombinant HA vaccine expressed by insect cells was licensed in the United States (for a detailed review of the history of influenza vaccination see). The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic was the first pandemic for which a specific pandemic influenza vaccine became globally available. Although it came late for the southern hemisphere, the pandemic vaccine was shown to effectively prevent laboratory-confirmed influenza, related hospitalization, and mortality in the northern hemisphere. Likewise, annual vaccination of the general population and especially of high-risk groups with seasonal vaccines, before the start of the influenza season, has been shown to considerably reduce morbidity, mortality, and economic losses associated with influenza. Economic losses averted by influenza vaccination are related to reduced health care costs and maintained productivity (eg). As a recent example, the CDC estimated for the United States the prevention of an estimated 7.52 million illnesses, 3.69 million medical visits, 105 000 hospitalizations, and 6300 deaths due to influenza, by influenza vaccination during the 2019–2020 season. Besides direct protective effects of influenza vaccination in the vaccinees, indirect effects in other members of the community may be observed due to reduced virus circulation. For example, a governmental vaccination program for schoolchildren in Japan from 1962 to 1994 was linked to a drop of excess mortality associated with influenza and pneumonia in the elderly, which was not observed after the program was discontinued. The vaccination coverage in adults was reported lower than in children, indicating an indirect protective effect of the vaccination of children on the health of the elderly. The effectiveness of influenza vaccination in older adults is lower than that in younger adults. The efficacy and effectiveness in the elderly was even initially questioned by a Cochrane meta-analysis (updated version available). However, methodologically adjusted meta-analysis resulted in values ranging from 30% to 50% vaccine effectiveness, largely depending on the age of the vaccinees and the matching of the vaccine strains with the circulating influenza viruses. Furthermore, less severe disease is typically reported in vaccinated patients than in nonvaccinated patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza. Interestingly, influenza vaccination may reduce the impact of other respiratory infections, which can occur as coinfections during influenza, as well as counter the rise of antimicrobial resistance. Maintaining or increasing influenza vaccination coverage during the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been recommended by public health agencies to prevent additional seasonal influenza burden on the highly strained health care systems. However, both excess mortality data and viral surveillance have revealed limited cases of other respiratory infections, and in particular influenza, during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous seasons. The limited circulation of seasonal influenza viruses may be mainly due to the set of nonpharmaceutical public health interventions deployed in most countries since the beginning of the pandemic (eg, increased hygiene measures, face masks, social distancing, and contact reduction). While the effectiveness of such measures against both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus infections is undeniable, their implementation is temporary due to considerable social and economic consequences. Effective vaccination remains the preventive measure of choice against influenza.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine trials provide valuable insight into the safety and efficacy of vaccines, with individually randomized, placebo-controlled trials being the gold standard in trial design. However, a myriad of variables must be considered as clinical trial data are interpreted and used to guide policy decisions. These variables include factors such as the characteristics of the study population and circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strains, the force of infection, the definition and ascertainment of endpoints, the timing of vaccine efficacy assessment, and the potential for performance bias. In this Viewpoints article, we discuss critical variables to consider when comparing efficacy measurements across current and future COVID-19 vaccine trials.

Recommendations for the Use of Influenza Vaccines, 2019–20

Groups Recommended for Vaccination

Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months who do not have contraindications. Recommendations regarding timing of vaccination, considerations for specific populations, the use of specific vaccines, and contraindications and precautions are summarized in the sections that follow.

Timing of Vaccination

Balancing considerations regarding the unpredictability of timing of onset of the influenza season and concerns that vaccine-induced immunity might wane over the course of a season, it is recommended that vaccination should be offered by the end of October. Children aged 6 months through 8 years who require 2 doses (see Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years) should receive their first dose as soon as possible after the vaccine becomes available to allow the second dose (which must be administered ≥ 4 weeks later) to be received by the end of October. For those requiring only 1 dose for the season, early vaccination (i.e. in July and August) is likely to be associated with suboptimal immunity before the end of the influenza season, particularly among older adults. Community vaccination programs should balance maximizing likelihood of persistence of vaccine-induced protection through the season with avoiding missed opportunities to vaccinate or vaccinating after onset of influenza circulation occurs. Efforts should be structured to optimize vaccination coverage before influenza activity in the community begins. No recommendation is made for revaccination later in the season of persons who have already been fully vaccinated (i.e. providing a booster dose). Vaccination should continue to be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. To avoid missed opportunities for vaccination, providers should offer vaccination during routine health care visits and hospitalizations.

Optimally, vaccination should occur before onset of influenza activity in the community. However, because timing of the onset, peak, and decline of influenza activity varies, the ideal time to start vaccinating cannot be predicted each season. Moreover, more than one outbreak might occur in a given community in a single year. In the United States, localized outbreaks that indicate the start of seasonal influenza activity can occur as early as October. However, in 75% of 36 influenza seasons from 1982–83 through 2017–18, peak influenza activity (which often is close to the midpoint of influenza activity for the season) has not occurred until January or later, and in 58% of seasons, the peak was in February or later. Activity most commonly peaked in February in 15 (42%) of these seasons.

### Advances in the development of influenza virus vaccines [^4ebc4243]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2015). Medium credibility.

Influenza virus infections are a major public health concern and cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current influenza virus vaccines are an effective countermeasure against infection but need to be reformulated almost every year owing to antigenic drift. Furthermore, these vaccines do not protect against novel pandemic strains, and the timely production of pandemic vaccines remains problematic because of the limitations of current technology. Several improvements have been made recently to enhance immune protection induced by seasonal and pandemic vaccines, and to speed up production in case of a pandemic. Importantly, vaccine constructs that induce broad or even universal influenza virus protection are currently in preclinical and clinical development.

### Influenza vaccine strain selection with an AI-based evolutionary and antigenicity model [^19666384]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Current vaccines provide limited protection against rapidly evolving viruses. For example, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates show that the overall influenza vaccine effectiveness against outpatient illness in the United States averaged below 40% between 2012 and 2021. Moreover, the clinical outcomes of a vaccine can be assessed only retrospectively. Here we propose an in silico method named VaxSeer that predicts the antigenic match of vaccine candidates with circulating viruses, in the context of the viruses' relative dominance in the future influenza season. Based on 10years of retrospective evaluation using sequencing and antigenicity data, our approach consistently selects strains with better empirical antigenic matches to circulating viruses than annual recommendations. Finally, our predicted estimate of antigenic match exhibits a strong correlation with influenza vaccine effectiveness and reduction in disease burden, highlighting the promise of this framework to drive the vaccine selection process.

### Interim estimates of 2021–22 seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness-United States, February 2022 [^b938cdae]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

On February 25, 2022, the World Health Organization issued recommendations that the 2022–23 influenza vaccines for the northern hemisphere include updates to A(H3N2) reference viruses representing the 2a.2 subclade of A(H3N2) clade 3C.2a1b, as well as updates to the B/Victoria lineage vaccine component. Predicting circulation of virus subtypes and predominant clades within subtypes remains challenging. Evolution of circulating viruses has required frequent updates to the composition of influenza vaccines. Efforts to develop influenza vaccines that provide broader coverage of the diversity among circulating viruses are ongoing.

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, because of low influenza test positivity, VE estimates were limited to all ages combined against influenza A overall and against A(H3N2); VE can vary by virus type or subtype, vaccine formulation, and antigenic match between circulating viruses and vaccine components. End-of-season VE estimates could change as enrollment continues or if other influenza viruses predominate later in the season. Second, vaccination status at six of seven sites included self-report, which might result in misclassification of influenza vaccination status for some patients. Third, health care seeking behavior has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic and enrollment of patients with outpatient illness from COVID-19 testing sites might have affected results. The test-negative design for estimating influenza VE requires validation when influenza test-negative controls include patients with COVID-19 and receipt of influenza and COVID-19 vaccines are correlated. Finally, VE estimates in this report are specific to the prevention of outpatient illness rather than to more severe illness outcomes (e.g. hospitalization or death); data from studies measuring VE against more severe outcomes this season will be available at a later date.

### Interim estimates of 2016–17 seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness-United States, February 2017 [^9c37aa4d]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

In the United States, annual vaccination against seasonal influenza is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months (1). Each influenza season since 2004–05, CDC has estimated the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine to prevent influenza-associated, medically attended, acute respiratory illness (ARI). This report uses data, as of February 4, 2017, from 3,144 children and adults enrolled in the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (U.S. Flu VE Network) during November 28, 2016-February 4, 2017, to estimate an interim adjusted effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine for preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection associated with medically attended ARI. During this period, overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) (adjusted for study site, age group, sex, race/ethnicity, self-rated general health, and days from illness onset to enrollment) against influenza A and influenza B virus infection associated with medically attended ARI was 48% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 37%-57%). Most influenza infections were caused by A (H3N2) viruses. VE was estimated to be 43% (CI = 29%-54%) against illness caused by influenza A (H3N2) virus and 73% (CI = 54%-84%) against influenza B virus. These interim VE estimates indicate that influenza vaccination reduced the risk for outpatient medical visits by almost half. Because influenza activity remains elevated (2), CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommend that annual influenza vaccination efforts continue as long as influenza viruses are circulating (1). Vaccination with 2016–17 influenza vaccines will reduce the number of infections with most currently circulating influenza viruses. Persons aged ≥ 6 months who have not yet been vaccinated this season should be vaccinated as soon as possible.

### MF59 is a safe and potent vaccine adjuvant for flu vaccines in humans: what did we learn during its development? [^dbda3420]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

The MF59 adjuvant has been included in a licensed influenza vaccine for a decade. Hence, we have a significant amount of clinical data to establish its potency and safety. We can now reassess our early preclinical studies and determine whether or not they were useful to predict human responses. The main lesson learned is that mouse models can be valuable, but one must ask the right questions and the models must be used appropriately.

Seasonal influenza vaccines — 2021–2022 composition and product selection: All 2021–2022 seasonal influenza vaccines will be quadrivalent and contain the same influenza strains as recommended by the World Health Organization and the US Food and Drug Administration, with both influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) components different this season and the B components unchanged; influenza A strains may differ between egg-based versus cell- or recombinant-based platforms but are matched to strains expected to circulate. Quadrivalent vaccines contain A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus for egg-based and A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus for cell- or recombinant-based, A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2)-like virus for both platforms, B/Washington/02/2019-like virus (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage) for all vaccines, and B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage) for all vaccines; trivalent vaccines do not include the B/Yamagata component (not available in United States). More than one product may be appropriate for a given patient, and vaccination should not be delayed to obtain a specific product.

During the 2021–22 influenza season, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to circulate in the United States, and COVID-19 vaccinations are expected to continue. Current guidance for the administration of COVID-19 vaccines (available at) indicates that these vaccines can be administered with other vaccines, including influenza vaccines; providers should consult this page for updated information. Guidance for vaccine planning during the pandemic is available at. Additional discussion of coadministration of influenza and COVID-19 vaccines can be found in the section on Administration of Influenza Vaccines with Other Vaccines.

Optimally, vaccination should occur before onset of influenza activity in the community. However, because timing of the onset, peak, and decline of influenza activity varies, the ideal time to start vaccinating cannot be predicted each season. Moreover, more than one outbreak might occur in a given community in a single year. In the United States, localized outbreaks that indicate the start of seasonal influenza activity can occur as early as October. However, in 27 (75%) of 36 influenza seasons from 1982–83 through 2017–18, peak influenza activity (which often is close to the midpoint of influenza activity for the season) has not occurred until January or later, and in 21 (58%) seasons, the peak was in February or later. Activity peaked in February in 15 (42%) of these seasons.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2021–2022 [^bb065dbc]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

AAP influenza vaccine recommendations for children — 2021–2022 season: The AAP recommends annual influenza vaccination for everyone 6 months and older, including children and adolescents, during the 2021–2022 influenza season. For the 2021–2022 influenza season, the AAP recommends that any licensed influenza vaccine appropriate for age and health status can be used for influenza vaccination in children, and inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) are options for children for whom these vaccines are appropriate. The AAP does not have a preference for any influenza vaccine product over another for children who have no contraindication to influenza vaccination and for whom more than one licensed product appropriate for age and health status is available, and pediatricians should administer whichever formulation is available in their communities to achieve the highest possible coverage this influenza season. Children 6 through 35 months of age may receive any licensed, age-appropriate IIV available this season, at the dose indicated for the vaccine, and children 36 months (3 years) and older should receive a 0.5-mL dose of any available, licensed, age-appropriate vaccine. The number of seasonal influenza vaccine doses recommended to be administered to children in the 2021–2022 influenza season remains unchanged and depends on the child's age at the time of the first administered dose and vaccine history. Children 6 months through 8 years of age who are receiving influenza vaccine for the first time or who have received only 1 dose before July 1, 2021, or whose vaccination status is unknown, should receive 2 doses of influenza vaccine 4 weeks apart, ideally by the end of October, and vaccines should be offered as soon as they become available; children needing only 1 dose of influenza vaccine, regardless of age, should also receive vaccination ideally by the end of October. Influenza vaccine may be administered simultaneously with or any time before or after administration of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines, and given that it is unknown whether reactogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines will be increased with coadministration of influenza vaccine, the reactogenicity profile of the vaccines should be considered and providers should consult the most current ACIP/AAP guidance regarding coadministration. Children with acute moderate or severe COVID-19 should not receive influenza vaccine until they have recovered; children with mild illness may be vaccinated. Efforts should be made to ensure vaccination for children in high-risk groups (Table 1) and their contacts, unless contraindicated. Product-specific contraindications must be considered when selecting the type of vaccine to administer, and children who have had an allergic reaction after a previous dose of any influenza vaccine should be evaluated by an allergist. Children with egg allergy can receive influenza vaccine (IIV or LAIV) without any additional precautions beyond those recommended for all vaccines.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2019–20 influenza season [^cb320a4d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Variable data concerning presence and rate of waning immunity after influenza vaccination, coupled with the unpredictable timing of the influenza season each year, prevent determination of an optimal time to vaccinate. Programmatic issues are also a consideration; although delaying vaccination might result in greater immunity later in the season, deferral also might result in missed opportunities to vaccinate, as well as difficulties in vaccinating a population within a more constrained time period. The potential contributions of these factors among persons aged ≥ 65 years have been assessed using a simulated mathematical model examining various scenarios of vaccination timing, timing of onset of the influenza season, rate of waning, and vaccine effectiveness. In this model, assuming a historical average timing of onset of the influenza season, delaying vaccination until October resulted in more hospitalizations if > 11% of persons aged ≥ 65 years who would have been vaccinated in August or September failed to get vaccinated. However, these predictions varied considerably with assumed timing of season onset, rate of waning immunity, and vaccine effectiveness.

Vaccination efforts should continue throughout the season because the duration of the influenza season varies, and influenza activity might not occur in certain communities until February or March. Providers should offer influenza vaccine routinely, and organized vaccination campaigns should continue throughout the influenza season, including after influenza activity has begun in the community. Although vaccination by the end of October is recommended, vaccine administered in December or later, even if influenza activity has already begun, might be beneficial in the majority of influenza seasons.

### Influenza vaccines: successes and continuing challenges [^43b540ca]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFLUENZA VACCINES

The currently available seasonal influenza vaccines (Table 1) provide protection against circulating virus strains that are closely related to those represented in the vaccine but fail to provide long-lasting and broadly protective immunity against more distantly related drifted influenza viruses. This has led to the development of a procedure of influenza vaccine strain selection that is coordinated by the WHO twice a year in close consultation with an international network of key laboratories and academies to review surveillance, clinical study results, and the availability of vaccine viruses. For a few decades, this strain selection was used to produce trivalent vaccines that represented the 2 circulating influenza A virus subtypes and 1 influenza B virus lineage. Since 2013–2014, mainly quadrivalent influenza vaccines are administered. They represent 2 circulating influenza A virus subtypes and 2 influenza B virus lineages: the Yamagata and Victoria lineages, which display limited serum cross-reactivity. As cross-B–lineage protection appears to be related to the level of exposure to influenza B virus, which increases with age, protection against the seasonal influenza B virus lineage absent from trivalent vaccines may occasion vaccine failure in children. Quadrivalent vaccines were shown to provide improved protection against influenza B virus in children, which are less likely to have preseasonal immunity in case of a B linage mismatch of a trivalent vaccine.

### Self-reported influenza and influenza-like symptoms in U.S. adults age 18–64 between September 1, 2019 and April 15, 2020 [^c56208f1]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) can indicate the presence of novel, widespread community pathogens. Comparing week-to-week reported influenza-like illness percentages may identify the time of year a novel pathogen is introduced. However, changes in health-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic call in to question the reliability of 2019–2020 ILINet data as a comparison to prior years, potentially rendering this system less reliable as a novel pathogen surveillance tool. Corroboration of trends seen in the 2019–2020 ILINet data lends confidence to the validity of those trends. This study compares predicted versus reported influenza and influenza-like illnesses in vaccinated adults as a surrogate measure of novel pathogen surveillance.

Methods

An online survey was used to ask US adults their influenza vaccination status, whether they were diagnosed with influenza after vaccination, and whether they experienced an influenza-like illness other than flu.

Results

Prevalence of self-reported flu diagnosis in adults age 18–64 who received the flu vaccine between September 1, 2019 and April 15, 2020 (n = 3,225) was 5.8%, while self-reported flu or flu-like illness (without a flu diagnosis) was 17.9%.

Conclusion

Flu and flu-like illness in this sample of flu-vaccinated U.S. adults is significantly higher than predicted, consistent with substantially higher ILI's in 2019–20 compared to ILI's from 2018–19, suggesting that the ILI values reported during the COVID-19 pandemic may be appropriate for comparison to prior years.

### Progress and remaining gaps in estimating the global disease burden of influenza [^c99c1fe7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Influenza has long been a global public health priority because of the threat of another global pandemic. Although data are available for the annual burden of seasonal influenza in many developed countries, fewer disease burden data are available for low-income and tropical countries. In recent years, however, the surveillance systems created as part of national pandemic preparedness efforts have produced substantial data on the epidemiology and impact of influenza in countries where data were sparse. These data are leading to greater interest in seasonal influenza, including implementation of vaccination programs. However, a lack of quality data on severe influenza, nonrespiratory outcomes, and high-risk groups, as well as a need for better mathematical models and economic evaluations, are some of the major gaps that remain. These gaps are the focus of multilateral research and surveillance efforts that will strengthen global efforts in influenza control in the future.

Currently Licensed Influenza Vaccines

Vaccines are the most effective way to provide protection and control against the seasonal influenza virus. More than 150 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccines are produced annually in the United States alone. There are 3 classes of vaccines that are being used: inactivated virus, live attenuated virus, and recombinant HA influenza vaccines. Influenza vaccines are trivalent (containing an H1N1 strain, an H3N2 strain, and 1 B virus lineage) or quadrivalent (containing both H1N1 and H3N2 strains and both B lineages). Each year, the World Health Organization predicts the next circulating viruses and provides seed strains for vaccine production. In the past, these seed strains were derived from coinfection cultures in which the new seasonal influenza virus strain was allowed to exchange gene segments encoding surface HA and NA with the gene segments encoding the internal proteins of a vaccine production virus. The acceptance of recombinant DNA techniques for the production of new reassortant vaccine strains made coinfection cultures unnecessary and has allowed for more efficient seed strain production. This is important because production speed is an important factor when fighting a seasonal virus.

In the case of inactivated influenza virus vaccines, the virus is typically split into individual proteins with detergent after inactivation, for example, by formaldehyde treatment. Split vaccines can be further enriched for the HA and NA proteins to provide subunit vaccines. Live attenuated vaccines are administered intranasally and rely on cold-adapted influenza viruses that do not replicate well in the lower respiratory tract and therefore do not cause disease. This attenuated phenotype is due to mutations in viral genes other than HA and NA. Similar to the inactivated vaccines, live attenuated vaccines are reformulated yearly to match the HA and NA of circulating strains. They are less used than inactivated vaccines and only effective in children because preexisting influenza virus immunity in adults limits the replication and immunogenicity of the live attenuated virus. Recombinant HA that contains influenza virus vaccines produced in insect cell cultures are also approved, but their use is still limited.

### Early estimates of seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness-United States, January 2015 [^e55eb34d]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

In the United States, annual vaccination against seasonal influenza is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months. Each season since 2004–05, CDC has estimated the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine in preventing medically attended acute respiratory illness (ARI) associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza. This season, early estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness are possible because of widespread, early circulation of influenza viruses. By January 3, 2015, 46 states were experiencing widespread flu activity, with predominance of influenza A (H3N2) viruses. This report presents an initial estimate of seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness at preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection associated with medically attended ARI based on data from 2,321 children and adults enrolled in the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (Flu VE) during November 10, 2014-January 2, 2015. During this period, overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) (adjusted for study site, age, sex, race/ethnicity, self-rated health, and days from illness onset to enrollment) against laboratory-confirmed influenza associated with medically attended ARI was 23% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 8%-36%). Most influenza infections were due to A (H3N2) viruses. This interim VE estimate is relatively low compared with previous seasons when circulating viruses and vaccine viruses were well-matched and likely reflects the fact that more than two-thirds of circulating A (H3N2) viruses are antigenically and genetically different (drifted) from the A (H3N2) vaccine component of 2014–15 Northern Hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccines. These early, low VE estimates underscore the need for ongoing influenza prevention and treatment measures. CDC continues to recommend influenza vaccination because the vaccine can still prevent some infections with the currently circulating A (H3N2) viruses as well as other viruses that might circulate later in the season, including influenza B viruses. Even when VE is reduced, vaccination still prevents some illness and serious influenza-related complications, including thousands of hospitalizations and deaths. Persons aged ≥ 6 months who have not yet been vaccinated this season should be vaccinated, including persons who might already have been ill with influenza this season.

Seasonal influenza vaccines and B lineages — Before the 2013–2014 influenza season, only trivalent influenza vaccines that included a single influenza B strain were available. Since the 1980s, 2 antigenically distinct lineages (Victoria or Yamagata) have circulated globally, vaccination against 1 lineage generally confers little cross-protection against the other, and trivalent vaccines offer limited immunity against circulating B strains of the lineage not present in the vaccine. In recent years it has been difficult to predict which B lineage will predominate; therefore, a quadrivalent vaccine with B strains of both lineages would be predicted to offer additional protection, but there is no evidence at this time that a quadrivalent vaccine is more effective. Table 3 includes a summary of vaccine types licensed for children and adults during the 2018–2019 season. More than 1 product may be appropriate for a given patient.

Pediatric influenza vaccine dosing — 2020–2021 season specifies that the number of seasonal influenza vaccine doses recommended for children during the 2020–2021 influenza season depends on the child's age at the time of the first administered dose and vaccine history. Influenza vaccines are not licensed for administration to infants younger than 6 months and should not be used in this age group. Children 9 years and older need only 1 dose, regardless of previous vaccination history. For children 6 months through 8 years of age, need 2 doses if they have received fewer than 2 doses of any trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV or LAIV) before July 1, 2020, or if their vaccination status is unknown; the interval between the 2 doses should be at least 4 weeks, and two doses should be administered to children who receive their first dose before their ninth birthday, even if their ninth birthday occurs during the same season. Children 6 months through 8 years of age require only 1 dose if they have previously received 2 or more total doses of any trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV or LAIV) before July 1, 2020; the 2 previous doses do not need to have been received during the same influenza season or consecutive influenza seasons. Figure 2 logic for 6 months through 8 years of age asks "Has child received TWO or more total doses* of any influenza vaccine prior to July 1, 2020?"; if Yes, "Only 1 dose needed", and if No or Unknown, "Administer TWO doses of influenza vaccine, given 4 weeks apart as minimum interval†", with the parallel branch label "9 years of age or older".

### Host immune response-inspired development of the influenza vaccine [^47e909b3]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Currently, licensed seasonal influenza vaccines are formulated to induce neutralizing antibodies that target virus strain–specific HA on the surface. However, predicting the next circulating strain is difficult, and sometimes the HA of the circulating virus undergoes antigenic drift and shift and antigenically mismatches the HA contained in vaccine strains. In such cases, vaccine-induced antibodies will have reduced effectiveness in targeting the circulating virus, and efficacy of the vaccine can be low. Another cause of antigenic mismatch between vaccine and circulating virus originates from the vaccine production process. Many of the influenza vaccines currently in use are produced on embryonated chicken eggs. However, mutations in the HA as a result of egg adaptation have resulted in vaccine failure in the recent past.

Another weakness of current vaccines is that in the very young and elderly populations, increasing protective immune responses by a single vaccination is often unsuccessful. Young children typically have no preexisting immunity against influenza virus after maternal antibodies wane. Therefore, 2 consecutive influenza vaccinations should be given in a pediatric setting to induce protective antibody levels. In contrast, the older population has preexisting immunity against influenza; however, both innate and adaptive immune responses in older adults are affected by immunosenescence. As a result, immunosenescence is thought to be responsible for high morbidity and mortality in elderly adults after influenza virus infection. To overcome this inefficient induction of influenza-specific antibodies in the elderly population, high-dose vaccines with twice the HA content of conventional vaccines or MF59-adjuvanted vaccines are available for this group. As we discuss in more detail below, studies on the interactions between the host and vaccine or influenza virus can help steer vaccine development to boost immune responses in specific populations.

Different but antigenically related influenza A strains are included in this season's egg-based and cell-based or recombinant vaccines; however, they are still matched to the strains expected to circulate in the 2022 to 2023 season.

Influenza vaccines in development — development efforts continue for universal influenza vaccines that induce broader protection and eliminate the need for annual vaccination; the success of messenger RNA (mRNA) and other novel technologies used in the development of COVID-19 vaccines may accelerate the prospects of broad influenza vaccines, with priorities that include developing a safe, immunogenic vaccine for infants younger than 6 months, studying adjuvanted and novel-route vaccines, and improving processes to shorten the interval between strain identification and vaccine production.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza… [^bd59ab3b]. CDC (2023). Medium credibility.

Updates to the recommendations described in this report reflect discussions during public meetings of ACIP held on October 23, 2019; February 26, 2020; and June 24, 2020. Primary updates to this report include the following two items. First, the composition of 2020–21 U. S. influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza Apdm09, influenza A, and influenza B/Victoria lineage components. Second, recent licensures of two new influenza vaccines, Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent and Fluad Quadrivalent, are discussed. Both new vaccines are licensed for persons aged ≥ 65 years. Additional changes include updated discussion of contraindications and precautions to influenza vaccination and the accompanying Table, updated discussion concerning use of LAIV4 in the setting of influenza antiviral medication use, and updated recommendations concerning vaccination of persons with egg allergy who receive either cell culture–based IIV4 or RIV4.

The effectiveness of influenza vaccination varies depending on several factors, such as the age and health of the recipient; the type of vaccine administered; the types, subtypes, and lineages of circulating influenza viruses; and the degree of similarity between circulating viruses and those included in the vaccine, despite an overall estimated vaccine effectiveness of 38%.

As of August 2020, SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate and cause severe illness in the United States and worldwide. The extent to which SARS-CoV-2 will circulate over the course of the 2020–21 influenza season is unknown. However, during the continued or recurrent circulation of SARS-CoV-2 concurrently with influenza viruses during the upcoming fall and winter, influenza vaccination of persons aged ≥ 6 months can reduce prevalence of illness caused by influenza, and can also reduce symptoms that might be confused with those of COVID-19. 18).

### Host immune response-inspired development of the influenza vaccine [^e27abb94]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although we are on the road toward a true universal influenza vaccine to be available in the pharmacy, currently licensed vaccines are the best option to protect against influenza virus infection. Through the addition of adjuvants or new vaccine production platforms, current licensed seasonal vaccine approaches are being upgraded slowly. Although not discussed in detail in this review, development of new vaccine production platforms has helped with increasing immune responses that target influenza virus. Epitope-based vaccines try to focus the immune response toward epitopes that are crucial for the virus but might not be immunogenic by nature. The HA stalk domain discussed elsewhere in this review is such an epitope, and targeting host immune responses against conserved epitopes with epitope-based vaccines is often used to broaden the specificity of the vaccine response. We briefly want to mention messenger RNA– and DNA-based vaccines, 2 vaccine platforms that have generated great interest because they can be produced in mass amounts in shorter time compared with the conventional approaches.

Influenza vaccine development is hampered to some extent by the fact that only a limited number of correlates or surrogates of protection are used to predict vaccine efficacy. The preclinical and clinical data gathered from animal models and human cohort studies performed with currently licensed influenza vaccines or after influenza infection are crucial for gaining a better understanding of immune correlates of protection. Anti-influenza immunity is a complex system shaped by interactions between innate and adaptive immune responses at different levels and influenced by the previous immune history of the individual, including first and subsequent exposures to influenza virus infections and vaccinations. It is likely that a combination of immune correlates or surrogates of protection for influenza virus will have more predictive value for vaccine efficacy, especially if the influenza vaccine relies on correlates of protection different from the currently accepted ones. The size and complexity of data sets that become available require highly advanced data management systems, storage capacity, systems biology approaches, and machine learning for analysis and prediction, which would allow for a better understanding of the influenza vaccine response. With new technologies, development of a more targeted influenza vaccine can be established and will be guided by novel immune correlates of protection that we are starting to understand better. The challenge is now to put all available data at work to optimize current and future influenza vaccine approaches that can lead to the development of an influenza vaccine that can protect the human population from the burden influenza viruses still cause.

Influenza vaccine products and strains — 2022–2023: All 2022–2023 seasonal influenza vaccines are quadrivalent and contain the same influenza strains as recommended by the World Health Organization and the US Food and Drug Administration Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee for the Northern Hemisphere. The influenza A (H3N2) and influenza B Victoria lineage vaccine components for the 2022–2023 season are different from those in the previous season, whereas the influenza A (H1N1) and influenza B Yamagata lineage components are unchanged. Different, but antigenically-related, influenza A strains are included in this season's egg-based and cell-based or recombinant vaccines, and they are matched to the strains expected to circulate in the 2022–2023 season. More than one product may be appropriate for a given patient, there is no preference for one product over another, and influenza vaccination should not be delayed to obtain a specific product.

APPROACHES TO IMPROVE INFLUENZA VACCINES

Next-Generation Influenza Vaccines

Next-generation influenza vaccines are urgently needed in order to address seasonal influenza antigenic drift and contribute to better pandemic preparedness. These aim at inducing broader intra- and intersubtypic as well as longer-lasting protective immune responses. Their production aim at rapid and large-scale capacity, overcoming one of the major shortcomings of the embryonated chickens egg system. Major challenges faced by the research and development community for the successful development of next-generation influenza vaccine candidates therefore include the induction of the desired humoral and T-cell–mediated immune responses against conserved epitopes, as well as the development of large-scale production systems. Mammalian cell lines and baculovirus expression system based on insect cells already offer relevant alternatives to the embryonated egg system, although costs will need to align with the latter for competitiveness.

Significant progress towards these next-generation vaccine candidates has been achieved worldwide. Vaccine candidates in the development pipeline can be divided into 2 categories (for an overview of influenza vaccines in clinical trials see). The first are designed to elicit broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) responses toward highly conserved conformational epitopes in the HA stem and non-virus–neutralizing (non-VN) antibody responses to structurally conserved regions of influenza virus surface membrane proteins (HA, NA, and matrix protein 2 ectodomain [M2e]). The second are designed to induce cross-protective T-cell responses against predominantly internal proteins, like M1, NP, and PB1. The respective immune responses contribute largely to preventing infection on the one hand, and reducing disease severity upon infection on the other.

The recent discovery of bnAbs against influenza viruses indicates that the generation of a broadly protective vaccine may indeed be attainable. The majority of these bnAbs, however, are directed toward highly conserved conformational epitopes in the HA stem, which lack the immunodominance of epitopes displayed by the influenza HA head. A key strategy proposed to avoid or circumvent influenza HA head immunodominance is by generating recombinant headless HA proteins (or HA stems). However, removal of the transmembrane domain on the one hand and HA head on the other without extensive compensatory modifications to stabilize the remaining molecule leads to loss of native conformation of the HA stem, resulting in low if any presence of conformational bnAb-inducing epitopes. This has led to several approaches currently pursued towards stabilization of HA stems.

### Evolution-informed forecasting of seasonal influenza A (H3N2) [^e677abf6]. Science Translational Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Interpandemic or seasonal influenza A, currently subtypes H3N2 and H1N1, exacts an enormous annual burden both in terms of human health and economic impact. Incidence prediction ahead of season remains a challenge largely because of the virus' antigenic evolution. We propose a forecasting approach that incorporates evolutionary change into a mechanistic epidemiological model. The proposed models are simple enough that their parameters can be estimated from retrospective surveillance data. These models link amino acid sequences of hemagglutinin epitopes with a transmission model for seasonal H3N2 influenza, also informed by H1N1 levels. With a monthly time series of H3N2 incidence in the United States for more than 10 years, we demonstrate the feasibility of skillful prediction for total cases ahead of season, with a tendency to underpredict monthly peak epidemic size, and an accurate real-time forecast for the 2016/2017 influenza season.

### Does this patient have influenza? [^94a825b4]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Influenza vaccination lowers, but does not eliminate, the risk of influenza. Making a reliable, rapid clinical diagnosis is essential to appropriate patient management that may be especially important during shortages of antiviral agents caused by high demand.

Objectives

To systematically review the precision and accuracy of symptoms and signs of influenza. A secondary objective was to review the operating characteristics of rapid diagnostic tests for influenza (results available in < 30 min).

Data Sources

Structured search strategy using MEDLINE (January 1966-September 2004) and subsequent searches of bibliographies of retrieved articles to identify articles describing primary studies dealing with the diagnosis of influenza based on clinical signs and symptoms. The MEDLINE search used the Medical Subject Headings EXP influenza or EXP influenza A virus or EXP influenza A virus human or EXP influenza B virus and the Medical Subject Headings or terms EXP sensitivity and specificity or EXP medical history taking or EXP physical examination or EXP reproducibility of results or EXP observer variation or symptoms.mp or clinical signs.mp or sensitivity.mp or specificity.mp.

Study Selection

Of 915 identified articles on clinical assessment of influenza-related illness, 17 contained data on the operating characteristics of symptoms and signs using an independent criterion standard. Of these, 11 were eliminated based on 4 inclusion criteria and availability of nonduplicative primary data.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed and abstracted data for estimating the likelihood ratios (LRs) of clinical diagnostic findings. Differences were resolved by discussion and consensus.

Data Synthesis

No symptom or sign had a summary LR greater than 2 in studies that enrolled patients without regard to age. For decreasing the likelihood of influenza, the absence of fever (LR, 0.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25–0.66), cough (LR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.31–0.57), or nasal congestion (LR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.42–0.59) were the only findings that had summary LRs less than 0.5. In studies limited to patients aged 60 years or older, the combination of fever, cough, and acute onset (LR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.8–7.7), fever and cough (LR, 5.0; 95% CI, 3.5–6.9), fever alone (LR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.8–5.0), malaise (LR, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.2–3.1), and chills (LR, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.0–3.2) increased the likelihood of influenza to the greatest degree. The presence of sneezing among older patients made influenza less likely (LR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24–0.92).

Conclusions

Clinical findings identify patients with influenza-like illness but are not particularly useful for confirming or excluding the diagnosis of influenza. Clinicians should use timely epidemiologic data to ascertain if influenza is circulating in their communities, then either treat patients with influenza-like illness empirically or obtain a rapid influenza test to assist with management decisions.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2018–2019 [^fe4c2f73]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

The authors of this statement update the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics for the routine use of influenza vaccine and antiviral medications in the prevention and treatment of influenza in children. Highlights for the upcoming 2018–2019 season include the following:1. Annual influenza immunization is recommended for everyone 6 months and older, including children and adolescents.2. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends an inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), trivalent or quadrivalent, as the primary choice for influenza vaccination in children because the effectiveness of a live attenuated influenza vaccine against influenza A(H1N1) was inferior during past influenza seasons and is unknown for this upcoming season.3. A live attenuated influenza vaccine may be used for children who would not otherwise receive an influenza vaccine (eg, refusal of an IIV) and for whom it is appropriate because of age (2 years of age and older) and health status (ie, healthy and without any underlying chronic medical condition).4. All 2018–2019 seasonal influenza vaccines contain an influenza A(H1N1) vaccine strain similar to that included in the 2017–2018 seasonal vaccines. In contrast, the influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B (Victoria lineage) vaccine strains included in the 2018–2019 trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines differ from those in the 2017–2018 seasonal vaccines.a. Trivalent vaccines contain an influenza A(Michigan/45/2015[H1N1])pdm09-like virus, an influenza A(Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016[H3N2])-like virus (updated), and an influenza B (Colorado/60/2017)-like virus (B/Victoria lineage; updated).b. Quadrivalent vaccines contain an additional B virus (Phuket/3073/2013-like virus; B/Yamagata lineage).5. All children with egg allergy of any severity can receive an influenza vaccine without any additional precautions beyond those recommended for all vaccines.6. Pregnant women may receive an influenza vaccine (IIV only) at any time during pregnancy to protect themselves as well as their infants, who benefit from the transplacental transfer of antibodies. Postpartum women who did not receive vaccination during pregnancy should be encouraged to receive an influenza vaccine before discharge from the hospital. Influenza vaccination during breastfeeding is safe for mothers and their infants.7. The vaccination of health care workers is a crucial step in preventing influenza and reducing health care-associated influenza infections because health care personnel often care for individuals at high risk for influenza-related complications.8. Pediatricians should attempt to promptly identify their patients who are suspected of having an influenza infection for timely initiation of antiviral treatment when indicated and on the basis of shared decision-making between each pediatrician and child caregiver to reduce morbidity and mortality. Although best results are seen when a child is treated within 48 hours of symptom onset, antiviral therapy should still be considered beyond 48 hours of symptom onset in children with severe disease or those at high risk of complications (see Table 2 in the full policy statement).

### Vaccines for preventing influenza in the elderly [^92a636a1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The consequences of influenza in the elderly (those age 65 years or older) are complications, hospitalisations, and death. The primary goal of influenza vaccination in the elderly is to reduce the risk of death among people who are most vulnerable. This is an update of a review published in 2010. Future updates of this review will be made only when new trials or vaccines become available. Observational data included in previous versions of the review have been retained for historical reasons but have not been updated because of their lack of influence on the review conclusions.

Objectives

To assess the effects (efficacy, effectiveness, and harm) of vaccines against influenza in the elderly.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 11), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (1966 to 31 December 2016); Embase (1974 to 31 December 2016); Web of Science (1974 to 31 December 2016); CINAHL (1981 to 31 December 2016); LILACS (1982 to 31 December 2016); WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; 1 July 2017); and ClinicalTrials.gov (1 July 2017).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing efficacy against influenza (laboratory-confirmed cases) or effectiveness against influenza-like illness (ILI) or safety. We considered any influenza vaccine given independently, in any dose, preparation, or time schedule, compared with placebo or with no intervention. Previous versions of this review included 67 cohort and case-control studies. The searches for these trial designs are no longer updated.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We rated the certainty of evidence with GRADE for the key outcomes of influenza, ILI, complications (hospitalisation, pneumonia), and adverse events. We have presented aggregate control group risks to illustrate the effect in absolute terms. We used them as the basis for calculating the number needed to vaccinate to prevent one case of each event for influenza and ILI outcomes.

Main Results

We identified eight RCTs (over 5000 participants), of which four assessed harms. The studies were conducted in community and residential care settings in Europe and the USA between 1965 and 2000. Risk of bias reduced our certainty in the findings for influenza and ILI, but not for other outcomes. Older adults receiving the influenza vaccine may experience less influenza over a single season compared with placebo, from 6% to 2.4% (risk ratio (RR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.66; low-certainty evidence). We rated the evidence as low certainty due to uncertainty over how influenza was diagnosed. Older adults probably experience less ILI compared with those who do not receive a vaccination over the course of a single influenza season (3.5% versus 6%; RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.73; moderate-certainty evidence). These results indicate that 30 people would need to be vaccinated to prevent one person experiencing influenza, and 42 would need to be vaccinated to prevent one person having an ILI. The study providing data for mortality and pneumonia was underpowered to detect differences in these outcomes. There were 3 deaths from 522 participants in the vaccination arm and 1 death from 177 participants in the placebo arm, providing very low-certainty evidence for the effect on mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.11 to 9.72). No cases of pneumonia occurred in one study that reported this outcome (very low-certainty evidence). No data on hospitalisations were reported. Confidence intervaIs around the effect of vaccines on fever and nausea were wide, and we do not have enough information about these harms in older people (fever: 1.6% with placebo compared with 2.5% after vaccination (RR 1.57, 0.92 to 2.71; moderate-certainty evidence)); nausea (2.4% with placebo compared with 4.2% after vaccination (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.74 to 4.12; low-certainty evidence)).

Authors' Conclusions

Older adults receiving the influenza vaccine may have a lower risk of influenza (from 6% to 2.4%), and probably have a lower risk of ILI compared with those who do not receive a vaccination over the course of a single influenza season (from 6% to 3.5%). We are uncertain how big a difference these vaccines will make across different seasons. Very few deaths occurred, and no data on hospitalisation were reported. No cases of pneumonia occurred in one study that reported this outcome. We do not have enough information to assess harms relating to fever and nausea in this population. The evidence for a lower risk of influenza and ILI with vaccination is limited by biases in the design or conduct of the studies. Lack of detail regarding the methods used to confirm the diagnosis of influenza limits the applicability of this result. The available evidence relating to complications is of poor quality, insufficient, or old and provides no clear guidance for public health regarding the safety, efficacy, or effectiveness of influenza vaccines for people aged 65 years or older. Society should invest in research on a new generation of influenza vaccines for the elderly.

### Interim estimates of 2021–22 seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness-United States, February 2022 [^3aedaaec]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This interim estimate of 2021–22 influenza VE suggests that influenza vaccination did not significantly reduce the risk of outpatient medically attended illness with influenza A(H3N2) viruses that have predominated so far this season. These findings are consistent with previous evidence of low to no protection against outpatient infection with A(H3N2) subclade 2a.2 viruses from an investigation of an influenza outbreak on a university campus during October–November 2021. These VE estimates underscore the need for ongoing diagnostic testing for influenza, influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis when indicated, and everyday preventive measures. CDC continues to recommend influenza vaccination when VE against outpatient illness is reduced because a growing body of evidence suggests that influenza vaccination can avert serious outcomes, including hospitalization, ICU admission, and death, among persons who are vaccinated but still become infected. In addition, vaccination is likely to prevent illness or serious complications of infection with other influenza viruses that might circulate later in the season, including influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses.

Compared with influenza vaccination during 2020–21, influenza vaccination coverage is lower so far this season in certain groups, including some groups who are at high risk for severe influenza or complications from influenza, such as persons who are pregnant, infants, and preschool-aged children, as well as persons from racial and ethnic minority groups. Persons aged ≥ 6 months who have not yet been vaccinated this season should be vaccinated.

This influenza VE estimate is the first since the 2019–20 season; effectiveness of 2020–21 influenza vaccines could not be assessed because influenza virus circulation was historically low. Cumulative rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations so far this season have also been substantially lower than in recent A(H3N2)-predominant seasons. During the 2021–22 influenza season, clinical laboratory data reported to CDC showed increased influenza virus circulation beginning in November 2021 and continuing through mid-December 2021. From late December 2021 through late January 2022, during the rapid rise in SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant positivity, influenza activity declined; however, during the first 2 weeks of February 2022, a slight increase in the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza at clinical laboratories was reported. Influenza activity is difficult to predict and may continue for multiple weeks.

### Modeling the effect of different vaccine effectiveness estimates on the number of vaccine-prevented influenza-associated hospitalizations in older adults [^fbcb17e0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

We compared influenza vaccine-prevented hospitalizations in adults aged ≥ 65 years for a range of hypothetical effectiveness estimates. During 2012–2013, a vaccine with 10% effectiveness (66% coverage) would have averted approximately 13 000 hospitalizations, and a vaccine with 40% effectiveness would have averted approximately 60 000 hospitalizations. Annual vaccination is merited in this vulnerable population.

### Pandemic influenza virus vaccines boost hemagglutinin stalk-specific antibody responses in primed adult and pediatric cohorts [^5d3f779b]. NPJ Vaccines (2019). Medium credibility.

The WHO makes annual recommendations on seasonal influenza virus vaccine composition based on a prediction of which viral strains will predominate in the upcoming season. In some seasons, the predictions are imperfect, resulting in mismatch of the viral vaccine strains with the circulating strains and associated poor vaccine effectiveness. Moreover, manufacture of a new vaccine formulation using current egg-based production followed by inactivation and detergent splitting of the vaccine virus takes several months which is clearly suboptimal. A game-changing universal influenza virus vaccine that would elicit durable immunity to all influenza virus strains and subtypes could overcome these issues and is an area of focus for the vaccine industry.

Influenza virus type A HAs are phylogenetically classified into group 1 and group 2 HAs. In contrast to the HA head domain, the stalk domain is relatively conserved within these respective groups. Anti-stalk antibodies are known to protect against a wide range of influenza virus strains and subtypes in animal models, broadly following this phylogeny. The stalk domain therefore represents an attractive target for the development of a universal influenza virus vaccine. Vaccination with constructs comprising the stalk domain but lacking the head domain (a mini HA construct) has been shown to induce an immune response in preclinical studies, – and a Phase I clinical trial is underway using this approach (NCT03814720). An alternative approach is to employ sequential immunization with a series of chimeric influenza viruses with divergent HA head domains and conserved stalk domains to overcome the immunodominance of the head domain and redirect the immune system towards the stalk domain. Use of an adjuvant has been shown to increase the magnitude of the humoral immune response. –

Adult humans have pre-existing immunity to the HA stalk domain from previous seasonal influenza virus exposure. Immunization with an influenza virus vaccine containing an HA from an influenza virus strain not circulating in humans should theoretically boost these pre-existing anti-stalk antibodies since the head domain will not be recognized and memory B-cells with specificities in the conserved stalk domain will be recalled. Thus, a vaccine containing pandemic or pre-pandemic influenza viruses can act as a surrogate for one dose of a chimeric HA-based broadly reactive vaccine. This effect has been observed in previous studies that measured levels of HA stalk antibodies after H5 and H7 influenza virus vaccination. – In the present study, we further tested this hypothesis using assays that measure HA stalk antibodies in serum obtained from previous clinical trials with different vaccines containing pandemic or pre-pandemic viruses (i.e. A/H1N1, A/H5N1, A/H9N2) or with seasonal influenza virus vaccine.

### Interim estimates of 2013–14 seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness-United States, February 2014 [^3baf78fc]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

In the United States, annual vaccination against seasonal influenza is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months. Each season since 2004–05, CDC has estimated the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine to prevent influenza-associated, medically attended acute respiratory illness (ARI). This report uses data from 2,319 children and adults enrolled in the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (Flu VE) Network during December 2, 2013-January 23, 2014, to estimate an interim adjusted effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine for preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection associated with medically attended ARI. During this period, overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) (adjusted for study site, age, sex, race/ethnicity, self-rated health, and days from illness onset to enrollment) against influenza A and B virus infection associated with medically attended ARI was 61%. The influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1) virus that emerged to cause a pandemic in 2009 accounted for 98% of influenza viruses detected. VE was estimated to be 62% against pH1N1 virus infections and was similar across age groups. As of February 8, 2014, influenza activity remained elevated in the United States, the proportion of persons seeing their health-care provider for influenza-like illness was lower than in early January but remained above the national baseline, and activity still might be increasing in some parts of the country. CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices routinely recommend that annual influenza vaccination efforts continue as long as influenza viruses are circulating. Persons aged ≥ 6 months who have not yet been vaccinated this season should be vaccinated. Antiviral medications are an important second line of defense to treat influenza illness and should be used as recommended among suspected or confirmed influenza patients, regardless of patient vaccination status. Early antiviral treatment is recommended for persons with suspected influenza with severe or progressive illness (e.g., hospitalized persons) and those at high risk for complications from influenza, no matter how severe the illness.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2016–2017 [^fd240387]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Future directions — For the 2016–2017 season, postmarketing safety and real-time vaccine effectiveness data will be analyzed as they become available, and continued evaluation of the safety, immunogenicity, and effectiveness of influenza vaccine, especially for children younger than 2 years, is important; complete analyses of quadrivalent vaccines is needed as the number of formulations of IIV4 increases. With limited data on the use of neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) in hospitalized children or in children with comorbid conditions, prospective randomized clinical trials are warranted, and to administer antiviral therapy optimally in hospitalized patients with influenza who cannot tolerate oral or inhaled antiviral agents, FDA-approved intravenous NAIs for children also are needed. A single-dose, intranasal drug, laninamivir octanoate, needs further research as a potential option for influenza prophylaxis in children. The interim recommendation that LAIV4 not be used in children will be reevaluated for future influenza seasons, although analyses of LAIV effectiveness in the United States during the 2016–2017 influenza season will be limited; data on the vaccine effectiveness of LAIV4 against a matched H3N2 virus strain are lacking, analyses of LAIV effectiveness differ somewhat between the CDC and other groups, and LAIV has been documented to be well tolerated in children with a history of anaphylaxis after exposure to egg, similar to IIV.

### Interim estimates of 2021–22 seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness-United States, February 2022 [^a02d2a5f]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

In the United States, annual vaccination against seasonal influenza is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months except when contraindicated (1). Currently available influenza vaccines are designed to protect against four influenza viruses: A(H1N1)pdm09 (the 2009 pandemic virus), A(H3N2), B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage. Most influenza viruses detected this season have been A(H3N2) (2). With the exception of the 2020–21 season, when data were insufficient to generate an estimate, CDC has estimated the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine at preventing laboratory-confirmed, mild/moderate (outpatient) medically attended acute respiratory infection (ARI) each season since 2004–05. This interim report uses data from 3,636 children and adults with ARI enrolled in the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network during October 4, 2021-February 12, 2022. Overall, vaccine effectiveness (VE) against medically attended outpatient ARI associated with influenza A(H3N2) virus was 16% (95% CI = -16% to 39%), which is considered not statistically significant. This analysis indicates that influenza vaccination did not reduce the risk for outpatient medically attended illness with influenza A(H3N2) viruses that predominated so far this season. Enrollment was insufficient to generate reliable VE estimates by age group or by type of influenza vaccine product (1). CDC recommends influenza antiviral medications as an adjunct to vaccination; the potential public health benefit of antiviral medications is magnified in the context of reduced influenza VE. CDC routinely recommends that health care providers continue to administer influenza vaccine to persons aged ≥ 6 months as long as influenza viruses are circulating, even when VE against one virus is reduced, because vaccine can prevent serious outcomes (e.g., hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death) that are associated with influenza A(H3N2) virus infection and might protect against other influenza viruses that could circulate later in the season.

### Development and validation of a clinical prediction tool for seasonal influenza vaccination in england [^4e1a57db]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

For example, a patient can be characterized as unlikely, moderately likely, or highly likely to be vaccinated based on their predicted probability, and EHR prompts could be constructed accordingly. For patients flagged as highly likely, the prompt may advise the HCP to make presumptive and time-saving recommendation (eg, "today we will be giving you your flu shot"). For patients flagged as unlikely, the prompt may include a list of the patient's clinical risk conditions, suggesting that the HCP initiate a personalized dialogue with regard to the patient's specific condition(s) and the importance of vaccination, which would be followed by a presumptive recommendation. As for those patients flagged as moderately likely, the prompt may advise the HCP to make a presumptive recommendation, but also to be prepared to discuss the patient's specific risk conditions if they exhibit hesitancy. This scenario demonstrates 1 way these models potentially can be used to autonomously deliver time-optimizing, patient-tailored guidance to HCPs.

Limitations

Despite the strong predictive performance of these models, this study has some limitations that must be acknowledged. First, we explicitly opted to treat missing values as unknown, rather than the more common approach of imputation or exclusion of observations with missing data. However, in a clinical setting, it is likely that values for some predictors may be missing in the patient's records, such as ethnicity, smoking status, or body mass index. By explicitly modeling these missing values, we preserve their explanatory power among patients that have a known value while retaining the model's ability to predict among patients with missing values, thereby maximizing the model's clinical utility. As for excluding patients aged 65 years or older without IMD data, this was decided to reflect real-world circumstances, in which a patient's IMD measure can simply be obtained via cross-referencing their area of residence with an IMD lookup table.

### Learning from prepandemic data to forecast viral escape [^92ce1dc8]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Effective pandemic preparedness relies on anticipating viral mutations that are able to evade host immune responses to facilitate vaccine and therapeutic design. However, current strategies for viral evolution prediction are not available early in a pandemic-experimental approaches require host polyclonal antibodies to test against 1–16, and existing computational methods draw heavily from current strain prevalence to make reliable predictions of variants of concern 17–19. To address this, we developed EVEscape, a generalizable modular framework that combines fitness predictions from a deep learning model of historical sequences with biophysical and structural information. EVEscape quantifies the viral escape potential of mutations at scale and has the advantage of being applicable before surveillance sequencing, experimental scans or three-dimensional structures of antibody complexes are available. We demonstrate that EVEscape, trained on sequences available before 2020, is as accurate as high-throughput experimental scans at anticipating pandemic variation for SARS-CoV-2 and is generalizable to other viruses including influenza, HIV and understudied viruses with pandemic potential such as Lassa and Nipah. We provide continually revised escape scores for all current strains of SARS-CoV-2 and predict probable further mutations to forecast emerging strains as a tool for continuing vaccine development (evescape.org).

### Successes and failures of the live-attenuated influenza vaccine: can we Do better? [^0b37052d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

The effectiveness of the live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) can vary widely, ranging from 0% to 50%. The reasons for these discrepancies remain largely unclear.

Methods

We use mathematical models to explore how the efficacy of LAIV is affected by the degree of mismatch with the currently circulating influenza strain and interference with pre-existing immunity. The models incorporate 3 key antigenic distances: the distances between the vaccine strain, pre-existing immunity, and the challenge strain.

Results

Our models show that an LAIV that is matched with the currently circulating strain is likely to have only modest efficacy. Our results suggest that the efficacy of the vaccine would be increased (optimized) if, rather than being matched to the circulating strain, it is antigenically slightly further from pre-existing immunity than the circulating strain. The models also suggest 2 regimes in which LAIV that is matched to circulating strains may be protective: in children before they have built immunity to circulating strains and in response to novel strains (such as antigenic shifts) which are at substantial antigenic distance from previously circulating strains. We provide an explanation for the variation in vaccine effectiveness between studies and countries of vaccine effectiveness observed during the 2014–2015 influenza season.

Conclusions

LAIV is offered to children across the world; however, its effectiveness significantly varies between studies. Here, we propose a mechanistic explanation to understand these differences. We further propose a way to select the LAIV strain that would have a higher chance of being protective.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2020–21 influenza season [^165f11a8]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Primary Changes and Updates in the Recommendations

Routine annual influenza vaccination of all persons aged ≥ 6 months who do not have contraindications continues to be recommended. No preferential recommendation is made for one influenza vaccine product over another for persons for whom more than one licensed, recommended, and appropriate product is available. Updated information in this report includes the following:

The composition of the 2020–21 U.S. influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B/Victoria lineage components. These updated components will be included in both trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines. Quadrivalent vaccines will include an additional influenza B virus component from the B/Yamagata lineage, which is unchanged from that included in quadrivalent influenza vaccines used during the 2019–20 season. For the 2020–21 season, U.S. egg-based influenza vaccines (i.e. vaccines other than ccIIV4 and RIV4) will contain hemagglutinin (HA) derived from an influenza A/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an influenza A/Hong Kong/2671/2019 (H3N2)-like virus, an influenza B/Washington/02/2019 (Victoria lineage)-like virus, and (for quadrivalent egg-based vaccines) an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus. U.S. cell culture–based inactivated (ccIIV4) and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from an influenza A/Hawaii/70/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an influenza A/Hong Kong/45/2019 (H3N2)-like virus, an influenza B/Washington/02/2019 (Victoria lineage)-like virus, and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus.
Two new influenza vaccine licensures are described: In November 2019, FDA licensed Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent (HD-IIV4). Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent is approved for use in persons aged ≥ 65 years. For the 2020–21 season, Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent is expected to replace the previously available trivalent formulation of Fluzone High-Dose (HD-IIV3). The dose volume for Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent (0.7 mL) is slightly higher than that of trivalent Fluzone High-Dose (0.5 mL). Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent, like Fluzone High-Dose, contains 4 times the amount of HA per vaccine virus in each dose compared with standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (60 μ g per virus, versus 15 μ g in standard-dose IIVs). In February 2020, FDA licensed Fluad Quadrivalent (aIIV4). Fluad Quadrivalent is approved for use in persons aged ≥ 65 years. For the 2020–21 season, both Fluad Quadrivalent and the previously licensed trivalent formulation of Fluad (aIIV3) are expected to be available. Fluad Quadrivalent, like Fluad, contains the adjuvant MF59.

### Seasonal influenza surveillance and vaccination policies in the WHO south-east Asian region [^db561359]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Influenza, an acute viral infection of the respiratory tract, remains a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality. Like antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and other variants of SARS-CoV-2, it is also considered one of the leading candidates for the next large-scale pandemic following COVID-19. Each year, it infects approximately 5%–10% of adults and 20%–30% of the global children population, but the mild nature of most cases leads to widespread under-reporting and underdiagnosis. Nonetheless, the WHO attributes 3–5 million cases of severe respiratory illness and 290 000–650 000 deaths annually to influenza. The global economic burden of influenza, including direct and indirect costs, absenteeism, and years of life lost due to both mild and severe respiratory illness, is substantial, with low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LICs and LMICs) bearing the brunt of this impact. Influenza A, the primary driver of global influenza seasons, is responsible for annual outbreaks, periodic epidemics, and sporadic pandemics, while influenza B outbreaks occur every 2–4 years. Historically, four out of the five pandemics in the last century have been caused by influenza, resulting in approximately 55 million deaths worldwide.

Since 1952, the WHO has been conducting worldwide influenza surveillance through the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). Currently, 192 member states of the WHO have GISRS components that share viral samples and data to benefit one another. Surveillance plays a critical role in monitoring, reporting and controlling the dynamics of the influenza virus in the respective areas. It also enables in early detection of outbreaks, the selection of appropriate strains for vaccine development and guides in policy development and implementation.

Immunisation remains the best-known strategy for the prevention of influenza illness. The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation prioritises the seasonal influenza vaccine for high-risk groups including healthcare workers (HCWs), children under 59 months, older adults (over 65), pregnant women and those with underlying medical conditions.WHO advocates the establishment of robust influenza surveillance systems, the implementation of seasonal influenza immunisation policies and programmes and further research in key areas across all member states.

Influenza vaccines in development — Development efforts continue for universal vaccines that induce broader protection and eliminate the need for annual vaccination; the success of mRNA and other novel technologies used for COVID‑19 vaccines may accelerate broad influenza vaccines; ongoing federal support of National Institutes of Health (NIH)–sponsored research is crucial; establishing immunity in early life and developing a safe, immunogenic vaccine for infants younger than 6 months are essential; studies of adjuvanted vaccines or novel routes are needed in children; efforts continue to shorten the interval between strain identification and vaccine production.

### SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strain selection: guidance from influenza [^f1de628b]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

When first approved, many hoped that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine would provide long-term protection after a primary series. Waning of immunity and continued appearance of new variants has made booster inoculations necessary. The process is becoming increasingly similar to that used for annual updating of the influenza vaccine. The similarity has become even more apparent with selection of BA.4/BA.5 as the Omicron strain of the updated bivalent (Original + Omicron) COVID-19 vaccines. It is hoped that, if COVID-19 develops winter seasonality, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will require only annual review to determine if updates are necessary. Recommendations on whom should receive the booster would be based on conditions at that time.

### Predictive evolutionary modelling for influenza virus by site-based dynamics of mutations [^31794db5]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Influenza virus continuously evolves to escape human adaptive immunity and generates seasonal epidemics. Therefore, influenza vaccine strains need to be updated annually for the upcoming flu season to ensure vaccine effectiveness. We develop a computational approach, beth-1, to forecast virus evolution and select representative virus for influenza vaccine. The method involves modelling site-wise mutation fitness. Informed by virus genome and population sero-positivity, we calibrate transition time of mutations and project the fitness landscape to future time, based on which beth-1 selects the optimal vaccine strain. In season-to-season prediction in historical data for the influenza A pH1N1 and H3N2 viruses, beth-1 demonstrates superior genetic matching compared to existing approaches. In prospective validations, the model shows superior or non-inferior genetic matching and neutralization against circulating virus in mice immunization experiments compared to the current vaccine. The method offers a promising and ready-to-use tool to facilitate vaccine strain selection for the influenza virus through capturing heterogeneous evolutionary dynamics over genome space-time and linking molecular variants to population immune response.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2017–2018 [^e94ec573]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Influenza surveillance resources — information about influenza surveillance is available through the CDC Voice Information System (influenza update at 1-800-232-4636) or at www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm, and information is posted weekly on the CDC Web site (www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivitysurv.htm). Although current influenza season data on circulating strains do not necessarily predict which and in what proportion strains will circulate in the subsequent season, it is instructive to be aware of 2016–2017 influenza surveillance data and use them as a guide to empirical therapy until current seasonal data are available from the CDC.
