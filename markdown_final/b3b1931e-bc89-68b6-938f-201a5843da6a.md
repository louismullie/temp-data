## Question

A 7-year-old boy presents with a boggy, tender scalp plaque with pustules and patchy alopecia; a KOH prep is positive for dermatophytes and he is diagnosed with kerion (inflammatory tinea capitis). What ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing a 7-year-old boy diagnosed with kerion, i.e., inflammatory tinea capitis, confirmed by a positive KOH prep. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and whether kerion is already encompassed by tinea capitis coding. Then, I should verify the ICD-10-CM category and subcategory structure for dermatophyte infections of the scalp. Next, I will check whether any laterality or additional specificity is required and whether an unspecified code is acceptable if details are unknown. Finally, I will confirm the exact code and ensure it aligns with authoritative coding guidance and pediatric billing principles.

> Let me first confirm the clinical diagnosis. Kerion is an inflammatory manifestation of tinea capitis, typically presenting as a boggy, tender, pustular plaque with patchy alopecia and often lymphadenopathy; the KOH prep confirms dermatophyte infection, which supports the diagnosis of tinea capitis with an inflammatory kerion phenotype [^3438f322] [^0e096431].

> Now, I need to check the ICD-10-CM hierarchy. Tinea capitis is classified under B35 Dermatophytosis, and the specific subcategory is B35.0 Tinea capitis. Wait, let me verify whether kerion requires a separate code or if it is already included within B35.0; I should confirm that kerion is not a distinct ICD-10-CM entity and that B35.0 suffices for inflammatory tinea capitis presentations, including kerion [^1d8e10eb].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any seventh-character laterality is required for B35.0. Unlike some ICD-10-CM categories that mandate laterality (e.g., certain eye conditions), tinea capitis does not require a seventh character for laterality, so B35.0 stands alone without additional digits; I initially wondered if I needed to add a suffix, but that would be incorrect here [^notfound].

> Next, I should review whether an unspecified code is appropriate when the organism is unknown. The ICD-10-CM framework allows use of unspecified codes when clinical information is insufficient to identify the specific pathogen; pediatric coding guidance emphasizes that clinicians should not be penalized for using unspecified codes when details are unavailable, and B35.0 is already specific to tinea capitis, so using B35.0 is appropriate even if the dermatophyte species is not specified in the record [^d495525c].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final code. The correct ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for kerion (inflammatory tinea capitis) in a 7-year-old boy is B35.0 Tinea capitis. I need to ensure I do not add extraneous characters or substitute an alternative code, as B35.0 precisely captures the condition described [^1d8e10eb].

The ICD-10-CM code for kerion (inflammatory tinea capitis) is **B35.0** (Tinea capitis). This code applies to all clinical variants of tinea capitis, including kerion, and does not require a separate code for the inflammatory subtype. Accurate coding supports appropriate management and billing, and clinicians should document the inflammatory features to justify systemic therapy and any adjunctive measures.

## ICD-10-CM code for kerion

The ICD-10-CM code for kerion is **B35.0**, which corresponds to tinea capitis. This code encompasses all clinical variants of tinea capitis, including kerion, and does not require a separate code for the inflammatory subtype.

---

## Clinical features of kerion

Kerion is characterized by the following clinical features:

- **Inflammatory plaques**: Boggy, tender, erythematous plaques on the scalp, often with pustules and purulent discharge.

- **Alopecia**: Patchy hair loss due to inflammation and destruction of hair follicles.

- **Lymphadenopathy**: Regional lymph node enlargement, particularly in the occipital or posterior auricular regions.

- **Systemic symptoms**: Occasionally, fever and malaise may be present, especially in severe cases.

---

## Diagnostic confirmation

Diagnosis of kerion is typically confirmed by:

- **Clinical examination**: Characteristic appearance of boggy, inflamed plaques with pustules and alopecia.

- **KOH preparation**: Direct microscopic examination of scalp scrapings revealing dermatophyte hyphae and spores.

- **Fungal culture**: Identification of the specific dermatophyte species, commonly Trichophyton tonsurans or Microsporum canis.

---

## Management implications

Accurate ICD-10-CM coding of kerion as tinea capitis (B35.0) has important management implications:

- **Systemic antifungal therapy**: Oral griseofulvin, terbinafine, or itraconazole are recommended as first-line treatments for tinea capitis, including kerion.

- **Adjunctive topical therapy**: Topical antifungal shampoos (e.g. ketoconazole or selenium sulfide) may be used to reduce spore burden and transmission.

- **Monitoring for complications**: Persistent inflammation may lead to scarring alopecia, necessitating close follow-up and consideration of additional interventions.

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for kerion (inflammatory tinea capitis) is **B35.0** (Tinea capitis). This code encompasses all clinical variants of tinea capitis, including kerion, and does not require a separate code for the inflammatory subtype. Accurate coding is essential for appropriate clinical management, billing, and epidemiological tracking of this condition.

### The assessment and management of tinea capitis in children [^97f66e18]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis is an infection of the scalp and hair shaft caused by dermatophyte fungi. It is seen in all age groups, and the incidence seems to be on the rise in North America. Clinical diagnosis of tinea capitis can be challenging, as symptoms can vary from minimal pruritus with no hair loss, to severe tenderness, purulence, and permanent scarring in inflammatory kerion lesions. The diagnosis of tinea capitis must be confirmed in the laboratory by using fungal stains or obtaining cultures, since treatment may be prolonged with potential side effects. Systemic therapy is needed because topical antifungals cannot effectively penetrate the hair shaft to eradicate the infection. Oral griseofulvin remains the standard treatment agent, but terbinafine and itraconazole are also effective alternatives (although currently without Food and Drug Administration approval).

Tinea capitis is a fungal infection of the scalp and hair shaft that mainly affects prepubescent children. Its clinical aspects range from a mild noninflammatory infection resembling seborrheic dermatitis to a highly inflammatory swelling reaction (kerion). We report the cases of 2 children who underwent surgical treatment of their kerions under general anesthesia. One lesion had been incised and the other excised. This inappropriate treatment made conservative treatment after surgery more difficult. We recommend that abscesslike lesions on the scalps of children be carefully investigated by surgeons and dermatologists to determine whether they are the result of a dermatophytic infection in order that the appropriate conservative treatment can be initiated.

Conclusion

Kerion is an uncommon manifestation of tinea capitis, and early detection of the disease is necessary to manage the complications. Our research represented one of the largest epidemiological investigations into Kerion in an eleven-year period. The epidemiologic profile of our patients shows that development of the disease is not unlikely in urban areas. Many of our patients had a history of animal contact with sheep. It's important to note that while Kerion is more common in children, it can still occur in adults and should be taken into account in a differential diagnosis. Based on our experience in the dermatology clinic, the majority of patients experienced hair regrowth, albeit with some residual scalp scarring. In general, we recommend systemic corticosteroids in patients with severe inflammatory symptoms to control the inflammation.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

Background

Tinea capitis (TC), a cutaneous fungal infection of the scalp, remains a public health concern worldwide. The disease has inflammatory or non-inflammatory presentations, and Kerion is an uncommon inflammatory subtype. Kerion derives its name from the Greek word for honeycomb Back in time, Kerion was considered a sign of poverty. Fortunately, the development of antifungal treatments and improvements in public health have effectively controlled the prevalence of inflammatory TC. Kerion is more common in rural areas, and factors such as low socioeconomic status, poor hygiene, and crowded living can increase the frequency. T-cell lymphocytes mediate a vigorous, hypersensitive immune response to pathogens, which primarily causes disease. Kerion predominantly affects children between the ages of 3 and 7, with boys more commonly affected than girls.

Fig. 1
Kerion of the scalp (suppurative pustular plaque)

The disease manifests as tender, pustular, boggy, inflammatory plaques (Fig. 1). Alopecia, changes in skin color, and bacterial superinfection are potential complications that may mimic other conditions such as abscesses, cellulitis, psoriasis, alopecia areata, atopic dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis, potentially leading to a misdiagnosis. The absence of a standardized guideline for diagnosing Kerion can lead to delays in accurate diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis is typically based on clinical suspicion, followed by further confirmation through lesion culture or microscopic identification using direct testing with potassium hydroxide preparation (KOH). Researchers rarely investigate the transmission mode of this uncommon disease. Also, information on the condition is primarily derived from case report studies, highlighting the importance of larger studies.

The incidence of Kerion hasn't yet been studied in referral hospitals in Iran. With respect to demographic factors, mode of transmission, and treatment outcomes, the present study retrospectively reviews cases with clinically diagnosed inflammatory TC treated in the dermatology department of Shahid Faghihi referral hospital to expand the information on the condition.

### Dissecting cellulitis mimicking kerion in a 9-year-old boy [^53b0a0dd]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp (DCS) is an uncommon disease characterized by painful boggy and suppurative nodules and sinus tracts of the scalp. DCS is a progressive disorder that can cause extensive scarring alopecia. In DCS, an intense inflammatory response is believed to be caused by occlusion of follicles by keratin, and sometimes potentiated by overlying bacterial infection. DCS is part of the follicular occlusion tetrad, along with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), acne conglobata, and pilonidal cysts. Typically, DCS is diagnosed in men aged between 20 and 40 years with skin type IV and above. On histology, early stages are characterized by dense lymphocytic, neutrophilic, and histiocytic infiltrate. Later stages are defined by granulomas of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and foreign-body giant cells. Fibrotic changes are typical of end-stage disease. Clinically, DCS can be mistaken for bacterial or fungal infections (eg, abscesses or kerion), or other inflammatory scalp dermatoses (eg, alopecic and aseptic nodules of the scalp [AANS]). We present a 9-year-old boy with DCS originally thought to have tinea capitis and kerion. To our knowledge, this is the youngest reported case of DCS.

Methods

Study design, study population, and data gathering

With the extraction of information from the electronic database in the dermatology department of Shahid Faghihi Hospital, we identified 132 patients with tinea capitis between April 2011 and August 2022 (11 years). Patients with a clinical diagnosis of tinea capitis or those diagnosed through a KOH test or pathogen culture met the inclusion criteria. The study excluded patients whose final diagnosis was not tinea capitis. The following factors were ascertained: age, gender, place of residence, familial history, medical history, contact with animals, history of other fungal infections, date of admission and discharge, systemic symptoms such as lymphadenopathy and fever, laboratory profile, systemic and topical antifungal treatment. An expert physician conducted telephone conversations with patients to collect information on treatment outcomes. Despite conducting a 6-week follow-up after patients' discharge, the absence of a registration system in an outpatient setting prevented the documentation of outcome data in electronic databases.

Ethical statement

The study protocol received approval from the Research Ethics Committees of the School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, located in Shiraz, Iran (ethics code: IR.SUMS.MED.REC.1401.148). The data for this retrospective study came from the patients' hospital records. According to the research ethics consideration in biomedical sciences approved by the Health Ministry of Iran, upon admission to the hospital, all patients (or parents or legal guardians for patients under 18 years of age) signed a consent form authorizing the use of their hospital records for research purposes, anonymously.

Statistical analyses of the data

We analyzed the data using SPSS version 25 and STATA 14.2. We used chi-square, independent t-test, and ANOVA tests. Using descriptive statistics, we defined the presence of scalp ringworm as well as current clinical, demographic, and epidemiological patterns. We used the chi-square test to examine the relationship between gender and factors, such as age and place of residence. We used the independent t-test to investigate the relationship between the number of hospital days and clinical symptoms. The p-value of equal to or less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Epidemiology, clinical features, and outcome of the hospitalized patients with kerion in fars province, iran: an eleven-year retrospective study [^877e26bd]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study was subject to several limitations. First, our patients had typical manifestations of Kerion, and further mycological tests were not a routine in our hospital, and we don't have the pathogenic spectrum of our patients. Additionally, the 6-week follow-up visits of our patients were done in an outpatient setting, and data were not recorded at the time, and we had missing data on treatment results. Furthermore, this study cannot be generalized to a broader population for the following reasons: First, the demographic distribution in our study may only represent Kerion patients in our region. Second, our study sample includes hospitalized patients and does not involve outpatients. Furthermore, the majority of patients with tinea capitis seek care at primary healthcare centers, and tertiary hospitals refer selected cases, thereby introducing unavoidable referral bias. Finally, this study covers an 11-year period, and our sample size is limited.

In this regard, future research on tinea capitis could explore various aspects that may enhance public health outcomes. We recommend additional research to examine the role of domestic and farm animals in the transmission of tinea capitis, as well as the effectiveness of educational campaigns in reducing infection rates across various communities. Furthermore, genetic research could shed light on why individuals in specific regions are more susceptible to developing Kerion. Lastly, upcoming research could investigate the role of telehealth in diagnosing and treating patients in remote regions, aiming to improve access to care while reducing health costs.

### Introduction… [^f86d9f82]. stacks.cdc.gov (2023). Medium credibility.

Tinea incognito describes steroid-modified tinea. In some patients, especially those who are immunosuppressed or who have a history of corticosteroid use, dermatophyte infections may spread to involve extensive skin areas, and, in rare cases, may extend to the dermis and hair follicle. Over the past decade, dermatophytoses cases not responding to standard of care therapy have been increasingly reported. These cases are especially prevalent in the Indian subcontinent,… Tinea corporis is most caused by The most common cause of tinea cruris worldwide is Risk factors, clinical features, and differential diagnosis of tinea corporis and cruris are listed in The most rapid and cost-effective diagnostic technique for tinea corporis and cruris is direct microscopic examination with 10–15% potassium hydroxide preparation using skin scrapings of the affected area showing segmented hyphae [.

Position statements released in 2019 by the Canadian Pediatric Society recommend that adjunctive topical corticosteroid therapy be avoided due to the risk of skin atrophy [For widespread infection involving multiple areas, disease refractory to topical therapy, or tinea corporis with vellus hair involvement (Terbinafine is the recommended first-line therapy in treatment-naïve patients with tinea corporis or cruris [.

First-line therapy for tinea capitis is oral antifungal therapy, as topical therapy cannot effectively penetrate the hair shaft. Although many controlled trials described herein are exclusive to pediatric patients, the same medications are used in adult patients.

### Tinea capitis in an immigrant pediatric community; a clinical signs-based treatment approach [^bb99cd43]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Tinea capitis is an infection of the scalp and hair follicles, caused by dermatophytes. Dermatophytes is a common name of three genera of fungi – Trichophyton, Microsporum and Epidermophyton, with the first two species being most dominant. Dermatophytes are also classified by host preference and natural habitat, with anthropophilic dermatophytes affecting humans, zoophilic dermatophytes affecting animals, and geophilic dermatophytes mainly affecting the soil. The latter two are relatively rare. All dermatophytes can exploit keratin (hair, skin, and nails) for growth and their clinical manifestations are named after the affected area of the body (e.g. Tinea manum, Tinea pedis, Tinea capitis). Tinea capitis is one of the most common cutaneous infections in pre-pubertal children, mainly from 6 months to 10–12 years of age. The epidemiology of Tinea capitis varies across geographical regions throughout the world and changes over time. The infection spreads among family members and classmates 1.

The clinical manifestations of Tinea capitis are variable, depending on the type of hair invasion, the level of host resistance, the immune system and the degree of inflammatory host response, but can grossly be classified as alopecic or inflammatory. Inflammatory Tinea capitis includes kerion, which manifests as a tender mass with pustules, purulent discharge, lymphadenopathy, malaise, fever, and favus, with yellow cup-shaped crusts around the hair, inflammation and scarring.

Tinea capitis is often misdiagnosed, thus delaying appropriate treatment and enabling spread of infection. The diagnosis can be made in several ways. First and foremost, anamnesis and physical examination are crucial. In recent years, the dermatoscope has become more commonly used for close inspection of the scalp. Diagnosis can be confirmed by direct microscopy, with use of standard potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparations. Its disadvantages include the time-consuming process, requirement of an expert and equipment not necessarily available in every clinic, and a false negative rate of up to 40%. In addition, scalp scrapings and hair fragments from the affected area can be cultured, but can involve up to 3 weeks until results are provided. Molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), provide for faster and more accurate identification of dermatophyte infections.

### Diagnostic approach to tinea capitis with kerion: a retrospective study [^7f92d77b]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Kerion is an inflammatory type of tinea capitis manifesting as boggy crusted nodules. Diagnosis of kerion is often challenging due to high rates of false-negative mycological samples.

Methods

A retrospective study among children with kerion, prior to antifungal treatment, was conducted to assess rates of false-negative mycological samples. Specimens for direct microscopy and fungal culture were collected at baseline and after administration of an oral antibiotic course, with or without an oral steroid course. Kerion was categorized as highly inflammatory when a painful, moist scalp nodule with spontaneous purulent discharge or exuberant crust was present, or mildly inflammatory when an erythematous, dry scalp nodule was seen.

Results

Twenty-three children (mean age 7.9 ± 3.0years) were included in the study. Trichophyton tonsurans was the most common species isolated (69.6%). Highly inflammatory kerions were significantly more likely to be culture negative before treatment than mildly inflammatory kerions (80% vs. 16.7%, p < .01). Non-inflammatory tinea capitis lesions (n = 13) were culture positive in all cases. Following a combined oral antibiotic and steroid course given to most highly inflammatory kerions (n = 11/13), higher rates of positive fungal cultures were found compared to baseline (90.9% vs. 18.2%, p < .01).

Conclusion

High rates of negative fungal cultures were found only in highly inflammatory kerion. Sampling a highly inflammatory kerion after a combined oral antibiotic and steroid course improved rates of positive fungal cultures. In addition, sampling of non-inflammatory tinea capitis lesions (when present in addition to the kerion) had the highest culture sensitivity.

Methods

Study design

This was a retrospective study, conducted in the district of Tel-Aviv, Israel. The study analyzed the records of children aged 0–8 years (2 months – 7.7 years) with a clinical manifestation or positive culture of Tinea capitis, who were referred to a dermatologist in a secondary referral clinic of the Meuhedet sick fund and treated by the same dermatologist between January 2016 and December 2017. Data extracted from patient electronic records included: age, sex, country of birth, origin of parents, duration of lesion until contact with the dermatologist, infected family member (yes/no), high IgE level (yes/no), eosinophil blood count, history of immunosuppression, medical history, lesion description (alopecia, scaling, pruritus) and morphology, presence of kerion and lymphadenopathy, culture results, outcome of microscopic examination of skin scrapings and hair fragments (KOH exam), topical treatment (yes/no) and type and duration of systemic treatment.

Statistical analysis

All measured variables and derived parameters are presented using descriptive statistics. The correlation between background clinical and demographic data and Tinea capitis diagnosis was assessed using the chi-squared and Wilcoxon tests. Correlations between demographic/clinical/laboratory characteristics and other types of fungi or other important findings were assessed using a T-test.

All tests were two-tailed, and a p -value of 5% or less was considered statistically significant. The data were analyzed using SAS® version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).

### Epidemiology, clinical features, and outcome of the hospitalized patients with kerion in fars province, iran: an eleven-year retrospective study [^e8f0681d]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Kerion, a severe inflammatory type of tinea capitis, presents with purulent, boggy swelling and alopecia. Few articles in the literature provide information on this uncommon manifestation of tinea capitis (TC). This study aimed to determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with Kerion over an 11-year period in an inpatient setting.

Methods

In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we enrolled all the admitted patients with inflammatory TC in the dermatology department of Shahid Faghihi referral hospital during 2011–2022. The data included demographic factors, animal contact, treatment, outcome, and past medical profiles. We used STATA 14.2 to analyze the data.

Results

One hundred and thirty-two patients with Kerion were enrolled in to the study. the mean age of patients was 7.6 ± 5.8 years. Boys (82.5%, n = 109) significantly outnumbered girls (17.5%, n = 23), and 82.2% of patients were under 11 years of age. Eight patients were one to two years old, two were infants under one year old, and five were adults. More than half (52.2%) of the patients were from rural areas. Most of the cases had heavily utilized systemic antifungal therapy, antibiotics, and corticosteroids. In addition, 43 patients reported positive animal contact. Over the course of an eleven-year period, there was a downward trend in the number of hospitalized patients.

Conclusion

We report one of the largest studies on Kerion patients over an eleven-year period. We have expanded the information on Kerion patients' epidemiology, transmission mode, and clinical outcomes. To develop preventative strategies for Kerion, future studies should focus on additional risk factors and individual susceptibilities.

### A retrospective study of the management of pediatric kerion in trichophyton tonsurans infection [^cdfcd0c5]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Kerion celsi is the inflammatory extreme of tinea capitis, representing a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the causative dermatophyte. Some authors have advocated the use of oral corticosteroids in patients with kerion formation to inhibit the host inflammatory response and minimize the risk of scarring. This retrospective study analyzed the management and outcome of all children younger than 10 years old presenting to our pediatric dermatology service with tinea capitis resulting in kerion formation between 2003 and 2009. We propose that kerion treatment be directed toward the underlying dermatophyte. Oral and intralesional corticosteroids are an unnecessary adjunct to oral antifungal therapy for children with tinea capitis presenting with kerion in urban areas.

### Tinea capitis: an update [^3d5559ec]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Tinea capitis is an important superficial infection and affects children globally. A literature review was conducted to identify recent findings and the current understanding of this fungal infection. Here, we highlight updates on important aspects of tinea capitis including advances in dermatophyte detection and diagnosis and comparing these new methods to more traditional techniques. Additionally, aspects of treating tinea capitis are discussed, including the importance of mycological confirmation and current means of treatment, and the treatment of asymptomatic carriers are reviewed. This review also examines the subject of laboratory monitoring of patients undergoing treatment with systemic antifungals; we discuss the opinions of prominent researchers and currently accepted guidelines. Lastly, we provide answers to several common questions that practitioners may encounter when treating a child with tinea capitis.

### Inadequate diagnostic testing and systemic antifungal prescribing for tinea capitis in an observational cohort study of 3.9 million children, United States [^1d8e10eb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Tinea capitis (TC), a dermatophyte scalp and hair shaft infection, is an important public health concern. Confirmatory testing (eg, direct microscopy, fungal culture) before treatment is generally considered best practice because suspected TC has a broad differential diagnosis and treatment requires prolonged oral antifungal therapy. Since national data on TC epidemiology, testing, and treatment practices are lacking, our objectives were to calculate TC incidence and describe testing and treatment practices for a large cohort of commercially insured children in the United States.

We analyzed Merative MarketScan Commercial Database, selecting patients aged < 18 years with ≥ 1 outpatient visit during July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020, continuous insurance enrollment during the 180 to 365 days surrounding the first outpatient visit, and no TC diagnosis on or in the 180 days before the first outpatient visit. We calculated 1-year TC incidence, stratifying by demographic features. We identified TC cases and TC-related diagnostic testing using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, code B35.0 and Current Procedural Terminology codes. We compared diagnostic and treatment practices among specialties using χ 2 tests (α = 0.05).

Among 3,929,156 patients, 1-year TC incidence per 10,000 person-years was 16.3 (95% CI, 15.9–16.7) (Table I). Incidence was highest among 5-year-olds (31.6; 95% CI, 29.1–34.0), males (20.9; 95% CI, 20.3–21.5), and Southern residents (22.5; 95% CI, 21.8–23.2).

Most patients with TC were diagnosed by pediatricians (54.6%), followed by dermatologists (11.7%) and family practitioners (10.4%) (Table II). Confirmatory testing was infrequent (21.9%), and the most common tests were fungal culture (17.8%) and direct microscopy (9.7%). Testing was more frequent among patients diagnosed by dermatologists (51.0%) than by pediatricians (16.4%) or family practitioners (11.0%) (P < .01).

### Clinical clues and trends in epidemiology and pathogens in paediatric tinea capitis: a retrospective cohort study [^fda8c0f8]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tinea capitis is the most common dermatophyte infection in children. Pathogens differ between populations. During the past few decades pathogen shifts have been reported in many countries around the world. This study aimed to characterize the pathogens involved in tinea capitis in a large tertiary paediatric medical centre in Israel.

Methods

The electronic medical records of the dermatology unit were searched for patients diagnosed with tinea capitis from 2010 to 2019, and demographic, clinical and mycological data were retrieved. A stepwise logistic regression was performed to determine the variables most significantly associated with positive cultures.

Results

The prevalence of Trichophyton tonsurans isolates was found to be significantly increased during 2019. In the logistic regression analysis, alopecia was most significantly associated with a positive culture (OR = 8.72, 95% CI 4.29–17.7, P < 0.001) while positive culture was also associated with age (OR = 1.11 per year of age, 95% CI 1.02–1.22, P = 0.01) and Ethiopian ethnicity (OR = 3.67, 95% CI 1.42–9.45, P = 0.01). The presentation of alopecia was significantly related to having a positive culture. This symptom was more prevalent in boys than in girls, and the diagnosis of tinea capitis was delayed by an average of 2months in girls.

Conclusion

The results of this study may herald a pathogen shift in Israel. Physicians should be aware that rates of alopecia are lower in girls and this can result in delayed diagnosis and the development of complications, including chronicity, scarring alopecia and kerion formation.

### Epidemiology, clinical features, and outcome of the hospitalized patients with kerion in fars province, iran: an eleven-year retrospective study [^ea670015]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Globally, people widely recognize tinea capitis as a public health concern, especially in developing countries. In this study, we reported one of the largest epidemiological studies conducted among Kerion patients admitted in a tertiary referral hospital in Iran. The major findings of our study were the decreased number of hospitalized Kerion patients over the last decade and the high incidence of the disease among boys under the age of 11. Many patients identified close contact with sheep as a source of infection. Hair regrowth with some scarring was the most frequently reported treatment outcome.

Kerion is an intense type of TC caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to pathogen mediated by T-cell lymphocytes. While it is commonly linked to zoophilic dermatophytes like Microsporum canis, anthropophilic agents such as Trichophyton tonsurans have become increasingly responsible, particularly in urban areas. In our study, nearly half of the Kerion cases were from urban areas, reflecting these recent observations. A recent study also reported a similar even distribution of the disease. Increased human-animal contact in urban settings and greater interaction between urban and rural populations, facilitated by improved transportation, could contribute to these findings. Understanding these epidemiological trends is crucial in developing targeted preventative strategies to manage tinea capitis.

Direct contact with humans, soil, or infected animals can transmit keritosis, but pinpointing the precise source of infection is frequently challenging and rarely investigated. We discovered that 43 patients had a history of animal contact, with sheep being the most frequent source, which is particularly noteworthy given the cultural context in Iran. Iran is an Islamic country with relatively low pet ownership, where most of the animal contacts are with sheep that are held for dairy farming. This finding highlights the significance of our results, as future preventative measures could address this possible infection source. The literature further provides multiple infection sources. In a study involving 121 inflammatory TC patients in Tunisia, 29 cases reported positive animal contact, primarily with cats and dogs. The source of infection in some case report studies has been identified as dog, cat shared comb use, handmade belt, family member, and soil. Furthermore, one of our patients developed Kerion after head trauma, reflecting the same scenario in a previous study. We do not identify head injury as a potential predisposing factor for Kerion; however, given the multifactorial nature of the disease, a thorough patient history can enhance our understanding of the condition.

### Tinea capitis in an immigrant pediatric community; a clinical signs-based treatment approach [^47460065]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The presented findings emphasized the importance of diagnosis and treatment of these immigrant children by their primary pediatric doctor since it takes, as mentioned, an average of 4.3 months until they visit a dermatologist. During this critical time period, the scalp can become severely and permanently damaged, and the infection can become systemic or cause an outbreak within the entire community. In conclusion, we recommend to relate to scaly scalp in high-risk populations as Tinea capitis, and to treat with griseofulvin at a dosage of up to 50 mg/kg/day, starting from the first presentation to the pediatrician.

### Neonatal kerion celsi: report of three cases [^acc8e128]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis is a fungal infection caused by dermatophytes, frequent in children but uncommon in the neonatal period. Kerion Celsi is the inflammatory manifestation of tinea capitis secondary to host immunologic responses and its occurrence in newborns is extremely infrequent. We describe three neonates with the diagnosis of kerion Celsi. The isolated dermatophytes were Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. mentagrophytes in two patients and Trichophyton rubrum in the third. Both patients with T. mentagrophytes referred an indirect contact with rabbits and were successfully treated with systemic antifungal (griseofulvin and fluconazole). The patient with T. rubrum had a father with a tinea manuum and both received just topical antimycotic treatment.

The yearly incidence of Kerion patients admitted to our tertiary dermatology center. Notably, boys outnumbered girls consistently throughout the study period.

During the clinical examination, all patients displayed the typical presentation of Kerion. Thirty-two patients had fever, and 42 had cervical lymphadenopathy. The analysis revealed differences in the prevalence of fever, lymphadenopathy, and remote dermatophytosis between males and females. For fever, 5.3% of males and 18.9% of females reported experiencing it, suggesting a higher likelihood in females. Conversely, lymphadenopathy was present in 25.7% of males and 6% of females, indicating a higher likelihood in males. Similarly, remote dermatophytosis was reported in 17.4% of males and 2.2% of females, suggesting a higher likelihood in males (Fig. 4). However, these differences were not statistically significant, meaning they could have occurred by chance and may not represent true relationships between gender and these conditions (the p-values for fever, lymphadenopathy, and remote dermatophytosis were 0.450, 0.739, and 0.381, respectively). The results showed no correlation between the presence of these systemic symptoms and the length of hospital stay (p-values of 0.758 and 0.415 for fever and lymphadenopathy, respectively). Additionally, 26 patients had fungal infections other than tinea capitis, and in these patients, no significant relationship was found between the length of hospital stay and the presence of non-scalp fungal infection (p-value = 0.707). These findings suggest that the presence of systemic symptoms or non-scalp fungal infections did not impact the length of hospital stay in this study population.

### Dissecting cellulitis mimicking kerion in a 9-year-old boy [^a8ebb52c]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 9-year-old healthy boy with skin type V presented to the pediatric dermatology clinic with a 1-year history of scalp nodules and alopecia. He had been treated with ketoconazole shampoo. On examination, he had scattered alopecic scaly round thin plaques, cervical lymphadenopathy, tender papules and small nodules, some with drainage (Fig 1). There was no family history of fungal infection or scalp lesions, however, his mother had HS managed with adalimumab. The patient was prescribed oral griseofulvin 20 mg/kg/d for 6 weeks and topical ketoconazole shampoo for presumptive tinea capitis and kerion. Because of discomfort, a 7-day course of oral prednisolone was also given. Fungal culture and potassium hydroxide examination of the scalp scrapings obtained before treatment, were negative. After completion of this regimen, the boggy, painful lesions resolved, leaving round plaques of scarring alopecia. Two weeks later, the scalp nodules recurred. Repeat fungal and bacterial cultures were negative. He then received subsequent treatments with oral terbinafine, prednisolone, and oral cephalexin, all with temporary reduction in the size and drainage of the nodules but the scalp never fully cleared. Eventually, the nodules recurred and were worse than initial presentation (Fig 2).

A punch biopsy was performed from an inflamed scalp nodule and a trial of intralesional kenalog (ILK) was injected to the largest nodule. On histopathology, a predominantly reticular dermal, periadnexal and perivascular, mixed inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils, and occasional eosinophils were seen. Periodic acid–Schiff stain was negative. Dermal fibrosis with focal scarring was present (Fig 3). These findings, coupled with the clinical picture, were consistent with DCS.

A. Percentage of the different types of dermatophyte fungi in culture among children with suspected tinea capitis. B. Percentage of the different types of dermatophyte fungi by host preference

Tinea capitis cases in children in this community prior to this study, were treated with griseofulvin as first-line therapy at a maximum dose of 25 mg/kg/day for 6–8 weeks, which induced a minimal response, if any. In order to eradicate and prevent spread of the infection, the recommended drug dose was gradually elevated to a dose of 50 mg/kg/day, for 6–8 weeks, which efficiently eradicated the infection. From then on, all children suspected to have Tinea capitis were treated with griseofulvin at this doubled dose.

During the study period, due to unavailability of griseofulvin for some time, 21 patients were treated with fluconazole, at a maximum dose of 7.5 mg/kg/day, for 4 weeks. None of these children showed a clinical response, even when the dose was raised to 10 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks. After the return of griseofulvin to the market, these children were treated with griseofulvin 50 mg/kg/day; clearance was achieved within 6 weeks in most cases, except for 3 children who required 8 weeks of treatment until the condition fully resolved.

Five children presented with kerion. In addition to antifungal treatment, they were treated with antibiotics and steroids. None required surgical intervention. Two children with both a negative culture and negative direct examination and suspected of having seborrheic dermatitis, were not treated empirically for Tinea capitis. Two other children with uncertainty regarding the possibility of Tinea capitis or seborrheic dermatitis diagnosis, were given empirical treatment, which was discontinued after receiving negative culture results.

Four children who showed no response to griseofulvin had a R. mucilaginosa -positive culture and were treated accordingly.

All children received topical treatment as adjunct therapy, as recommended, in order to reduce contagion. No clinical side effects or blood test abnormalities were observed in the participants during treatment. All treatments and responses are summarized in Table 4.

### Case report: tinea capitis in a 10-year-old child… [^9c3a1d69]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: Scalp dermatitis with scaling can be challenging to diagnose in children. Tinea capitis, the most common cause of hair loss among children, should be excluded. A 10-year-old patient presented with a seven-year history of scalp scaling, beginning with a quarter-sized, well-demarcated scaly plaque of hair loss, previously diagnosed as seborrheic dermatitis and treated with topical antifungals and corticosteroids. Two months earlier, the patient developed fluctuance, purulent drainage, and alopecia. The patient had an erythematous, boggy patch of alopecia involving more than 50% of the scalp and clinically consistent with a kerion., an inflammatory subtype characterized by tender, erythematous, boggy plaques with thick crusting, often with pustules and purulent drainage. 1, 2 The patient had no cervical lymphadenopathy. A potassium hydroxide scraping test and Wood lamp examination were negative. A punch biopsy found hyphae and spores within the hair shaft.

The fungal culture grew Trichophyton tonsurans. The patient was treated with griseofulvin, 20 to 25 mg per kg per day, and ketoconazole 2% shampoo applied to the scalp for five minutes, rinsed daily for two weeks, and then rinsed twice a week for six weeks. The kerion resolved after eight weeks, leaving patchy alopecia with permanent scarring. Tinea capitis can mimic seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, scalp psoriasis, sebopsoriasis, and discoid lupus. It can develop into a kerion. 1, 2 It is caused by advanced disease and an exaggerated immune response, predominantly found in children five to 10 years of age. 3 More than 20 misdiagnosed cases have been reported, usually as bacterial abscesses or dissecting cellulitis. 4 Delayed treatment increases risk of permanent hair loss. Tinea capitis should be treated with systemic antifungals because topical medications inadequately penetrate the hair follicle. 2 Oral griseofulvin is the first-line treatment.

5 A systematic review found that griseofulvin was more effective for Microsporum species, whereas terbinafine was equally or slightly more effective for Trichophyton dermatophytes. 1, 5 Some clinicians treat kerion with prednisone, although combination treatment may not be superior to antifungals alone. 6 Antibiotics are unnecessary unless a secondary bacterial infection is identified.
6. Topical antifungal shampoos as an adjunctive scalp treatment can decrease infectivity and be used in family members to decrease risk of reinfection from asymptomatic carriers. Ketoconazole 2% shampoo should be applied to the scalp for five to 10 minutes, two to three times per week for at least two weeks or until the infection has cleared. Fomites should be disinfected or discarded because dermatophytes can stay viable for prolonged periods. 1 The authors thank Dr. Wendi E. Wohltmann for her expertise as the dermatopathologist for this case and article review.

### Epidemiologic trends in pediatric tinea capitis: a population-based study from kaiser permanente Northern California [^02bc7007]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemic levels of tinea capitis (TC) have previously been reported in children.

Objective

We sought to determine new epidemiologic trends for TC among northern California children from 1998 through 2007.

Methods

Annual incidence of TC was based on diagnosis code or first-time antifungal prescriptions in all children up to age 15 years at Kaiser Permanente Northern California.

Results

An average of 672,373 children/y met the inclusion criteria. Trend analyses showed decreases in TC by diagnosis code and by prescriptions (73.7% and 23.7%, respectively). Girls had lower incidence rates than boys by diagnosis (111.9 vs 146.4, P < .001 for 1998, and 27.9 vs 39.9, P < .001 for 2007). African Americans had the highest incidence rates by diagnosis (447.3 in 1998 and 184.1 in 2007) compared with other ethnic groups. Trichophyton tonsurans was the predominant organism (89.4% of all positive fungal cultures in 1998 and 91.8% in 2007). Prescriptions for griseofulvin declined, whereas the prescriptions for other antifungals increased.

Limitations

This was a retrospective study.

Conclusions

In this cohort, there was a significant decrease in incidence of TC over the study period. Trichophyton tonsurans continued to be the predominant organism. These trends may be a result of improved education, recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of TC and increased use of new oral antifungals.

### Epidemiologic features and risk of scarring in pediatric patients with kerion celsi [^b4072931]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Kerion celsi represents the inflammatory extreme of tinea capitis, as a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the causative dermatophyte. Data regarding prevalence, trends in pathogens, and risk factors for scarring are limited.

Objective

The main objective of the study is to assess clinical and epidemiologic features of children with kerion celsi and risk factors for scarring.

Methods

We reviewed medical records of pediatric patients with kerion celsi treated between January 2006 and July 2020.

Results

Among 80 patients, the prevalence of permanent alopecia was 27.5%. Patients with remaining alopecia presented to our clinic at a mean 1.3 months earlier than those with complete response to treatment (2.2 ± 2.1 and 3.4 ± 4.8, respectively; p < .05). Patients of Ethiopian ethnicity were more represented than in the general population; however, scarring was observed in only 11% (p = 0.08). Outcomes did not differ by pathogen, antifungal treatment prescribed, duration of treatment, or the use of prednisone or antibiotics.

Conclusions

Scarring alopecia is a common complication of kerion celsi. Host innate immune response, pathogen virulence, and treatment timeline should be considered as possible variables affecting risk of scarring in the future studies.

### Epidemiology, clinical features, and outcome of the hospitalized patients with kerion in fars province, iran: an eleven-year retrospective study [^000a1e06]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

As was found in our study, the majority of TC patients were boys, which is consistent with patterns seen in previous studies and in Iran. Huyen et al. reported that 64% of the 25 inpatient Kerion cases were males. However, the differences in patient gender have not always been identified. The gender of patients may influence their vulnerability to certain types of fungal infections, but the relationship remains incompletely understood. The chemical and physical structure of the skin, along with its normal microbiota, play a crucial role in antifungal resistance. In this case, a study suggests that progesterone and related compounds may help limit infections in women by slowing the growth of dermatophytes. This may allow the host immune system to clear the infection. This observation could help explain why males are more susceptible to tinea capitis. Future research should explore the interactions between hormonal factors, skin structure, and the suitability of fungi.

Our study result was similar to prior studies, indicating that TC mostly appeared in children between 6 and 11 years of age. A study among 25 inpatient Kerion cases found that children between ages four and eleven mostly experience the disease. The resistance of adult hair to TC is believed to be the fungistatic property of fatty acids, as well as colonization of sebum by the fungus Pityrosporum orbiculare. Although Kerion mostly appears in children, we had five adult Kerion patients without any predisposing factors, such as immunosuppression. Half of them were from rural areas, and the other half were from urban areas. Previous reports have documented a few cases of adult Kerion, even among immunocompetent individuals. Therefore, it is not implausible to consider Kerion as a potential differential diagnosis in adults. Two of our patients were infants from both rural and urban areas, neither of whom reported any history of animal contact. It's likely that asymptomatic households might have been the source of infection. Family members have been the previously reported source of infant contamination.

### Racial disparities, risk factors, and clinical management practices for tinea capitis: an observational cohort study among US children with medicaid [^5a21d2c2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: Tinea capitis (TC), a common childhood scalp and hair dermatophytosis, is associated with lower socioeconomic status, but national data on TC incidence and risk factors among children from lower income households are lacking to guide public health efforts and clinical care. We estimated incidence, assessed risk factors, and described clinical practices for TC among a large US cohort of Medicaid-insured children.

In the Merative MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid Database *, we identified TC cases among children < 18 years, underlying conditions, and TC-related diagnostic testing † (Supplementary Table I, available via Mendeley at). We calculated 1-year TC incidence overall and by race/ethnicity, age, and underlying health conditions. We used Poisson regression to assess associations between risk factors and TC incidence and compared TC diagnostic and treatment patterns by race/ethnicity using χ 2 tests (α = 0.05).

Among 4,148,385 Medicaid patients, 1-year TC incidence per 10,000 person-years was 59.1 (95% CI: 58.4–59.9) (Table I). Incidence was highest in children who were 3 to 5 years old (118.4, 95% CI: 116.0–120.8), male (71.2, 95% CI: 70.1–72.3), and non-Hispanic Black (Black) (129.6, 95% CI: 127.7–131.5). Adjusting for age, sex, and underlying health conditions, TC incidence rates were 6.7 times higher in Black vs non-Hispanic White children (95% CI: 6.5–7.0) (Supplementary Fig 1, available via Mendeley at). Younger age, male sex, atopy, HIV infection, and immune-mediated inflammatory disease were independently associated with higher TC incidence.

### The role of ingrown hairs in persistent kerion of children: a clinical study [^a8aaf7b3]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Tinea capitis, an infection of the hair, follicles, and surrounding skin caused by dermatophytes, occurs with notable frequency in children, including those who are not immunocompromised, with a particular prevalence among preschool‐aged children. Although the spectrum of pathogens varies significantly with geography and over time, tinea capitis continues to be a global public health issue, particularly in developing countries where sanitation and nutrition may be inadequate. Kerion, a severe inflammatory form of tinea capitis, can result in scarring alopecia and extensive tissue damage, in addition to common symptoms such as erythema, scaling, and abscess formation.

Persistent kerion exhibits more extensive involvement and increased severity in the infrequently reported cases of tinea capitis that are refractory to treatment, and managing cases resistant to systemic antifungal agents poses a significant challenge. In this process, ingrown hairs may play an important role. Ingrown hairs, also named pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB), can act as foreign bodies to cause local inflammations. The erythema papulopustular lesions mainly involves the beard, neck, submental, and groin areas. In fact, ingrown hairs can occur in any area where traumatic hair removal has been performed, but reports of scalp involvement are rare, especially in infections. Clinical practice in our patients suggested that ingrown hairs might be a contributing factor to the prolonged duration and suboptimal outcomes in persistent cases of tinea capitis, particularly in kerion. Further research into the cause and progression of this condition could enhance prevention and treatment strategies for tinea capitis that is unresponsive to conventional therapies.

This prospective study evaluated persistent kerion cases among children with tinea capitis at our hospital, documenting six instances that showed limited improvement with standard antifungal therapy and were subsequently treated effectively with ingrown hair removal. The study also discussed the potential role of ingrown hairs in superficial fungal infections affecting the hair.

### Inadequate diagnostic testing and systemic antifungal prescribing for tinea capitis in an observational cohort study of 3.9 million children, United States [^c8eb2bee]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, 75.9% of patients were prescribed any antifungal, 61.2% were prescribed an oral antifungal (most frequently griseofulvin [52.7%]), and 14.7% were prescribed topical antifungal therapy alone. Patients prescribed topical therapy alone were more often diagnosed by family practitioners (22.1%) than by dermatologists (17.5%) or pediatricians (10.1%) (P < .01).

Most patients diagnosed with TC received no confirmatory laboratory testing, which is concerning because visual inspection alone of suspected cutaneous fungal infections can lead to diagnostic errors and unnecessary antifungal use. Low testing rates might be due to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments restrictions, long turnaround times, and low reimbursement rates. Guidelines recommend against using topical antifungals alone, due to lack of hair shaft penetration. Since 38.8% of patients with TC were either prescribed topical treatment alone or not prescribed antifungals, there might be lack of knowledge about appropriate TC treatment, diagnostic uncertainty, and reluctance to prescribe systemic antifungals to children. The higher TC incidence among prepubescent and male children is consistent with previous studies.

Study limitations include lack of information on race/ethnicity and non-commercial insurance types. Further, administrative data are subject to potential disease misclassification and undercoding, which might particularly affect reporting of diagnostic tests with low reimbursement rates (eg, direct microscopy). While dermatologists' use of diagnostic testing for TC exceeded other specialties, our study highlights important opportunities across all specialties to increase testing and ensure effective treatment for children with TC.

### Tinea capitis among children and adolescents in the farwaniya region of Kuwait [^57b6e1c1]. The Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Analysis of 325 patients (182 males, 143 females) of mycologically proven tinea capitis (TC) seen over a period of two years from January 2001 — December 2002 in the Farwaniya region of Kuwait is presented in this study. The age range was 8 months to 17 years. Peak incidence was observed in the 3–14 year age group (79.6%). Positive family history and contact with pets were noted in 22% and 36.7% of the cases, respectively. The non-inflammatory 'gray patch' variety was the most common clinical type, seen in 163 (50.2%) children, followed by the black-dot variant in 100 (30.2%) patients. A significant proportion of the cases (16.6%) had the uncommonly reported seborrheic dermatitis or dandruff like pattern. Highly inflammatory kerion was encountered infrequently (2.5%). Seven species of dermatophytes were isolated; Trichophyton violaceum in 135 (41.5%), followed by Microsporum canis in 89 (27.4%), Microsporum audouinii in 48 (14.8%), Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. mentagrophytes in 31 (9.5%), Trichophyton verrucosum in 15 (4.6%), Trichophyton tonsurans in 6 (1.9%) and Microsporum gypseum in 1 (0.3%) patient. T. violaceum was the most common fungus responsible for the black-dot variety (89/100) and kerion (4/8) patients. Three cases of kerion (33.3%) grew T. verrucosum. M. canis was the most common species isolated from the 'gray patch' cases (79/163; 48.5%) followed by almost equal prevalences of T. violaceum (16.6%), M. audouinii (15.3%), and T. mentagrophytes var. mentagrophytes (12.3%). Among the seborrheic type of cases, M. audouinii was the most common fungus isolated in 20/54 (37%) followed by T. violaceum in 15 (27.8%), T. mentagrophytes var. mentagrophytes in 9 (16.7%), M. canis in 8 (14.8%) and T. verrucosum and T. tonsurans in one (0.3%) patient each. The results are significantly different from those in earlier studies in Kuwait.

### The role of ingrown hairs in persistent kerion of children: a clinical study [^c2cda335]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Tinea capitis, a dermatophytes infection affecting scalp and hair, is particularly prevalent among children, especially those who are preadolescent. In China, the average age of onset is about 4 years old, which is in line with previous literature indicating an onset range of 1 to 5 years old. The high incidence in children may be attributed to several factors: an immature skin barrier function, insufficient secretion of fatty acids that inhibit fungal growth, a strong curiosity, and a lack of hygiene awareness, all of which can lead to easier exposure to infection sources.

Clinically, tinea capitis could be categorized into different subtypes based on the causative fungal species and the patient's immune response. The genotypes of dermatophytes influence the activity levels of enzymes such as keratinase, collagenase, and elastase, potentially leading to varying degrees of infection severity. However, the precise correlation between the activity of these secretases and the severity of the infection has yet to be established.

It is widely accepted that animal‐derived pathogens, with M. canis being the most common, are more prone to induce severe inflammatory reactions such as kerion, characterized by inflammatory follicular papules and raised masses encrusted with pustules and thick scabs. Untreated kerion can result in permanent scarring alopecia. Although previous reports have documented cases of kerion that show poor responses to conventional systemic antifungal treatments, regardless of whether in children with normal or congenital immunodeficiency, the potential role of ingrown hairs as a causative factor has not been previously discussed. We searched the relevant databases using the terms "ingrown hairs" and "tinea capitis" or "kerion," finding no previous literature describing the condition. Although the infection species, affected range, and duration of disease varied among the six patients with persistent kerion in our study, poor response to standard oral antifungal drugs and the presence of ingrown hairs were consistent.

3 RESULTS

Among the 312 cases of tinea capitis in children, six cases were finally defined as persist kerion according to our standard. General information of each case is presented in Table 1. The detailed cases are below.

TABLE 1
General information of the 6 cases.

3.1 Patient 1

A 6‐year‐old girl presented with a 2‐month history of alopecia and swollen plaques on her scalp. She received no treatment before being diagnosed with kerion caused by Trichophyton mentagrophyte. Oral terbinafine 125 mg/day for 4 months and prednisone treatment for 14 days showed poor response. Physical examination revealed scarring alopecia and inflammatory swelling plaques with black linear structures on the scalp (Figure 1a). Dermatoscopic evaluation identified these structures as ingrown hairs, which were successfully removed under dermatoscopic guidance using sterile instruments, including a needle and tweezers (Figure 1b–d). Endothrix hair invasion was confirmed by fluorescent microscopy with calcofluor white staining (Figure 1e). Following the removal, oral terbinafine was continued for additional 2 weeks, which led to a response in the lesions and negative mycological results. This case was the only patient who received continued systemic antifungal medication during the removal of the ingrown hairs. Subsequent follow‐up revealed no signs of recurrence, and the patient made a full recovery.

### The role of ingrown hairs in persistent kerion of children: a clinical study [^a8bf1e67]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Tinea capitis, a common public health problem in developing countries, has severe forms such as kerion. However, the underlying mechanisms and standard treatments for persistent cases of tinea capitis or kerion remain controversial. In this work, we investigate the ingrown hairs and corresponding treatment in persistent kerion of children. Children with persistent kerion were enrolled among 312 cases of tinea capitis at the Department of Dermatology, Hangzhou Third People's Hospital from January 2020 to June 2024. The presence of fungal infection was ascertained by direct microscopic examination under calcofluor white staining and routine culture. The structure of the ingrown hairs was observed directly by a dermatoscope, which was subsequently extracted using sterile tools. A total of six cases of persistent kerion among 312 cases of tinea capitis were enrolled. Ingrown hairs were ascertained under dermatoscopy and extracted by minor operation. Except for one patient who continued oral terbinafine, the other five cases were cured by removal alone. Ingrown hairs, induced by fungal infection, may be an aggravating factor of persistent course of tinea capitis. Our study demonstrated that the presence of ingrown hairs could be confirmed through direct dermatoscopy, and patients experienced significant improvement following removal treatment under dermatoscopy.

### The changing face of microsporum spp infections [^2bb785b9]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Significant changes in epidemiology, etiology, and the clinical pattern of mycotic infections caused by Microsporum spp have been observed in recent years. Fungal infections caused by M canis, followed by M gypseum and M hominis, involving skin and its appendages, represent one of the most common diseases worldwide and a recalcitrant problem in dermatology that demands appropriate diagnostic and treatment strategies. The most striking clinical phenomena of superficial and kerion and other forms of tinea, such as tinea capitis, fungal infections of the glabrous skin (tinea pedis, manus, cruris et corporis), and even onychomycosis due to Microsporum spp are described, with emphasis on the changes that have occurred in the last decade. The data on significant differences in the prevalence and clinical pattern of the fungal skin infections caused by Microsporum spp today compared with the data at the beginning of the epidemic breakout might still be rather controversial, depending also on the patients' lifestyle and geography. In general, physicians should be aware of the clinical spectrum of mycotic infections due to Microsporum spp to avoid mistakes in identifying the fungal etiology and to provide patients with the proper therapy.

Results

The medical records of 76 children fulfilling the eligibility criteria were reviewed (Table 1). Out of 76 cases, 55 (72.4%) were boys and 21 (27.6%) were girls. The average age was 3.1 years (range 0–8 years). In total, 30 children (39.9%; 9 girls (30%) and 21 boys (70%)) had a family member infected with Tinea capitis. All children were born in Israel to parents who emigrated from Eritrea. The average time from the initial appearance of the lesion until contact with a dermatologist was 4.3 months (3 days - 24 month).

Out of 76 cases, 64 had a positive culture, 18 of which were collected from girls (28%) and 46 from boys (72%). The remaining 12 cultures were contaminated. In parallel, 65 cases had a positive direct examination, 8 of which showed negative cultures (Table 1). Thus, 57 cases had both a positive culture and direct examination, while 72 patients have at least one positive test (Fig. 1).

### A case report of tinea capitis in infant in first year of life [^9740dc51]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Tinea capitis is a cutaneous fungal infection common among 3 to 7 year old children but it is rare in the first year of life.

Case presentation

We present a case of a 12-month-old infant with erythematous scalp lesions combined with hair loss. He was suspected of dermatophytosis and mycological analysis of all suspected lesions was performed. Clinical features and culture results confirmed tinea capitis caused by Microsporum canis. The infant patient was treated with griseofulvin for 2 months. However, 15 days later at the end of treatment he presented with a single vesicle positive for M. canis. Griseofulvin therapy continued for another month. After 3 months of follow-up, no recurrence was observed.

Conclusions

In infant, sometimes tinea capitis is misdiagnosed and underreported because it is similar to other scalp pathologies. Therefore, if erythematous scalp lesions are present, they must be examined from a mycological point of view to inform the differential diagnosis. Once diagnosed, treatment of tinea capitis can pose a dilemma because different factors may influence the choice between equally effective therapies (i.e. safety, age, formulation, cost). This case report suggests that it is important to establish an accurate diagnosis and treatment for this dermatophytosis to avoid recurrences or therapeutic failures, especially in infants.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Tinea capitis: a single-institution retrospective review from 2010 to 2015 [^ce9ccac6]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background/Objective

Tinea capitis is a common infection of scalp hair in children. The prevalent etiologic organism has changed significantly over time, which may reflect the complex interaction of environmental factors, genetic predisposition, and movement of populations. We evaluate the prevalence of different infectious organisms causing tinea capitis and describe the clinical characteristics.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with tinea capitis with tissue culture confirmation, who were seen in pediatric dermatology at a tertiary care center from 2010 to 2015. Patient demographics, culture data, and clinical characteristics were evaluated. Inflammatory pattern, characterized by presence of pustules, bogginess, or lymphadenopathy, was noted.

Results

Forty-six patients with culture-positive tinea capitis were identified. In the 18 (42.9%) patients who were infected with either Trichophyton violaceum or Trichophyton soudanenese, all were of African ethnicity. In contrast, Trichophyton tonsurans was identified in a minority of African patients (3.8%), revealing a statistically significant difference between ethnicity and infective species (P-value < 0.001). T tonsurans was significantly more likely than T violaceum to exhibit an inflammatory pattern (68% vs 22%, P value < 0.027).

Conclusions

While T tonsurans remained the most common cause of tinea capitis, T violaceum and T soudanense have increased in prevalence. As these latter agents are less inflammatory, clinical diagnosis may be delayed. Studying changes in the infectious cause of tinea capitis can help us create a snapshot to better understand the evolution of our population make-up, allowing us to provide crucial quality health care to all.

For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Dermatophytid in tinea capitis: rarely reported common phenomenon with clinical implications [^b48ef3ab]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis may be associated with a dermatophytid, which appears as a disseminated eczematous eruption. This phenomenon may occur before or after initiation of systemic antifungal drug therapy and is not an indication for stopping medication. We present here a series of cases that involve 5 children with tinea capitis who developed a dermatophytid before or during the course of their management. In each child, the eruption resolved despite continuation of oral antifungal therapy. Our experience suggests that dermatophytid secondary to tinea capitis is much more common than reported. Furthermore, parents and clinicians frequently mistake dermatophytid for drug allergy. Recognition of this phenomenon, distinction of dermatophytid from drug allergy, and continuation of systemic treatment is essential for clearing the infection and dermatophytid.

### Tinea capitis in infants in their first year of life [^0def7742]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Tinea capitis is the most common type of dermatophytosis in children, but is uncommon in the first year of life.

Objectives

To review clinical, mycological and epidemiological data in a series of 10 infants aged under 1 year diagnosed as having tinea capitis in three Spanish hospitals between 1998 and 2002.

Methods

A retrospective case note study.

Results

There were six boys and four girls with a mean of age 7 months (range 1.5–12). All the children were born in Spain, but in five cases the parents were immigrants from Africa. In these cases the isolated dermatophytes were two Trichophyton tonsurans, one T. verrucosum and two Microsporum audouinii. Four autochthonous cases were caused by M. canis and one by M. audouinii (but this one was in contact with African immigrants). In two of the five cases produced by anthropophilic dermatophytes other family members were infected by the same fungus. Most cases were treated successfully with griseofulvin.

Conclusions

Although tinea capitis is rare in infants in their first year of life, the condition should be investigated if scaling and/or alopecia are present. A thorough epidemiological study of other family members is mandatory.

### Superficial fungal infections [^b48ef769]. Pediatrics in Review (2012). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis, tinea corporis, and pityriasis versicolor are common superficial fungal infections in the pediatric population.
- Tinea capitis is the most common dermatophyte infection worldwide. In North America, the cause is almost exclusively T tonsurans. Diagnosis of tinea capitis usually can be made by clinical features alone, especially when occipital or postauricular lymphadenopathy is present. Skin scrapings prepared with potassium hydroxide for microscopic examination, or a cotton swab for fungal culture, usually are diagnostic.
- Treatment of tinea capitis requires systemic antifungal therapy. Terbinafine and griseofulvin are both effective against T tonsurans and are FDA-approved for this indication in children.
- Adjunctive topical therapy for the patient and household contacts decreases transmission of this infection.
- Topical antifungal therapy usually is effective for tinea corporis and pityriasis versicolor. However, recurrences of pityriasis versicolor are common.

### Racial disparities, risk factors, and clinical management practices for tinea capitis: an observational cohort study among US children with medicaid [^e6d3105e]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Among 24,536 patients diagnosed with TC, 13.3% received diagnostic testing, most commonly fungal culture (10.7%) and direct microscopy (5.1%) (Table II). Testing was similar by race/ethnicity (P = 0.12). Overall, 83.2% of patients were prescribed an antifungal drug, with 68.2% and 47.2% receiving oral and topical antifungals, respectively; 15.0% received topical therapy alone.

In this Medicaid-insured cohort, Black children had higher TC incidence than other groups, with incidence rates ~7 times higher than White children, substantiating previously documented disparities. This association persisted after adjusting for TC risk factors. Focused community or school-based interventions might help address racial disparities in TC burden.

Rates of confirmatory diagnostic testing among Medicaid-insured children were lower than those found in a previous study that included commercially insured children (13.3% vs 21.9%), reflecting differential care potentially associated with limited time and resources for testing or limited access to dermatologists. Lack of confirmatory laboratory testing could lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate antifungal prescriptions, which is concerning given recent reports of antifungal drug-resistant dermatophytosis. More than 30% of patients with TC did not receive systemic antifungal treatment, which is needed for effective treatment.

This study relied on administrative data, which is subject to incomplete case ascertainment, undercoding, and disease misclassification. The database also lacked information on socioeconomic status, housing, geography, income, and other environmental factors, limiting our ability to assess underlying causes of racial disparities in TC incidence. Additional studies are needed to investigate these factors and guide targeted public health interventions to address TC disparities.

Overall, this study demonstrates high overall TC incidence and racial disparities among children with Medicaid, highlighting a need for tailored public health efforts and opportunities for improving clinical management.

### Tinea capitis in an immigrant pediatric community; a clinical signs-based treatment approach [^e53ff278]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The most common clinical finding in children with either positive culture or positive direct examination was scaling, observed in 91 and 97% of cases, respectively, aligning with a previously published report. However, in contrast to this earlier report, that dealt with urban hospital-based general pediatric practice, in the present study, the majority of children with a positive culture or positive direct exam had one positive sign, which was scales (53 and 48%, respectively). Moreover, the previous work found a high association between lymphadenopathy and positive Tinea capitis cultures, which stands in contrast with our results, where only 4.7% of the children with a positive culture and 7.7% of those with positive signs on direct examination, presented with lymphadenopathy. A different immune response to the same infection may underlie these conflicting observations, and may require an entirely different therapeutic approach.

In the current study population, many parents who visited a dermatologist with their infected child discontinued follow up at various stages, some after only one visit, likely due to long queues, distant clinics, loss of workdays and more. Some of the parents returned to the dermatologist only because the child was not allowed to return to the daycare center or due to development of infection and fever. Thus, treatment should be given to ensure suitable and efficient management from the initial and possibly only encounter with the patient.

In previously reported cases of Tinea capitis, insufficient response in skin of color populations was not solely due to lack of compliance, but rather, to a reduced clinical response of the fungi to the conventional griseofulvin doses. As a result, over the past few decades, dosage elevations have been tested and have effectively achieved clearance. This might be due to suboptimal absorption of the drugs, different host response patterns to the same fungi or evolution of resistance to the drugs.

### Diagnosis and management of tinea infections [^5de2211d]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Tinea infections (often called ringworm) are caused by dermatophyte fungi and classified by the body site involved. Tinea corporis and tinea capitis are most common in prepubertal children, and tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea unguium (most common type of onychomycosis) are more likely in adolescents and adults. Clinical diagnosis without testing may be unreliable because other conditions can resemble tinea infections (eg, tinea corporis can be confused with eczema, and onychomycosis with dystrophic toenails from repeated low-level trauma or psoriasis). Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea pedis generally respond to inexpensive topical antifungal agents, but oral antifungal agents may be indicated for patients with extensive disease, lack of response to topical treatment, immunocompromise, or hair follicle involvement (eg, tinea capitis). Oral terbinafine is considered first-line therapy for tinea capitis and onychomycosis because it is well tolerated, effective, and inexpensive. Emerging tinea infections may be more severe than classic tinea infections and generally do not improve with first-line topical or oral antifungals. These infections may require prolonged oral antifungal therapy and specialized diagnostic testing. Antifungal stewardship, including avoiding the use of combination antifungal-corticosteroids, should be emphasized to optimize outcomes and help prevent resistance.

### Trichophyton rubrum tinea capitis in a young child [^572596f5]. Pediatric Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

While the primary etiologic agent of tinea capitis in the United States has varied over the past century, the last several decades have been marked by a predominance of infection with Trichophyton tonsurans. Related anthropophilic organisms commonly isolated in other dermatophytoses are infrequently observed in tinea capitis. We report the unusual occurrence of tinea capitis in a young boy infected with Trichophyton rubrum.

### Tinea capitis in adult women masquerading as bacterial pyoderma [^6fc32c3f]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis is generally thought to be a common disease in children but not in adults. Adults with tinea capitis generally present with scale and alopecia. We report 3 adults with inflammatory tinea capitis caused by Trichophyton tonsurans that resembled a bacterial infection. Of these patients, 2 were initially given a diagnosis of bacterial pyoderma. All patients were successfully treated with oral antifungal agents. One patient had significant eosinophilia that resolved with treatment. We conclude that tinea capitis should remain in the differential diagnosis of adults with alopecia and pyoderma-like presentations. A biopsy specimen was helpful in making the diagnosis in 2 of the 3 patients, but fungal culture confirmed the diagnosis in all cases.

### Aetiology of tinea capitis in China: a multicentre prospective study [^ac7ff60f]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tinea capitis is still common in developing countries, such as China. Its pathogen spectrum varies across regions and changes over time.

Objectives

This study aimed to clarify the current epidemiological characteristics and pathogen spectrum of tinea capitis in China.

Methods

A multicentre, prospective descriptive study involving 29 tertiary hospitals in China was conducted. From August 2019 to July 2020, 611 patients with tinea capitis were enrolled. Data concerning demography, risk factors and fungal tests were collected. When necessary, the pathogens were further identified by morphology or molecular sequencing in the central laboratory.

Results

Among all enrolled patients, 74·1% of the cases were in patients aged 2-8years. The children with tinea capitis were mainly boys (56·2%) and were more likely than adults to have a history of animal contact (57·4% vs. 35·3%, P = 0·012) and zoophilic dermatophyte infection (73·5% vs. 47%). The adults were mainly female (83%) and were more likely than children to have anthropophilic agent infection (53% vs. 23·9%). The most common pathogen was zoophilic Microsporum canis (354, 65·2%), followed by anthropophilic Trichophyton violaceum (74, 13·6%). In contrast to the eastern, western and northeastern regions, where zoophilic M. canis predominated, anthropophilic T. violaceum predominated in central China (69%, P < 0·001), where the patients had the most tinea at other sites (20%) and dermatophytosis contact (26%) but the least animal contact (39%). Microsporum ferrugineum was the most common anthropophilic agent in the western area, especially in Xinjiang province.

Conclusions

Boys aged approximately 5years were the most commonly affected group. Dermatologists are advised to pay more attention to the different transmission routes and pathogen spectra in different age groups from different regions.

### Tinea capitis and its associated factors among school children in gondar town northwest, Ethiopia [^f8b8d35f]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Data processing and analysis

Data was cleaned, coded and entered using EPI info version 7.22 and exported to SPSS version 22 statistical packages for further statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics was used to describe the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents, by using texts, tables and graphs. Binary logistic regression analysis was applied to identify factors associated with Tinea capitis. Bivariable analysis was done and P value less than 0.2 was included in the multiple logistic regression analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to identify factors associated with Tinea capitis by controlling the effect of potential confounding variables. The Hosmer and Lemeshow test were used to diagnose the model adequacy. Finally, variables which had independent association with Tinea capitis was identified on the basis of Adjusted Odds Ratio and p-value with its corresponding 95% CI. Variables having a p-value less than 0.05 was claimed as statistically significant.

Ethical consideration

Ethical clearance was obtained from College of Medicine and Health Sciences, School of Nursing on the behalf of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of University of Gondar. Then, a permission letter written from the Gondar education office to the selected schools. Informed consent obtained from all the participants parents/guardians. After informing them all the purpose, benefit, risk, the confidentiality of the information and the voluntary nature of the participation in the study. Then assent was obtained from the children. So, participation was after obtaining both informed consent and assent. Participation was on a voluntary basis and confidentiality was maintained to encourage accurate and honest self-disclosure.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics," crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one," and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

There was no overall difference in coder efficiency in the 1-year periods before and after ICD-10 implementation (P = 0.76). However, we noted a reduction in coder efficiency during the first 4 months (October 2015 to January 2016) after ICD-10 conversion, which returned to baseline for the remaining 8 months (Figure 2).

### Trends in tinea capitis in an Irish pediatric population and a comparison of scalp brushings versus scalp scrapings as methods of investigation [^cc121bb5]. Pediatric Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

A retrospective study of 391 children with suspected tinea capitis was analyzed to examine the prevalence of dermatophyte species and to compare the efficacy of the scalp scraping method with that of the hairbrush method for diagnoses over a 6-year period. Trichophyton tonsurans tinea capitis is the most common pathogen. The hairbrush method of obtaining specimens for fungal culture was superior to scalp scrapings (p = 0.03) in making the diagnosis, and using two methods (p < 0.001) increased the yield of identifying a dermatophyte infection.

Distribution of skin diseases in Sumba, Indonesia. (A and B) Tornado plots showing the distribution of prevalent skin diseases (A) and neglected tropical skin diseases (B) among adults and children (< 18 years old) diagnosed through teledermatology in Sumba, Indonesia. In plot (A), the total number of patients with skin infections and infestations is shown, as well as the subdivision into bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic infections. ICD-11 = WHO International Classification of Diseases version 11.

Most of the dermatoses identified were common skin diseases such as impetigo, tinea corporis, atopic dermatitis, neurodermatitis, and others. Less common diseases diagnosed included lichen nitidus, porokeratosis, metastasized acral lentiginous melanoma, ichthyosis, and a patient suspected of LEOPARD syndrome. Bacterial superinfections were seen in 35 of 273 patients (12.8%), excluding primary diagnosis with impetigo, ecthyma, abscess, vitiligo, lentigines, and hyperpigmentation. Fifty-three patients (17.3%) were affected by a neglected tropical skin disease (skin-NTD), including leprosy (23, 7.5%), scabies (9, 2.9%), pediculosis capitis (9, 2.9%), chromoblastomycosis, histopathology confirmed (4, 1.3%), tinea imbricata (4, 1.3%), pediculosis corporis (1, 0.3%), filariasis (1, 0.3%), and a snake bite (1, 0.3%). One child with skin ulcers was clinically suspected of having yaws.

### A case report of tinea capitis in infant in first year of life [^4853eeac]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Tinea capitis (TC) is a fungal infection of the scalp and the surrounding skin due to dermatophytes such as Microsporum spp. and Trichophyton spp. It is a predominantly dermatophyte infection in children 3 to 7 years old and it is rare in infants in the first year of life. We report a case of an infant with TC admitted to the Medical Science Department, University of Turin (Italy).

Case presentation

A.M. a 12-month-old male infant, Caucasian, Italian, in good general health, with no history of recent fever or any other symptoms. The patient was evaluated for erythematous scalp lesions and annular patches combined with hair loss (Fig. 1). The infant had not been in contact with animals; her mother and other family members were asymptomatic. No other systemic symptoms were elicited. He was suspected to have a dermatophytosis.

Fig. 1
A 12 month-old male infant presented a history of erythematous scalp lesions combined with hair loss

The Wood's light examination revealed a brilliant green fluorescence on the scalp lesions. Mycological analysis of all suspected dermatophyte lesions was performed. Hair and scale samples were collected and examined under a light microscope with 20% v /v KOH + 40% v/v DMSO solution in distilled water. A fungal culture was performed into Mycobiotic agar (Merck, KGAA, Germany) to identify dermatophytes. Plates were incubated at 25 °C and examined every 2–3 days for at last 15 days. Mold identification was based on macroscopic and microscopic assessment of colonies. Macroscopic examination revealed some white fluffy spreading colonies (Fig. 2), and a characteristic deep yellow-orange pigment on the reverse. Spindle shaped multicellular macroconidia with thick cell walls were detected on microscopic examination (Fig. 3). Clinical features and culture results reveled TC caused by Microsporum canis.
