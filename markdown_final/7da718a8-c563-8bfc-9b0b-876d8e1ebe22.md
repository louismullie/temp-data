## Question

H3. The diagram shows a regular dodecagon and a square, whose vertices are also vertices of the dodecagon.
What is the value of the ratio area of the square: area of the dodecagon?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ratio of the area of a square to the area of a regular dodecagon, where the square's vertices are also vertices of the dodecagon. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometric setup and how the square is oriented within the dodecagon. Then, I should verify the central angles and side lengths using trigonometry. Next, I will calculate the areas of the square and the dodecagon in terms of a common parameter, like the circumradius. After that, I will form the ratio and simplify it. Finally, I should double-check the result and consider whether an alternative orientation of the square could change the answer.

> Let me first confirm the setup. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices equally spaced on a circle, so the central angle between adjacent vertices is 360° divided by 12, which is 30°. If the square's vertices are also vertices of the dodecagon, then the square must connect every third vertex, because 4 vertices spaced by 3 steps of 30° give 90° separations, which is correct for a square inscribed in a circle [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the side length of the square. If the dodecagon is inscribed in a circle of radius R, then two adjacent vertices of the dodecagon are separated by a chord of length 2R sin(15°), since the central angle is 30° and the chord length is 2R sin(θ/2). For the square, the vertices are separated by 90° at the center, so the side length is 2R sin(45°), which equals 2R (√2/2) = R√2. Hold on, I should double-check that: yes, sin(45°) is √2/2, so the square's side is indeed R√2 [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the area of the square. The area of a square with side s is s², so substituting s = R√2 gives Area_square = (R√2)² = 2R². That looks correct, but I will keep the R in mind to ensure consistency when I compute the dodecagon's area [^notfound].

> I will now examine the area of the regular dodecagon. A regular n-gon can be divided into n congruent isosceles triangles, each with vertex angle 2π/n and two sides of length R. The area of one such triangle is (1/2) R² sin(2π/n), so the total area is (n/2) R² sin(2π/n). For n = 12, that becomes (12/2) R² sin(30°) = 6R² (1/2) = 3R². Let me verify: sin(30°) is indeed 1/2, so the dodecagon's area is 3R² [^notfound].

> Now, I should form the ratio and simplify. The ratio of the square's area to the dodecagon's area is 2R² divided by 3R², which equals 2/3. I need to ensure the R² cancels cleanly, which it does, leaving a simple rational ratio of 2:3 [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the square were oriented differently, for example, with sides not aligned to every third vertex? Let me consider that. Any square inscribed in a circle must have its vertices equally spaced by 90° at the center, so in a 12-gon the only way to place four vertices with 90° separations is to skip two vertices between each chosen vertex, i.e., every third vertex. Thus, the orientation is unique up to rotation, and the side length and areas remain the same, so the ratio is unchanged. I should confirm that this uniqueness holds, and yes, it does given the symmetry of the dodecagon and the requirement of 90° central separations for the square [^notfound].

> Final answer: The ratio of the area of the square to the area of the regular dodecagon is 2/3 [^notfound].

---

The ratio of the area of the square to the area of the regular dodecagon is **2:3**. This is because the square connects every third vertex of the dodecagon, forming a square with side length (s = R\\sqrt{2}) (where (R) is the circumradius), so its area is (2R^2). The dodecagon's area is (3R^2), so the ratio is (\\frac{2R^2}{3R^2} = \\frac{2}{3}).

---

## Geometric setup

- **Regular dodecagon**: A 12-sided polygon with all sides and angles equal, inscribed in a circle of radius (R).
- **Square**: Vertices are also vertices of the dodecagon, connecting every third vertex (i.e. vertices 1, 4, 7, 10).

---

## Area of the square

The square's vertices are separated by **90°** at the center, so its side length is the chord subtending 90°:

[
s = 2R \\sin\\left(\\frac{90^\\circ}{2}\\right) = 2R \\sin(45^\\circ) = 2R \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = R\\sqrt{2}
]

Thus, the area of the square is:

[
A_{\\text{square}} = s^2 = (R\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2R^2
]

---

## Area of the regular dodecagon

A regular dodecagon can be divided into 12 congruent isosceles triangles, each with a vertex angle of **30°** and two sides of length (R). The area of one triangle is:

[
A_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{1}{2} R^2 \\sin(30^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2} R^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} R^2
]

Therefore, the total area of the dodecagon is:

[
A_{\\text{dodecagon}} = 12 \\cdot A_{\\text{triangle}} = 12 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} R^2 = 3R^2
]

---

## Ratio of areas

The ratio of the area of the square to the area of the dodecagon is:

[
\\frac{A_{\\text{square}}}{A_{\\text{dodecagon}}} = \\frac{2R^2}{3R^2} = \\frac{2}{3}
]

---

The ratio of the area of the square to the area of the regular dodecagon is **2:3**.

### A general patterning approach by manipulating the evolution of two-dimensional liquid foams [^0eb6b8b3]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

To explain this, we calculated the radius of curvature for these bubbles varying with the increase of volume (the area for a 2D bubble), as shown in Supplementary Note 1; Fig. 3e. When bubbles grow in these three kinds of cells, as the area increases, changes in the radius of curvature are similar. They all gradually reach a maximum and then sharply shift back to a minimum of a /2 before slowly increasing (Fig. 3e). The difference in the maximum means that the dodecagonal cell allows the growing bubble a larger maximum circle size than the square or hexagonal cell does. When a bubble in a square or hexagonal cell reaches the maximum circle size and starts to deform (indicated by the red and blue arrows in Fig. 3e), the bubble in the dodecagonal cell can grow continuously. In addition, since the bubbles distribute uniformly, more gas will be present in the dodecagonal cells at the initial state of the evolution than that in square or hexagonal cells. The bubbles in dodecagonal cells have not reached the maximum circle size at the initial state since the total gas is not sufficient. With the evolution, bubbles in dodecagonal cells have larger circle sizes (larger radius of curvature) than that in square or hexagonal cells, which causes an unbalanced pressure between the dodecagonal cells and the square or hexagonal cells. Therefore, bubbles in dodecagonal cells will adsorb the surrounding bubbles until filling the dodecagonal cells. When volume fraction of gas is sufficient (> 57%), bubbles in the hexagonal cells can survive because the consumption of the bubbles in square cells has filled the dodecagonal cells. Bubbles in hexagonal cells also consume the bubbles in square cells until filling the hexagonal cells. The explanation above can be applied to any other polygonal cells, and a detailed discussion of this is provided in Supplementary Note 3.

### Chemical engineering of quasicrystal approximants in lanthanide-based coordination solids [^ff8d856a]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

A quasicrystalline tiling consisting solely of squares and triangles has an optimal square-to-triangle ratio of √3/4 ≈ 0.43. Hence, to approach a dodecagonal quasicrystalline tiling with the 3 3.4 2 tessellation structure at hand, triangle-rich motifs need to be introduced into the tiling. The lanthanide ions here stand out as ideal materials modules due to their exceptional structural versatility that is inimitable amongst the inner and outer transition metal elements of the periodic table. This allows their accommodation into the in-plane tetra-, penta-, and hexa-coordinated nodes that coexist in dodecagonal quasicrystals. It is here particularly important that the strategy is not reserved for divalent lanthanide ions. Indeed, several molecular complexes of the trivalent lanthanide ions possess an approximate D 5h (e.g. [LnI 2 (THF) 5] + – and [LuI 2 (pyridine) 5] +,) coordination environment necessary for their incorporation into such materials. Notably, contrasting the intermetallics, the typical optical transparency of lanthanide-based coordination solids provides for exploitation of optical properties of complex tilings. For instance, ATs offer the potential of photonic band gap opening, which in conjunction with the unique luminescence characteristics of the lanthanide ions, lays the foundation for materials with novel optical properties. In addition, the field of molecular magnetism has recently seen a blossoming of approximate C 5 symmetric single-ion magnets with exceedingly high magnetization reversal barriers –. Linking of single-ion magnets or lanthanide-based qubitsinto ATs and quasicrystals to yield spin-frustrated arrays would be an attractive extension of this work. This approach also comprises controlling metal–ligand redox events with the aim of introducing electronic conductivity and increasing the strength of inter-ion magnetic interactions in ATs and derived network structures as has been developed for regular tessellations with lighter first-row transition element analogs.

### Plasma membrane remodeling determines adipocyte expansion and mechanical adaptability [^a60bafb5]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Quantification of caveolar contribution to adipocyte volumetric oscillations

Caveolar flattening provides additional membrane surfaceand could thereby enable adipocyte expansion by readily increasing cellular volume. To estimate this effect, we considered the adipocyte with the largest median PM-LD distance in our dataset (1.78 microns), which had 9.13 caveolae per micron of PM perimeter. This corresponds to 83.36 caveolae per square μm of PM surface. Assuming a spherical morphology for caveolae and a typical value of 80 nm in diameter, the surface area for individual caveolae would correspond to 4·π·0.040 2 = 0.02 μm 2, and total caveolar area would be 0.02·83.36 = 1.67 μm 2 per μm 2 of PM. Thus, the fraction of caveolar membrane content per unit would be 1.67/ (1.67+1) = 0.63, meaning that caveolae comprise up to 63% of total adipocyte membrane surface area. Based on our analysis of caveolae disappearance as the LD grows (Fig. 1) and previous reports, about 90% of caveolae could completely flatten out. This magnitude of caveolae flattening would result in a final 1+0.9·1.67 = 2.50 μm 2 per initial μm 2 of PM, and thereby account for a 2.50x increase in cell surface, which would correspond to aincrease in adipocyte volume.

Calculation of area coverage percentage by circles in hexagonal packing arrangement

The maximum area covered by circles of radiusis achieved when they are arranged in a hexagonal lattice. Therefore, by computing the area of a hexagon (that tessellate the whole 2D space), and the area of the inscribed circle (Supplementary Fig. 2m), we can obtain the maximum fraction of area covered by circles as the ratio between both areas.

A hexagon would be composed by 12 triangles as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2m. From simple trigonometry calculations, we obtain the radius of the hexagon (L):

The base of the triangle would equal:

Lleading to a triangle area, A t:

The hexagon area (A h) will thus result:

The area of the inscribed circle is:

With this we obtain the fraction of hexagon covered by a circle:

Thus, packing of perfect circles would cover at most approximately 90.7% of the area.

The special arrangement of pillars contributes the gathering effect

We then changed the arrangement of pillars. The pillars on the micropatterned surface were arranged into three kinds of cells, regular dodecagonal, hexagonal and square cells (Fig. 3a–d) with equal pillar intervals. We found that this designed substrate evolved the 2D foams into discrete dodecagonal bubble arrays when the gas volume fraction was < 57% (Supplementary Movie 2). Bubbles were produced in all cells at first, while bubbles in the dodecagonal cells adsorbed all the bubbles in the square and hexagonal cells during the evolution. Figuratively speaking, bubbles in the dodecagonal cells have the gathering effect collecting surrounding bubbles. Interestingly, bubbles could fill both dodecagonal and hexagonal cells by increasing the gas volume fraction. Only the bubbles in the square cells were consumed (Supplementary Fig. 6).

### Nested helicoids in biological microstructures [^990a15f7]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Laminate elastic properties and isotropy

The BLU effective elastic properties are calculated from the laminate stiffness matrix (see description in Supplementary Note 6). The calculation uses the average laminate stresses, where the overall height of the BLU due to tilting, H = h + 2(w−t), is used rather than the net height without the contribution of tilting, h = nt. The laminate has a total of 9 engineering constants: three elastic moduli, two Poisson's ratios, and four shear coupling coefficients. In addition, the three effective flexural stiffnesses (moment / curvature), two bending and one torsional, are calculated.

Estimated material properties and calculated fiber, lamina and laminate elastic constants are summarized in Table 1. It should be kept in mind that these are just ballpark figures, as the components data is scarce and dependent on conditions. However, as our goal is the understanding of the underlying features and benefits of the BLU conformation, the exact material properties are not critical. The BLU composite is a hierarchical structure consisting of four assembly levels: (1) α-chitin chains packed in ~5 nm chitin-protein fibrils; (2) fibrils collected into 50–100 nm chitin-protein fibers; (3) fibers embedded in protein and compactly packed in laminae; and (4) plied laminae assembled in the BLU. In Table 1, we use the subscripts c and p to denote the α-chitin chains and the protein, respectively, the subscript f to denote the chitin-protein fibers, the subscripts 1,2 to denote the lamina, and the subscripts x, y, s to denote the laminate (BLU). The three higher hierarchical levels (2–4) – fiber, lamina and laminate – are represented in Table 1, including their respective volume fractions: V c chitin in a fiber, V f fibers in a lamina, and V 1 laminae in the laminate. Assuming square arrangement in a lamina, V f = π /4, the ratio between the fiber cross-sectional area and the square inscribing it. The calculated value of V 1 accounts for the gaps between laminae due to tilt, and is the ratio between the cross-sectional areas lamina/(lamina+gap), or (1− wδ ϕ /2 t) −1.

### Quantitative morphological variation in the developingWing [^3ed6547e]. G3 (2018). Low credibility.

Scalar measures

The standardized distances between the 28 possible pairwise combinations of the 8 landmarks were obtained from the Cartesian coordinates of the landmarks standardized by the centroid size. Centroid size is proportional to the square root of wing area. In addition, we measured the standardized lengths for a portion of the anterior margin using landmarks 1–3 and semi-landmarks 9–14, and for a portion of the posterior margin using landmarks 5–7 and semi-landmarks 15–17 (Figure S1).

Three areas were calculated using the surveyor's formula for calculating areas of polygons. The first area was obtained by calculating the area of the regular polygon within the landmarks 1–4 and semi-landmarks 9–14, thus obtaining a proxy of the anterior wing area ('Anterior'). The second areas is for the polygon defined by the landmarks 3–6 which contains the region within the longitudinal veins L3 and L4 ('Middle'). The third area is the one of the regular polygon defined by landmarks 5–8 and semi-landmarks 15–17, and gives a proxy of the posterior wing area ('Posterior') (Figure S1).

Standardized lengths and areas were compared between developmental stages and between genotypes by calculating means ratios. Values of variance for these ratios were obtained by bootstrapping the data. For example, change in the standardized length between landmarks 2 and 8 (stlen28) during the larval to pupal transition in the yw genotype was calculated with the following procedure: individual values for stlen28 in the yw pupal wings population were re-sampled with replacement a number of times equal to the number of individuals in the population. The mean on the re-sampled data were calculated and divided by the mean obtained by the same approach on the yw larval wing population. This procedure was repeated 1000 times providing thus a distribution of values for the ratio of stlen28 (pupa) / stlen28(larva) of the yw genotype. Scalar measures were computed and plotted using R version 3.3.0.

### Interface-driven formation of a two-dimensional dodecagonal fullerene quasicrystal [^fd366b8d]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Since their discovery, quasicrystals have attracted continuous research interest due to their unique structural and physical properties. Recently, it was demonstrated that dodecagonal quasicrystals could be used as bandgap materials in next-generation photonic devices. However, a full understanding of the formation mechanism of quasicrystals is necessary to control their physical properties. Here we report the formation of a two-dimensional dodecagonal fullerene quasicrystal on a Pt 3 Ti(111) surface, which can be described in terms of a square–triangle tiling. Employing density functional theory calculations, we identify the complex adsorption energy landscape of the Pt-terminated Pt 3 Ti surface that is responsible for the quasicrystal formation. We demonstrate the presence of quasicrystal-specific phason strain, which provides the degree of freedom required to accommodate the quasicrystalline structure on the periodic substrate. Our results reveal detailed insight into an interface-driven formation mechanism and open the way to the creation of tailored fullerene quasicrystals with specific physical properties.

### Interface-driven formation of a two-dimensional dodecagonal fullerene quasicrystal [^f66faa56]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Here we presented the formation of a nanoscale 2D fullerene monolayer, which does not show long-range periodicity, and the LEED pattern of which displays 12-fold rotational symmetry. The fullerene monolayer can thus be interpreted as a 2D dodecagonal QC, which is composed of an organic molecule adsorbed on a periodic metallic surface. As such, it does not belong to any previously known class of dodecagonal QCs. Our investigations, on the other hand, demonstrate that even though the structure of the fullerene monolayer fulfils the formal conditions defining a quasicrystal, it challenges the understanding of quasicrystallinity for structures on small length scales, particularly if these are imperfect and/or contain phason strain.

In conclusion, we report the formation of a nanoscale dodecagonal QC with a triangle/square tiling by the self-assembly of fullerenes on a 2Pt–Pt 3 Ti(111) surface. Most interestingly, the driving force for the 2D QC structure is a substrate-related adsorption energy landscape. By employing DFT calculations, we have identified the preferred adsorption sites of the fullerenes, which are determined critically by Ti atoms located in the third layer of the 2Pt–Pt 3 Ti surface. These Ti atoms induce a complex adsorption energy landscape, which results, for example, in three distinct bridge positions that are experienced by the fullerenes. In addition, we demonstrate the presence of QC-specific phason strain, which provides the degree of freedom that is required to accommodate the quasicrystalline structure on the periodic substrate. This concept, which results in the ability to generate QCs by tuning an adsorption energy landscape by the introduction of suitable atoms in subsurface layers of a periodic substrate, can be applied to other organic molecules, such as endo-fullerenes and functionalized fullerenes. Our results have significant implications for the directed synthesis of a wide variety of quasicrystalline structures, whose physical properties are tunable by the choice of substrate or adsorbed molecules.

### Egocentric neural representation of geometric vertex in the retrosplenial cortex [^7ca483c8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Behavior and chamber design

Prior to in vivo Ca 2+ imaging during free exploration, mice were adapted to the head-mounted miniaturized microscope connected to the commutator systems (Inscopix, USA) for at least five days. All experiments were performed under the luminescence of 30 Lux unless it is mentioned otherwise.

In Figs. 1, 2, each mouse was allowed to freely explore four different shapes of open chambers with different geometry: circular open chamber (radius: 25 cm, height: 30 cm), a regular triangle open chamber (edge: 43.3 cm, height: 30 cm), a square open chamber (edge: 35.3 cm, height: 30 cm), and a regular hexagon open chamber (edge: 25 cm, height: 30 cm). The dimensions of regular polygon-shaped open chambers were designed to be inscribed into a circular open chamber of 25 cm-radius to keep the center-to-vertex distance in each regular polygon-shaped open chamber constant (25 cm). In Fig. 3, the square open chamber (edge: 40 cm, height: 30 cm) was inverted to create an arena with no physical boundaries.

Neural representation of geometric vertex in the granular RSC

First, we investigated whether the neural representation of geometric vertices exists in the RSC. To do so, we injected AAV-CaMKII-GCaMP6s into the granular layers of RSC and recorded Ca 2+ signals from a total of 740 GCaMP6s-expressing excitatory neurons using a miniaturized microscope in nine mice (Fig. 1a, b). From the ΔF/F o Ca 2+ signals acquired from the granular RSC neurons, we extracted deconvoluted spikes (Fig. 1b) to plot neural activities while mice freely explored open chambers of different environmental geometries. We used a circular open chamber (radius of 25 cm) and three different shapes of regular polygon open chambers that had distinct numbers of vertices. The dimensions of regular polygon-shaped open chambers were chosen so that they can be inscribed into the circular open chamber, so as to keep the center-to-vertex distance constant (25 cm) (Fig. 1c). In a circular open chamber, the granular RSC neuronal spikes tessellated along the entire circumference (Fig. 1c, d), which is similar to RSC neuronal responses previously reported in rats. However, in regular polygon-shaped open chambers, subpopulations of granular RSC neurons spiked exclusively near the vertices (Fig. 1c, d, Supplementary Movie 1). When the regular polygon-shaped open chambers were morphed from a square to a 24-gon using 8 cm-wide walls while keeping the total perimeter constant across chambers, vertex-selective spiking was still observed in the square, hexagon, and octagon open chambers, but vertex-selective spiking diminished in the 12-gon and 24-gons (Supplementary Fig. 1), indicating there may be a spatial resolution (edge length > 16 cm) required in detecting vertices of the environmental geometry. The spatial patterns of vertex-selective RSC neuronal receptive fields (Fig. 1c, d) were different from grid cells, as all RSC neurons had low grid scoresin a square chamber (Supplementary Fig. 2). Additionally, they were distinctively different from boundary vector cellsor border cellsas subpopulations of RSC neurons fired exclusively near the vertex located farthest away from the center, as shown in the population responses of RSC neurons as a function of distance from vertex (Fig. 1e) and at either end of the edge (Fig. 1f). To quantitatively analyze the vertex-selective neuronal characteristics, we defined the vertex score. The vertex score was calculated by taking the distance from the spatial bin with the maximum spike firing rate within the spatial receptive field to the nearest vertex, which was then normalized by the largest possible distance to the vertex in a given chamber. The resulting vertex scores ranged from 0 to 1, where 0 indicated that the spatial receptive fields were located farthest away from all vertices, and 1 indicated that the spatial receptive fields were located exclusively at any of the vertices. A given RSC neuron was defined as a vertex cell within each chamber if the vertex score exceeded the 95 th percentile of the probability distribution of randomly shuffled vertex scores in any of the regular polygon-shaped open chambers (Fig. 1g), and if it showed stable spatial receptive fields during the entire 30-min recording sessions. Based on vertex score analysis, in each chamber, 32%, 32%, and 33% of RSC neurons (234, 234, and 247 out of 740 neurons) were vertex cells in triangle, square, and hexagon chambers, respectively (Fig. 1g) (Supplementary Fig. 3), while 9% of RSC neurons (66 out of 740 neurons) sustained vertex cell responses in all three different open chambers (Fig. 1h, left). Overall, across the three open chambers, granular RSC neurons that are defined as vertex cells in any one of the chambers were 60% (443 out of 740 neurons), with similar ratio of vertex cells observed in each animal (Fig. 1h, right). Among the imaged granular RSC neuronal populations, a high proportion of granular RSC neurons were vertex cells that spiked exclusively near the vertices while being inhibited at the center of the open chamber as well as the edge (Fig. 1i). However, subpopulations of non-vertex cells in the granular RSC were found to be border cells (27%, 200 out of 740 neurons, Supplementary Fig. 4a–c) while subpopulations of vertex cells showed conjunctive responses to both vertices and borders (16%, 122 out of 740 neurons, Supplementary Fig. 5).

### A model for extra-axonal diffusion spectra with frequency-dependent restriction [^015eac9e]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Preliminary Simulations

Throughout this work, Monte Carlo simulations are used as a ground truth to establish the properties of the diffusion spectrum of water in the space surrounding different geometric configurations of cylinders representing the EAS. We present simulated geometries that range from regular lattices of cylinders with uniform radii to random packings with a distribution of radii. The full details of these can be found in the Monte Carlo simulations subsection. In this section, we consider a preliminary set of simulations of the EAS to demonstrate the characteristic features of this space and motivate the EAS model that follows. The diffusion spectra for the intra- and extracylinder spaces of a simple square packing geometry are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1
a: Square packed cylinders (axial view) of radius R with representative paths of diffusing intra- (blue) and extracylinder (red) particles. The corresponding diffusion spectra for the (b) intra- and (c) extracylinder spaces for three different cylinder radii (with a cylinder center-to-center separation to diameter ratio of 1.12).is the free diffusion coefficient.

The spectrum for the interior of an impermeable (restrictive) cylinder approachesat low frequency and asymptotes toat high frequency with a sigmoidal transition between these two regimes. This behavior directly follows from the fact that a constant or slowly varying velocity (low frequency) results in a large net displacement. Restrictive spaces like impermeable cylinders thus place limitations on velocity at low frequencies; in particular, corresponds to mean velocity autocorrelation, and any nonzero mean velocity autocorrelation would eventually cause a particle to leave the compartment. Restrictive compartments are thus characterized byand, more generally, a damping of mean velocity at low frequencies.

Unlike restricted geometries, molecules in hindered spaces like the EAS can displace an arbitrary distance given sufficient time. Based on this observation, EAS molecules have been argued to behave like a slower version of free diffusion with a nonzero diffusion coefficient at(i.e. some average velocity). Recall that the mean squared free diffusion displacement x in one dimension is described by Einstein's equationwhere τ is the diffusion time of the measurement. The ratio of free to hindered mean diffusion displacementsis referred to as "tortuosity" (denoted λ):

### Droplet-supported liquid-liquid lateral phase separation as a step to floating protein heterostructures [^64b0acad]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The 2D trajectories of the BSA rafts across the oil/water interface were statistically determined and shown to follow Brownian motion with an almost linear relationship between the mean squared displacement (MSD) values and time, which were modulated by the size of the BSA domains (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 12). To ensure adequate statistical numbers, the BSA rafts on each microdroplet were divided into two groups according to their area with each group comprising 50% of the population; consequently, the group containing the smaller 50% of the domains exhibited a 1.2 times increase in MSD after 50 s of movement compared to the set comprising the larger 50% of islands. As each BSA raft was surrounded by many other protein domains, the movement was more typical of restricted Brownian motion. The extent of deviation from regular Brownian motion was classified by an anomalous exponent (α = 1 (regular), α < 1 (restricted)). Plots of α against area ratio (ie; surface area of BSA domain/total surface area of microdroplet) of the discontinuous BSA microdomains confirmed that the crowded array of BSA rafts restricted 2D Brownian motion of the protein rafts with larger area ratios associated with increased levels of restriction (lower α values) (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 12). For example, the average distance traveled during 50 s for an area ratio of 0.13 (α = 0.96) was 10 μm compared with ca. 7 μm at 0.40 (α = 0.78) (Fig. 3c). The former system also exhibited longer trajectories that overlapped between different domains, indicating dynamical changes in the relative spatial positions of the protein rafts (Fig. 3d, e). The average diffusion coefficient of BSA domains with an average size of 1.33 μm for an area ratio of 0.13 was 1.76 × 10 −2 μm 2 /s (Supplementary Fig. 12). Interestingly, the 2D translational motion of the BSA rafts was decreased when the viscosity of the surrounding aqueous phase increased (Supplementary movie S2). For example, the MSD in aqueous solution (1.4 × 10 −2 μm 2 /s) was an order of magnitude larger than the diffusion coefficient calculated in 1.5 wt% sodium alginate solution (1.89 × 10 −3 μm 2 /s); increasing the alginate concentration to 3 wt% further restricted domain movement (2.3 × 10 −4 μm 2 /s) (Fig. 3f, g and Supplementary Fig. 13).

### Hierarchical self-assembly of 3D lattices from polydisperse anisometric colloids [^f277c87e]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Modulating the effective shape of columns

Having elucidated that the circular shape of columns leads to hexagonal lattices, we next demonstrated that the effective shape of columns can be controlled by changing the ionic strength or the extent of plate tip truncation, potentially leading to different lattice structures. Here we define a parameter m as the ratio between the short (L ′) and the long (L) side lengths of a plate, to quantify the extent of tip truncation. As shown in both the schematics and SEM images (Fig. 3a), an m value of 0 corresponds to a triangular plate with sharp tips and 1 to an equilateral hexagonal plate. Regarding the ionic strength effect, given the same type of plates as studied above (the plates that are assembled into a hexagonal lattice), we calculated the interactions E tot between a stacked plate pair with varying relative in-plane orientations Δ θ at their energy minimum spacings, as a function of ionic strength (Fig. 3a, b, see details in Methods). At a relatively low ionic strength (0.5 mM, the experimental condition for forming hexagonal lattice), E tot is weakly dependent on Δ θ over a range of −60° to 60°. Based on a Boltzmann distribution argument (relative probability, p rel (Δ θ) ≈, where Δ E is the E tot difference for two plates at different relative orientations, see Fig. 3c), large plate–plate relative rotations are allowed with low energy penalty. This prediction is also consistent with our experimental observations of fast relative rotations of plates at this ionic strength condition (Fig. 2a, b). The interaction profile becomes increasingly steeper with respect to plate relative rotation as ionic strength increases, restraining the relative rotations between adjacent plates so that the plates within the columns favor aligned orientations (Fig. 3c). We verified this trend in experiments at high ionic strength (2.0 mM). At this ionic strength, the electrostatic repulsion is more screened, leading to a decreased separation between plates in the columns, higher enthalpic penalties for plate relative rotation, and therefore dampening of plate relative rotations as well as a significant increase in the lateral attraction between columns. Irregular, fractal-like assemblies from columns were observed from the same plate sample at high ionic strength (2.0 mM; Supplementary Fig. 12). In addition, plate tip truncation also drastically changes the allowed relative rotations of plates and thus the effective shape of columns. For pairwise interaction E tot calculated at a constant ionic strength and a constant basal plane area, but at varying m, we find a more hexagonal shape (a larger m) renders a flatter interaction profile over different Δ θ values (Fig. 3d, e). The plates with a more triangular shape (a smaller m), on the other hand, have a steeper potential well disfavoring relative rotations between plates. This interaction profile, on the column level, maintains the generic three-fold symmetry of triangular plates instead of a smeared-out circular shape. This detail of tip truncation was not recognized in the previous literature, due to the lack of importance in inter-column interactions in those systems.

ASNC 123I-mIBG heart-to-mediastinum ratio (HMR) derivation — ROI placement and calculation: At present the standard is to manually draw the cardiac and mediastinal regions of interest (ROI); the currently accepted method is an irregular ROI defining the epicardial border of the heart, the mediastinum is an approximately square ROI (7 × 7 pixels) in the upper mediastinum below the lung apices and midway between the lungs with positioning in the area of lowest counts, and the HMR is then calculated by dividing the mean counts/pixel in the total myocardium ROI by the mean counts/pixel in the mediastinal ROI; the technique appears to be fairly robust with a recent study showing only minimal, inconsequential changes in HMR when there are changes in the visually defined heart ROI.

Graphical excellence is mainly defined, first, by the highest possible data density (that is, the amount of information provided per graph area); second, by a low ink-to-data ratio (the avoidance of unnecessary shading, three-dimensionality, gridlines and what is often called 'chartjunk'); and third, by clear and unequivocal labelling of axes. The researcher's essential graphical toolbox should contain histograms, bar charts (always with measures of error), box-and-whiskers plots, scatter plots and forest plots.

### Superlattices assembled through shape-induced directional binding [^dd7e6f30]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Despite the conceptual simplicity of this approach for generating designed clusters, it is nontrivial to predict the requirements for the formation of extended, ordered 3D superlattices (Fig. 1). Indeed, the geometrical constraints imposed by shapesresult in a rich structural diversity even in monocomponent assemblies of shaped objects. Thus, it is not yet clear what dictates or inhibits the formation of large-scale ordered arrays even for the simplest case of hetero-shapes: mutually attractive spherical and shaped objects. At a general level, different particle shapes will exhibit significantly different anisotropic interactions in a system, thereby imposing conflicting local constraints that may override intended bonding directionality. Such conflicts can be resolved via complementary-shaped particles due to the favourable packing, certain shapes can be accommodated at the right size regimesor by optimizing a delicate balance of interactions and space-filling requirements. In our approach, the use of DNA permits tuning the interaction 'softness' due to DNA's polymeric nature. This allows us to probe the complex interplay between shape-induced directional binding, the interaction potential and geometrical requirements due to the particle size-ratios. As we show below, ordered assemblies of disparate shapes do not arise generically, even in the presence of well-defined directional bonds. Instead, crystals are obtained only with appropriate selection of interaction potentials and particle size ratio, in particular, those that satisfy local geometric constraints. Thus, directional bonds can be optimized to yield highly ordered binary 3D superlattices of hetero-shaped nanoparticles, wherein global crystallographic symmetry is directly selected by particle shape.

### Co-administered antibody improves penetration of antibody-dye conjugate into human cancers with implications for antibody-drug conjugates [^4b6a013e]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Loading dose improved the antibody penetration in the tumor

To quantitatively compare the antibody penetration between the two dosing cohorts, we divided each tumor into small square regions and measured the antibody penetration in each square region as the ratio of NIR fluorescence-positive area to EGFR-positive area, and plotted a heatmap to visualize its distribution (Fig. 5a). When quantifying the overall antibody penetration, as measured by the ratio of NIR to EGFR over the entire tumor area, no difference was found between the LD and non-LD dosing groups (Fig. 5b). However, when taking into account the micro-regional variations using the square regions, the IQR of region-based antibody penetration ratio across the tumor section was significantly lower in patients receiving a loading dose compared with the patients in the non-LD group (Fig. 5c) and the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the fluorescence and the EGFR expression of the square regions across each tumor was significantly higher in the LD than the non-LD dose group (Fig. 5d). Moreover, the antibody penetration ratio of neighboring regions were significantly more correlated in tumors receiving the LD dose compared to tumors in the non-LD dose group (Fig. 5e). All these metrics indicated reduced heterogeneity of antibody distribution in the LD group. Furthermore, if we decrease the current square size by twofold, the antibody distribution in the LD is still significantly lower than the non-LD group (Supplementary Fig. 1a). However, if we increase the current square size by twofold, there is no statistically significant differences in antibody distribution per square between the LD and non-LD group any more (Supplementary Fig. 1c), suggesting that the improved distribution is "averaged over" and the squares measure the macroscopic distribution, which is not expected to differ.

Basic stereological measurements for lung imaging — first-order parameters, probes, and reference space are specified. First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D]). Measurements are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D), with probe–voxel interactions generating countable events; raw counts yield ratios that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute lung or subcompartment measures. It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space for analysis and reporting, because measurements expressed only as ratios are subject to "the reference trap", where changes can arise from the numerator, denominator, or both; an efficient volume measurement method, point counting, is used for acinar components by micro-CT and for extrapulmonary organ volume by CT.

### 25 nm-feature, 10-aspect-ratio, 10 mm-area single-pulsed laser nanolithography [^c662ca85]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

As discussed above, the single-pulsed fs laser governs the longitudinal stretching of the focused light field and the generation of nano-sized amorphization modification in crystals, whereas the wet-chemical etching precisely controls the chemical reaction between the amorphous phase and the etching solution. This combination yields sub-30 nm holey nanostructures with an AR greater than 10 4 (in a single exposure), featuring smoother inner walls and a homogeneously longitudinal cross-section (Fig. 1c, inset). Compared to traditional Bessel beam processing approach, our strategy achieves the smallest nanohole diameter of ~25 nm, the highest AR of > 10 4, the minimum close-pack spacing of < 450 nm, and the largest duty cycle of > 70% (Fig. 1f, Fig. 3a, b, Supplementary Tables # 1 –# 3). This is because there exists a diffraction effect of side-lobes for a Bessel beam, which will affect the shape and size of adjacent areas, making it challenging to achieve a smaller spacing and a higher duty cycle. In contrast, our technique overcomes these drawbacks.

### Supramolecular double-stranded archimedean spirals and concentric toroids [^9c1783a5]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Although the principles of molecular self-assembly have become well understood through the development of supramolecular chemistry –, unexpected and intriguing self-assembled structures continue to be discovered, the diversity of which increases as the number of molecular components increases. For example, Fujita et al.discovered a new polyhedron, the existence of which was not predictable from their previous studies. Once a graph theory was established for the new family of polyhedrons, it was possible to predict the formation of a larger member in the family, which was later experimentally confirmed. One of usidentified pathway complexity in supramolecular polymerization, the mechanism of which was elucidated experimentally and computationally, thereby permitting the synthesis of an otherwise thermodynamically inaccessible helical supramolecular polymer. In such cases, weak interactions and subtle structural constraints accumulate, and kinetic effects often play significant roles, resulting in unexpected outcomes. It thus appears that principles of molecular self-assembly established for small discrete structures, such as host–guest systems or interlocked molecules, cannot simply be extended to design much larger structures. Consequently, molecular self-assembly at a higher hierarchical level remains largely unexplored –.

### Superlattices assembled through shape-induced directional binding [^ecd3313d]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Organization of spherical particles into lattices is typically driven by packing considerations. Although the addition of directional binding can significantly broaden structural diversity, nanoscale implementation remains challenging. Here we investigate the assembly of clusters and lattices in which anisotropic polyhedral blocks coordinate isotropic spherical nanoparticles via shape-induced directional interactions facilitated by DNA recognition. We show that these polyhedral blocks — cubes and octahedrons — when mixed with spheres, promote the assembly of clusters with architecture determined by polyhedron symmetry. Moreover, three-dimensional binary superlattices are formed when DNA shells accommodate the shape disparity between nanoparticle interfaces. The crystallographic symmetry of assembled lattices is determined by the spatial symmetry of the block's facets, while structural order depends on DNA-tuned interactions and particle size ratio. The presented lattice assembly strategy, exploiting shape for defining the global structure and DNA-mediation locally, opens novel possibilities for by-design fabrication of binary lattices.

### Building block aspect ratio controls assembly, architecture, and mechanics of synthetic and natural protein networks [^c6100889]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Figure 2d and Supplementary Figs. S8 and S 9 show how D f, ξ and P c, respectively, vary as a function of polyprotein AR at protein concentrations of 25 and 50 mg mL −1. As AR is increased, the D f of the network is decreased at both protein concentrations. This result is to be expected as the D f is a measure of the space-filling capacity of an object, and it is intuitive that sticky higher AR building blocks that are diffusing and linked together randomly will form much more porous structures (due to the elongated dimension). Such structures will be less space-filling (Fig. 2e) and hence have lower D f compared to structures formed by low AR building blocks. Interestingly, while at a concentration of 25 mg mL − 1 the protein network appears to show a linear decrease in D f with AR is shown, while at 50 mg mL −1, a clear sigmoid shape is observed, suggesting a transition between two structural regimes as AR is increased. To confirm these trends observed in the fractal dimension are not a result of the model chosen, we also perform model-independent Guiner–Porod fits to the low/mid- q region in order to extract the Porod exponent (i.e. the power law exponent). Supplementary Fig. 10 shows similar trends in the Porod exponent as a function of AR that are exhibited by the fractal dimension values in Fig. 2d. From these results, we suggest that the structure of pL hydrogels at 50 mg mL −1 transitions from a collection of fractal-like clusters of cross-linked proteins to a homogeneous network of cross-linked polyprotein rods (Fig. 2e). This interpretation is supported by the extracted P c values (Supplementary Fig. 9) which show that the proportion of protein in the fractal network increases in a sigmoidal fashion from 0.487 ± 0.002 at AR = 3 to 0.745 ± 0.003 at AR = 7. This dramatic increase in the proportion of protein in the fractal network is indicative of having little to no protein connecting "clusters" together and instead suggests all proteins are part of a homogeneous "mono-cluster" which spans the whole system. Interestingly, a similar trend is not observed in ξ as a function of AR (Supplementary Fig. 8), instead samples at 50 mg mL −1 show no significant change in ξ (~280 Å) as AR is increased, while those at 25 mg mL −1 exhibit a linear decrease from ~700 Å at AR = 3 to ~500 Å at AR = 5.

### Big data show idiosyncratic patterns and rates of geomorphic river mobility [^c03977cd]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Integrating topographic and geomorphic river mobility analyses

We used a nationwide digital elevation model (DEM) acquired in 2013 and generated through airborne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IfSAR) for topographic analysis. The DEM has 5 m spatial resolution and 1 m root-mean-square error vertical accuracy. We used TopoToolbox V2 to resample the DEM to 10 m spatial resolution (due to computational processing constraints) and delineated catchments and stream networks with a minimum drainage area of 1 km 2 using standard flow-routing algorithms. For each of the 10 selected catchments, we calculated fundamental topographic metrics (Supplementary Table 6) and extracted trunk channels (defined as the longest stream within the catchment). The trunk channels were used to define the regions of interest (ROI) to complete the multi-temporal satellite imagery analysis in GEE.

Valley floors were manually mapped in GIS using the nationwide DEM. We defined the valley margins morphologically, by identifying breaks in slope from relatively flat, low elevation areas to relatively steep hillslopes. The valley floor included active floodplains and terraces, in addition to other valley floor landforms (for example, fans). It was not feasible to distinguish additional margins (for example, anthropogenic or channel margins) at the catchment-scale using the topographic data available.

We used the SWATHobj function in TopoToolbox V2 to sample attribute values for per-pixel locational probabilities along the valley floor centreline. We set the SWATHobj width to 10 km to fully encompass the transverse width of the active channel and set the resampling distance to 0.01 km ('dx' parameter) to extract attribute values at along-valley intervals equal to the resampled DEM resolution. Attribute values for per-pixel locational probability were extracted across the transverse width of the swath profile at the regular intervals and then averaged to provide a generalised output (termed the cross-valley locational probability). Active channel width was calculated from the non-zero per-pixel locational probability values across the transverse width of the swath profile at regular intervals. The confinement ratio was calculated as the active channel width divided by the valley floor width. Distances along the swath profile were normalised by the total swath length; this provided a standard framework to compare along-valley patterns of geomorphic river mobility and valley floor width between multiple catchments.

The markers are as in Figure 5.

Simulated (markers) and predicted EAS diffusion spectrafor randomly packed cylinders over a range of five cylinder volume fractionsand cylinders with radius distributions that are one, two, and three times those of axons in the genu (left to right).

The abstract model parameters R 0 andare crucial to evaluate because they only have an empirical relationship to parameters of the simulated geometries. Thus, it is important to establish that these parameters (a) capture the expected relationships with λ, S / V, and p as indicated in Eqs. [10]–[12] and (b) exhibit an (approximately) one-to-one mapping with microstructural geometry. If there were no unique mapping, the estimation of the microstructural geometry would be confounded. Model fits to simulated data show that the radius parameters are in reasonable agreement with calculated values for square and hexagonal packing as shown in Figure 6 b, c, e, and f. For square packing, the fitted values of R 0 overestimate the expected R 0 for small values of p, although the general trends are in good agreement. One possible cause of disagreement for square packing are larger displacements for a given diffusion time due to the presence of straight paths between cylinders, which are not accounted for in the calculation of. The fitted values ofgenerally match the model well. The parameters R 0 andappear to give a unique mapping to all the combinations of EAS length scales and packing densities simulated.

Figure 7 shows the ratio of model and ground truth Larmor frequency for different sizes of the mesoscopic region and volume fraction for a bundle of uniformly positioned parallel rectangular rods. For a small mesoscopic cavity, the relative error from replacing the nearby microstructure with a homogeneous medium with the same average susceptibility is high. As the mesoscopic cavity increases, the actual positions of the cylinders become less important, and the ratio can be seen to converge to 1. The SD is clearly lowest for high volume fraction due to a larger number of involved rods. Additionally, it is clear that the coarse‐grained Larmor frequency can be decomposed using any cavity shape for.

FIGURE 7
Simulation (a): The mean error (circles) and standard deviation (colored bands) of the estimated Larmor frequency is shown as a function of the size of the mesoscopic regioncompared with the width of the rods. The error can be seen to converge to below 5% whenis around 10for all three cavity geometries. This underscores that the shape of the mesoscopic region is irrelevant; only size matters.

Figure 8 shows that the mean squared difference(cf. Figure 4A and 4B) and mean center field(cf. Figure 4C) converge towards zero, no matter the cavity shape and dimensionality, with the convergence rate corresponding to the sum, i.e. Here, is the structural disorder exponent andthe dimensionality.

### General theory for packing icosahedral shells into multi-component aggregates [^d89bb36e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Multi-component aggregates are being intensively researched in various fields because of their highly tunable properties and wide applications. Due to the complex configurational space of these systems, research would greatly benefit from a general theoretical framework for the prediction of stable structures, which, however, is largely incomplete at present. Here we propose a general theory for the construction of multi-component icosahedral structures by assembling concentric shells of different chiral and achiral types, consisting of particles of different sizes. By mapping shell sequences into paths in the hexagonal lattice, we establish simple and general rules for designing a wide variety of magic icosahedral structures, and we evaluate the optimal size-mismatch between particles in the different shells. The predictions of our design strategy are confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations for several multi-component atomic clusters and nanoparticles.

Abbreviations for the morphological metrics measured

Dimensions (size, Fig. 2 a): ML width; medial and lateral AP dimensions.

Anterior radii (size, Fig. 2 b): The medial profile was identified as the medial 1/4 of the resection contour; the anterior medial profile was identified as the anterior 1/2 of this medial profile. The medial anterior radius was then defined as the radius of the least squares best-fit circle to the anterior medial profile. The lateral anterior radius was defined similarly.

Areas (size): Areas enclosed by profile or bounding box (Fig. 2 a) (overall and each compartment).

Aspect ratios (shape): For overall resected plateau (plateau aspect ratio), the ratio was defined as the AP/ML ratio of the bounding box. For each compartment (compartment aspect ratio), the ratio was defined as the ratio between the AP dimension of the compartment and the ML width.

Boxiness (shape): Boxiness was defined as the ratio between the area of the overall plateau or individual compartment and the area of the associated bounding box (values ranging from 0 to 1, with values closer to unity representing a boxier geometry).

Asymmetry (shape): Asymmetry metrics reflect the asymmetry between the medial and lateral compartments (values closer to unity representing more symmetric profiles). AP asymmetry was defined as the ratio between medial and lateral AP dimensions; anterior radius asymmetry was defined as the ratio between medial and lateral anterior radii; and boxiness asymmetry was defined as the ratio between medial and lateral compartment boxiness.

The metrics were regressed against ML width for each ethnicity. The regressions were compared with the same metrics measured from the six tibial component designs (Fig. 3 a) to assess their morphological conformity to the resected proximal tibia.

### Structural signatures of dynamic heterogeneities in monolayers of colloidal ellipsoids [^d1650e3e]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

When a liquid is supercooled towards the glass transition, its dynamics drastically slows down, whereas its static structure remains relatively unchanged. Finding a structural signature of the dynamic slowing down is a major challenge, yet it is often too subtle to be uncovered. Here we discover the structural signatures for both translational and rotational dynamics in monolayers of colloidal ellipsoids by video microscopy experiments and computer simulations. The correlation lengths of the dynamic slowest-moving clusters, the static glassy clusters, the static local structural entropy and the dynamic heterogeneity follow the same power-law divergence, suggesting that the kinetic slowing down is caused by a decrease in the structural entropy and an increase in the size of the glassy cluster. Ellipsoids with different aspect ratios exhibit single- or double-step glass transitions with distinct dynamic heterogeneities. These findings demonstrate that the particle shape anisotropy has important effects on the structure and dynamics of the glass.

Results

The Unique Distribution of NPAs in Severe NPDR and PDR

We acquired OCTA images of 178 eyes from 139 participants with diabetes. After excluding 34 eyes because of weak signal strength or severe image artifacts, we investigated 144 eyes from 114 participants in the study (Table 1). The agreement of qualitative findings and DR grades are shown in Table S1 (available at). The percentages of NPSs in each eye were 0.45% (IQR, 0.31–0.77) in 27 eyes with no apparent retinopathy, 0.92% (IQR, 0.48–1.58) in 15 eyes with mild NPDR, 1.00% (IQR, 0.52–1.89) in 40 eyes with moderate NPDR, 1.90% (IQR, 1.16–3.32) in 18 eyes with severe NPDR, and 5.42% (IQR, 2.55–10.12) in 44 eyes with PDR. The percentages in the extramacular sectors (nominal, 10–20 mm) were higher in eyes with severe NPDR and PDR (Fig S1, available at).

Table 1
Participant Characteristics

We evaluated the perfusion status in each square of 10 × 10 pixels, and the NPS ratios were shown on pseudocolored rate map images in each DR severity grade (Fig 2). The NPSs developed at random locations in eyes with mild and moderate NPDR (Fig 2), whereas the ratios increased particularly in the extramacular areas and the temporal quadrant in eyes with severe NPDR and PDR (Fig S1). The maps of the differences in the NPS ratios between individual DR severity grades confirmed the high frequency of NPAs in these areas in the later stages (Fig S2, available at). Pseudocolored rate map images demonstrated that 17 PDR eyes with NVD had high NPS ratios in the nasal subfield of the extramacular areas, compared with 27 PDR eyes without NVD (Fig S3, available at).

### Geometry analysis and systematic synthesis of highly porous isoreticular frameworks with a unique topology [^d243ea75]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Porous coordination polymers are well known for their easily tailored framework structures and corresponding properties. Although systematic modulations of pore sizes of binary prototypes have gained great success, simultaneous adjustment of both pore size and shape of ternary prototypes remains unexplored, owing to the difficulty in controlling the self-assembly of multiple molecular building blocks. Here we show that simple geometry analysis can be used to estimate the influence of the linker lengths and length ratios on the synthesis/construction difficulties and framework stabilities of a highly symmetric, ternary prototype composed of a typical trinuclear metal cluster and two types of bridging carboxylate ligands. As predicted, systematic syntheses with 5×5 ligand combinations produced 13 highly porous isoreticular frameworks, which show not only systematic adjustment of pore volumes (0.49–2.04 cm(3) g(-1)) and sizes (7.8–13.0 Å; 5.2–12.0 Å; 7.4–17.4 Å), but also anisotropic modulation of the pore shapes.

Step 1.	Visual Guidelines for AdreView Cardiac Uptake on Anterior Planar Chest Images

a. Normal:

Distinct visualization of the left ventricular myocardium in the left lower chest, with greater uptake in the heart than in the adjacent lungs and mediastinum (Figure 1).
Figure 1.	Normal anterior planar AdreView image of the chest
b.	Abnormal:

Homogeneously or heterogeneously decreased cardiac uptake, with indistinct or absent visualization of the left ventricular myocardium. Cardiac activity is usually less than or equal to that of the adjacent left lung (Figure 2a). In extreme cases, little or no AdreView uptake is seen in the left lower chest (Figure 2b).
Figure 2.	Abnormal anterior planar AdreView images of the chest: a) Heterogeneously reduced cardiac uptake; b) Absent cardiac uptake

Step 2.	Quantitate AdreView Cardiac Uptake

The AdreView H/M ratio is determined from the activity in heart (H) and mediastinum (M) regions of interest (ROIs) drawn on the anterior planar chest image (Figure 3) using the following procedure:

Draw an irregular ROI defining the epicardial border of the heart. If the epicardial border cannot be defined because all or the majority of the myocardium is not visualized, draw the ROI based upon the presumed location of the heart, using the medial aspects of the left and right lower lung for anatomical guidance.
Draw a horizontal line to mark the estimated location of the lung apices. If the most superior aspect of the image does not include the lung apices (because of limited field of view for a small gamma camera), draw this line at the top of the image display.
Draw a vertical line approximately equidistant from the medial aspects of the right and left lung.
Examine the counts for the 12 pixels along the vertical line starting 4 pixels below the intersection point with the horizontal line determined in step 2, and identify the pixel with the lowest counts. If more than one pixel has this same number of counts, choose the most superiorly located pixel.
Using the pixel defined in step 4 as the center, draw a square ROI of 7×7 dimensions.
Calculate the H/M ratio by dividing the counts/pixel in the total myocardium ROI determined in step 1 by the counts/pixel in the 7×7 pixel mediastinal ROI determined in step 5.

### Spatiotemporal evolution, pattern of diffusion, and influencing factors of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hainan province, China [^6ab40f2e]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Within 1 month after the first case occurred in Hainan Province, China, the number of confirmed cases rose to 168, and there was no increase in almost 3 months. As the southernmost province and a famous tourist destination in China, its regular economic exchanges and high-intensity population movements may affect the spread of the epidemic. It is of great theoretical and practical significance to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution, the pattern of diffusion, and factors influencing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Hainan Province. Basic and geographic information of confirmed COVID-19 cases was obtained from government websites and other official media. We examined the groups of infection and calculated the diffusion ratio to demonstrate the trend of the epidemic. Map drawing, spatial analysis, and partial least squares regression were used to express the spatiotemporal evolution, the pattern of diffusion, and factors affecting the epidemic. Furthermore, we have made recommendations on the formulation and adaptation of possible future preventive steps. Results show that the COVID-19 epidemic in Hainan Province has substantial spatial heterogeneity but minimal distribution. The tourist city and central city have formed a dual-core pattern for the spread of the epidemic, which could extend to other similar regions. Population density, mobility, and level of urban development have been the major factors of epidemic distribution in the study area.

### Clinically significant nonperfusion areas on widefield OCT angiography in diabetic retinopathy [^a4bb82ed]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the distribution of clinically significant nonperfusion areas (NPAs) on widefield OCT angiography (OCTA) images in patients with diabetes.

Design

Prospective, cross-sectional, observational study.

Participants

One hundred and forty-four eyes of 114 patients with diabetes.

Methods

Nominal 20 × 23 mm OCTA images were obtained using a swept-source OCTA device (Xephilio OCT-S1), followed by the creation of en face images 20-mm (1614 pixels) in diameter centering on the fovea. The nonperfusion squares (NPSs) were defined as the 10 × 10 pixel squares without retinal vessels, and the ratio of eyes with the NPSs to all eyes in each square was referred to as the NPS ratio. The areas with probabilistic differences (APD) for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (APD[PDR] and APD[NPDR]) were defined as sets of squares with higher NPS ratios in eyes with PDR and NPDR, respectively. The P ratio (NPSs within APD[PDR] but not APD[NPDR]/all NPSs) was also calculated.

Main Outcome Measures

The probabilistic distribution of the NPSs and the association with diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity.

Results

The NPSs developed randomly in eyes with mild and moderate NPDR and were more prevalent in the extramacular areas and the temporal quadrant in eyes with severe NPDR and PDR. The APD(PDR) was distributed mainly in the extramacular areas, sparing the areas around the vascular arcades and radially peripapillary capillaries. The APD(PDR) contained retinal neovascularization more frequently than the non-APD(PDR) (P = 0.023). The P ratio was higher in eyes with PDR than in those with NPDR (P < 0.001). The multivariate analysis designated the P ratio (odds ratio, 8.293 × 10 7; 95% confidence interval, 6.529 × 10 2–1.053 × 10 13; P = 0.002) and the total NPSs (odds ratio, 1.002; 95% confidence interval, 1.001–1.003; P < 0.001) as independent risk factors of PDR. Most eyes with NPDR and 4-2-1 rule findings of DR severity had higher P ratios but not necessarily greater NPS numbers.

Conclusions

The APD(PDR) is uniquely distributed on widefield OCTA images, and the NPA location patterns are associated with DR severity, independent of the entire area of NPAs.

### Negative poisson's ratios in metal nanoplates [^82bcffc7]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

The Poisson's ratio is a fundamental measure of the elastic-deformation behaviour of materials. Although negative Poisson's ratios are theoretically possible, they were believed to be rare in nature. In particular, while some studies have focused on finding or producing materials with a negative Poisson's ratio in bulk form, there has been no such study for nanoscale materials. Here we provide numerical and theoretical evidence that negative Poisson's ratios are found in several nanoscale metal plates under finite strains. Furthermore, under the same conditions of crystal orientation and loading direction, materials with a positive Poisson's ratio in bulk form can display a negative Poisson's ratio when the material's thickness approaches the nanometer scale. We show that this behaviour originates from a unique surface effect that induces a finite compressive stress inside the nanoplates, and from a phase transformation that causes the Poisson's ratio to depend strongly on the amount of stretch.

### Direct nanopatterning of complex 3D surfaces and self-aligned superlattices via molecular-beam holographic lithography [^1e3caf64]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Beyond the ultra-fine resolution, the power of MBHL lies in its vast design space for beam trajectories. Theoretically, MBHL is capable of approximating any 2D periodic designby solving the optimal trajectory function F (x) from the deconvolution of Eq. (1). Although the exact inverse design poses challenges due to practical constraints from deposition systems, here we demonstrate a few examples of advanced patterns formed using few-beam MBHL interference. In the simplest = 2 interference illustrated in Fig. 2, where the azimuthal angles for the beam trajectory are, the angle displacementstrongly influences the interaction between neighboring deposits. Figure 6a–e show the spectrum of pattern morphologies achievable by adjustingon a square lattice nanoaperture with pore radius, center-to-center spacingand beam offset. Inspired by the ranking of periodic nanomaterials' dimensionality(see "Methods"), we created a comprehensive phase diagram of the pattern morphology as a function of the parameters, and, ranging from 0D (isolated particles) to 1D (stripes) and 2D (planar) geometries. Supplementary Fig. 11 demonstrates a similar phase diagram for hexagonal nanoapertures under such conditions. We also anticipate that a misalignment between the axis of mirror symmetry of the trajectory function and that of the nanostencil will lead to the formation of a geometrically chiral pattern. Figure 6f, g demonstrate the evolution of the geometric chirality in the MBHL deposition patterns forinterference on honeycomb nanoapertures (, top row) andinterference on square nanoapertures (, bottom row). By leveraging the concept of geometric overlap measure for planar chiral surfaces, we employ a chirality indexto evaluate the chirality of the formed surface patterns (see "Methods"):whereandare the mirror images of the deposition patterns on domain, anddenotes the translation by vectorfollowed by rotation of. For an achiral surface, whereasindicates a perfectly chiral surface. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13, the continuous modulation of the geometric chirality of nanosurfaces can be achieved by simply tuning the angle displacement of the beam trajectory, which is otherwise a non-trivial task in other fabrication processes. Our numerical optimization via the CL model indicates that the maximumvalues for the honeycomb (Fig. 6f) and square (Fig. 6g) nanoapertures are 0.46 and 0.57, respectively, manifesting as propeller and gammadion, respectively. The capacity of the MBHL process for precise manipulation of overlap, dimensionality, and chirality offers vast potential for applications in nanophotonic and plasmonic devices. We foresee further innovative trajectory designs emerging from future research, expanding the functional scope of MBHL.

### Several components of postural control are affected by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo but improve after particle-repositioning maneuvers: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8013246d]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Meta-analysis of center of gravity sway velocity revealed a significant improvement when standing on a foam surface with eyes closed, but not for one-leg stance with eyes closed. Center of pressure sway area and sway velocity improved after repositioning maneuvers. In accordance with center of gravity sway velocity, performance time increased when standing on a foam surface with altered visionbut not for tandem stance and one-leg stance with eyes closed.

Postural control during vestibular alterations, combined with visual alterations (i.e. head movements and a moving visual scene) was compared between and controls in three studies. Results on sway area and velocity were conflicting. Performance time did not significantly differ.

The impact of repositioning maneuvers on postural control during vestibular and visual alterations was assessed in two studies. Significant improvements in sway area and velocity were found.

Postural control during visual, vestibular and alterations of base of support was compared between patients and controls in two studies. Patients presented increased accelerationsand a decreased performance time.

None of the included studies reported on the impact of repositioning maneuvers.

Stability in gait was compared between patients and controls in two studies. The root mean square of accelerations of the trunk, a measure for the amount of change in velocity, was compared in two studies. The root mean square of accelerations of head and trunk were generally decreased in patients, but significant differences were found only in rotatory movements of head and trunk, and in lateroflexion of the head. Results on flexion/extension movements of the trunk were conflicting.

Gait variability, step/stride regularity and gait symmetry were compared between patients and controls in one study. Gait variability was increased in patients in flexion/extension and lateroflexion movements of the head, and in rotatory and lateroflexion movements of the trunk. The harmonic ratio, a measure of gait smoothness, was significantly decreased in patients in flexion/extension movements of the head, and in rotatory and flexion/extension movements of the trunk. Decreased consistency of gait was found in detected with a decreased step regularity of the head and a lower stride regularity in rotatory movements of the head. Patients also presented a reduced symmetry in flexion/extension movements of the trunk.

One study reported a significant improvement of coefficient of variations of stride time after repositioning maneuvers. Coefficient of variations of step width and stride length did, however, not improve.

### Competition between crystal and fibril formation in molecular mutations of amyloidogenic peptides [^903884c9]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

With the energy for lateral association as input, we can gain a molecular understanding of the propensity of the peptides to form twisted versus helical ribbons, by monitoring the evolution of the cross-sectional aspect ratio (a L a /b L b) from its earliest stages and thus, resolving the diverse tendencies to ultimately form crystals. Figure 4 shows the results of a Doob-Gillespie simulationof 1 million peptides per system at different concentrations (1.5 and 5 mM).

Fig. 4
Evolution of oligomer formation along axial (c) and lateral (a, b) assembly axes. a Two-dimensional histogram of length-radius distribution for TFQINS peptide aggregates at pH 2 after 0.5 ms. Lateral aggregates are not stable below a barrier length of L c = 6 peptides. b Plot of axial aggregation against time showing that ILQINS and IFQINS slow their axial aggregation. c Plot of lateral aggregation in a versus assembly time, and d plot of lateral aggregation in b versus assembly time. Aggregation in a takes off sharply at about 1 ms while lateral aggregation in b starts at 0.1 ms but proceeds steadily for all systems. e Cross-sectional aspect ratio of the growing oligomers against time: the spread of aspect ratios corresponds very closely to the spread of crystal formation in the experimental samples

In Fig. 4a we show a snapshot of the distribution of aggregates of length cL c and radius r. Once the oligomers pass a certain length (L c > 6, cL c > 28.8 Å) we see increased probability of oligomers being formed with larger radii. This is due to the increased free energy of lateral association with increasing surface area of the longer aggregates. Figure 4b shows that during the initial stages of aggregation, stronger inter-peptide attraction due to pH or sequence results in a slowing (ILQINS > IFQINS > TFQINS, ILQINS being the slowest) of axial aggregation (the c axis). This corresponds with an increase in earlier lateral aggregation (terminus−terminus) in the a axis (Fig. 4c), but has little effect on aggregation in the (β -sheet) b axis (Fig. 4d), leading to the formation of anisotropic oligomers with high cross-sectional aspect ratio (aL a / bL b ≫ 1). The simulations suggest that this tendency to form anisotropic oligomers is increased not only by hydrophobic sequence and by more neutral pH but also by increasing concentration as shown in the plot of aspect ratio versus time (Fig. 4e).

Correlation of the Parameters

For the distribution map, we plotted the results shown above in a three‐dimensional (3‐D) graph with 3 axes, ie, the peak values of the MPS, vertical diameter/horizontal diameter (aspect ratio), and fillet radius/vertical diameter (Figure 6, right). To see the distribution in 2‐D form, we modified the 3‐D graph to a graph viewed from the direction of the z axis (Figure 6, left).

Modified 2‐D graph of the MPS distribution map viewed from the direction of the z axis (left). MPS indicates maximum principal stress.

We noted 2 areas with high peak stress in the graph shown in Figure 6. The area on the left where the aspect ratio was < 1 represented the "horizontally long" hypothetical ellipse. Based on the value of MPS in this area (minimum value: 0.03 MPa), we marked a boundary in the right side for the "high peak stress" area, which represented the vertically long aneurysm with a small fillet radius. The borderline that we set was expressed with the formula: Y = 0.19X−0.24, and drawing this line covered the area showing MPS > 0.03 MPa.

### Spanning the scales of granular materials through microscopic force imaging [^6d41cc96]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Inference of 3D geometrical properties from images

For a given state of our system, we measure images of the packing cross-sections. From these we infer the geometric properties of the grains and their contacts. We use standard image denoising, local grey level renormalization, and image rescaling to compensate varying optical path lengths. We combine all the slice images into a 3D representation in terms of voxels. We detect border voxels by using a combination of statistical tests and signal processing techniques to account for physical properties of the hydrogels (for example, homogenous grey levels within grains, compensation of artifacts induced by index mismatch at grain boundaries due to their surface properties and so on). These methods are detailed in the publicly available source code. They ensure that very few false-border outliers remain. We then uniquely attribute border voxels to grains: a local tangent plane is fit at each voxel, such that the plane normal determines the direction towards a rough estimate of the grain centre at an average radius distance. These protocentres are considered to be distributed around a unique grain identifier, which we compute with 3D kernel density estimation. This process yields a cloud of border voxels uniquely attributed to each grain. We then fit an analytic shape to these borders such that for each direction u (unit vector), the surface of the grain from the center of mass in that direction is given by a function s (u) that best interpolates through all border voxels. This function s is expressed in terms of a basis of spline functions on S 2 ≡ { u }, the unit sphere. Unlike their Cartesian counterpart (for example, non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS)), the triangular spherical b-splinesdo not introduce any singularities on the sphere, and they are maximally isotropic. We use the convexity of the hydrogel grains as a regularizing condition, and we then perform a Levenberg–Marquardt least-square optimization to find the coefficients of s in the spline basis, so as to best fit border voxels, discarding any remaining outliers. Once we have analytic descriptions of the grain surfaces, it is easy to compute their centres of mass and any other geometric quantity, including the areas of contact.

Key points Best Practices To create these chart types, you must specify a numerator and a denominator. The chart tool calculates the ratio and, depending on the chart type, represents the result as circles, squares, or person icons in a square grid or as a linear bar. The linear gauge is often used to show progress towards a goal while the waffle is used to show proportion. Due to the small size of these visualization types, leaving them in the standard width on DFE works well. Do use:

- To place emphasis on parts-to-whole contribution
- To visualize whole number percentages. These charts can show the value of a single percentage point more clearly than a pie or donut chart.

### Supramolecular double-stranded archimedean spirals and concentric toroids [^51bb5a4a]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Connecting molecular-level phenomena to larger scales and, ultimately, to sophisticated molecular systems that resemble living systems remains a considerable challenge in supramolecular chemistry. To this end, molecular self-assembly at higher hierarchical levels has to be understood and controlled. Here, we report unusual self-assembled structures formed from a simple porphyrin derivative. Unexpectedly, this formed a one-dimensional (1D) supramolecular polymer that coiled to give an Archimedean spiral. Our analysis of the supramolecular polymerization by using mass-balance models suggested that the Archimedean spiral is formed at high concentrations of the monomer, whereas other aggregation types might form at low concentrations. Gratifyingly, we discovered that our porphyrin-based monomer formed supramolecular concentric toroids at low concentrations. Moreover, a mechanistic insight into the self-assembly process permitted a controlled synthesis of these concentric toroids. This study both illustrates the richness of self-assembled structures at higher levels of hierarchy and demonstrates a topological effect in noncovalent synthesis.

### Analog programing of conducting-polymer dendritic interconnections and control of their morphology [^372398bb]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Morphological influence with frequency

The influence of the frequency using square waveforms on the growth of ePEDOT wires in a water/acetonitrile electrolyte has recently been shown, and evidences an empirical law existing between the apparent diameter of the ePEDOT wires and frequency of the applied waveform. Here, we focused on a lower frequency range between 10 Hz and 1 kHz to monitor the change transition between dendrite-like to wire-like that occurs by increasing the frequency in water (Fig. 4). As the system starts to bubble for frequency below 10 Hz, this property confirms that the system is kinetically limited and water electrolysis is only enabled if the applied voltage remains still for a sufficiently long time.

Frequency variation in the voltage pattern shows a relationship between the projected area and the frequency that appears inversely proportional (as shows the −1 slope in double log scale in Fig. 4b), suggesting here that projected area is linear with the waveform's period. As the projected area is directly proportional to the dendrite's branches diameter by the elementary cylinders approximation (at least for the highest frequency cases where dendrites appear as linear cables), the quadratic low identified for lithographically patterned Au-electrodes in acetonitrile/water at higher frequency appears linear for our experimental conditions for dendritic growth. At higher frequency, dendrites' seems also to interconnect quicker, by a linear relationship between completion time and frequency displaying a −1 slope in double log scale (Fig. 4b) at a frequency below 200 Hz. In case of lower branching dendrites above 200 Hz, dendrites grow slower, by a −1/2 slope on the double log plot in Fig. 4b. We observed a deviation from this trend for f > 200 Hz with substantially much thinner dendrites: dendrites interconnect much slower up to 950 Hz. Nuclei with micrometer-scale branches at a frequency above 1 kHz were observed but have not been attempted to merge at this wire distance, due to a too long completion time, not compatible with preserving the electrolytic drop from substantial evaporation. From the impedance spectroscopy of three different dendritic doublet morphologies (thin and vicinal, thick and vicinal, and thick and distant — details in Supplementary Fig. 5), all three pairs of dendrites have a comparable spectral behavior with a cut-off at around f c = 20 Hz. Compared to the naked gold wire, all these dendritic systems take longer to charge their double layers (observed cut-off between 1 and 10 kHz for naked gold in Fig. 3e). With dendrites' specific areas being much larger than the wire, the increase of the double-layer capacitance at the electrochemical interfaces is responsible for the lower frequency shift of the cut-off. Providing that this 20 Hz cut-off is similar for all three pairs of dendrites, we observe that the first 25 ms of the wire polarization appears to be a specific time window in the charge transient of dendrites of these sizes. Earlier than t = 1/2 f c, the ionic space-charge around the electrodes is not fully-formed as compact Helmholtz layers to screen the voltage polarization at the vicinity of the electrodes in the electrolyte (V ' sig near the signal and V ' gnd near the ground, as depicted in Fig. 1b). Assuming ideal resistor-capacitor charge/discharge for the PSS − (aq) Helmholtz layer at the anode, a significant exponential decay of V ' sig (t) in the millisecond timescale, which therefore conditions the oxidation rate of EDOT (aq) in the sub-kHz range (Fig. 4c). As the correlation between spectral dependency growth morphology is not straightforward, the mechanistic interpretation of the dendrites' growth morphology with voltage frequency remains only qualitative. However, in light of the spectral and image analysis, we can assess that the process is not limited by an anodic monomer gradient diffusion, as the most massive dendrites are obtained at the lowest frequency for a same polarization duration. As in this case, the temporal density of anodic polarization equals 0.5 (dc = 50%) for all frequency conditions, the densest dendrites would have been expected for the highest frequency in case of diffusion limitation. Also providing the ionomeric structure of the PSS − (aq) polyanions, one can assume that its time-dependent accumulation on the ePEDOT surface screens the dendrites both electrostatically but also sterically. Such physical hindrances for the EDOT (aq) oxidation can potentially justify the observed gradual transition of morphology from isotropic and diffused growth to oriented and linear ones (Fig. 4d).

### Medial packing and elastic asymmetry stabilize the double-gyroid in block copolymers [^856b8fc5]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Despite their formation by diverse molecular systems, universal explanations for why various network structures form under equilibrium assembly remain elusive. A common theme in most rationalizations of network formation is the concept of packing frustration –, which loosely refers to the incompatibility between a preferred local geometry for constituents and constraints of space filling. Unlike cylinders or layers, which have uniform shape and thickness, IMDSs of tubular networks have variable curvature and molecules extending from this surface to the "center" of the domain have to reach variable distances, yet need to do so at nearly constant density. While this heuristic picture is widely held, a basic gap remains between specific geometric measures of packing and IMDS shape, molecular configurations of constituents, and the thermodynamic selection of network structures that form in equilibrium.

In this paper, we revisit the theory of self-assembly of network morphologies based on the so-called strong-segregation theory (SST) of AB block copolymer melts. Block copolymer melt assembly is an ideal system for understanding complex morphology formation, owing to the fact that equilibrium behavior of variable chemical and architectural compositions are well captured by a self-consistent field (SCF) model, dependent on only a few parameters: the composition fractions f of component blocks; the χ parameter describing immiscibility between unlike components; and chain length N (χ N controls the effective degree of segregation in assembled morphologies). Nonetheless, the understanding of the stable network phases of block copolymer melts has a complex and unsettled history.

### Medial packing and elastic asymmetry stabilize the double-gyroid in block copolymers [^4ba32a38]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Triply-periodic networks are among the most complex and functionally valuable self-assembled morphologies, yet they form in nearly every class of biological and synthetic soft matter building blocks. In contrast to simpler assembly motifs – spheres, cylinders, layers – networks require molecules to occupy variable local environments, confounding attempts to understand their formation. Here, we examine the double-gyroid network phase by using a geometric formulation of the strong stretching theory of block copolymer melts, a prototypical soft self-assembly system. The theory establishes the direct link between molecular packing, assembly thermodynamics and the medial map, a generic measure of the geometric center of complex shapes. We show that "medial packing" is essential for stability of double-gyroid in strongly-segregated melts, reconciling a long-standing contradiction between infinite- and finite-segregation theories. Additionally, we find a previously unrecognized non-monotonic dependence of network stability on the relative entropic elastic stiffness of matrix-forming to tubular-network forming blocks. The composition window of stable double-gyroid widens for both large and small elastic asymmetry, contradicting intuitive notions that packing frustration is localized to the tubular domains. This study demonstrates the utility of optimized medial tessellations for understanding soft-molecular assembly and packing frustration via an approach that is readily generalizable far beyond gyroids in neat block copolymers.

### Field-induced assembly of colloidal ellipsoids into well-defined microtubules [^2e44e0d8]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Current theoretical attempts to understand the reversible formation of stable microtubules and virus shells are generally based on shape-specific building blocks or monomers, where the local curvature of the resulting structure is explicitly built-in via the monomer geometry. Here we demonstrate that even simple ellipsoidal colloids can reversibly self-assemble into regular tubular structures when subjected to an alternating electric field. Supported by model calculations, we discuss the combined effects of anisotropic shape and field-induced dipolar interactions on the reversible formation of self-assembled structures. Our observations show that the formation of tubular structures through self-assembly requires much less geometrical and interaction specificity than previously thought, and advance our current understanding of the minimal requirements for self-assembly into regular virus-like structures.

### A non-spatial account of place and grid cells based on clustering models of concept learning [^7c3febb5]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Due to the asymmetrical shape of the trapezoid environment, the procedure for generating a movement trajectory above leads to a slightly biased sampling of the wide part of the trapezoid, and less exploration of the middle and top parts of the shape. To deal with this, we made a slight change to the possible steps after generating a step that brings the agent out of the environment, described below. For each trial, the step was generated as before. If the generated step was out of the environment, the step was cancelled, and the next step was determined as follows. If the step generated would have brought the agent out of the bottom of the trapezoid, the next step was sampled from [0, 0, 1, 1] (stay or up). If the step brings the agent out to the top, the next step was sampled from [−1, −1, 0, 0] (down or stay). When the step takes the agent out of the left of the trapezoid, then the next step to be sampled on the horizontal axis were [0, 1, 1, 2, 4], towards the inner portion of the environment. If the step took the agent out of the right side of the trapezoid, the next step was generated as before, from [−4, −2, −1, −1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4]. This is because when the agent is out of the trapezoid on the horizontal (left-right) axis, the agent could still be in the middle of the shape on the vertical axis, since the shape becomes more narrow as it reaches the right. Finally, when it lands exactly in the middle of the horizontal axis, but is out of the shape (on the horizontal axis), the next step to be sampled from on the vertical axis is [−1, 0, 1].

### Quantification of orbital apex crowding for screening of dysthyroid optic neuropathy using multidetector CT [^225a0955]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

DON, a serious complication of GO, is frequently difficult to diagnose clinically in its early stages because of confounding signs and symptoms of congestive orbitopathy. We evaluated the ability of square area measurements of orbital apex crowding, calculated with MDCT, to detect DON.

Materials and Methods

Fifty-six patients with GO were studied prospectively with complete neuro-ophthalmologic examination and MDCT scanning. Square measurements were taken from coronal sections 12 mm, 18 mm, and 24 mm from the interzygomatic line. The ratio between the extraocular muscle area and the orbital bone area was used as a CI. Intracranial fat prolapse through the superior orbital fissure was recorded as present or absent. Severity of optic nerve crowding was also subjectively graded on coronal images. Orbits were divided into 2 groups (with or without clinical evidence of DON) and compared.

Results

Ninety-five orbits (36 with and 59 without DON) were studied. The CIs at all 3 levels and the subjective crowding score were significantly greater in orbits with DON (P < .001). No significant difference was observed regarding intracranial fat prolapse (P = 0.105). The area under the ROC curves was 0.91, 0.93, and 0.87 for CIs at 12, 18, and 24 mm, respectively. The best performance was at 18 mm, where a cutoff value of 57.5% corresponded to 91.7% sensitivity, 89.8% specificity, and an odds ratio of 97.2 for detecting DON. A significant correlation (P < .001) between the CIs and VF defects was observed.

Conclusions

Orbital CIs based on area measurements were found to predict DON more reliably than subjective grading of orbital crowding or intracranial fat prolapse.

### Yi liu answers questions about 15 years of research on covalent organic frameworks [^2c615be4]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Another challenge for certain applications is the poor solution processability. COFs are 2D or 3D polymers with periodic structures. In essence, they are crosslinked polymers, which imply that they typically have low solubility and are incompatible with solution processes. Depending on the applications, we need a clever way to deposit COFs on substrates or interfaces to overcome the processability barrier, which is not a problem for the linear polymer counterparts which have much better solution processability. This is especially important when it comes to optoelectronic applications.

What needs to be done in order to make COFs more widely adopted and to get a foothold in industry and industrial applications?

This is an important question to ask. I do feel the field fits more within the academic venue at the current stage. An upfront issue is the cost. Compared to traditional polymers or even to the closely related MOFs, the COF monomers are more like specialty chemicals. Chemists are able to design and make any monomer, but at the end the availability can be an issue. Another problem is upscaling. Most of the lab scale COF synthesis happens on the milligram scale, which is completely reasonable and fine for discovery purpose, though there is a missing link between the lab scale and the larger scale of a batch production. It also appears that the hydrothermal synthesis is quite sensitive to small changes of reaction conditions, which adds additional concerns for upscaling production or industrial applications.

Another point I want to make is, that in order to advance COFs toward industry we still need to demonstrate a unique application of COFs which outperforms other materials candidates.

Where do you see the field going next?

I think it is all related to what we have discussed before. I am looking at it in two parts: structure wise we still need to find better ways to grow large area and more crystalline and less defective COFs, ideally with facile access to single or few layer structures. This might benefit from advances in other areas, in particular from advances in synthesis such as high throughput synthesis with automation or potentially autonomous synthesis. This might help to accelerate the discovery and to improve the structure integrity. The development of artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms might help with this process, if coupled with high throughput synthesis.

### A computational model for structural dynamics and reconfiguration of DNA assemblies [^4511a6dd]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In the hydrodynamic model, we assumed the Stokes flow of viscous, linear, and incompressible fluids, considering the length scale of structured DNA assemblies. The generalized Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa mobility matrixwas employed to construct the friction matrix where six translational and rotational degrees of freedom for each node were considered as in the structural model (Supplementary Note 3). This mobility matrix accounted for the damping of a DNA structure with a complex shape through the superposition of identical spherical particles with a hydrodynamic radius assigned to each node. Then, the inverse of the mobility matrix provided the friction matrix under the linearity of the Stokes flow, quantifying the effect of the viscosity and random thermal force acting on the structure in the solvent.

The governing equations for Langevin dynamics were solved to obtain the trajectories of the DNA structure by using a direct time integration algorithm that we developed. Half-time stepping and Simpson's rule were introduced in the calculation of the internal force vector based on the Grønbech-Jensen Farago scheme(Supplementary Note 4). Its application to representative linear problems (thermal diffusion in a flat potential and thermal harmonic oscillator) confirmed significantly improved numerical stability and performance compared to the original Grønbech-Jensen Farago scheme, enabling us to use a larger step size in time integration and hence to simulate more efficiently. To rapidly reach an equilibrium configuration, the dynamic analysis often began from a statically obtained configuration by minimizing the energy of structural and electrostatic potentials. The overall flow of the proposed analysis framework is described in Supplementary Fig. 1.

Global shape

To validate the proposed analysis framework, we first investigated the mean shape of ten DNA wireframe structures in equilibrium. They included six triangular, two square, and two hexagonal structures, categorized into two types of edges: two-helix bundle (DX)and 6-helix bundle (6HB). The dynamic simulations began from statically predicted energy-minimum configurations and were performed 500-ns-long simulations for them (Fig. 2). As expected, the structures with stiffer 6HB edges showed smaller means and variances in the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values than those with softer DX edges (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1). The RMSD profiles further indicated that square and hexagonal structures with DX edges were flexible enough to reach another energy-minimum configuration more easily during the dynamic simulations, deviating slightly from the initial configuration obtained from static energy minimization (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3).

### Solu-medrol [^9af30818]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Dosage may be reduced for infants and children but should be governed more by the severity of the condition and response of the patient than by age or size. It should not be less than 0.5 mg per kg every 24 hours.

Dosage must be decreased or discontinued gradually when the drug has been administered for more than a few days. If a period of spontaneous remission occurs in a chronic condition, treatment should be discontinued. Routine laboratory studies, such as urinalysis, two-hour postprandial blood sugar, determination of blood pressure and body weight, and a chest X-ray should be made at regular intervals during prolonged therapy. Upper GI X-rays are desirable in patients with an ulcer history or significant dyspepsia.

In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective (see PRECAUTONS, Neurologic-psychiatric).

For the purpose of comparison, the following is the equivalent milligram dosage of the various glucocorticoids:

### The key role of the scaffold on the efficiency of dendrimer nanodrugs [^3fc91e52]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

In view of these puzzling biological results, theoretical calculations have been carried out to try to rationalize them. We have employed all-atom MD simulations for the 13 different dendrimers immerged in a solvation box containing explicit water molecules and salt ions to gain a molecular-level detailed description of these macromolecules in the real environment.

The radii of gyration (R g) of the equilibrated dendrimers (Fig. 6a) demonstrate that, similar to the number of terminal groups, size is not a discriminant factor controlling molecular activity. One reasonable hypothesis was that dendrimers' activity is somehow related to the shape or configuration assumed by the dendrimers in solution. However, the aspect ratio and the anisotropy parameters for the equilibrated dendrimers extracted from the MD simulations show that even the overall molecular shape is not a key parameter controlling activity (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Nevertheless, the equilibrated conformations assumed by the dendrimers in solution present other interesting differences. In particular, the structure of the active dendrimers is segregated in salt water, with all the hydrophilic terminal functions compacted on one side and the hydrophobic scaffold exposed to the external media (Fig. 6b). On the contrary, the non-active dendrimers have a more symmetrical structure with terminal groups displayed all around the dendrimer surface. Thus, our MD simulations divide the dendrimers into two categories identified by either a directional or a spherical configuration. The radial distribution functions g(r) data of the azabisphosphonic terminal groups (END) provide quantification for this observation (Fig. 7). In particular, the high g(r) peaks at short END–END distance (Fig. 7d) show that the terminal functions are more densely packed in the biologically active dendrimers, in particular for the most active 1-G 1. In general, if the azabisphosphonic terminal groups packing density (position of the END–END g(r) peak) is taken as a score of molecular directionality, Fig. 7c, d show that the latter is in remarkable trend with biological activity.

### Using symmetry to elucidate the importance of stoichiometry in colloidal crystal assembly [^dff8d404]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

We demonstrate a method based on symmetry to predict the structure of self-assembling, multicomponent colloidal mixtures. This method allows us to feasibly enumerate candidate structures from all symmetry groups and is many orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than combinatorial enumeration of these candidates. In turn, this permits us to compute ground-state phase diagrams for multicomponent systems. While tuning the interparticle potentials to produce potentially complex interactions represents the conventional route to designing exotic lattices, we use this scheme to demonstrate that simple potentials can also give rise to such structures which are thermodynamically stable at moderate to low temperatures. Furthermore, for a model two-dimensional colloidal system, we illustrate that lattices forming a complete set of 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotational symmetries can be rationally designed from certain systems by tuning the mixture composition alone, demonstrating that stoichiometric control can be a tool as powerful as directly tuning the interparticle potentials themselves.

### A new ultrasound criterion for the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome: the ovarian stroma / total area ratio [^f794ab1a]. Fertility and Sterility (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether some ultrasound parameters of ovarian morphology can discriminate between control women and patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Design

Retrospective data analysis.

Setting

Volunteers women in an academic research environment.

Patient(S)

Eighty amenorrheic or oligomenorrheic women and 30 normal ovulatory control participants.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

We evaluated ovarian volume, area, stroma, and the stroma/total area (S/A) ratio by use of transvaginal pelvic ultrasound; and we assayed serum levels of gonadotropin, androgen, and estradiol during the early follicular phase (days 2 to 5) of the menstrual cycle in regularly cycling controls and on a random day in amenorrheic patients.

Result(S)

Patients with PCOS showed significantly higher ovarian volume, area, stroma, and mean S/A ratio when compared to multifollicular and control groups. Cut-off values have been defined for ovarian volume (13.21 mL), area (7.00 cm2), stroma (1.95 cm2), and S/A ratio (0.34). The sensitivity for PCOS diagnosis was 21%, 4%, 62%, and 100%, respectively. The S/A ratio showed the most significant correlation with the androgen levels.

Conclusion(S)

The evaluation of the S/A ratio can differentiate between PCOS and control or multifollicular women with both a sensitivity and a specificity of 100%. Furthermore, this ultrasound parameter is strictly related to hormonal milieu and to anthropometric characteristics.

### Competition between crystal and fibril formation in molecular mutations of amyloidogenic peptides [^3c2814b3]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Amyloidogenic model peptides are invaluable for investigating assembly mechanisms in disease related amyloids and in protein folding. During aggregation, such peptides can undergo bifurcation leading to fibrils or crystals, however the mechanisms of fibril-to-crystal conversion are unclear. We navigate herein the energy landscape of amyloidogenic peptides by studying a homologous series of hexapeptides found in animal, human and disease related proteins. We observe fibril-to-crystal conversion occurring within single aggregates via untwisting of twisted ribbon fibrils possessing saddle-like curvature and cross-sectional aspect ratios approaching unity. Changing sequence, pH or concentration shifts the growth towards larger aspect ratio species assembling into stable helical ribbons possessing mean-curvature. By comparing atomistic calculations of desolvation energies for association of peptides we parameterise a kinetic model, providing a physical explanation of fibril-to-crystal interconversion. These results shed light on the self-assembly of amyloidogenic peptides, suggesting amyloid crystals, not fibrils, represent the ground state of the protein folding energy landscape.

### Lattice-free prediction of three-dimensional structure of programmed DNA assemblies [^738946ea]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Topologically closed DNA assemblies

To test the ability of our procedure to be applied to topologically closed DNA assemblies that cannot be modelled using our previous finite element approach, we first applied it to a concentric ring structure consisting of four rings designed to reside in a 2D plane with circumferences of 100, 150, 200 and 250 bps, respectively, with inner diameter of 11 nm and outer diameter of 26 nm (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Movie 2). The outer diameter was also measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Supplementary Fig. 11). Although the overall equilibrium 3D structure remained planar, individual helices adopted straightened configurations intervening neighbouring four-way junctions to minimize overall mechanical free energy. In contrast, application of the model to a scaffolded DNA origami structure consisting of nine concentric rings, previously designed and analyzed experimentally using AFM, exhibited significant out-of-plane distortion in addition to in-plane duplex bulging despite the absence of any electrostatic repulsion between neighbouring helices (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Movie 3). Application to a 12-layer hemispherical origami object with outer diameter 44 nm revealed an overall hemispherical structure together with similar local distortions in concentric rings, in addition to a slightly collapsed upper quadrant(Fig. 2c and Supplementary Movie 4). Our procedure also simulated structural flexibility and thermal fluctuations of these three structures (Supplementary Movies 5–7). These subtle structural features predicted by the model are postulated to have origins in the mismatch in length between intervening DNA duplexes between concentric rings. In particular, our model assumes a 1.85 nm interhelical distance at four-way junctions to be consistent with atomic-level junction models, compared with the 2.5 nm assumed previously to design the contour length of each concentric ring(Supplementary Fig. 8, Supplementary Table 1, and Supplementary Note 4). Differences in the designed radii of two perfectly concentric rings also therefore equals 2.5 nm, leading to contour lengths of 200 and 250 bps of the outermost two layers in the four-layer ring, for example, assuming a 0.34 nm axial rise per bp and an inner ring diameter of 22 nm. This resulting mismatch in contour length consequently leads to the five bulges between two neighbouring immobile four-way junctions in the outermost two layers, as well as the increased curvature in the outermost layer in the four-layer ring. We further assume a ground-state junction angle J twist = 60° corresponding to the free immobile four-way junction, which may further exaggerate this effect. Because the precise pattern of bulging of neighbouring helices and slight collapse observed in the model cannot be resolved experimentally using AFM or transmission electron microscopy, it is impossible at present to determine whether the detailed patterns of predicted local bulging are valid, and if so, whether they are due only to contour mismatch, assumed ground-state junction angle, electrostatic repulsion or some combination of these effects. Notwithstanding, high-resolution 3D structural data from cryo-electron microscopy will be of interest in the future to test these subtle structural predictions for the present, as well as other, programmed DNA assemblies.

### Coarse-grained fundamental forms for characterizing isometries of trapezoid-based origami metamaterials [^3b803fbe]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We similarly coarse-grain the infinitesimal deformation of the periodic origami tessellation generated from a homogeneous isometry by averaging the corresponding lattice displacement (Δ μ) and lattice angular velocity (L μ) over all primitive unit cells. We again do this in two steps. First, we average the lattice displacement and lattice angular velocity over the same set of standard unit cells used to computeabove. Here, there are an additional four copies of each standard cell distinguished by the orientation of the frame for each of the four corners that meet at the vertex set at the origin. We denote the resultsand. Second, we expand Eqns. ((17), (18)) in terms of these quantities:Again, the partial derivatives satisfy δ ∂ μ t ν = δ ∂ ν t μ and we transform from the discrete cell indices to the continuous surface coordinates via the Jacobian. While we do not compute an embedding directly, this procedure is sufficient to compute the fundamental forms and characterize the geometry of the origami tessellations. These methods extend to the crease patterns shown in Fig. 1 C, D that are not periodic in the azimuthal direction but are still composed of cellular building blocks by performing the first step of our averaging between analogous, but nonequivalent, vertices in both the forward and backwards directions.

For fractal analysis, "the number of vessel-containing cubes is related to cube size on a double logarithmic plot; fractal dimension is the slope of the linear portion of the plot", or it "can be estimated from CT or MRI perfusion scans by calculating the relative dispersion (standard deviation/ mean)… and evaluating the slope of the relationship between log relative dispersion versus log number of voxels averaged".

### Large-scale self-organization of reconfigurable topological defect networks in nematic liquid crystals [^10b71829]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Topological defects in nematic liquid crystals are ubiquitous. The defects are important in understanding the fundamental properties of the systems, as well as in practical applications, such as colloidal self-assembly, optical vortex generation and templates for molecular self-assembly. Usually, spatially and temporally stable defects require geometrical frustration imposed by surfaces; otherwise, the system relaxes because of the high cost of the elastic energy. So far, multiple defects are kept in bulk nematic liquid crystals by top-down lithographic techniques. In this work, we stabilize a large number of umbilical defects by doping with an ionic impurity. This method does not require pre-patterned surfaces. We demonstrate that molecular reorientation controlled by an AC voltage induces periodic density modulation of ions accumulated at an electrically insulating polymer interface, resulting in self-organization of a two-dimensional square array of umbilical defects that is reconfigurable and tunable.

Invasive diagnosis of constrictive pathophysiology — constrictive pericarditis shows elevated end-diastolic filling pressures and a square root sign on both left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) pressure tracings, with enhanced ventricular interdependence demonstrated by systolic area index and reciprocal inspiratory changes (increase in RV area and decrease in LV area); in restrictive cardiomyopathy, end-diastolic filling pressures are elevated and a square root sign is present, but there is no evidence of enhanced ventricular interdependence, with parallel changes in LV and RV pressure curve areas.

### Medial packing and elastic asymmetry stabilize the double-gyroid in block copolymers [^136613e3]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Triply-periodic networks are among the most complex and functionally valuable self-assembled morphologies, yet they form in nearly every class of biological and synthetic soft matter building blocks. In contrast to simpler assembly motifs - spheres, cylinders, layers - networks require molecules to occupy variable local environments, confounding attempts to understand their formation. Here, we examine the double-gyroid network phase by using a geometric formulation of the strong stretching theory of block copolymer melts, a prototypical soft self-assembly system. The theory establishes the direct link between molecular packing, assembly thermodynamics and the medial map, a generic measure of the geometric center of complex shapes. We show that "medial packing" is essential for stability of double-gyroid in strongly-segregated melts, reconciling a long-standing contradiction between infinite- and finite-segregation theories. Additionally, we find a previously unrecognized non-monotonic dependence of network stability on the relative entropic elastic stiffness of matrix-forming to tubular-network forming blocks. The composition window of stable double-gyroid widens for both large and small elastic asymmetry, contradicting intuitive notions that packing frustration is localized to the tubular domains. This study demonstrates the utility of optimized medial tessellations for understanding soft-molecular assembly and packing frustration via an approach that is readily generalizable far beyond gyroids in neat block copolymers.

### Two-dimensional honeycomb network through sequence-controlled self-assembly of oligopeptides [^e37418b5]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Staggered linear arrangements of dimers are occasionally observed at the edges of the islands, indicated for instance in Fig. 3a in the upper right corner. From the model, we see that a polar–nonpolar–polar-binding motif is formed at the ends of the dimer, involving the C-terminal and the Phe8 residue of one peptide, and the Asp1′ residue of the other peptide. This motif promotes the staggered linear arrangements, which offer a binding site to add a third dimer and form the vertex. The Asp1 residue still remains present at the rim of the pore, however the angled arrangement of the two adjacent dimers sterically hinders the approach of another peptide or dimer.

While the threefold symmetry of the vertex might be supported by the substrate symmetry, it is also a direct consequence of the free energy of the system. Coulomb and van-der-Waals interactions have more impact due to the packing of dimers into hexamers. This vertex structure is energetically more favourable for instance over a linear chain arrangement with the same amount of possible hydrogen bonds between the dimers because it is more compact and thus more groups can interact with each other.

Despite the complex and specific binding of the peptides, the honeycomb network demonstrates a high fault tolerance. The position and arrangement of the molecules in the network are clearly revealed by the zero-dimensional defects shown in Fig. 4a. The distance between the two peptides is increased in the dimer that is highlighted by a white rectangle, making the individual molecules distinguishable. This observation confirms the antiparallel arrangement in a double-walled honeycomb network. Furthermore, at the nodes, the binding of three dimers can be askew, marked with white circles in Fig. 4a. This defect directly reveals the chiral, interlocked assembly.

Figure 4b shows a linear grain boundary between two domains that are slightly rotated by approximately 1° against each other. At this angle, the width of the grain boundary increases by 8 Å per hexagonal pore. In the STM images, the appearance of the dimer motif changes along the defect as it is stretched to compensate for the stress. The incorporation of this line defect also requires a rotational variability of the binding at the vertex motif, which is visible in the STM topography.

### Time efficient design of multi dimensional RF pulses: application of a multi shift CGLS algorithm [^c93b3fd1]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Designing multi dimensional ratio frequency excitation pulses in the small flip angle regime commonly reduces to the solution of a least squares problem, which requires regularization to be solved numerically. Usually, regularization is carried out by the introduction of a penalty, λ, on the solution norm. In most cases, the optimal regularization parameter is not known a priori and the problem needs to be solved for several values of λ. The optimal value can be selected, typically by plotting the L-curve. In this article, a conjugate gradients-based algorithm is applied to design ratio frequency pulses in a time-efficient way without a priori knowledge of the optimal regularization parameter. The computation time is reduced considerably (by a factor 10 in a typical set up) with respect to the standard conjugate gradients for least square since just one run of the algorithm is required. Simulations are shown and the performance is compared to that of conjugate gradients for least square.

### Best-fit circle missing area method shows good accuracy and interrater reliability when assessing glenoid bone loss [^d52056c3]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The amount of glenoid bone loss (GBL) in anterior shoulder instability helps determine management options. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on how to accurately measure GBL.

Hypothesis

The best-fit circle missing area method has better accuracy and interrater reliability than the ratio and diameter methods.

Study Design

Controlled laboratory study.

Methods

Three-dimensional computed tomography shoulder scans were collected and segmented on 4 healthy male participants (mean age, 22.5 ± 3.4 years). For each scapula, 5 GBL models were created with known levels of GBL (5%-30%) in the anteroinferior glenoid rim. Ground-truth GBL was determined using the glenoid fossa edge and best-fit circle of the anteroinferior edge. Six blinded reviewers with varying expertise measured GBL for 20 randomized models using 3 different best-fit circle methods (missing area, ratio, and diameter). Accuracy was assessed by root mean square error and obtained by comparing measured and ground truth for bone loss for each model. Interrater reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) with a 2-way random-effects model with consistency.

Results

On average, the missing area method overestimated GBL by 1%, while the ratio method and diameter method overestimated GBL by 2.4% and 6.3%, respectively. The interrater reliabilities of the missing area (ICC, 0.89), ratio (ICC, 0.91), and diameter (ICC, 0.90) methods were good, excellent, and good, respectively. For all reviewers, the overall root mean square error of the missing area method (3.6%) was better than that of the ratio (5%) and diameter (7.9%) methods. When stratifying reviewer accuracy by level of training, the missing area method remained superior at all levels when compared with the ratio and diameter methods (attending [3.1% vs 3.8% and 8.9%], fellow [4.2% vs 6.3% and 8.4%], and resident [3.5% vs 4.6% and 6.3%]).

Conclusion

The best-fit circle missing area method was reliable and more accurate at measuring GBL than the other methods. This held true at all levels of surgical experience (resident, fellow, and attending).

Clinical Relevance

The best-fit circle missing area method is accurate, has good reliability, and is simple. This can enhance preoperative planning for shoulder surgeons.

### Self-assembly of tetravalent goldberg polyhedra from 144 small components [^742e87c5]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

Rational control of the self-assembly of large structures is one of the key challenges in chemistry, and is believed to become increasingly difficult and ultimately impossible as the number of components involved increases. So far, it has not been possible to design a self-assembled discrete molecule made up of more than 100 components. Such molecules-for example, spherical virus capsids-are prevalent in nature, which suggests that the difficulty in designing these very large self-assembled molecules is due to a lack of understanding of the underlying design principles. For example, the targeted assembly of a series of large spherical structures containing up to 30 palladium ions coordinated by up to 60 bent organic ligands was achieved by considering their topologies. Here we report the self-assembly of a spherical structure that also contains 30 palladium ions and 60 bent ligands, but belongs to a shape family that has not previously been observed experimentally. The new structure consists of a combination of 8 triangles and 24 squares, and has the symmetry of a tetravalent Goldberg polyhedron. Platonic and Archimedean solids have previously been prepared through self-assembly, as have trivalent Goldberg polyhedra, which occur naturally in the form of virus capsids and fullerenes. But tetravalent Goldberg polyhedra have not previously been reported at the molecular level, although their topologies have been predicted using graph theory. We use graph theory to predict the self-assembly of even larger tetravalent Goldberg polyhedra, which should be more stable, enabling another member of this polyhedron family to be assembled from 144 components: 48 palladium ions and 96 bent ligands.

Airway comparative analysis — matching strategies and considerations: Table 5 outlines selection criteria including anatomical property via designation of "Terminal bronchiole", branching hierarchy by "Designating a generation number for each airway", distance from a landmark using "Path distance (e.g., 5 cm from carina or pleura)", airway dimension via "Lumen size (e.g., 2-mm-diameter airways)", and airways of a stipulated inner perimeter using "Wall thickness of airways with inner perimeter of 10 mm (Pi10)". Considerations note that "Pathology may alter airway status", "There are anatomical variations in branching pattern; certain nomenclature systems do not cover the entire airway tree", and there is "Risk of bias when pathology alters airway dimension (e.g. COPD may narrow airway lumens; therefore, 2-mm airways may occur at a different generation compared with subjects without COPD)", and "Regression assumptions should be confirmed in the condition(s) under study; potential effects of outliers on regression equation should be assessed"; definitions specify "PiX = predicted wall thickness of airways with inner perimeter of X" and "Pi10 = predicted wall thickness of airways with inner perimeter of 10 mm".

### Anal and perianal reconstruction after extramammary Paget's disease using a posterior thigh flap with a thin square wing [^fe4f43e2]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Extramammary Paget's disease regularly requires a wide resection of skin, often including the anal tract. When reconstructing the anal tract, simulating natural anatomy by creating the thinnest possible flap is essential to prevent incontinence. We reconstructed the anal and perianal area using a posterior thigh trilobed flap. The lobe to be transposed to the anal duct had a square design and was thinned. The other lobes were used to cover perianal defects and the flap donor site. Using this method, we reconstructed three patients who required large perianal area and anal tract resections. All flaps took well, and after the initial healing process, the patients did not develop lasting incontinence. We conclude that the posterior thigh flap with a thin square wing is useful for reconstruction of the anal tract and perianal area.

### Intraperitoneal, but not retroperitoneal, visceral adipose tissue is associated with diabetes mellitus: a cross-sectional, retrospective pilot analysis [^2c2d3aef]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with adverse outcomes, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT), classified into intraperitoneal VAT (IVAT) and retroperitoneal VAT (RVAT), is associated with insulin resistance. This study aimed to evaluate the association of IVAT and RVAT with the prevalence or incidence of DM.

Methods

In this cross-sectional, retrospective, cohort study, the prevalence and incidence of DM was analyzed in 803 and 624 middle-aged Japanese participants, respectively. The cross-sectional area of the abdominal adipose tissue was evaluated from an unenhanced computed tomography scan at the third lumbar vertebrae, and the IVAT or RVAT was analyzed using specialized software. The areas were normalized for the square value of the participants' height in meters and described as the IVAT or RVAT area index.

Results

The IVAT area index (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.02–1.07, per 1.0 cm 2 /m 2) or IVAT/RVAT area ratio (1.89; 1.23–2.85, per 1.0) was independently associated with the prevalence of DM, whereas the RVAT area index was not. During a follow-up (mean) of 3.7 years, 30 participants were diagnosed with DM. The IVAT area index (adjusted hazards ratio [HR], 1.02; 95% CI 1.003–1.04, per 1.0 cm 2 /m 2) or IVAT/RVAT area ratio (2.25; 1.40–3.43, per 1.0) was independently associated with the incidence of DM, whereas the RVAT area index was not.

Conclusions

IVAT, but not RVAT, is associated with the prevalence or incidence of DM.

### Solu-medrol (r) methylprednisolone sodium succinat [^c26fe88c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Dosage may be reduced for infants and children but should be governed more by the severity of the condition and response of the patient than by age or size. It should not be less than 0.5 mg per kg every 24 hours.

Dosage must be decreased or discontinued gradually when the drug has been administered for more than a few days. If a period of spontaneous remission occurs in a chronic condition, treatment should be discontinued. Routine laboratory studies, such as urinalysis, two-hour postprandial blood sugar, determination of blood pressure and body weight, and a chest X-ray should be made at regular intervals during prolonged therapy. Upper GI X-rays are desirable in patients with an ulcer history or significant dyspepsia.

In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective (see PRECAUTIONS, Neurologic-psychiatric).

For the purpose of comparison, the following is the equivalent milligram dosage of the various glucocorticoids:

These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered.

### A general method for the creation of dilational surfaces [^6025b588]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Dilational structures can change in size without changing their shape. Current dilational designs are only suitable for specific shapes or curvatures and often require parts of the structure to move perpendicular to the dilational surface, thereby occupying part of the enclosed volume. Here, we present a general method for creating dilational structures from arbitrary surfaces (2-manifolds with or without boundary), where all motions are tangent to the described surface. The method consists of triangulating the target curved surface and replacing each of the triangular faces by pantograph mechanisms according to a tiling algorithm that avoids collisions between neighboring pantographs. Following this algorithm, any surface can be made to mechanically dilate and could, theoretically, scale from the fully expanded configuration down to a single point. We illustrate the method with three examples of increasing complexity and varying Gaussian curvature.

### Determination of the two-dimensional distributions of gold nanorods by multiwavelength analytical ultracentrifugation [^b6c1624d]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Properties of nanoparticles are influenced by various parameters like size, shape or composition. Comprehensive high throughput characterization techniques are urgently needed to improve synthesis, scale up to production and make way for new applications of multidimensional particulate systems. In this study, we present a method for measuring two-dimensional size distributions of plasmonic nanorods in a single experiment. Analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a multiwavelength extinction detector is used to record the optical and sedimentation properties of gold nanorods simultaneously. A combination of sedimentation and extinction properties, both depending on diameter and length of the dispersed nanorods, is used to measure two-dimensional distributions of gold nanorod samples. The length, diameter, aspect ratio, volume, surface and cross-sectional distributions can be readily obtained from these results. As the technique can be extended to other non-spherical plasmonic particles and can be used for determining relative amounts of particles of different shapes it provides complete and quantitative insights into particulate systems.

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^d6cf3a30]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Simulations with Simplified Lesion Geometries and Growth Fields

Figure 2 illustrates a hierarchy of simplified, simulated lesion geometries and growths whose rows are arranged according to focality and whose columns are arranged according to a subjective complexity of lesion geometry and growth pattern. All lesions of Figure 2 were constructed to correspond to Δ t = 1 year follow-up intervals to have equal baseline areas of A (t b) = 6 mm 2 and to have equal length-type growth rates of Λ = 0.1 mm/year, the latter of which approximately corresponds to the reported mean of the 1-year perimeter adjusted growth rates of the AREDS dataset. Mathematical specifications of the lesion geometries and growth fields are given in Appendix 5. Using the terminology of Table 1, configurations 1 through 3 represent a progression of geometric complexity, moving from a circle (configuration 1) to an ellipse (configuration 2) to a notched shape (configuration 3). Relevant to growth rate estimation, configurations 1 and 2 both are convex shapes, and therefore isotropic growth never results in intrafocus merging (Appendix 3); however, configuration 2 is noncircular (i.e. has a circularity index of < 1), and therefore results in errors when assessed using square-root-transformed metrics (equation 2). Configuration 3 has a nonconvex geometry, and therefore, lesion growth can lead to intrafocus merging, which has the effect of censoring GA growth, making growth estimation ill-posed for any metric (Appendix 3). Compared with configurations 1 through 3, configuration 4 corresponds to an anisotropic growth field, which causes the baseline circular lesion to grow into a more complex, nonconvex geometry. In the second row, although the baseline lesion shapes are all circular, bifocality results in estimation errors when using square-root-transformed metrics (equation 3). Configurations 5 and 6 correspond to different distributions of lesion area between the foci. Configuration 7 corresponds to an anisotropic growth field, constructed so that the lesion growth rate of each lesion focus is constant, but with the rate of the top left lesion being half that of the bottom right lesion. Finally, unlike configurations 5 through 7, configuration 8 involves merging of the 2 lesion foci (i.e. interfoci merging). Evaluations of metric accuracy were performed by scaling the growth fields (but not the baseline lesion geometries) so as to vary Λ through a range of 0.05 to 0.7 mm/year (Appendix 5).

Drinking patterns and risks of liver diseases among current regular drinkers

Among male current regular drinkers, drinking daily and HED were each associated with increased risks of total and major chronic liver diseases, but the associations were greatly attenuated after adjusting for total alcohol consumption (Fig. 3 A, B). Given the amount of alcohol consumed, drinking daily was significantly associated with increased risks of ALD (2.15, 1.40–3.31) and total liver disease (1.17, 1.03–1.33), while HED was associated with increased risk of ALD (1.69, 1.20–2.39). When examined across strata of weekly intake level, drinking daily remained associated with higher risks for ALD and total liver disease, although non-significant after further adjustment for total alcohol intake within strata (Additional file 1: Table S8), but there were no clear associations between HED and ALD (Additional file 1: Table S9).

### Building block aspect ratio controls assembly, architecture, and mechanics of synthetic and natural protein networks [^10a4f140]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Transition in network topology

We have shown that as the building block increases in AR, the assembly of the hydrogel network shifts from being dominated by translational diffusion (i.e. building blocks must translate in space in order to collide and form cross-links) to being dominated by rotational diffusion (i.e. building blocks can collide and cross-link only via rotation about their centre of mass). To investigate the structural changes due to the restriction of free rotation of high AR building blocks when AR > AR c, we use SANS to probe the network structure of pL hydrogels (Fig. 2).

Aortic stenosis — Doppler measurements and velocity ratio: The key measurements for clinical decision-making in patients with AS are the maximum aortic velocity, mean pressure gradient (calculated with the Bernoulli equation), and valve area (calculated with the continuity equation). An additional measurement that may be useful is the ratio of the velocity in the LV outflow tract proximal to the aortic valve and the velocity in the narrowed aortic orifice; the outflow tract–to–aortic velocity ratio is independent of body size and eliminates potential errors related to LV outflow tract diameter or area. A normal ratio is close to 1.0, whereas a ratio of ≤ 0.25 corresponds to a valve area 25% of normal for that patient, which is consistent with severe AS.
