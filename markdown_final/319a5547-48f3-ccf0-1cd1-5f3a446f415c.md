## Question

Diagnostic studies for dizziness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnostic studies for dizziness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify dizziness syndromes and why the old "type" paradigm fails. Then, I should verify which bedside tests are first-line and how accurate they are. Next, I will examine when imaging is indicated and which modality to choose. After that, I need to check which vestibular function tests add value and when they are unnecessary. Finally, I will integrate special populations, safety netting, and a practical algorithm, while continuously checking the strength of evidence and correcting any misstatements I might make along the way.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework, because everything hinges on it. The outdated approach that tries to categorize dizziness by subjective "type" (vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium, lightheadedness) is unreliable and not predictive of etiology; instead, the modern, evidence-based approach uses Timing, Triggers, and a Targeted Examination (TiTrATE) to classify patients into acute vestibular syndrome, spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome, or triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, which drives both the differential and the testing strategy [^7f9000ae] [^470ee741] [^733a7d57].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line bedside tests and their performance. For acute vestibular syndrome, HINTS (head impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) performed by trained clinicians has high sensitivity and reasonable specificity for detecting a central cause, with pooled estimates around 94% sensitivity and 87% specificity, and HINTS Plus adds bedside hearing assessment to improve detection of posterior circulation stroke. Importantly, HINTS can outperform early MRI for ruling out stroke in the first 24–48 hours, so I should not jump to imaging before completing HINTS when a trained examiner is available [^afa8aa2e] [^9b8a75f1] [^c75ddab1]. For triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver is the criterion standard for posterior canal BPPV, and the supine roll test detects lateral canal BPPV; I should confirm that repeating the maneuver on the other side is advised if the first is negative, and I need to remember that a positive Dix-Hallpike rules in BPPV, but a negative test does not rule in a central cause [^d1fe65a9] [^7f118857] [^8d860aff].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging. I should double-check when it is actually indicated. Routine CT or MRI is not recommended for isolated dizziness without red flags, and CT has very low sensitivity for acute stroke in this population, so a negative CT cannot exclude a central cause. MRI is far more sensitive but still misses a meaningful minority early after onset, so imaging should be reserved for central or equivocal HINTS findings, focal neurologic deficits, concern for posterior circulation TIA, or atypical presentations, rather than used as a blanket screen [^a19baf1d] [^3f99685c] [^f44714c1]. I should confirm that DWI-only MRI protocols are used more often but have lower diagnostic yield than full stroke-protocol MRI, reinforcing the need to match imaging to pretest probability and protocol quality [^59055995].

> Let me consider vestibular function testing carefully, because I need to ensure I do not over-order low-yield tests. Routine vestibular testing is not recommended for straightforward BPPV diagnosed clinically, as it rarely changes management and can delay care; however, in complex, recurrent, or unclear cases, targeted tests such as videonystagmography, video head impulse testing, rotary chair, and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials can help distinguish peripheral from central etiologies and characterize vestibular hypofunction, with VEMPs offering particular value in suspected superior semicircular canal dehiscence or Ménière disease, though evidence strength varies by indication [^384d7d5d] [^5907f865] [^7dd6a107] [^621185a5]. I should confirm that cervical VEMP is not recommended for BPPV diagnosis, to avoid misapplication [^e7c12fbd].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In older adults, dizziness is often multifactorial and cardiovascular contributors are common, so I need to check for orthostatic hypotension, polypharmacy, and gait instability, and I should screen for falls risk when BPPV is present because BPPV confers a markedly increased falls risk in the elderly [^e59bf6d7] [^579d4a2b] [^fbd374c3]. In children, sophisticated vestibular testing is less available, so bedside screening and referral patterns differ, and audiologists should follow pediatric consensus statements for assessment pathways [^94fb4f73]. In suspected vertebrobasilar insufficiency with vertigo on head turning, cervical vascular imaging may be warranted to evaluate dynamic compression, but I should confirm that this is a niche indication rather than routine [^1dcf80e6].

> I will now examine safety netting and follow-up, because missing a central cause is the key risk. If HINTS is not available or is equivocal, or if the patient has high-risk features or persistent symptoms, I should arrange timely MRI or neurologic consultation rather than discharging with a vague diagnosis; conversely, if BPPV is confirmed and symptoms resolve with canalith repositioning, discharge with return precautions and vestibular rehabilitation referral is appropriate, and I should advise on positional precautions and falls prevention as indicated [^f44714c1] [^a2f84189] [^579d4a2b]. But wait, what if the patient presents with spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome and TIA is on the table? In that scenario, vascular imaging such as CTA or MRA may be reasonable when clinical suspicion is moderate to high, balancing yield and pretest probability [^55b911fa].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. Start with TiTrATE to classify the syndrome; if acute vestibular syndrome, perform HINTS and HINTS Plus when feasible; if central or equivocal, obtain stroke-protocol MRI with DWI and MRA; if peripheral, treat and arrange follow-up. If triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, perform Dix-Hallpike and supine roll testing; if positive, treat BPPV and avoid imaging; if negative or atypical, reconsider the differential and escalate evaluation. If spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome, assess for vestibular migraine versus TIA using associated symptoms and vascular risk, and consider vascular imaging when TIA risk is concerning. Throughout, avoid routine CT or MRI in low-risk, typical presentations and reserve imaging for those with red flags or persistent diagnostic uncertainty [^470ee741] [^a19baf1d] [^f44714c1] [^9e245ace].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought CT might be reasonable as a first-line screen to exclude hemorrhage, but I should correct that. Noncontrast CT has very low sensitivity for acute ischemic stroke in this population and a negative CT cannot safely exclude a central cause, so relying on CT alone risks false reassurance; MRI is the modality of choice when imaging is indicated, and early MRI can still miss a minority of strokes, which is why HINTS remains pivotal in the first 24–48 hours [^3f99685c] [^f44714c1].

> Finally, I need to ensure I address system-level issues that drive overtesting. Overuse of CT and MRI in low-yield scenarios contributes to costs and length of stay without improving diagnostic yield, and geographic variation in vestibular testing reflects a lack of consensus; aligning practice with TiTrATE, HINTS, and guideline-directed imaging thresholds can reduce low-value care while maintaining safety [^d09ed8fc] [^2c177a6e] [^470ee741].

Diagnostic evaluation of dizziness relies on a **targeted history and exam** [^4f91cf15] to classify symptoms by timing, triggers, and associated features, which guides testing [^733a7d57]. Most patients do not need labs or imaging [^4f91cf15]; **routine labs are low-yield** [^6be7b140] and should be reserved for specific indications (e.g. suspected cardiac, metabolic, or medication causes) [^daee1707]. Imaging is not routine [^4f91cf15]; **MRI is preferred** when central causes are suspected (e.g. stroke, tumor) [^afc8d454] [^3f99685c], whereas CT is reserved for acute hemorrhage or when MRI is unavailable [^notfound]. For peripheral vestibular disorders, use Dix-Hallpike [^d1fe65a9] and HINTS [^9b8a75f1] at the bedside; vestibular testing (VNG, vHIT, VEMPs) is reserved for persistent or unclear cases [^7dd6a107]. Avoid low-value tests (e.g. routine CT for nonfocal dizziness) [^a19baf1d] and tailor testing to the clinical picture to improve diagnostic yield and reduce unnecessary costs [^59055995].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A thorough **clinical history and physical examination** are the cornerstone of dizziness evaluation [^4f91cf15]. The history should focus on the following:

- **Timing**: Acute (seconds to minutes), episodic (minutes to hours), or chronic (days to weeks).
- **Triggers**: Positional changes, head movements, anxiety, or spontaneous onset.
- **Associated symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, hearing loss, tinnitus, focal neurological deficits, or chest pain.
- **Medication use**: Antihypertensives, sedatives, antidepressants, or anticonvulsants.

The physical examination should include:

- **Vital signs**: Orthostatic blood pressure measurements [^4f91cf15].
- **Neurological examination**: Cranial nerves, coordination, gait, and Romberg test [^e97b4b1a].
- **Oculomotor examination**: Nystagmus assessment, head impulse test, and Dix-Hallpike maneuver [^9b8a75f1] [^d1fe65a9].

---

## Laboratory tests

Routine laboratory testing is generally **not recommended** for patients with dizziness unless specific clinical indications are present [^4f91cf15]. Laboratory tests may be considered in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical indication** | **Recommended laboratory tests** |
|-|-|
| Suspected cardiac arrhythmia or ischemia | Electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac enzymes (troponin, CK-MB) [^daee1707] |
| Suspected metabolic disturbance | Basic metabolic panel (BMP), glucose, thyroid function tests [^6be7b140] |
| Suspected medication-induced dizziness | Drug levels (e.g. digoxin, anticonvulsants) [^notfound] |
| Suspected infection or inflammation | Complete blood count (CBC), inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) [^notfound] |

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging studies are **not routinely indicated** for dizziness evaluation [^4f91cf15]. They are reserved for specific clinical scenarios where central nervous system (CNS) pathology is suspected:

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Preferred modality when central causes are suspected (e.g. stroke, tumor, multiple sclerosis) [^afc8d454] [^3f99685c].
- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Reserved for acute settings when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, particularly to exclude hemorrhage [^notfound].
- **Vascular imaging (CTA/MRA)**: Considered when vertebrobasilar insufficiency or carotid artery disease is suspected [^55b911fa] [^1dcf80e6].

---

## Vestibular function tests

Vestibular function tests are indicated for patients with persistent or unclear dizziness, particularly when peripheral vestibular disorders are suspected [^7dd6a107]. Commonly used tests include:

- **Videonystagmography (VNG)**: Assesses spontaneous and induced nystagmus, helping differentiate peripheral from central causes [^notfound].
- **Video head impulse test (vHIT)**: Evaluates vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) function, useful in diagnosing vestibular neuritis and superior semicircular canal dehiscence [^notfound].
- **Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs)**: Useful in diagnosing superior semicircular canal dehiscence and other otolithic disorders [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic algorithms

Several diagnostic algorithms have been developed to guide clinicians in evaluating dizziness. The **TiTrATE algorithm** (Timing, Triggers, And Targeted Examination) is widely recommended and emphasizes a structured approach to history, physical examination, and targeted testing [^733a7d57] [^470ee741]. The **HINTS examination** (Head Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew) is particularly useful in acute vestibular syndrome to differentiate peripheral from central causes [^9b8a75f1] [^afa8aa2e].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite the availability of diagnostic tools and guidelines, several challenges persist in the evaluation of dizziness:

- **Subjectivity**: Patient descriptions of dizziness are often vague and inconsistent, complicating diagnosis [^3b005678].
- **Overlap**: Symptoms of peripheral and central vestibular disorders often overlap, making differentiation difficult [^13752ed0].
- **Resource utilization**: Overuse of imaging and laboratory tests contributes to increased healthcare costs without significant diagnostic yield [^d09ed8fc] [^59055995].

---

Diagnostic evaluation of dizziness requires a **structured approach** [^733a7d57], beginning with a thorough clinical history and physical examination, followed by targeted laboratory and imaging studies when indicated. Vestibular function tests are reserved for persistent or unclear cases. This approach improves diagnostic accuracy, reduces unnecessary testing, and enhances patient outcomes.

A significant number of individuals are affected by symptoms of dizziness. It is the most common complaint among patients over 75 years of age. A large number of these patients seek counsel from their physicians. It is imperative for the evaluating physician to obtain a thorough history and perform a complete physical exam. The proper diagnostic studies must also be obtained to confirm or rule out particular diagnoses. The physician should never assume that the dizziness is the result of normal aging prior to ruling out pathologic conditions.

### Diagnostic yield of MRI in adult patients with dizziness or vertigo at the emergency department: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^59055995]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Dizziness and vertigo are common in the emergency department, often requiring an MRI to detect central causes. However, utilization varies widely. This systematic review and meta-analysis quantify the diagnostic yield and utilization rate of MRI in adult emergency department patients and assess the impact of clinical setting, patient selection, and imaging protocols.

Materials and Methods

A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library (until June 9, 2025) identified studies evaluating MRI in adult emergency department patients with dizziness or vertigo. Study quality was assessed using QUADAS-2. Pooled proportions were calculated via random-effects meta-analysis, with subgroup analyses for patient selection, exclusion of peripheral vertigo, and MRI protocols.

Results

Seventeen studies, including 42,994 patients, were analyzed. The mean age across studies ranged from 47.3 to 65.1 years, with an overall male proportion of 39.8% (17,121 men). The pooled MRI diagnostic yield was 13.1% (95% CI: 8.3–20.2), and MRI utilization was 23.2% (95% CI: 14.0–33.9). Isolated dizziness had a lower yield (5.7% vs 17.8%; p < 0.01). Excluding peripheral vertigo increased MRI use (30.1% vs 21.0%; p = 0.043) but did not improve yield (14.4% vs 11.4%; p = 0.32). DWI-only protocols had lower yield (4.3% vs 13.6%; p = 0.03) but higher utilization (71.5% vs 23.2%; p < 0.01).

Conclusion

MRI was used in 23.2% of emergency department patients, with a 13.1% diagnostic yield. DWI-only protocols improve access but miss key findings. Optimizing imaging strategies can enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

Key Points

Question What is the diagnostic yield of MRI in adult emergency patients with dizziness or vertigo, and how do selection criteria and imaging protocols affect outcomes? Findings MRI diagnostic yield was 13.1% (utilization: 23.2%). DWI-only protocols were used more often (71.5%) but showed lower yield (4.3%). Yield for isolated dizziness was 5.7%. Clinical relevance While MRI is efficient for detecting central causes of dizziness, its yield is low in cases of isolated dizziness without neurological signs. Comprehensive clinical judgment and optimized protocols are essential to prevent unnecessary imaging in the emergency setting.

### Central etiologies… [^daee1707]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

General Approach Questions regarding the timing and triggers that provoke dizziness can categorize the dizziness as more likely to be peripheral or central in etiology. Findings from the physical examination can help confirm a probable diagnosis. A diagnostic algorithm can help determine whether the etiology is peripheral or central. TITRATE THE EVALUATION TiTrATE is a novel diagnostic approach to determining the probable etiology of dizziness or vertigo. 2 The approach uses the Timing of the symptom, the Triggers that provoke the symptom, And a Targeted Examination. The responses place the dizziness into one of three clinical scenarios: episodic triggered, spontaneous episodic, or continuous vestibular.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Findings from the physical examination — including a cardiac and neurologic assessment, with attention to the head, eye, ear, nose, and throat examination — are usually normal in patients presenting with dizziness. Blood pressure should be measured while the patient is standing and in the supine position. The patient's gait should be observed and a Romberg test performed. Patients with an unsteady gait should be assessed for peripheral neuropathy. 18 A positive Romberg test suggests an abnormality with proprioception receptors or their pathway. The use of the HINTS examination can help distinguish a possible stroke from acute vestibular syndrome. Test of Skew. Test of skew is assessed by asking the patient to look straight ahead, then cover and uncover each eye. Vertical deviation of the covered eye after uncovering is an abnormal result.

Although this is a less sensitive test for central pathology, an abnormal result is fairly specific for brainstem involvement. BPPV is diagnosed with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. LABORATORY TESTING AND IMAGING Most patients presenting with dizziness do not require laboratory testing. Patients with chronic medical conditions may require blood glucose and electrolyte measurements. Patients with symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease should undergo electrocardiography, Holter monitoring, and possibly carotid Doppler testing. However, in a summary analysis of multiple studies that included 4, 538 patients, only 26 had a laboratory result that explained their dizziness.

### Dizziness: state of the science [^bf3d6274]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Dizziness is prevalent in all adult populations, causing considerable morbidity and utilization of health services. In the community, the prevalence of dizziness ranges from 1.8% in young adults to more than 30% in the elderly. In the primary care setting, dizziness increases in frequency as a presenting complaint; as many as 7% of elderly patients present with this symptom. Classification of dizziness by subtype (vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium, and other) assists in the differential diagnosis. Various disease entities may cause dizziness, and the reported frequency of specific diagnoses varies widely, depending on setting, patient age, and investigator bias. Life-threatening illnesses are rare in patients with dizziness, but many have serious functional impairment. Dizziness can be difficult to diagnose, particularly in elderly persons, in whom it often represents dysfunction in more than one body system. Given the relatively underdeveloped state of the empirical literature on dizziness, investigators would benefit from use of consistent criteria to describe dizziness symptoms and establish diagnoses. Investigation of the effects of testing and treatment should focus on diagnoses that are life threatening or lead to significant morbidity. In the elderly, a function-oriented approach should be studied and compared with current diagnosis-focused strategies. Alternative therapies for chronic and recurrent dizziness also merit investigation.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® dizziness and ataxia: 2023 update [^3b005678]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic evaluation of a patient with dizziness or vertigo is complicated by a lack of standardized nomenclature, significant overlap in symptom descriptions, and the subjective nature of the patient's symptoms. Although dizziness is an imprecise term often used by patients to describe a feeling of being off-balance, in many cases dizziness can be subcategorized based on symptomatology as vertigo (false sense of motion or spinning), disequilibrium (imbalance with gait instability), presyncope (nearly fainting or blacking out), or lightheadedness (nonspecific). As such, current diagnostic paradigms focus on timing, triggers, and associated symptoms rather than subjective descriptions of dizziness type. Regardless, these factors complicate the selection of appropriate diagnostic imaging in patients presenting with dizziness or vertigo. This document serves to aid providers in this selection by using a framework of definable clinical variants. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Health care utilization, prognosis and outcomes of vestibular disease in primary care settings: systematic review [^e47c3570]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Vertigo and dizziness are frequent complaints in primary care that lead to extensive health care utilization. The objective of this systematic review was to examine health care of patients with vertigo and dizziness in primary care settings. Specifically, we wanted to characterize health care utilization, therapeutic and referral behaviour and to examine the outcomes associated with this. A search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was carried out in May 2015 using the search terms 'vertigo' or 'dizziness' or 'vestibular and primary care' to identify suitable studies. We included all studies that were published in the last 10 years in English with the primary diagnoses of vertigo, dizziness and/or vestibular disease. We excluded drug evaluation studies and reports of adverse drug reactions. Data were extracted and appraised by two independent reviewers; 16 studies with a total of 2828 patients were included. Mean age of patients ranged from 45 to 79 with five studies in older adults aged 65 or older. There were considerable variations in diagnostic criteria, referral and therapy while the included studies failed to show significant improvement of patient-reported outcomes. Studies are needed to investigate current practice of care across countries and health systems in a systematic way and to test primary care-based education and training interventions that improve outcomes.

### Evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of the head-impulse test: a scoping review [^77a7ebd6]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Vestibular symptoms rank among the most common complaints in medicine worldwide. Underlying disorders manifested by these symptoms are generally associated with an impairment of the vestibular-ocular reflex and can be assessed with different diagnostic procedures. In recent years, an increasing number of diagnostic test accuracy studies comparing various head-impulse test (HIT) methods with other diagnostic procedures have been published but not systematically reviewed.

Objective

To conduct a scoping review and describe key characteristics of the growing number of diagnostic studies in patients presenting with vestibular symptoms.

Evidence Review

In April 2017, published studies were identified through searches of 4 bibliographic databases: Medline, Science Citation Index Expanded, the Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect. Studies were included if they provided diagnostic accuracy data (sensitivity and specificity) for any HIT method with reference to any other vestibular test or clinical diagnosis in patients with vestibular symptoms. Study key characteristics were extracted, and the current literature was described narratively. All analysis took place between June 2017 and July 2018.

Findings

We identified a total of 27 diagnostic studies (including 3821 participants). There were disagreements between diagnostic test accuracy data both within and between studies when different HIT methods were compared with other diagnostic procedures. The proportion of correctly identified people having the disease (sensitivity) ranged between 0% and 100% (median, 41%), whereas the proportion of correctly identified people without the disease (specificity) was higher and ranged between 56% and 100% (median, 94%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Based on the studies included in this review, sensitivity, specificity, and, more importantly, the risk of misdiagnosis and associated undertreatment or overtreatment cannot be reliably estimated by HIT methods for patients with vestibular symptoms. We recommend that further diagnostic studies consider (1) multiple possible underlying causes of vestibular symptoms and multiple test thresholds, (2) a representative sample of patients with and without the disease, and (3) reporting guidelines for diagnostic test accuracy studies.

Diagnostic paradigm and terminology — the traditional diagnostic paradigm, developed 50 years ago, based on symptom quality and asking the patient "What do you mean by dizzy?", suggests basing the differential diagnosis and clinical evaluation on the patient's description, but this paradigm was never properly validated, has significant methodological flaws, and does not reliably predict underlying causes; the Barany Society has developed formal international consensus criteria, terminology, and definitions for many vestibular disorders, and the writing committee has tried to use terms aligned with these consensus definitions that make sense to frontline clinicians.

### Diagnostic work up and management of acute onset vertigo… [^271f70f5]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Phd thesis will be done including these 3 parts. STUDY 1 Effects of implementation of HINTS and v-HIT in an emergency department HYPOTHESIS Implementation of HINTS and v-HIT in the acute diagnostic workup for patients presenting with acute onset dizziness/vertigo at the ED, Hospital of South West Jutland, Denmark, along with the routine triage and acute MRI of the brain can reduce the number of un-/misdiagnosed cases to almost zero at the time of discharge from hospital. Two hundred patients are needed in both groups. METHODS Baseline population 1: The first part of this study reviews the patient's pathway from onset of vertigo/dizziness to final diagnosis by means of current management. Charts of all patients admitted to the ED, SVS, throughout 12 months due to acute onset dizziness/vertigo as the primary complaint are reviewed. Data is used for comparison with study population 1 undergoing intervention 1.

In addition, the baseline population are offered a cross sectional follow up visit at the ENT Department, SVS, in order to fill in DHI, as well as undergoing standard vestibular status with HINTS, v-HIT, VNG and posturography. A subgroup of baseline patients with assumed peripheral AVS at the time of the acute attack is appointed according to patient chart, actual history and vestibular status as baseline in study 2. Study population 1: is enrolled prospectively and represents all consecutive patients admitted with acute onset dizziness/vertigo as the primary complaint to the ED. The population undergoes intervention 1: HINTS and v-HIT performed acutely by a group of trained nurses in the ED. Furthermore, acute MRI and usual triage is performed. PRIMARY OUTCOMES Number of undiagnosed and misdiagnosed cases in the two populations is calculated at the time of discharge from ED.

Definitions: Undiagnosed: cases without specific ICD10 code explaining acute dizziness/vertigo. Misdiagnosed: cases in which the chart review reveals obviously wrong ICD10 codes/post-hospital examinations reveal the specific cause of dizziness/vertigo; or ENT-examination within 24 hours changes the primary diagnosis.

### Diagnostic accuracy of neuroimaging in emergency department patients with acute vertigo or dizziness: a systematic review and meta-analysis for the guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department [^3f99685c]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute vertigo or dizziness represent a diagnostic challenge. Neuroimaging has variable indications and yield. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic test accuracy of neuroimaging for patients presenting with acute vertigo or dizziness.

Methods

An electronic search was designed following patient-intervention-control-outcome (PICO) question-(P) adult patients with acute vertigo or dizziness presenting to the ED; (I) neuroimaging including computed tomography (CT), CT angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and ultrasound (US); (C) MRI/clinical criterion standard; and (O) central causes (stroke, hemorrhage, tumor, others) versus peripheral causes of symptoms. Articles were assessed in duplicate. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) was used to assess certainty of evidence in pooled estimates.

Results

We included studies that reported diagnostic test accuracy. From 6309 titles, 460 articles were retrieved, and 12 were included: noncontrast CT scan-six studies, 771 patients, pooled sensitivity 28.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 14.4%-48.5%, moderate certainty) and specificity 98.9% (95% CI 93.4%-99.8%, moderate certainty); MRI-five studies, 943 patients, sensitivity 79.8% (95% CI 71.4%-86.2%, high certainty) and specificity 98.8% (95% CI 96.2%-100%, high certainty); CTA-one study, 153 patients, sensitivity 14.3% (95% CI 1.8%-42.8%) and specificity 97.7% (95% CI 93.8%-99.6%), CT had higher sensitivity than CTA (21.4% and 14.3%) for central etiology; MRA-one study, 24 patients, sensitivity 60.0% (95% CI 26.2%-87.8%) and specificity 92.9% (95% CI 66.1%-99.8%); US-three studies, 258 patients, sensitivity ranged from 30% to 53.6%, specificity from 94.9% to 100%.

Conclusions

Noncontrast CT has very low sensitivity and MRI will miss approximately one in five patients with stroke if imaging is obtained early after symptom onset. The evidence does not support neuroimaging as the only tool for ruling out stroke and other central causes in patients with acute dizziness or vertigo presenting to the ED.

### Diagnosing vestibular hypofunction: an update [^d67e2095]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Unilateral or bilateral vestibular hypofunction presents most commonly with symptoms of dizziness or postural imbalance and affects a large population. However, it is often missed because no quantitative testing of vestibular function is performed, or misdiagnosed due to a lack of standardization of vestibular testing. Therefore, this article reviews the current status of the most frequently used vestibular tests for canal and otolith function. This information can also be used to reach a consensus about the systematic diagnosis of vestibular hypofunction.

### The munich diagnostic and predictor study of dizziness: objectives, design, and methods [^1813d58e]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

This report describes the objectives, design, and methods of the Munich Diagnostic and Predictor Study of Dizziness, a prospective study investigating diagnostic subgroups, correlates, and predictors of dizziness that is not sufficiently explained medically but clearly related to a psychiatric disorder. All patients presenting at the Integrated Centre for Research and Treatment of Vertigo, Balance and Ocular Motor Disorders at the University Hospital Großhadern in Munich, Germany, are investigated during their first-time visit. The study consists of a baseline and two follow-up assessment points at 6 and 12 months. At the baseline assessment point, all participants complete self-rated questionnaires concerning dizziness, depression, anxiety, dissociative and traumatic experiences, somatization, body sensations and perception, cognitions, attachment, personality, quality of life and experiences with the health care system. Additionally, a structured clinical interview is conducted to assess mental disorders. Then, the neurologists complete questionnaires regarding the subjective doctor-patient relationship and to document the somatic diagnoses and results. The follow-up measurements consist of self-rated questionnaires. This study aims to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients who suffer from dizziness related to a psychiatric disorder and who are often severely impaired in their working and daily lives.

### Etiologic distribution of dizziness / vertigo in a neurological outpatient clinic according to the criteria of the international classification of vestibular disorders: a single-center study [^0fbd993f]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

However, during the process of the diagnosis and treatment of vertigo, even if a diagnostic paradigm based on the determination of the lesion lateralization, localization, and nature of symptoms is adopted with the use of the existing vestibular evaluation techniques, it is still difficult to clarify whether the vestibular system is involved in a considerable number of patients. Moreover, the results from large-sample studies on the etiology of dizziness/vertigo vary widely, this may be related to the differences in disease severity among patients included in different studies, the level of diagnosis among hospitals of different levels, and the sample size. Given this background, this study aimed to determine the etiologic distribution of dizziness/vertigo in patients visiting the vertigo outpatient clinic of the neurology department of our hospital to validate and enrich the spectrum of dizziness/vertigo-related vestibular disorders based on the diagnostic framework as defined in the ICD-11. We hope to provide clinicians with a reference on the diagnosis and treatment of dizziness/vertigo.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dizziness and vertigo, more specifically with respect to Dix-Hallpike maneuver (AAO-HNSF), AAO-HNS 2017 guidelines recommend to perform the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45 degrees to one side and the neck extended 20 degrees with the affected ear down) to elicit provoked vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus for the diagnosis of posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Repeat the maneuver with the opposite ear down if the initial maneuver is negative.

### Comparing caloric and self-experienced dizziness symptoms: diagnostic value and implications in functional dizziness [^fb8e07f4]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Several limitations of the present study should be acknowledged. The study was designed to test the hypothesis that patients with peripheral vestibular disorders would perceive their most severe dizziness experiences as more similar to caloric stimulation than patients with nonperipheral dizziness. Sample size was determined based on a limited number of prespecified primary analyses, which constituted the confirmatory part of the study and clearly rejected the primary hypothesis. All subsequent analyses are exploratory, as they were not prespecified. Many of the observed effects were substantial and consistent. However, given the relatively small sample size, confirmatory analyses are necessary. The provided means and effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals may assist in planning such future studies. Larger samples with a broader representation of different vestibular disorders would allow for more refined and generalizable analyses, including direct comparisons with healthy individuals without a history of inner ear disease or dizziness. Future studies may also re-evaluate the symptom categories used here through factor analysis, which could require an expanded item set. In addition, the potential advantage of self-comparison ratings over separate assessments of dizziness and caloric symptoms warrants further investigation, especially with regard to simple and practical diagnostic applications. Increasing the number of scale points in the self-comparison measure could enhance comparability, while separating it from the caloric symptom ratings may facilitate independent use. Of note, a scenario not observed in our sample — but common in clinical practice and likely to occur with larger samples — is that of patients aborting caloric testing, e.g. due to vomiting. Such cases should be considered separately, as they may carry diagnostic value on their own and were not included in the present analysis.

In summary, the exploratory findings we consider most promising suggest that the assessment of caloric symptoms holds considerable potential — not only for diagnosing vestibular disorders, but also for advancing the pathophysiological understanding of dizziness symptoms, particularly in patients with functional dizziness. For both the development of a simple and practical diagnostic tool and the investigation of underlying mechanisms, caloric stimulation offers a key advantage: it is widely used in clinical routine, and symptom questionnaires can be easily integrated.

### A systematic review of the reported proportions of diagnoses for dizziness and vertigo [^ef168eb6]. Otology & Neurotology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the typical proportions of diagnoses for patients presenting with dizziness or vertigo based on clinical speciality and to assess the change in proportions of diagnoses over time.

Data Sources

Following PRISMA guidelines, systematic searches of PubMed and CINAHL databases and follow-up reference searches were performed for articles published in English up to October 2016.

Study Selection

Analysis of searches yielded 42 studies meeting the criteria of case series of adult patients with dizziness and/or vertigo presenting to general practice, emergency departments or specialist outpatient clinics.

Data Extraction

Data comprising demographics, diagnostic cases, and the total number of cases were recorded and independently tested, followed by a risk of bias analysis.

Data Synthesis

Sample size weighted proportions expressed as percentages with confidence intervals were calculated and compared using χ analysis and a reference proportion formed by the combination of Ear Nose and Throat and Neurotology case series published between 2010 and 2016. Analysis of diagnostic trends over time used Poisson regression with consideration for overdispersion.

Conclusions

This systematic review of case series demonstrated significant differences in the proportions of diagnoses for patients presenting with dizziness or vertigo, depending on the specialty making the diagnosis. ENT proportions were dominated by BPPV, Psychogenic and Menière's disease diagnostic categories, whereas emergency proportions were dominated by Other, Cardiac, and Neurological categories. Analysis of case series proportions over time revealed increases in diagnoses such as Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo and Vestibular Migraine, and a corresponding decrease in the diagnoses of Menière's disease.

### Head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew examination for diagnosing central causes of acute vestibular syndrome [^afa8aa2e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Dizziness is a common reason for people to seek medical care. Acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is a specific type of dizziness, which can include severe vertigo, nausea and vomiting, nystagmus, or unsteadiness. Acute vestibular syndrome can be due to peripheral or central causes. It is important to determine the cause, as the intervention and outcomes differ if it is from a peripheral or central cause. Clinicians can assess for the cause using risk factors, patient history, examination findings, or advanced imaging, such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The head impulse, nystagmus, test of skew (HINTS) examination is a three-part examination performed by clinicians to determine if AVS is due to a peripheral or central cause. This includes assessing how the eyes move in response to rapidly turning a person's head (head impulse), assessing the direction of involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and assessing whether the eyes are aligned or misaligned (test of skew). The HINTS Plus examination includes an additional assessment of auditory function.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations, with or without video assistance, for identifying a central etiology for AVS.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, the International HTA database, and two trials registers to September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included all retrospective and prospective diagnostic test accuracy studies that evaluated the HINTS or HINTS Plus test used in a primary care clinic, an urgent care clinic, the emergency department, or during inpatient hospitalization against a final diagnosis of a central etiology of AVS, as defined by the reference standard of advanced imaging or final diagnosis by a neurologist.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently determined eligibility of each study according to eligibility criteria, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias, and determined the certainty of evidence. Disagreements were adjudicated by consensus or a third review author if needed. The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for identifying a central etiology for AVS, conducted clinically (clinician visual assessment) or with video assistance (e.g. video recording with goggles); we independently assessed the clinical and video-assisted examinations. Subgroup analyses were performed by provider type (e.g. physicians, non-physicians), time from symptom onset to presentation (e.g. less than 24 hours, longer than 24 hours), reference standard (e.g. advanced imaging, discharge diagnosis), underlying etiology (e.g. ischemic stroke, alternative etiologies [hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial mass]), study setting (e.g. outpatient [outpatient clinic, urgent care clinic, emergency department], inpatient), physician level of training (e.g. resident, fellow/attending), physician specialty (e.g. otolaryngology, emergency medicine, neurology, and neurologic subspecialist [e.g. neuro-ophthalmology, neuro-otology]), and individual diagnostic accuracy of each component of the examination (e.g. head impulse, direction-changing nystagmus, test of skew). We created 2 x 2 tables of the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives and used these data to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 16 studies with a total of 2024 participants (981 women and 1043 men) with a mean age of 60 years. Twelve studies assessed the HINTS examination; five assessed the HINTS Plus examination. Thirteen studies were performed in the emergency department; half were performed by neurologists. The clinical HINTS examination (12 studies, 1890 participants) was 94.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82.0% to 98.2%) sensitive, and 86.9% (95% CI 75.3% to 93.6%) specific (low-certainty evidence). The video-assisted HINTS examination (3 studies, 199 participants) was 85.0% to 100% sensitive (low-certainty evidence), and 38.9% to 100% specific (very low-certainty evidence). The clinical HINTS Plus examination (5 studies, 451 participants) was 95.3% (95% CI 78.4% to 99.1%) sensitive, and 72.9% (95% CI 44.4% to 90.1%) specific (low-certainty evidence). The video-assisted HINTS Plus examination (2 studies, 163 participants) was 85.0% to 93.8% sensitive, and 28.6% to 38.9% specific (moderate-certainty evidence). Subgroup analyses were limited, as most studies were conducted in the emergency department, by physicians, and with MRI as a reference standard. Time from symptom onset to presentation varied across studies. Three studies were at high risk of bias and three studies were at unclear risk of bias for participant selection. Three studies were at unclear risk of bias for the index test. Four studies were at unclear risk of bias for the reference standard. Two studies were at unclear risk of bias for flow and timing. One study had unclear applicability concerns for participant selection. Two studies had high applicability concerns for the index test and two studies had unclear applicability concerns for the index test. No studies had applicability concerns for the reference standard.

Authors' Conclusions

The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations had good sensitivity and reasonable specificity for diagnosing a central cause for AVS in the emergency department when performed by trained clinicians. Overall, the evidence was of low certainty. There were limited data for the role of video-assistance or specific subgroups. Future research should include more high-quality studies of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examination; assessment of inter-rater reliability across users; accuracy across different providers, specialties, and experience; and direct comparison with no HINTS or MRI to assess the effect on clinical care.

### Dizziness: evaluation and management [^4f91cf15]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Dizziness is a common but often diagnostically difficult condition. Clinicians should focus on the timing of the events and triggers of dizziness to develop a differential diagnosis because it is difficult for patients to provide quality reports of their symptoms. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes peripheral and central causes. Peripheral etiologies can cause significant morbidity but are generally less concerning, whereas central etiologies are more urgent. The physical examination may include orthostatic blood pressure measurement, a full cardiac and neurologic examination, assessment for nystagmus, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (for patients with triggered dizziness), and the HINTS (head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) examination when indicated. Laboratory testing and imaging are usually not required but can be helpful. The treatment for dizziness is dependent on the etiology of the symptoms. Canalith repositioning procedures (e.g. Epley maneuver) are the most helpful in treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation is helpful in treating many peripheral and central etiologies. Other etiologies of dizziness require specific treatment to address the cause. Pharmacologic intervention is limited because it often affects the ability of the central nervous system to compensate for dizziness.

### Dizziness: approach to evaluation and management… [^6be7b140]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

TITRATE THE EVALUATION TiTrATE is a novel diagnostic approach to determining the probable etiology of dizziness or vertigo. 2 The approach uses the Timing of the symptom, the Triggers that provoke the symptom, And a Targeted Examination. The responses place the dizziness into one of three clinical scenarios: episodic triggered, spontaneous episodic, or continuous vestibular. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Findings from the physical examination — including a cardiac and neurologic assessment, with attention to the head, eye, ear, nose, and throat examination — are usually normal in patients presenting with dizziness. Blood pressure should be measured while the patient is standing and in the supine position. The patient's gait should be observed and a Romberg test performed. Patients with an unsteady gait should be assessed for peripheral neuropathy. 18 A positive Romberg test suggests an abnormality with proprioception receptors or their pathway.

The use of the HINTS examination can help distinguish a possible stroke from acute vestibular syndrome. Test of Skew. Test of skew is assessed by asking the patient to look straight ahead, then cover and uncover each eye. Vertical deviation of the covered eye after uncovering is an abnormal result. Although this is a less sensitive test for central pathology, an abnormal result is fairly specific for brainstem involvement. BPPV is diagnosed with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. LABORATORY TESTING AND IMAGING Most patients presenting with dizziness do not require laboratory testing. Patients with chronic medical conditions may require blood glucose and electrolyte measurements. Patients with symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease should undergo electrocardiography, Holter monitoring, and possibly carotid Doppler testing.

However, in a summary analysis of multiple studies that included 4, 538 patients, only 26 had a laboratory result that explained their dizziness. Potentially deadly central causes of acute vestibular syndrome may mimic a more benign peripheral disorder, and a stroke may present with no focal neurologic signs. Computed tomography does not have adequate sensitivity to distinguish stroke from benign causes of acute vestibular syndrome. The HINTS examination is highly sensitive and specific in identifying stroke in patients with acute vestibular syndrome, and it is superior to diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in ruling out stroke. 6.

### Exploring vestibular assessment in patients with headache and dizziness [^efac7e91]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients often report symptoms of headache and dizziness concomitantly. Symptoms of dizziness can be explored with a comprehensive vestibular assessment, allowing for the investigation of central and peripheral vestibular system contributions to symptoms of dizziness. Patients who report both symptoms of headache and dizziness demonstrate abnormalities of the vestibular system which can be measured quantitatively. Completion of comprehensive vestibular testing can help to guide diagnosis and strategies for intervention.

### Vestibular assessment: a practical approach [^75cdf4e7]. Occupational Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

This paper presents an evidence-based introduction to assessing and managing the dizzy patient. It is based upon a literature review highlighting current best practice and the clinical experience of the author. Dizziness is common, often chronic and largely untreated, resulting in great personal and economic loss. Serious pathological causes of dizziness may be quickly and effectively screened by a simple ocular motor examination, differentiating these from peripheral vestibular lesions. A triage, differentiating dizziness into either acute onset, intermittent episodes or continuous symptoms is proposed, along with management strategies for the commonest causes of dizziness. Vestibular suppressant medication should be restricted to the acute phase of a vestibular episode. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy is the most effective treatment for continuous or chronic dizziness.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^579d4a2b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — falls risk and screening summarizes that symptomatic dizziness confers a 12-fold increase in the risk for falls and that among community-dwelling adults aged > 65 years, 1 in 3 falls each year, with U.S. fall costs estimated to exceed $20 billion annually. Across studies of fall etiology, dizziness and vertigo were the primary etiology 13% of the time compared with balance and gait problems 17% and person-environment interactions 31%. In a geriatric referral series, 9% had undiagnosed BPPV and three-fourths of those with BPPV had fallen within the 3 months prior to referral. Accordingly, evaluation of patients with a diagnosis of BPPV should include an assessment of risk for falls, and elderly patients will be more statistically at risk for falls with BPPV. An initial falls risk screening might start with questions such as those suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2015: (1) Have you had a fall in the past year? How many times? Were you injured? (2) Do you feel unsteady when standing or walking? (3) Do you worry about falling? A positive response to questions such as these might then prompt the clinician to conduct a more detailed falls risk assessment or refer to a clinician who can use tools such as the Get Up and Go test, Tinetti Balance Assessment, Berg Balance Scale, or others.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^fbd374c3]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Dizziness and vestibular disorders assessment

Expert recommendation. Routinely ask about dizziness symptoms, and undertake follow-up assessment as necessary to identify cardiovascular, neurological and/or vestibular causes (Appendix 2, available in Age and Ageing online). GRADE: E.

Recommendation details and justification

Dizziness is a common complaint in older adults who fall, with different meanings between individuals, and often no single explanatory cause. Careful history taking is of particular importance. Presyncope and observable unsteadiness or ataxia may be present.
Additionally, the vestibular system has a key role in the control of posture and gait, and there is evidence of a high incidence of both benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and vestibular dysfunction in those presenting with falls. In younger adults, such disorders can often be identified in the clinical history by a reported sensation of vertigo with clear positional or motion-provoked triggers. Identifying cases of vestibular dysfunction is more challenging in older adults due to more variable symptoms.
Where vertigo is reported, positional tests should be used to identify cases of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from non-cases (e.g. Dix-Hallpike, Head Impulse Test); however, the sensitivity of case-finding algorithms based purely upon symptoms compared with screening with positional testing in older adults is unknown.

### Comparing caloric and self-experienced dizziness symptoms: diagnostic value and implications in functional dizziness [^fc400b0c]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In clinical practice, the diagnostic assessment of chronic dizziness largely depends on a detailed patient history. In addition to modulating factors such as head movements or complex visual stimuli, and temporal features like the duration of dizziness phases, the symptoms patients experience during these phases are relevant to clinical decision making. These include both the qualitative character of dizziness and associated symptoms such as nausea. Although the diagnostic importance traditionally attributed to symptom quality has declined, the differentiation between spinning and nonspinning motion sensations (vertigo), disturbances of spatial orientation without a sense of motion (dizziness, as defined by the Bárány Society), and unsteadiness still contributes to the diagnostic classification of vestibular disorders.

However, attempts to infer the underlying disorder based on the reported quality of dizziness (with "dizziness" used here as an umbrella term) are limited by substantial variability observed both between individuals and within the same individual over time. To address this, we sought to reduce between-subject variability by having each patient compare their subjective experience of dizziness to their experience during the routinely administered caloric test, thereby controlling for stable individual differences in dizziness experience and reporting. The caloric test provides a clearly nonphysiological, standardized peripheral vestibular stimulus and may therefore serve as a proxy for an acute peripheral vestibular disorder. Following this rationale, we tested the hypothesis that patients with a peripheral vestibular disorder would perceive their dizziness as more similar to the caloric stimulation than would patients with dizziness of nonperipheral origin. To address this, we employed newly developed questionnaires specifically designed to assess and compare symptom experiences during dizziness and caloric stimulation.

Yet, we did not find the expected effect: patients with peripheral dizziness did not perceive caloric stimulation as more similar to their typical dizziness than did patients with nonperipheral dizziness. These findings prompted further exploratory analyses, which revealed distinct symptom patterns between groups, with potential diagnostic relevance and implications for pathophysiological models of functional dizziness.

### Psychological variables mediate symptoms in persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD): a cross-sectional self-report study [^98c0eaa4]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
Barany Society Diagnostic Criteria for Persistent Postural‐Perceptual Dizziness (PPPD).

Current research relies heavily on non‐specific patient‐reported outcomes, often without biometric data, which limits the precision of treatment evaluation. For example, Herdman et al. demonstrated that redirecting attention from consciously controlling balance and fear‐driven adaptations can significantly reduce negative illness perception and symptoms in patients with PPPD. However, since negative illness perception is not part of PPPD's diagnostic criteria, and the exact role of negative illness perception on dizziness is unknown, it is challenging to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.

Developing psychometric tools to measure key psychological factors like negative cognitive appraisal and anxiety could standardise assessments for PPPD and improve research and treatment.

### Neurological update: dizziness [^95dee262]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis and management of vertigo remains a challenge for clinicians, including general neurology. In recent years there have been advances in the understanding of established vestibular syndromes, and the development of treatments for existing vestibular diagnoses. In this 'update' I will review how our understanding of previously "unexplained" dizziness in the elderly is changing, explore novel insights into the pathophysiology of vestibular migraine, and its relationship to the newly coined term 'persistent postural perceptual dizziness', and finally discuss how a simple bedside oculomotor assessment may help identify vestibular presentations of stroke.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^d1fe65a9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — diagnosis using the Dix-Hallpike maneuver is specified and recommended. Clinicians should diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeat nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45° to 1 side and neck extended 20° with the affected ear down, and if the testing of the first side is negative, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver should be conducted with the other ear down before concluding a negative overall maneuver. This is a Strong recommendation based on diagnostic studies with minor limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm; the aggregate evidence quality is Grade B with a level of confidence in evidence rated High. Benefits are improved diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, risks include risk of provoking temporary symptoms of BPPV, exceptions are patients with physical limitations, and the policy level is Strong recommendation.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — radiographic testing is addressed as follows: Clinicians should not obtain radiographic imaging in a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging. Recommendation against radiographic imaging based on diagnostic studies with limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Quality improvement opportunity: Reduce unnecessary testing and costs, reduce unnecessary radiation and radiographic contrast exposure (National Quality Strategy domains: safety, affordable quality care). Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C based on observational studies for radiographic imaging. Level of confidence in evidence: Medium. Benefits: Facilitate timely treatment by avoiding unnecessary testing associated with low-yield and potential false-positive diagnoses; avoid radiation exposure and adverse reactions to testing. Risks, harms, costs: None. Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments: The panel placed heavy value in the accuracy of the BPPV diagnosis at the outset in that a diagnosis made by appropriate history and Dix-Hallpike is adequate to proceed with management without further testing. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exceptions: Patients who have separate indications for radiographic or vestibular testing aside from confirming a diagnosis of BPPV. Policy level: Recommendation against. Differences of opinion: None. Routine radiographic imaging is unnecessary for patients who already meet clinical criteria for the diagnosis of BPPV (Table 6). Radiographic imaging of the CNS should be reserved for patients who present with a clinical history compatible with BPPV but who also demonstrate additional neurologic symptoms atypical for BPPV.

### Imaging of dizziness [^d1f946ce]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a frequent indication for neuroimaging within the outpatient and emergency setting with variable diagnostic yield. The majority of persistent, recurrent, and isolated dizziness can be managed clinically. However, it may be difficult to distinguish a benign peripheral aetiology from a central cause, particularly in the emergency setting.

### A practical assessment algorithm for diagnosis of dizziness [^93a0df2e]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to test a 3-parameter model for diagnosis of dizziness based on the type and temporal characteristics of the dizziness and on hearing status.

Study Design and Setting

We conducted a prospective blinded study at a tertiary referral neurotology practice. Before examination, patients completed a questionnaire reporting type and timing of dizziness symptoms and hearing status. Clinical diagnoses were compared with questionnaire results.

Results

Fifty-seven patients completed the questionnaire. We were able to correctly classify 21 (60%) of the 35 subjects who had a common otogenic cause of vertigo by the diagnostic algorithm.

Conclusion

A simple classification of dizziness by type, timing, and hearing status can be self-reported by patients using a brief questionnaire. This classification scheme is as good as others of much greater complexity.

Significance

The simple classification scheme reported here is based on history alone and facilitates triage of dizzy patients into diagnostic groups for work-up and management.

### Validation of the sudbury vertigo risk score to risk stratify for a serious cause of vertigo [^91bf86c5]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Vanni et al.developed the STANDING algorithm, which consists of the (1) discrimination between spontaneous and positional nystagmus, (2) evaluation of the nystagmus direction, (3) head impulse test, and (4) evaluation of equilibrium, the first and second of which are components of the HINTS examination. A 2022 systematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies of this algorithm reported sensitivity for identifying a serious cause of dizziness from 93.4% to 100% and specificity from 71.8% to 94.3%. The review found all three studies of this algorithm were at a high risk of bias. The only external validation study found a sensitivity of 93.6% (95% CI 84.3–98.2) and a specificity of 74.8% (95% CI 84.3–98.2), with all physicians rating confidence in assessing the nystagmus and head impulse test as low.

Comparatively, the Sudbury Vertigo Risk Score has a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 96.5%–100%) and a specificity of 69.2% (95% CI 67.8%–70.5%). This fulfills accuracy requirements identified by emergency physicians, achieving a posttest probability of < 0.5% for a serious diagnosis.

Two guidelines offer advice on the risk stratification of patients presenting with dizziness for a serious outcome. The ACEP clinical policy, although not specifically directed at patients with dizziness, does offer advice for this patient population. It promotes the use of history and physical examination assessment to help risk stratify patients and, if trained, the use of the HINTS examination. The GRACE‐3 guidelines endorse the approach that includes the use of the HINTS examination, STANDING algorithm and assessment of BPPV. As often is the case of clinical guidelines neither approach as diagnostic algorithms have been externally validated for accuracy or impact on clinical practice. That being said both guidelines offer a reasonable a practical approach to the risk stratification of patients with dizziness.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^5907f865]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Vestibular testing in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — Clinicians should not order vestibular testing in a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing, with recommendation against vestibular testing based on diagnostic studies with limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C and level of confidence is Medium; benefits include facilitating timely treatment by avoiding unnecessary testing associated with low-yield and potential false-positive diagnoses, avoiding patient discomfort from nausea and vomiting from vestibular testing, and reduced costs from unnecessary testing; risks/harms/costs are noted as none; benefits-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm; the policy level is recommendation against; and exceptions are patients who have separate indications for vestibular testing aside from confirming a diagnosis of BPPV. The diagnosis of BPPV is based on the clinical history and physical examination with a positive result on the Dix-Hallpike test, which can be accomplished by a trained clinician without specialized testing equipment, and an appropriate CRP can be implemented immediately. Comprehensive vestibular testing is unnecessary for patients who already meet clinical criteria for the diagnosis of BPPV, and this does not imply that the use of video-oculographic technology with or without recording should not be used when available to help in identification and differentiation of types of BPPV. Comprehensive vestibular testing may have a role if the clinical presentation is atypical, if Dix-Hallpike testing is equivocal or shows unusual nystagmus, if the diagnosis is unclear, or if additional symptoms aside from those attributable to BPPV are present. In a retrospective chart review of 100 consecutive patients referred for vestibular assessment, a 9% reduction in referrals for specialized testing could be realized if the initial provider obtained a thorough case history and completed a Dix-Hallpike test, and among complex patients referred for subspecialty evaluation of BPPV, atypical or unclear nystagmus findings may approach 13% among patients with diagnoses suspicious for BPPV.

Dizziness and vertigo are common symptoms in the primary care and emergency settings, resulting in a significant decrease in quality of life and a high cost burden to the US health care system. The etiology of these symptoms is difficult to elucidate owing to a wide range of diseases with overlapping manifestations. The broad differential diagnosis based on whether the disease process is central or peripheral is showcased. Each differential will be categorized into neoplastic, infectious or inflammatory, structural, traumatic, and iatrogenic causes. Computed tomography scans, MRI, and vascular imaging are frequently complimentary in providing diagnoses and guidance in management.

### Comparing caloric and self-experienced dizziness symptoms: diagnostic value and implications in functional dizziness [^cfb9cff6]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic potential of relating self-experienced dizziness symptoms to those induced by caloric testing

As the primary hypothesis could not be confirmed, we used the available data for exploratory analyses aimed at generating hypotheses for future studies. We first asked whether comparing symptom reports across the two conditions — (1) self-experienced dizziness and (2) caloric stimulation — would offer any advantage over the conventional approach of assessing symptoms based solely on self-experienced dizziness. As shown in the second column of Fig. 1, there are symptoms for which patients with peripheral dizziness showed a greater directional difference in symptom intensity (own dizziness minus caloric stimulation) compared to patients with nonperipheral dizziness. In the latter group, the difference was not only smaller but even negative for some symptoms. Group differences were evident for spinning vertigo symptoms, imbalance, nausea, and sweating, as well as for certain symptoms related to general dizziness and depersonalisation/derealisation. In contrast, symptoms related to anxiety and nonspinning vertigo showed no group differences. A similar pattern was observed in the self-comparison component of the Caloric-and-Self-Comparison Questionnaire ("Self Comparison"), as shown in column 1. Notably, these group differences were markedly reduced or even absent when considering only responses referring to the self-experienced dizziness, as presented in the third column of Fig. 1. This exploratory analysis therefore suggests that comparing symptoms between self-experienced dizziness to those during caloric stimulation may indeed offer an advantage and greater diagnostic value than assessing self-experienced dizziness symptoms alone.

Fig. 1
Item-level comparison between peripheral and nonperipheral dizziness groups. For each item, group means and 95% confidence intervals are displayed for five different measures of perceived intensity. The columns differ in how dizziness and calorics are related: (1) direct self-comparison of intensity between dizziness and calorics, (2) calculated difference in intensity between dizziness and calorics, (3) intensity attributed to dizziness, (4) intensity attributed to calorics, and (5) the sum of dizziness and calorics intensity. Items are sorted according to Table 2. Horizontal thick lines mark boundaries between predefined symptom categories. Asterisks indicate that the 95% confidence interval of Cohen's d for that symptom and measure does not include zero (see Supplementary Information). Sample sizes (n₁: peripheral, n₂: nonperipheral) vary due to "don't know" responses

CT scan in emergency department (ED) dizziness and BPPV — diagnostic yield and guidance: "CT scans are used frequently in ED patients eventually diagnosed as BPPV", yet "Overall, the diagnostic yield of CT for important structural causes in dizzy patients is very low". In one study of admitted patients with typical BPPV nystagmus, "none of the 10 CT scans obtained clinically… revealed clinically important findings", whereas "two of 34 scans" in those with atypical or no nystagmus showed acute brain lesions; accordingly, the otolaryngology guideline "recommends against routine imaging in the presence of typical nystagmus and adequate therapeutic response to repositioning treatments".

### Utility of head CT in the evaluation of vertigo / dizziness in the emergency department [^aa6c5a05]. Emergency Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Acute dizziness (including vertigo) is a common reason to visit the emergency room, and imaging with head CT is often performed initially to exclude a central cause. In this study, consecutive patients presenting with dizziness and undergoing head CT were retrospectively reviewed to determine diagnostic yield. Four hundred forty-eight consecutive head CTs in a representative sample of dizzy emergency room (ER) patients, including patients with other neurological symptoms, were reviewed to identify an acute or subacute cause for acute dizziness along with the frequency and modalities used in follow-up imaging. The diagnostic yield for head CT ordered in the ER for acute dizziness is low (2.2%; 1.6% for emergent findings), but MRI changes the diagnosis up to 16% of the time, acutely in 8% of cases. Consistent with the American College of Radiology appropriateness criteria and the literature, this study suggests a low diagnostic yield for CT in the evaluation of acute dizziness but an important role for MRI in appropriately selected cases.

### Geographic variation in use of vestibular testing among Medicare beneficiaries [^2c177a6e]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective There is a lack of consensus regarding the indications for vestibular testing in the evaluation of dizziness and balance disorders. Geographic variation in health services utilization is associated with lack of consensus. To understand the variation in current practice, we investigated the patterns of use of vestibular testing and diagnosis codes for dizziness and balance disorders among individuals ≥ 65 years of age across different regions of the United States. Study Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Medicare administrative claims data. Subjects and Methods Using the Summarized Denominator file, a sample of the US population linked to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare files (years 2000–2010), we identified persons who were ≥ 65 years of age. We used multivariable analyses to determine the factors associated with vestibular testing and diagnoses. Results Of the 231,984 eligible Medicare beneficiaries, 27% were diagnosed with dizziness and balance disorders. Patterns of use of vestibular tests (eye movement recording for spontaneous nystagmus, caloric testing, and rotary chair testing) varied significantly by geographic region. Rotary chair test utilization varied most. We found significant geographic variation in vestibular testing and diagnoses after controlling for age, sex, race, Medicaid participation, and rurality. Conclusions There may be opportunities to improve the consistency and efficiency of care for dizziness and balance disorders. It will be important to define appropriate levels of vestibular diagnostic testing and which tests add sufficient value to justify the costs. Further work is needed to better characterize the causes and consequences of variation in vestibular test utilization.

### A new diagnostic approach to the adult patient with acute dizziness [^733a7d57]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dizziness, a common chief complaint, has an extensive differential diagnosis that includes both benign and serious conditions. Emergency physicians must distinguish the majority of patients with self-limiting conditions from those with serious illnesses that require acute treatment.

Objective Of The Review

This article presents a new approach to diagnosis of the acutely dizzy patient that emphasizes different aspects of the history to guide a focused physical examination with the goal of differentiating benign peripheral vestibular conditions from dangerous posterior circulation strokes in the emergency department.

Discussion

Currently, misdiagnoses are frequent and diagnostic testing costs are high. This relates in part to use of an outdated, prevalent, diagnostic paradigm. The traditional approach, which relies on dizziness symptom quality or type (i.e., vertigo, presyncope, or disequilibrium) to guide inquiry, does not distinguish benign from dangerous causes, and is inconsistent with current best evidence. A new approach divides patients into three key categories using timing and triggers, guiding a differential diagnosis and targeted bedside examination protocol: 1) acute vestibular syndrome, where bedside physical examination differentiates vestibular neuritis from stroke; 2) spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome, where associated symptoms help differentiate vestibular migraine from transient ischemic attack; and 3) triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, where the Dix-Hallpike and supine roll test help differentiate benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from posterior fossa structural lesions.

Conclusions

The timing and triggers diagnostic approach for the acutely dizzy patient derives from current best evidence and offers the potential to reduce misdiagnosis while simultaneously decreases diagnostic test overuse, unnecessary hospitalization, and incorrect treatments.

### Cost-effectiveness of advanced neuroimaging for transient and minor neurological events in the emergency department [^a3ccd29b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Additional Analyses

To explore potential diagnostic evaluation strategies' testing characteristics, we used 1‐way sensitivity analyses to identify optimal test performance parameters of potential future diagnostic approaches. In this threshold analysis, we varied the sensitivity and specificity of the advanced neuroimaging strategy and the current ED strategy from 0% to 100%. The cost of neuroimaging was varied from $0 to $50 000 to identify cost thresholds.

We conducted a secondary analysis using a 90‐day time horizon rather than 1‐year time horizon to account for the importance of short‐term outcomes when evaluating ED‐based decision making. Costs associated with patient care after hospital discharge were not included when the shorter time horizon of 90 days was used (Table 2).

We performed an additional secondary analysis to evaluate the strategy of obtaining CT angiography of the head and neck in the ED on every patient compared with our other 2 strategies. To conduct this additional analysis, we added a third branch to the decision node (Figure S1). We stipulated that patients were admitted from the ED if > 50% stenosis or occlusion in a relevant vessel was found on CT angiography and that they were discharged to home after a CT angiography study that lacked these findings. Outcomes after hospital admission or ED discharge after CT angiography were identical to those of the other diagnostic strategies. Extant literature on the sensitivity and specificity of CT angiography in our ED study population of low‐risk transient and minor neurological events is sparse. We therefore estimated CT angiography testing parameters from a study of patients with TIA and from a separate study of ED patients evaluated for dizziness. When adopting the study of dizzy patients to our model, we assumed that all patients whose CT angiography did not show a vessel stenosis did not have a vascular cause for their symptoms and that detection of fibromuscular dysplasia was a false positive. We thus estimated that CT angiography has a sensitivity of 17% and a specificity of 99% for a vascular event in our study population. We calculated the cost of CT angiography as $542 based on data reported by Medicare for Current Procedural Terminology codes 70496 and 70498.

All study data will be provided at the request of other investigators for the purposes of replicating procedures and/or results.

### Causes of persistent dizziness in elderly patients in primary care [^e59bf6d7]. Annals of Family Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Although dizzy patients are predominantly seen in primary care, most diagnostic studies on dizziness have been performed among patients in secondary or tertiary care. Our objective was to describe subtypes of dizziness in elderly patients in primary care and to assess contributory causes of dizziness.

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional diagnostic study among elderly patients in the Netherlands consulting their family physician for persistent dizziness. All patients underwent a comprehensive evaluation according to a set of diagnostic tests that were developed during an international Delphi procedure. Data for each patient were independently reviewed by a panel consisting of a family physician, a geriatrician, and a nursing home physician, which resulted in major and minor contributory causes of dizziness.

Results

From June 2006 to January 2008, we included 417 patients aged 65 to 95 years. Presyncope was the most common dizziness subtype (69%). Forty-four percent of the patients were assigned more than 1 dizziness subtype. Cardiovascular disease was considered to be the most common major contributory cause of dizziness (57%), followed by peripheral vestibular disease (14%), and psychiatric illness (10%). An adverse drug effect was considered to be the most common minor contributory cause of dizziness (23%). Sixty-two percent of the patients were assigned more than 1 contributory cause of dizziness.

Conclusions

Contrary to most previous studies, cardiovascular disease was found to be the most common major cause of dizziness in elderly patients in primary care. In one-quarter of all patients an adverse drug effect was considered to be a contributory cause of dizziness, which is much higher than reported in previous studies.

2 Objective

This study aims to bridge the gap between current diagnostic criteria and emerging understanding of PPPD by assessing psychological variables associated with its manifestation and maintenance. We evaluate these variables as potential treatment targets through mediation analysis between dizziness symptoms and PPPD diagnosis and investigate how they differentiate PPPD from healthy controls. Finally, we used multinomial logistic regression to make exploratory comparisons between PPPD, healthy controls (HC) and patients with chronic peripheral vestibular dysfunction (Bilateral Vestibulopathy patients [BVP]). This analysis allowed us to investigate distinguishing features and shared mechanisms among these groups.

### Emergency department vestibular rehabilitation therapy for dizziness and vertigo: a nonrandomized clinical trial [^799fccbc]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Dizziness is a common problem affecting an estimated 36.8 million US individuals annuallyand accounting for nearly 2 million annual visits to the emergency department (ED). Dizziness presents a substantial diagnostic challenge for clinicians because of its broad differential including both pathologic (eg, cerebellar stroke) and benign (eg, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [BPPV]) causes. Thus, dizziness-related ED visits commonly prompt clinicians to pursue low-value diagnostic imaging (eg, routine computed tomography [CT] for triggered episodic vestibular syndrome) and potentially unnecessary hospitalization, which in turn contribute to increased health care costs.

Previous dizziness research has focused on improving the diagnostic skills of clinicians by increasing the uptake of specific examination techniques, such as the Dix-Hallpike test or Head Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew (HINTS) examination, or implementing guidelines to promote standardized care. To our knowledge, no study has yet to characterize dizziness symptoms following an ED visit and only 1 study has explored patient-centered outcomes. Given this, we have little understanding of how patients fare after an ED visit for dizziness or what ED-based interventions might improve dizziness-related functioning. Emergency clinicians therefore have little guidance to offer patients regarding expected time to symptom resolution or potential treatments.

Conversely, outpatient physical therapy for dizziness and vertigo (ie, vestibular rehabilitation) has a strong evidence base. However, outpatient clinics differ greatly from the emergency care setting, as patients seen in outpatient vestibular therapy settings have typically received a provisional diagnosis by a referring clinician and have experienced a longer duration of symptoms, which contributes to greater diagnostic clarity. Whether vestibular rehabilitation can be delivered effectively by physical therapists in the ED — where patients present with acute-onset dizziness symptoms and frequently have received little to no prior medical evaluation — is currently unknown.

We therefore conducted a prospective nonrandomized pilot trial to obtain feasibility data from an ED vestibular rehabilitation intervention delivered by physical therapists and preliminary patient-reported outcomes in the 3 months following an ED visit for dizziness. We considered this work foundational to a future randomized clinical trial of an ED vestibular rehabilitation therapy intervention.

Vascular ultrasound performance for identifying large-vessel mechanisms of TIA is limited. In the systematic review, "the three studies (n = 258) that evaluated ultrasound were all related to stroke not TIA", and "the reference standard was MRA". Diagnostic accuracy was modest: "the sensitivities for ultrasound ranged from 30% to 53.6% and specificity 94.9%-100%", leading the authors to state that these data "suggesting that ultrasound in isolation should not be relied upon to diagnose a large-vessel mechanism for a TIA".

GRACE-3 — direct and indirect evidence on Dix–Hallpike in t-EVS — The systematic review identified four studies of moderate to high risk of bias; in one study all patients with a central etiology had a negative Dix–Hallpike test, and another study of admitted patients with an unclear type of dizziness reported two patients with atypical nystagmus on Dix–Hallpike testing that had a central cause, while excluding an unknown number of BPPV patients discharged after successful ED treatment. In clinical practice, a positive Dix–Hallpike test is used to rule in pc-BPPV as opposed to a negative test ruling in a central cause, the Dix–Hallpike test is considered the criterion standard diagnostic test for pc-BPPV so the test's sensitivity for pc-BPPV cannot properly be assessed, and routine use of the Dix–Hallpike test by emergency clinicians is very low.

### Dizziness [^56a519ab]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a common symptom encountered by all physicians. Dizziness and related symptoms are frequently linked to 1 or more of a list of contributors that includes benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Ménière disease, migraine, acute peripheral vestibulopathy, cerebral ischemia, and anxiety disorders. Awareness of these common clinical patterns increases the likelihood of making a rapid, accurate diagnosis.

### Dizziness: a diagnostic approach [^853a813f]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Dizziness accounts for an estimated 5 percent of primary care clinic visits. The patient history can generally classify dizziness into one of four categories: vertigo, disequilibrium, presyncope, or lightheadedness. The main causes of vertigo are benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Meniere disease, vestibular neuritis, and labyrinthitis. Many medications can cause presyncope, and regimens should be assessed in patients with this type of dizziness. Parkinson disease and diabetic neuropathy should be considered with the diagnosis of disequilibrium. Psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and hyperventilation syndrome, can cause vague lightheadedness. The differential diagnosis of dizziness can be narrowed with easy-to-perform physical examination tests, including evaluation for nystagmus, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, and orthostatic blood pressure testing. Laboratory testing and radiography play little role in diagnosis. A final diagnosis is not obtained in about 20 percent of cases. Treatment of vertigo includes the Epley maneuver (canalith repositioning) and vestibular rehabilitation for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, intratympanic dexamethasone or gentamicin for Meniere disease, and steroids for vestibular neuritis. Orthostatic hypotension that causes presyncope can be treated with alpha agonists, mineralocorticoids, or lifestyle changes. Disequilibrium and lightheadedness can be alleviated by treating the underlying cause.

### Prospective quantitative evaluation of gait and stance in patients with acute vertigo and dizziness [^28a92beb]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute vertigo and dizziness are the leading symptoms of about 4% of all patient visits to the emergency department (ED). With approximately 13% of the neurological consultations in the ED, it is the third most common complaint after headache and sensorimotor deficits. In previous ED cohorts, 4–10% of patients with acute vertigo and dizziness were found to have a stroke as the underlying cause. Diagnostic approaches for patients with acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) are mostly based on the assessment of vestibulo-ocular reflex function and central ocular motor signs established in the head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew (HINTS) triad. For these parameters, a quantitative assessment by video-oculography has become accessible, enhancing the sensitivity for the differentiation between peripheral and central etiologies. In contrast, assessment of posture and gait in acute vertigo and dizziness in previous studies was limited to course-grained clinical evaluation schemes such as the Gait and Truncal ataxia Index (GTI). These studies claim a high diagnostic accuracy of GTI grades 2 and 3 for vestibular stroke against acute unilateral vestibulopathy. A recent meta-analysis indicated that GTI had only a moderate diagnostic accuracy to detect acute central vestibular disorders with a sensitivity of GTI 2/3 of 70.8%, which was inferior to HINTS. Importantly, quantitative assessments of stance and gait during the acute stage of symptoms are almost completely missing to date.

A more standardized evaluation of postural and locomotor function may be justified by the fact that a relevant proportion of patients with acute vertigo and dizziness do mainly present with gait and stance imbalance and ataxia (recently named acute imbalance syndrome, AIS). Prioritizing the development of a diagnostic algorithm tailored to differentiate the etiologies in patients with a predominant AIS phenotype of AVS in the ED is imperative. This process benefits from a systematic evaluation of stance and gait parameters, which could be both reliable and easily applicable in the acute stage of symptoms (preferably already in the ED).

Given these considerations, we conducted the current study with the aim to prospectively gather objective markers of gait and stance based on established quantitative tests such as Timed Up and Go test (TUG), Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), and mobile posturography in patients presenting with acute isolated vertigo and dizziness (without other central symptoms) during the acute stage. We posed the question, if the extent of impairment reflected by these tests could help separate central from peripheral etiologies of acute isolated vertigo and dizziness.

### Comparing caloric and self-experienced dizziness symptoms: diagnostic value and implications in functional dizziness [^493bef8d]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The starting point of this study was a well-known diagnostic problem in chronic dizziness: the high interindividual variability in how patients describe the symptoms they experience during dizziness. We investigated whether this variability could be mitigated by comparing the symptoms a patient reports during their dizziness with those experienced during caloric stimulation, under the assumption of stable individual differences in dizziness experience and reporting. Based on the premise that caloric stimulation mimics an acute peripheral vestibular disturbance, this approach was expected to improve the differentiation between peripheral and nonperipheral dizziness. The study was designed accordingly. We hypothesized that the subjective experience during caloric stimulation would closely resemble that of an actual peripheral vestibular disorder. However, the primary analyses comparing the similarity between caloric-induced symptoms and self-experienced dizziness across peripheral and nonperipheral groups revealed effect sizes contrary to our expectations. Instead of the anticipated negative effect size (d ≈ – 0.6), the results consistently showed effect sizes close to zero or even slightly positive. Therefore, despite the smaller sample size than originally planned (~ 60 patients per group for 80% power; actual n = 49 and n = 34 for the peripheral and nonperipheral groups, respectively), and in the absence of any indication of a missed effect in extended analyses, the findings provide sufficient evidence to reject the hypothesis.

While the primary hypothesis — which relied on the absolute difference in symptom intensity as a measure of similarity — could not be confirmed, exploratory analyses suggest that the directed difference between caloric stimulation and self-experienced dizziness may have diagnostic relevance. For the symptoms of spinning vertigo (comprising three items) and imbalance (one item), the diagnostic value of the symptom comparison may stem from a reverse pattern between the groups: patients with peripheral dizziness report higher intensities during self-experienced dizziness, whereas those with nonperipheral dizziness report higher intensities during caloric stimulation. For spinning vertigo, this reverse pattern was so pronounced that it almost suggests a clinical rule of thumb: peripheral patients experience their strongest spinning sensations during their own dizziness, whereas nonperipheral patients — particularly those with functional dizziness — do so during caloric stimulation. It is noteworthy that the reverse pattern seems more critical for the diagnostic value of the symptom comparison than the correction of stable individual differences, despite the latter having been our primary assumption.

### Distinguishing peripheral from central causes of dizziness and vertigo without using HINTS or STANDING [^3e4892a8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Three validated diagnostic algorithms for diagnosing patients with acute onset dizziness or vertigo (HINTS, HINTS-plus and STANDING) exist. All are extremely accurate in distinguishing peripheral from central causes of dizziness when done by experienced clinicians. However, uptake of these diagnostic tools in routine emergency medicine practice has been sub-optimal, in part, due to clinicians' unease with the head impulse test, the most useful component contained of these algorithms. Use of these validated algorithms is the best way to accurately diagnose patients with acute dizziness. For clinicians who are unfamiliar with or uncomfortable performing or interpreting HINTS and STANDING, this article will suggest alternative approaches to help with accurate diagnosis of patients with acute dizziness or vertigo.

### Comparing caloric and self-experienced dizziness symptoms: diagnostic value and implications in functional dizziness [^a205b9d4]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnostic value of dizziness symptom quality is limited by variability in patient self-reports. Comparing it to the experience during standardized caloric stimulation could help control for individual differences in dizziness experience and reporting. As a nonphysiological stimulus, caloric testing may serve as a proxy for acute peripheral vestibular disorder. We hypothesized that dizziness of peripheral origin would be perceived as more similar to caloric stimulation than nonperipheral dizziness.

Methods

Patients with peripheral (n = 49) and nonperipheral dizziness (n = 34) were compared. Using newly developed questionnaires, participants rated the intensity of 30 symptoms during both dizziness and caloric stimulation, compared symptom intensity between the two, and rated overall similarity.

Results

Peripheral patients did not perceive caloric stimulation as more similar to their symptoms than nonperipheral patients. This also held for the functional dizziness subgroup (n = 14). However, exploratory analyses suggest symptom-specific group differences based on the directional intensity difference. For example, peripheral patients reported stronger spinning during their dizziness, whereas nonperipheral patients reported stronger spinning during caloric stimulation. These group differences outperformed those based on the dizziness ratings alone, which likely reflects pronounced caloric symptoms in the nonperipheral group, especially in functional dizziness, rather than stable individual differences. Peripheral patients also reported stronger caloric symptoms than controls without dizziness (n = 20). Symptom-specific group differences were not accounted for by slow-phase velocity of caloric nystagmus.

Conclusions

This study highlights the potential diagnostic value of comparing symptoms with caloric stimulation and provides further support for motion perception overestimation in functional dizziness.

### Emergency department vestibular rehabilitation therapy for dizziness and vertigo: a nonrandomized clinical trial [^1604f2d6]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The patient experience of dizziness represents a heterogeneous list of differential diagnoses, including conditions that are potentially amenable to an intervention delivered in an emergency care environment (eg, Epley maneuver for BPPV, corticosteroids for vestibular neuritis [unilateral peripheral hypofunction]), to nonspecific or chronic conditions (eg, persistent postural perceptual dizziness) that are difficult to diagnose and treat in a limited acute care encounter. To complicate matters further, the term dizziness is frequently used by patients to describe various general states of feeling unwell. Although we attempted to exclude patients with obvious nonvertiginous causes of dizziness, such as fever or severe anemia, and included consideration of orthostatic symptoms in the ED-VeRT algorithm, the general tendency to describe various states of unwell as dizziness likely contributes to the classification of some patients into undifferentiated triggered or spontaneous dizziness categories. Patients with undifferentiated dizziness classifications may still benefit from the general education, safety teaching, and diagnostic reassurance provided by a physical therapist, as a previous study observed how patients evaluated by an ED physical therapist for low back pain described benefits from the increased time and attention provided by an expert.

Ideally, we would compare the effect of ED vestibular therapy vs usual care among specific subgroups of diagnostic classifications (eg, BPPV, unilateral peripheral hypofunction), but because usual care participants did not receive the ED-VeRT standardized diagnostic classification algorithm, we were not able to assemble comparator subgroups. Although one might suggest that physician assessments (as documented in final billing diagnoses or physician notes) could be used to specify dizziness subgroups, ED visit diagnoses tend to be symptom-based (eg, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision [ICD-10] code R42: dizziness) rather than specific diagnoses (eg, ICD-10 code H81.09 Meniere disease), and physician assessments of dizziness in clinical notes have poor reliability and accuracy. This latter point about physician inconsistency in evaluating the patient symptom of dizziness has led to a preponderance of clinician-oriented educational interventions in the extant dizziness literature, which tends to emphasize simplified assessment tools (eg, HINTS) or clinical decision supports in pursuit of a clinician-oriented outcome, such as a decreased miss rate for stroke. Clinician-oriented interventions tend to target overuse of low-value care in the diagnostic workup for dizziness symptoms (routine CT for triggered episodic vestibular syndrome), which we also observed in this study: 63% of study participants received a CT scan, 28% received magnetic resonance imaging.
