## Question

Hyperparathyroidism management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hyperparathyroidism management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying the etiology. Then, I should evaluate target organ involvement and surgical candidacy. Next, I will outline definitive surgical management, followed by medical therapy for those not undergoing surgery. After that, I need to address special populations and postoperative care. Finally, I should define monitoring protocols and quality metrics, and close with a concise decision algorithm that integrates these elements.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and classify the etiology, because management hinges on getting this right. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a biochemical diagnosis of hypercalcemia with inappropriately normal or elevated PTH, after excluding secondary causes such as vitamin D deficiency, CKD, malabsorption, or thiazide/diuretic use; I should double-check 25-hydroxyvitamin D and renal function before labeling PHPT, and I need to remember that PTH assay generation can influence interpretation, though in classic PHPT the diagnosis is usually unaffected by assay type [^113RT9pz] [^111g74q9]. Hold on, I should verify the calcium threshold I'm using: serum calcium more than 1.0 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal supports surgery in otherwise asymptomatic patients, and I must not conflate normocalcemic PHPT, which has elevated PTH with normal calcium and is a diagnosis of exclusion, with classic PHPT [^117J3Tye] [^1117XBS1].

> Next, I should review target organ involvement because it drives surgical decisions. I need to check bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and distal one-third radius, since cortical bone loss at the radius is characteristic; vertebral imaging is warranted to detect silent fractures, and renal assessment should include eGFR, 24-hour urine calcium, and renal imaging for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, as these findings reclassify many "asymptomatic" patients to symptomatic disease [^113dWWvX] [^114Mmhe2]. Wait, let me verify the renal threshold: hypercalciuria above 400 mg/day is a surgical indication, and I should also consider that persistent hypercalcemia and reduced BMD are common reasons to proceed with parathyroidectomy even without overt symptoms [^117J3Tye].

> I will now examine surgical candidacy using contemporary guideline criteria. Surgery is indicated for all symptomatic PHPT, for serum calcium more than 1.0 mg/dL above normal, for osteoporosis or fragility/vertebral fracture, for eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m², for age 50 years or younger at diagnosis, and for hypercalciuria above 400 mg/day; importantly, many patients who initially appear asymptomatic reveal skeletal or renal involvement on targeted testing, shifting them into surgical candidacy [^117J3Tye] [^112xV7fq]. Hold on, I should verify the age criterion: yes, age 50 or younger at diagnosis is an indication regardless of symptoms, reflecting the cumulative burden of untreated disease over decades [^115f65xC].

> For definitive therapy, parathyroidectomy is the only curative treatment and should be performed by an experienced endocrine surgeon. Let me think about approach: focused minimally invasive parathyroidectomy with intraoperative PTH monitoring is appropriate when localization identifies a single adenoma, whereas bilateral exploration is preferred for nonlocalized or multigland disease; cure is typically defined by normalization of calcium and a greater than 50% PTH drop from baseline, with biochemical cure rates around 96% in experienced hands [^116GNMhu] [^116b6nbc]. I should confirm that preoperative imaging is for localization only, not diagnosis, and that negative imaging should not preclude surgical referral when criteria are met [^113ozvcX] [^1119hk9G].

> But wait, what if the patient declines surgery or is high risk? I need to ensure appropriate medical management. Cinacalcet is first-line to lower serum calcium into the normal range, though it has minimal effect on BMD; bisphosphonates or denosumab improve BMD but do not reliably lower calcium, so combination therapy can be considered when both hypercalcemia and low BMD coexist, albeit with lower-quality evidence supporting combined regimens [^1152z3aX] [^113LsBWi]. I should double-check vitamin D management: replete to at least 20–30 ng/mL, as deficiency worsens secondary hyperparathyroidism and can confound the picture, and maintain age-appropriate calcium intake per IOM guidance without restricting calcium in PHPT [^1163j2zS] [^116XPDL4].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with normocalcemic PHPT. Evidence is insufficient to recommend routine surgery, but if the same surgical criteria used for hypercalcemic PHPT are met, surgery can be reasonable; importantly, nPHPT has higher rates of multigland disease and may require bilateral exploration, and some patients progress to hypercalcemia over time, so individualized risk–benefit discussions are essential [^115SoFjt] [^114Tu7pc]. I should confirm that medical therapy with alendronate improves BMD in nPHPT when surgery is deferred, and that ongoing surveillance for progression is prudent [^114Tu7pc].

> For secondary hyperparathyroidism due to CKD, I need to ensure I address modifiable drivers first: control phosphate, correct vitamin D deficiency, and optimize calcium balance; calcimimetics, calcitriol or vitamin D analogs, or combinations are appropriate when PTH remains persistently elevated despite these measures, with KDIGO suggesting therapy when PTH is progressively rising or persistently above the upper reference limit for the assay after correcting modifiable factors [^113pQnhF] [^116VxgE8]. Hold on, I should verify the operative endpoint in tertiary hyperparathyroidism: success is defined by normalization of calcium rather than normalization of PTH, and subtotal parathyroidectomy is commonly favored when feasible [^1171bMy7].

> Postoperative care requires anticipation of hypocalcemia. I should confirm that transient hypoparathyroidism is managed with calcium and calcitriol, weaning as tolerated, and that recombinant PTH can be considered for prolonged hypoparathyroidism beyond 12 months; I also need to check for hungry bone syndrome in patients with severe preoperative bone disease and adjust calcium and vitamin D accordingly [^111uRmmN] [^116Jb7ew]. Let me verify cure definitions: biochemical cure is typically defined by normal calcium and PTH beyond 6 months, with special attention in normocalcemic patients to persistent PTH elevation that may reflect secondary drivers or residual disease [^112NYyQA] [^111MsM8p].

> For patients managed nonoperatively, I should double-check the monitoring cadence. Annual assessment of serum calcium, PTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, eGFR, and 24-hour urine calcium is recommended, with periodic BMD every 1–2 years and renal imaging if clinically indicated; progression occurs in about 25% over several years, so vigilance is warranted [^11266dkG]. Hold on, I should verify that delays in diagnosis and treatment are associated with worse outcomes; indeed, prolonged time to treatment beyond one year correlates with increased disease sequelae, reinforcing the need for timely action when criteria are met [^111H9AXb].

> I need to ensure quality metrics are embedded in care pathways. Key quality indicators include documenting surgical indications, using experienced endocrine surgeons, confirming vitamin D repletion, performing appropriate skeletal and renal imaging, and ensuring structured follow-up for nonoperative patients; implementing these can reduce unwarranted variation and improve outcomes [^11533T5w]. Let me reconsider the cost-effectiveness point: multiple analyses show surgery is more effective and cost-effective than long-term observation or pharmacotherapy in appropriate candidates, supporting early referral when criteria are met [^114BJqUx] [^117J3Tye].

> To synthesize a practical decision algorithm, I should confirm the following: if PHPT is symptomatic or meets any surgical criterion, refer for parathyroidectomy; if not, consider medical therapy with cinacalcet for hypercalcemia and antiresorptives for low BMD, or observation with structured annual monitoring; if uncertainty remains, pursue multidisciplinary conference and reassess over time for progression, always anchoring decisions to patient values, comorbidities, and life expectancy [^117YG2PD] [^113RT9pz]. Hold on, I should verify one last nuance: persistent or recurrent disease warrants re-evaluation by an experienced parathyroid surgeon, with confirmation of the biochemical diagnosis, review of prior records, and assessment of vocal cord function before deciding on reoperation [^116Qrvj1].

Hyperparathyroidism management is **tailored to type and severity**, with surgery as the definitive therapy for primary disease [^117J3Tye] and medical therapy for secondary/tertiary or when surgery is contraindicated [^116VxgE8] [^notfound]. For primary hyperparathyroidism, **parathyroidectomy is first-line** for symptomatic patients or those with serum calcium > 1.0 mg/dL above normal, osteoporosis, fragility fracture, vertebral compression fracture, or nephrolithiasis [^111RbJRd] [^117J3Tye]; minimally invasive techniques with intraoperative PTH monitoring achieve high cure rates [^115adJ2W]. For secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism, **cinacalcet and vitamin D analogs** are used to control PTH and calcium [^116VxgE8], with surgery reserved for refractory cases or persistent hypercalcemia [^1171bMy7]. Medical therapy includes cinacalcet to lower calcium, bisphosphonates or denosumab to improve bone density, and vitamin D/calcium to correct deficiency while avoiding hypercalcemia [^1152z3aX] [^113LsBWi] [^111DWHjG]. Monitoring includes serum calcium, PTH, renal function, and bone density; recurrence requires re-evaluation and often repeat surgery or medical therapy [^116qGStt] [^112NYyQA] [^111dqGvZ].

## Classification and clinical presentation

Hyperparathyroidism is classified into **three main types**:

| **Type** | **Description** | **Clinical presentation** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary (PHPT) | Overproduction of PTH by parathyroid adenoma, hyperplasia, or carcinoma | - Hypercalcemia <br/> - Nephrolithiasis <br/> - Osteoporosis <br/> - Neuropsychiatric symptoms [^116nAg13] |
| Secondary (SHPT) | Compensatory PTH elevation due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or vitamin D deficiency | - Hypocalcemia or normocalcemia <br/> - Bone pain <br/> - Fractures <br/> - Vascular calcifications [^112AkioF] |
| Tertiary (THPT) | Autonomous PTH secretion after prolonged secondary hyperparathyroidism | - Persistent hypercalcemia <br/> - Severe bone disease <br/> - Pruritus [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis and **classification** are essential for management and include:

- **Biochemical testing**: Serum calcium, PTH, phosphate, creatinine, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and 24-hour urinary calcium excretion [^113RT9pz].

- **Imaging**: Neck ultrasound, sestamibi scan, and 4D-CT for localization of abnormal parathyroid glands [^113ozvcX].

- **Bone density assessment**: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) to evaluate osteoporosis [^114Mmhe2].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is the **definitive treatment** for primary hyperparathyroidism, with minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) preferred when feasible. Intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring is used to confirm cure [^111g74q9].

---

### Indications for surgery

Indications for surgery vary by **subtype**:

| **Condition** | **Indications for surgery** |
|-|-|
| Primary hyperparathyroidism | - Symptomatic patients <br/> - Serum calcium > 1.0 mg/dL above normal <br/> - Osteoporosis or fragility fractures <br/> - Vertebral compression fractures <br/> - Nephrolithiasis <br/> - Age ≤ 50 years [^111RbJRd] [^115f65xC] |
| Secondary hyperparathyroidism | - Refractory to medical therapy <br/> - Persistent hypercalcemia <br/> - Severe bone disease <br/> - Pruritus <br/> - Vascular calcifications [^notfound] |
| Tertiary hyperparathyroidism | - Persistent hypercalcemia after renal transplantation <br/> - Severe bone disease <br/> - Pruritus [^1171bMy7] |

---

### Surgical techniques

- **Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP)**: Preferred for single-gland disease with IOPTH confirmation [^116b6nbc].

- **Bilateral neck exploration**: Used for multigland disease or unsuccessful localization [^116b6nbc].

- **Intraoperative PTH monitoring**: Confirms biochemical cure [^111g74q9].

---

### Complications and outcomes

Complications include transient hypocalcemia, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism; however, surgery provides **high cure rates** and significant improvements in bone mineral density and quality of life [^116GNMhu].

---

## Medical management

Medical therapy is indicated for patients who are not surgical candidates or as adjunctive treatment, and includes:

- **Cinacalcet**: Lowers serum calcium and PTH, particularly useful in secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism [^1152z3aX].

- **Bisphosphonates**: Improve bone mineral density but do not significantly lower calcium [^113LsBWi].

- **Denosumab**: Alternative to bisphosphonates [^113LsBWi].

- **Vitamin D and calcium supplementation**: Correct deficiency, carefully monitored to avoid hypercalcemia [^111H4sYr].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential to detect recurrence or progression, including **serum calcium, PTH, renal function, and bone density** assessments [^113RT9pz].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Emerging therapies include **calcimimetics, denosumab, and radiofrequency ablation**; ongoing research aims to refine surgical techniques, improve medical therapies, and enhance patient selection [^113LsBWi].

---

Hyperparathyroidism management is individualized, with surgery as the definitive treatment for primary disease and medical therapy for secondary/tertiary or when surgery is contraindicated. Regular monitoring and emerging therapies continue to **improve outcomes** [^117YG2PD].

### Management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^112EhSbW]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Since the last international guidelines were published in 2014 on the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), new information has become available with regard to evaluation, diagnosis, epidemiology, genetics, classical and nonclassical manifestations, surgical and nonsurgical approaches, and natural history. To provide the most current summary of these developments, an international group, consisting of over 50 experts in these various aspects of PHPT, was convened. This paper provides the results of the task force that was assigned to review the information on the management of PHPT. For this task force on the management of PHPT, two questions were the subject of systematic reviews using the Gradingof Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. The full report addressing surgical and nonsurgical management of PHPT, utilizing the GRADE methodology, is published separately in this series. In this report, we summarize the results of that methodological review and expand them to encompass a much larger body of new knowledge that did not specifically fit the criteria of the GRADE methodology. Together, both the systematic and narrative reviews of the literature, summarized in this paper, give the most complete information available to date. A panel of experts then considered the last set of international guidelines in light of the newer data and assessed the need for their revision. This report provides the evidentiary background to the guidelines report. In that report, evidence from all task forces is synthesized into a summary statement and revised guidelines for the evaluation and management of PHPT. © 2022 The Authors.

### Methodology for the guidelines on evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism [^114jRBXb]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

To develop guidelines for hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism, the panel assembled a panel of experts in parathyroid disorders, general endocrinologists, representatives of the Hypoparathyroidism Association, and systematic review and guideline methodologists. The guideline panel referred to a formal process following the Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) methodology to issue GRADEd recommendations. In this approach, panelists and methodologists formatted the questions, conducted systematic reviews, evaluated risk of bias, assessed certainty of evidence, and presented a summary of findings in a transparent fashion. For most recommendations, the task forces used a less structured approach largely based on narrative reviews to issue non-GRADEd recommendations. The panel issued Eight GRADEd recommendations (seven for hypoparathyroidism and one for hyperparathyroidism). Each GRADEd recommendation is linked to the underlying body of evidence and judgments regarding the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations, values and preferences, and costs, feasibility, acceptability and equity. This article summarizes the methodology for issuing GRADEd and non-GRADEd recommendations for patients with hypoparathyroidism or hyperparathyroidism. © 2022 The Authors.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: summary statement and guidelines from the fifth international workshop [^117YG2PD]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The last international guidelines on the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) were published in 2014. Research since that time has led to new insights into epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, measurements, genetics, outcomes, presentations, new imaging modalities, target and other organ systems, pregnancy, evaluation, and management. Advances in all these areas are demonstrated by the reference list in which the majority of listings were published after the last set of guidelines. It was thus, timely to convene an international group of over 50 experts to review these advances in our knowledge. Four Task Forces considered: 1. Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, and Genetics; 2. Classical and Nonclassical Features; 3. Surgical Aspects; and 4. Management. For Task Force 4 on the Management of PHPT, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology addressed surgical management of asymptomatic PHPT and non-surgical medical management of PHPT. The findings of this systematic review that applied GRADE methods to randomized trials are published as part of this series. Task Force 4 also reviewed a much larger body of new knowledge from observations studies that did not specifically fit the criteria of GRADE methodology. The full reports of these 4 Task Forces immediately follow this summary statement. Distilling the essence of all deliberations of all Task Force reports and Methodological reviews, we offer, in this summary statement, evidence-based recommendations and guidelines for the evaluation and management of PHPT. Different from the conclusions of the last workshop, these deliberations have led to revisions of renal guidelines and more evidence for the other recommendations. The accompanying papers present an in-depth discussion of topics summarized in this report. © 2022 The Authors.

### Indications for surgical management of hyperparathyroidism: a review [^117Qrz1b]. JAMA Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is a common clinical entity, with approximately 100 000 new cases diagnosed each year in the United States. Most patients with pHPT have a relatively mild form of the disease and present with few if any overt signs or symptoms. This has led to a dilemma regarding which patients should be considered for parathyroid surgery. In this article, we review the established literature on the indications for surgery in asymptomatic pHPT and discuss the most recent consensus conference guidelines.

Observations

The reviewed literature suggests that there were improved outcomes among patients with asymptomatic pHPT who underwent curative surgery.

Conclusions and Relevance

Most patients with pHPT should be considered for parathyroidectomy. More randomized clinical trials are needed to strongly support a surgical recommendation for all asymptomatic patients with pHPT.

### Who benefits from treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism? [^116nQNtg]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Parathyroidectomy (PTx) is the only definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), but is commonly underutilized. Most patients are medically observed, whereas approximately 30% of patients are treated operatively. PTx is a low-risk surgical procedure and the most cost-effective treatment option. An international consensus statement was published in 1990 to guide clinicians in the management of patients with PHPT, particularly those with asymptomatic disease. Most patients with PHPT and low perioperative risk benefit from surgical treatment, regardless of whether they meet consensus criteria, due to fracture risk reduction, health-related quality-of-life improvements, and prevention or mitigation of disease progression.

### The surgical management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the fourth international workshop [^115adJ2W]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The surgical management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) has undergone considerable advances over the past two decades. The purpose of this report is to review these advances.

Participants

This subgroup was constituted by the Steering Committee of the Fourth International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism to address key questions related to the surgical management of PHPT.

Evidence

Data since the last International Workshop were presented and discussed in detail. The topics included improvements in preoperative imaging, intraoperative adjuncts, refinements in local and regional anesthesia, and rapid intraoperative PTH assays.

Consensus Process

Questions were developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search for relevant studies was undertaken. After extensive review and discussion, the subgroup agreed on what recommendations should be made to the Expert Panel regarding surgical approaches to parathyroidectomy.

Conclusions

1) All patients with PHPT who meet surgical criteria should be referred to an experienced endocrine surgeon to discuss the risks, benefits, and potential complications of surgery. 2) Patients who do not meet surgical criteria and in whom there are no medical contraindications to surgery may request a visit with an experienced endocrine surgeon. Alternatively, a multidisciplinary endocrine conference with surgeon involvement could be employed to address all relevant issues. 3) Imaging is not a diagnostic procedure; it is a localization procedure to help the surgeon optimize the operative plan. 4) The frequency of hereditary forms of PHPT may be underappreciated and needs to be assessed with increased vigilance. And 5) surgery is likely to benefit patients due to high cure rates, low complication rates, and the likelihood of reversing skeletal manifestations.

### Medical management of primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the fourth international workshop on the management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism [^1163j2zS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The only available definitive therapy is parathyroidectomy, which is appropriate to consider in all patients. The purpose of this report is to provide an update on calcium and vitamin D supplementation and medical management for those patients with PHPT who cannot or do not want to undergo surgery.

Methods

Questions were developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken, and relevant articles published between 2008 and 2013 were reviewed in detail. The questions were addressed by the panel of experts, and consensus was established at the time of the workshop.

Conclusions

The recommended calcium intake in patients with PHPT should follow guidelines established for all individuals. It is not recommended to limit calcium intake in patients with PHPT who do not undergo surgery. Patients with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be repleted with doses of vitamin D aiming to bring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to ≥ 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) at a minimum, but a goal of ≥ 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) also is reasonable. Pharmacological approaches are available and should be reserved for those patients in whom it is desirable to lower the serum calcium, increase BMD, or both. For the control of hypercalcemia, cinacalcet is the treatment of choice. Cinacalcet reduces serum calcium concentrations to normal in many cases, but has only a modest effect on serum PTH levels. However, bone mineral density (BMD) does not change. To improve BMD, bisphosphonate therapy is recommended. The best evidence is for the use of alendronate, which improves BMD at the lumbar spine without altering the serum calcium concentration. To reduce the serum calcium and improve BMD, combination therapy with both agents is reasonable, but strong evidence for the efficacy of that approach is lacking.

### The management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^114h1XPC]. Clinical Endocrinology (2002). Low credibility.

Recent improvements in parathyroid imaging have led to renewed interest in the criteria for, and the surgical approach to, parathyroidectomy. It therefore seemed appropriate to review current evidence relating to the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism for those working within a general endocrine service. The recommendations are based on an electronic search spanning the past decade using the search terms hyperparathyroidism, management and parathyroidectomy/surgery, but we have also included key publications outside this period. The findings have been graded systematically (Appendix), according to the quality of the information available, to indicate the level of evidence on which they are based.

### Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: summary statement from the third international workshop [^115XLzbP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this report is to guide the use of diagnostics and management for this condition in clinical practice.

Participants

Interested professional societies selected representatives for the consensus committee and provided funding for a one-day meeting. A subgroup of this committee set the program and developed key questions for review. Consensus was established at a closed meeting that followed and at subsequent discussions.

Evidence

Each question was addressed by a relevant literature search (on PubMed), and the data were presented for discussion at the group meeting.

Consensus Process

Consensus was achieved by a group meeting. Statements were prepared and reviewed by all authors who represented the Planning Committee and the participating professional societies.

### Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: summary statement from the fourth international workshop [^111dqGvZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is routinely encountered in clinical practices of endocrinology throughout the world. This report distills an update of current information about diagnostics, clinical features, and management of this disease into a set of revised guidelines.

Participants

Participants, representing an international constituency, with interest and expertise in various facets of asymptomatic PHPT constituted four Workshop Panels that developed key questions to be addressed. They then convened in an open 3-day conference September 19–21, 2013, in Florence, Italy, when a series of presentations and discussions addressed these questions. A smaller subcommittee, the Expert Panel, then met in closed session to reach an evidence-based consensus on how to address the questions and data that were aired in the open forum.

Evidence

Preceding the conference, each question was addressed by a relevant, extensive literature search. All presentations and deliberations of the Workshop Panels and the Expert Panel were based upon the latest information gleaned from this literature search.

Consensus Process

The expert panel considered all the evidence provided by the individual Workshop Panels and then came to consensus.

Conclusion

In view of new findings since the last International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic PHPT, guidelines for management have been revised. The revised guidelines include: 1) recommendations for more extensive evaluation of the skeletal and renal systems; 2) skeletal and/or renal involvement as determined by further evaluation to become part of the guidelines for surgery; and 3) more specific guidelines for monitoring those who do not meet guidelines for parathyroid surgery. These guidelines should help endocrinologists and surgeons caring for patients with PHPT. A blueprint for future research is proposed to foster additional investigation into issues that remain uncertain or controversial.

### What medical options should be considered for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism? [^115Ndujv]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common, often asymptomatic, endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcaemia in the face of a nonsuppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. For those with symptomatic disease or who meet surgical criteria, parathyroidectomy is the treatment of choice. However, those patients who do not meet surgical criteria or who cannot undergo or refuse surgery must be managed medically. Medical management of PHPT involves continual assessment to determine who will benefit from surgical intervention, replacement of vitamin D, treatment of parathyroid bone disease and management of hypercalcaemia and renal stone disease.

### The landmark series: management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115o2tun]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgery is the only definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). The surgical management of PHPT has evolved over the past several decades in response to the continually growing body of evidence supporting its effectiveness in both symptomatic and asymptomatic disease. As imaging modalities for localization, operative approach, and intraoperative adjuncts, such as intraoperative parathyroid hormone testing, have been optimized, careful evaluation of the timing of parathyroidectomy in relationship to the disease's natural history has been pursued to limit the detrimental end-organ effects of untreated PHPT. Herein, we review select studies examining key aspects of PHPT management fundamental to the practicing surgical oncologist and endocrine surgeon caring for patients with PHPT.

### Primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism [^112eMqsT]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism have evolved since their original description. What was once a debilitating disease has now become one with few symptoms on initial presentation. Complications from these disorders have decreased significantly because of earlier detection. Improved management of patients with chronic renal disease has also limited complications among those with secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Appropriate management is essential even in the early phase of the disorder to minimize the morbidities that may result if left untreated.

### When would I use medical therapies for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism? [^112DEB6V]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Although there may be controversy surrounding the indications for parathyroidectomy in primary hyperparathyroidism, it remains the only accepted definitive therapy. However, even if parathyroidectomy is indicated, some patients refuse surgery, are medically unfit or have residual or recurrent disease inaccessible to further surgery. Some of these patients may be suitable for long-term observation but others require intervention for management of symptomatic or moderate to severe hypercalcaemia, loss of bone mineral density or renal calculi. The selection of a suitable therapy for each patient should be individualized.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^114guUzo]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

In this Review, we describe the pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), with a focus on recent advances in the field. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder that is characterized by hypercalcaemia and elevated or inappropriately normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone. Most often, the presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic in regions of the world where serum levels of calcium are routinely measured. In addition to mild hypercalcaemia, PHPT can manifest with osteoporosis and hypercalciuria as well as with vertebral fractures and nephrolithiasis, both of which can be asymptomatic. Other clinical forms of PHPT, such as classical disease and normocalcaemic PHPT, are less common. Parathyroidectomy, the only curative treatment for PHPT, is recommended in patients with symptoms and those with asymptomatic disease who are at risk of progression or have subclinical evidence of end-organ sequelae. Parathyroidectomy results in an increase in BMD and a reduction in nephrolithiasis. Various medical therapies can increase BMD or reduce serum levels of calcium, but no single drug can do both. More data are needed regarding the neuropsychological manifestations of PHPT and the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to sporadic PHPT, as well as on risk factors for complications of the disorder. Future work that advances our knowledge in these areas will improve the management of the disorder.

In this large database cohort study of 135 034 patients with hypercalcemia, those who were identified as high-risk and without a diagnosis and whose duration of workup or time from diagnosis to treatment exceeded 1 year experienced increased disease sequelae.

Meaning

These findings suggest that missed diagnoses and prolonged time to diagnosis and treatment of PHP are associated with increased disease burden.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113fus1j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the most common cause of hypercalcemia, is most often identified in postmenopausal women. The clinical presentation of PHPT has evolved over the past 40 years to include three distinct clinical phenotypes, each of which has been studied in detail and has led to evolving concepts about target organ involvement, natural history, and management.

Methods

In the present review, I provide an evidence-based summary of this disorder as it has been studied worldwide, citing key concepts and data that have helped to shape our concepts about this disease.

Results

PHPT is now recognized to include three clinical phenotypes: overt target organ involvement, mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia, and high PTH levels with persistently normal albumin-corrected and ionized serum calcium values. The factors that determine which of these clinical presentations is more likely to predominate in a given country include the extent to which biochemical screening is used, vitamin D deficiency is present, and whether parathyroid hormone levels are routinely measured in the evaluation of low bone density or frank osteoporosis. Guidelines for parathyroidectomy apply to all three clinical forms of the disease. If surgical guidelines are not met, parathyroidectomy can also be an appropriate option if no medical contraindications are present. If either the serum calcium or bone mineral density is of concern and surgery is not an option, pharmacological approaches are available and effective.

Conclusions

Advances in our knowledge of PHPT have guided new concepts in diagnosis and management.

### Contemporary management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115Gbaya]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism can be asymptomatic or symptomatic, as well as classic, normocalcemic, or normohormonal. It is important to rule out other causes of hypercalcemia or hyperparathyroidism. Preoperative localization with imaging is necessary for a minimally invasive approach and can be helpful even if planning 4-gland exploration. There are a variety of intraoperative techniques that can assist with localization as well as confirming success. Standard of care remains surgical resection of affected glands. However, there are less invasive management strategies that can be considered for poor surgical candidates.

### Nonsurgical management of mild primary hyperparathyroidism-a reasonable option [^1139fnCF]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a relatively common disorder which is often diagnosed incidentally and characterized in the majority of those affected by mild stable biochemical abnormalities and lack of symptoms. Nephrolithiasis and bone loss leading to an increased risk of fracture are generally accepted complications of PHPT. Some epidemiological studies report associations between PHPT and a wide range of common diseases, but these relationships may be confounded by the increased body weight observed in PHPT. Because there is a dearth of controlled clinical trial evidence in PHPT, optimal management is controversial. For individuals with mild stable PHPT, low fracture risk and no renal stones, observation without intervention is reasonable. Surgical treatment is clearly indicated for patients at risk of severe hypercalcaemia or with nephrolithiasis. For individuals with increased risk of fracture, antiresorptive therapies improve bone mineral density to a similar degree to surgical treatment. Calcimimetic agents may have a role in managing patients with symptomatic PHPT who cannot undergo, or fail, surgical treatment. There is a need for additional randomized clinical trials to inform management of PHPT.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113dWWvX]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To review primary hyperparathyroidism and the key issues that are relevant to the practicing endocrinologist.

Methods

The latest information on the presentation, diagnosis, and traditional and nontraditional aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism is reviewed.

Results

The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is straightforward when the traditional hypercalcemic patient is documented to have an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Commonly, patients are identified who have normal serum calcium levels but elevated PTH levels in whom no secondary causes for hyperparathyroidism can be confirmed. Traditional target organs of primary hyperparathyroidism-the skeleton and the kidneys-continue to be a focus in the patient evaluation. Bone mineral density shows a typical pattern of involvement with the distal one-third radius being selectively reduced compared with the lumbar spine in which bone mineral density is generally well maintained. Neurocognitive and cardiovascular aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism, while a focus of recent interest, have not been shown to definitively aid in the decision for or against surgery. The recommendation for surgery in primary hyperparathyroidism is based on guidelines that focus on the serum calcium level, renal function, bone mineral density, and age. In patients who do not meet guidelines, a nonsurgical management approach has merit.

Conclusions

Primary hyperparathyroidism is continuing to show changes in its clinical profile, with normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism being a topic of great interest. Skeletal and renal features of primary hyperparathyroidism drive, in most cases, the decision to recommend surgery. In patients who do not meet any criteria for surgery, a conservative approach with appropriate monitoring is acceptable.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: part two: surgical management [^1164bP4G]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is caused by the overproduction of parathyroid hormone by 1 or more parathyroid glands resulting in hypercalcemia and its downstream clinical consequences. The definitive management of PHPT is surgery. Approaches to successful surgery include bilateral exploration or focused parathyroidectomy with intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring, which in experienced hands are both associated with a low risk of complications.

Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To formulate clinical consensus recommendations on the presentation, assessment, and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in adults.

Methods

Representatives from relevant Australian and New Zealand Societies used a systematic approach for adaptation of guidelines (ADAPTE) to derive an evidence-informed position statement addressing nine key questions.

Results

PHPT is a biochemical diagnosis. Serum calcium should be measured in patients with suggestive symptoms, reduced bone mineral density or minimal trauma fractures, and in those with renal stones. Other indications are detailed in the manuscript. In patients with hypercalcaemia, intact parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, phosphate, and renal function should be measured. In established PHPT, assessment of bone mineral density, vertebral fractures, urinary tract calculi/nephrocalcinosis and quantification of urinary calcium excretion is warranted. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment and is warranted for all symptomatic patients and should be considered for asymptomatic patients without contraindications to surgery and with > 10 years life expectancy. In patients who do not undergo surgery, we recommend annual evaluation for disease progression. Where the diagnosis is not clear or the risk-benefit ratio is not obvious, multidisciplinary discussion and formulation of a consensus management plan is appropriate. Genetic testing for familial hyperparathyroidism is recommended in selected patients.

Conclusions

These clinical consensus recommendations were developed to provide clinicians with contemporary guidance on the assessment and management of PHPT in adults. It is anticipated that improved health outcomes for individuals and the population will be achieved at a decreased cost to the community.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: an update on diagnostic and management challenges [^114Tu7pc]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). Medium credibility.

Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition that can present with intermittent hypercalcemia or may evolve into hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. This milder biochemical entity remains incompletely understood because of a lack of long-term health outcomes regarding both medical and surgical approaches to its management. Medical therapies have shown some efficacy. A limited number of studies have found that bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density, and calcimimetics may decrease the risk of nephrolithiasis in patients with normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism. Studies have also described patient outcomes after applying the same surgical criteria used for patients with hypercalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism to those with the normocalcaemic form of the disease. These studies suggest that parathyroid surgery appears to be effective in normalizing elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentrations and decreasing adverse renal and skeletal outcomes in patients with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism. Given the available data and overall lack of consensus regarding the optimal management of these patients, a reasonable approach is to tailor treatment to the individual patient by considering their risk factors for new or accelerated bone loss, kidney stones, diminished quality of life, and cardiovascular disease.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for the definitive surgical management of secondary and tertiary renal hyperparathyroidism [^1169C8aj]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence-based recommendations for safe, effective, and appropriate treatment of secondary (SHPT) and tertiary (THPT) renal hyperparathyroidism.

Background

Hyperparathyroidism is common among patients with chronic kidney disease, end-stage kidney disease, and kidney transplant. The surgical management of SHPT and THPT is nuanced and requires a multidisciplinary approach. There are currently no clinical practice guidelines that address the surgical treatment of SHPT and THPT.

Methods

Medical literature was reviewed from January 1, 1985 to present January 1, 2021 by a panel of 10 experts in SHPT and THPT. Recommendations using the best available evidence was constructed. The American College of Physicians grading system was used to determine levels of evidence. Recommendations were discussed to consensus. The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons membership reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of the content.

Results

These clinical guidelines present the epidemiology and pathophysiology of SHPT and THPT and provide recommendations for work-up and management of SHPT and THPT for all involved clinicians. It outlines the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management of SHPT and THPT, as well as related definitions, operative techniques, morbidity, and outcomes. Specific topics include Pathogenesis and Epidemiology, Initial Evaluation, Imaging, Preoperative and Perioperative Care, Surgical Planning and Parathyroidectomy, Adjuncts and Approaches, Outcomes, and Reoperation.

Conclusions

Evidence-based guidelines were created to assist clinicians in the optimal management of secondary and tertiary renal hyperparathyroidism.

### Management of primary hyperparathyroidism: historical and contemporary perspectives [^1117XBS1]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a frequently diagnosed endocrine condition most commonly caused by a single parathyroid adenoma. Our understanding of the epidemiology and management of PHPT have evolved in the past few decades. Asymptomatic PHPT has been the most common presentation in developed countries since the advent of routine biochemical screening. Symptomatic disease is now also decreasing in developing nations. Normocalcemic PHPT is a newer phenotype that can be diagnosed in the setting of elevated PTH concentrations with persistently normal serum calcium, however, evaluation for secondary causes of hyperparathyroidism is critical as it is a diagnosis of exclusion. Genetic testing can be helpful in patients younger than 30 years of age and/or patients with intermediate or equivocal ranges of the urinary calcium to creatinine ratio (between 0.01 and 0.02) to differentiate PHPT from FHH and to evaluate for other genetic etiologies that may affect management. Surgery is the recommended treatment modality for symptomatic PHPT, and patients with asymptomatic PHPT meeting recommended criteria should also be considered for parathyroidectomy. "Asymptomatic" patients should be screened for the presence of nephrolithiasis and/or vertebral fracture, since many will be reclassified as having symptomatic disease with further investigation. For poor surgical candidates or patients not meeting criteria for surgery, medical therapy includes cinacalcet for hypercalcemia and antiresorptive therapies for osteoporosis.

### Quality indicators for the diagnosis and management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^11533T5w]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is a common endocrine disorder with many diagnostic and treatment challenges. Despite high-quality guidelines, care is variable, and there is low adherence to evidence-based treatment pathways.

Objective

To develop quality indicators (QIs) to evaluate the diagnosis and treatment of pHPT that could measure, improve, and optimize quality of care and outcomes for patients with this disease.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This quality improvement study used a guideline-based approach to develop QIs that were ranked by a Canadian 9-member expert panel of 3 endocrinologists, 3 otolaryngologists, and 3 endocrine surgeons. Data were analyzed between September 2020 and May 2021.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Candidate indicators (CIs) were extracted from published primary hyperparathyroidism guidelines and summarized with supporting evidence. The 9-member expert panel rated each CI on the validity, reliability, and feasibility of measurement. Final QIs were selected from CIs using the modified RAND-University of California, Los Angeles appropriateness methodology. All panelists were then asked to rank the top 5 QIs for primary, endocrine, and surgical care.

Results

Forty QIs were identified and evaluated by the expert panel. After 2 rounds of evaluations and discussion, a total of 18 QIs were selected as appropriate measures of high-quality care. The top 5 QIs for primary, endocrine, and surgical care were selected following panelist rankings.

Conclusions and Relevance

This quality improvement study proposes 18 QIs for the diagnosis and management of pHPT. Furthermore, the top 5 QIs applicable to physicians commonly treating pHPT, including general physicians, internists, endocrinologists, otolaryngologists, and surgeons, are included. These QIs not only assess the quality of care to guide the process of improvement, but also can assess the implementation of evidence-based guideline recommendations. Using these indicators in clinical practice and health system registries can improve quality and cost-effectiveness of care for patients with pHPT.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: recent advances [^114Mmhe2]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to describe recent advances and changes in the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).

Recent Findings

Although it has long been recognized that asymptomatic PHPT is associated with bone loss, particularly at cortical skeletal sites when evaluated with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, new imaging techniques suggest that trabecular skeletal deterioration as well as clinically silent vertebral fractures and nephrolithiasis are common. Nonclassical targets of asymptomatic PHPT as well as the effect of vitamin D deficiency and treatment upon PHPT presentation have been the subject of recent intense investigation. Randomized clinical trials are now available regarding the effect of parathyroidectomy (PTX) upon both classical and nonclassical target organs. They have confirmed results from observational studies with regard to the skeletal benefits of PTX but have not consistently shown improvements in nonclassical symptoms.

Summary

These findings have led to recommendations for more extensive renal and skeletal evaluation and broader criteria for PTX in PHPT. In addition to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, vertebral and renal imaging is recommended. When available, trabecular imaging techniques may be helpful. PTX criteria now include subclinical kidney stones, vertebral fractures and hypercalciuria, in addition to those based on age, serum calcium, bone densitometry and renal function.

### Role of surgery in mild primary hyperparathyroidism in the elderly [^111YLuFn]. The British Journal of Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

Background

The appropriate management of elderly patients with mild hyperparathyroidism is the subject of much debate.

Methods

A Medline literature search was conducted using the keywords 'hyperparathyroidism', 'asymptomatic' and 'elderly'. The references of the primary sources were examined for further citations. Personally collected cullings from journals and abstracts from journals were used as an additional source of data.

Results and Conclusion

No prospective randomized controlled trial comparing parathyroidectomy with conservative management for patients with mild or asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism has been published. There are a number of longitudinal studies that attempt to characterize the natural history of hyperparathyroidism, but most do not stratify patients according to age when assessing outcome. None the less, it is clear that elderly patients present with a different spectrum of problems, particularly indistinct neuropsychiatric and musculoskeletal symptoms, and these are likely to be improved by surgery. The evidence allows the conclusion that the truly asymptomatic elderly patient can be successfully managed conservatively; there is a good prospect of benefit from surgery for those with symptomatic disease, and such patients should not be denied an operative option.

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: new issues and new questions – bridging the past with the future [^11266dkG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

The earliest clinical descriptions of PHPT pointed to an inexorably progressive disorder. Now, in many asymptomatic individuals who do not meet any surgical guidelines. PHPT in general, does not seem to be progressive. Most asymptomatic patients seem to remain asymptomatic over many years of observation. In those with major clinical manifestations, nephrolithiasis is by far the most common. In these patients, surgery is clearly indicated. Bone densitometry is an indispensable component of the evaluation as well as in monitoring because there is evidence of bone involvement in most patients. This contrasts with the skeletal X-ray, which is invariably negative. Nevertheless, patients with PHPT can show a bone mass measurement either at the cortical or cancellous skeleton that is more than 2 SDs below age- and sex-matched control subjects. Bone density, serum calcium concentration, and/or urinary calcium excretion per se can show evidence for progression in as many as 25% of patients with asymptomatic PHPT. There are newer pharmacologic approaches to PHPT that are the subject of intense investigation. The bisphosphonates and the calcimimetics show particular promise in this regard. Unanswered are such questions as whether the lower bone density in the milder patients will increase substantially as in those who undergo successful parathyroidectomy and whether fracture risk would therefore be reduced. Can medical therapy reduce serum calcium. parathyroid hormone levels, and other biochemical indices of PHPT? Can medical therapy improve bone density without the need for surgery. The issues outlined in this presentation and further amplified in other presentations given in this workshop lead to a series of questions that, in turn, may lead to modified guidelines for the management of these patients. The questions are as follows. (1) Should there be any changes in diagnostic criteria for PHPT? (2) Should the guidelines for surgery in PHPT be changed in light of new data over the past decade? What should those guidelines be? (3) At present, is there sufficient evidence of clinical benefit with specific medical therapies to recommend their use? In which patients? (4) Can some patients be followed without surgery? If so, how should they be monitored? (5) When surgery is the preferred option, what are the relative merits of minimally invasive procedures compared with more conventional surgery? (6) What is the role of localization techniques in identifying abnormal parathyroid tissue preoperatively and intraoperatively? Are they sufficiently helpful and cost effective to warrant their use in all patients who undergo parathyroid surgery? If not, in what patients should they be recommended? (7) What items should be placed on the research agenda for PHPT over the next decade?

### Medical management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the third international workshop [^111rNaFZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine disorder that is frequently asymptomatic. The 2002 International Workshop on Asymptomatic PHPT addressed medical management of asymptomatic PHPT and summarized the data on nonsurgical approaches to this disease. At the Third International Workshop on Asymptomatic PHPT held in May 2008, this subject was reviewed again in light of data that have since become available. We present the results of a literature review of advances in the medical management of PHPT.

Methods

A series of questions was developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search for relevant studies evaluating the management of PHPT with bisphosphonates, hormone replacement therapy, raloxifene, and calcimimetics was conducted. Existing guidelines and recent unpublished data were also reviewed. All selected relevant articles were reviewed, and the questions developed by the International Task Force were addressed by the Consensus Panel.

Results

Bisphosphonates and hormone replacement therapy are effective in decreasing bone turnover in patients with PHPT and improving bone mineral density (BMD). Fracture data are not available with either treatment. Raloxifene also lowers bone turnover in patients with PHPT. None of these agents, however, significantly lowers serum calcium or PTH levels. The calcimimetic cinacalcet reduces both serum calcium and PTH levels and raises serum phosphorus. Cinacalcet does not, however, reduce bone turnover or improve BMD.

Conclusions

Bisphosphonates and hormone replacement therapy provide skeletal protection in patients with PHPT. Limited data are available regarding skeletal protection in patients with PHPT treated with raloxifene. Calcimimetics favorably alter serum calcium and PTH in PHPT but do not significantly affect either bone turnover or BMD. Medical management of asymptomatic PHPT is a promising option for those who are not candidates for parathyroidectomy.

This brief article is a response to the article by Monge et al. on page 326 entitled Reappraisal of 2003 NKF-K/DOQI guidelines for management of hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease patients.

We recommend that clinical trials be conducted to resolve these points of contention and other critical issues in the management of disorders of mineral metabolism in chronic kidney disease, including secondary hyperparathyroidism. The focus should be on evaluating the effects of alternative strategies on survival, as well as clinical manifestations of cardiovascular and bone disease.

### Current issues in the presentation of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the fourth international workshop [^114uRtpo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This report summarizes data on traditional and nontraditional manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) that have been published since the last International Workshop on PHPT.

Participants

This subgroup was constituted by the Steering Committee to address key questions related to the presentation of PHPT. Consensus was established at a closed meeting of the Expert Panel that followed.

Evidence

Data from the 5-year period between 2008 and 2013 were presented and discussed to determine whether they support changes in recommendations for surgery or nonsurgical follow-up.

Consensus Process

Questions were developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search for relevant studies was undertaken. After extensive review and discussion, the subgroup came to agreement on what changes in the recommendations for surgery or nonsurgical follow-up of asymptomatic PHPT should be made to the Expert Panel.

Conclusions

1) There are limited new data available on the natural history of asymptomatic PHPT. Although recognition of normocalcemic PHPT (normal serum calcium with elevated PTH concentrations; no secondary cause for hyperparathyroidism) is increasing, data on the clinical presentation and natural history of this phenotype are limited. 2) Although there are geographic differences in the predominant phenotypes of PHPT (symptomatic, asymptomatic, normocalcemic), they do not justify geography-specific management guidelines. 3) Recent data using newer, higher resolution imaging and analytic methods have revealed that in asymptomatic PHPT, both trabecular bone and cortical bone are affected. 4) Clinically silent nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis can be detected by renal imaging and should be listed as a new criterion for surgery. 5) Current data do not support a cardiovascular evaluation or surgery for the purpose of improving cardiovascular markers, anatomical or functional abnormalities. 6) Some patients with mild PHPT have neuropsychological complaints and cognitive abnormalities, and some of these patients may benefit from surgical intervention. However, it is not possible at this time to predict which patients with neuropsychological complaints or cognitive issues will improve after successful parathyroid surgery.

### Clinical guidelines and PTH measurement: does assay generation matter? [^111g74q9]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

PTH is an important regulator of calcium and phosphate homeostasis and bone remodeling. It is metabolized into PTH fragments, which are measured to a different extent by PTH assays of different generations because of differences in fragments recognized and lack of assay standardization. PTH is measured in the workup of several conditions, and clinical guidelines provide recommendations concerning these measurements. This review provides an overview of the impact of differences between PTH assays, applying distinct clinical guidelines for primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism and perioperative use of PTH measurements. Guidelines deal with PTH measurement in different ways, recommending either trend monitoring, the use of a fold increase of the upper reference limit, or an absolute PTH cutoff value. For classic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the type of PTH assay used will not affect diagnosis or management because the precise concentration of PTH is less relevant. In chronic kidney disease, the guideline recommends treating secondary hyperparathyroidism above a twofold to ninefold PTH increase, which will result in different clinical decisions depending on the assay used. For patients after bariatric surgery, guidelines state absolute cutoff values for PTH, but the impact of different generation assays is unknown because direct comparison of PTH assays has never been performed. During parathyroid surgery, PTH measurements with a third-generation assay reflect treatment success more rapidly than second-generation assays. Increased awareness among clinicians regarding the complexity of PTH measurements is warranted because it can affect clinical decisions.

### New perspectives in the management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^1116jEy2]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a biochemical syndrome caused by the inappropriate or unregulated overproduction of parathyroid hormone, Leading to hypercalcae-mia. It was previously considered a relatively rare disorder, with clinical manifestations dominated by renal and/or bone disease. However, in modern times the diagnosis is most frequently recognized coincidentally on biochemical testing in patients evaluated for unrelated complaints. Parathyroidectomy is the only curative treatment for PHPT, with improved outcomes in symptomatic patients following this procedure. However, surgical intervention in patients with no clear clinical features remains controversial. The National Institutes for Health (NIH) have developed consensus guidelines giving specific indications for when surgery is recommended in patients with asymptomatic PHPT. This article examines the impact of treatment on asymptomatic PHPT, focusing on bone disease, neurocognitive function, quality of Life, cardiovascular disease and mortality. Medical treatment options, including bisphospho-nates and cinacalcet, are also discussed.

### Management of primary hyperparathyroidism with severe hypercalcemia during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114CyG5i]. Clinical Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

In patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and severe hypercalcemia, parathyroidectomy remains the only curative therapy. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, when many hospital visits are suspended and surgeries cannot be performed, the management of these patients represents a challenging clinical situation. This article presents a literature review and discussion of the pharmacologic management of PHPT and severe hypercalcemia, which can be used as a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic until parathyroidectomy can be performed safely.

Methods

This narrative review was conducted by searching literature on the PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases using the terms primary hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, cinacalcet, bisphosphonates, denosumab, vitamin D, raloxifene, hormone replacement therapy, coronavirus, and COVID-19.

Findings

Appropriate monitoring and remote medical follow-up of these patients are essential until the resolution of the pandemic. Cinacalcet is the drug of choice for controlling hypercalcemia, whereas bisphosphonate or denosumab is the drug for improving bone mineral density. Combined therapy with cinacalcet and bisphosphonates or cinacalcet and denosumab should be considered when the effects on serum calcium and bone mineral density are simultaneously desired.

Implications

Medical management of PHPT and severe hypercalcemia presents a reasonable alternative for parathyroid surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak and should be instituted until the pandemic ends and surgery can be performed safely.

### Evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism summary statement and guidelines from the second international workshop [^114bvFbt]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

This clinical practice guideline addresses the prevention, diagnosis, and management of hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) and provides evidence-based recommendations. The HypoPT task forces included four teams with a total of 50 international experts including representatives from the sponsoring societies. A methodologist (GG) and his team supported the taskforces and conducted the systematic reviews. A formal process following the Gradingof Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and the systematic reviews provided the structure for seven of the guideline recommendations. The task force used a less structured approach based on narrative reviews for 20 non-GRADEd recommendations. Clinicians may consider postsurgical HypoPT permanent if it persists for > 12 months after surgery. To predict which patients will not develop permanent postsurgical HypoPT, we recommend evaluating serum PTH within 12 to 24 hours post total thyroidectomy (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). PTH > 10pg/mL (1.05pmol/L) virtually excludes long-term HypoPT. In individuals with nonsurgical HypoPT, genetic testing may be helpful in the presence of a positive family history of nonsurgical HypoPT, in the presence of syndromic features, or in individuals younger than 40years. HypoPT can be associated with complications, including nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, renal insufficiency, cataracts, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease, depression, and an increased risk of infection. Minimizing complications of HypoPT requires careful evaluation and close monitoring of laboratory indices. In patients with chronic HypoPT, the panel suggests conventional therapy with calcium and active vitamin D metabolites as first-line therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). When conventional therapy is deemed unsatisfactory, the panel considers the use of PTH. © 2022 The Authors.

### Diagnosis of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the fourth international workshop [^113jGG36]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this report is to provide an update on the use of diagnostic tests for this condition in clinical practice.

Participants

This subgroup was constituted by the Steering Committee to address key questions related to the diagnosis of PHPT. Consensus was established at a closed meeting of the Expert Panel that followed.

Evidence

Each question was addressed by a relevant literature search (on PubMed), and the data were presented for discussion at the group meeting.

Consensus Process

Consensus was achieved by a group meeting. Statements were prepared by all authors, with comments relating to accuracy from the diagnosis subgroup and by representatives from the participating professional societies.

Conclusions

We conclude that: 1) reference ranges should be established for serum PTH in vitamin D-replete healthy individuals; 2) second- and third-generation PTH assays are both helpful in the diagnosis of PHPT; 3) normocalcemic PHPT is a variant of the more common presentation of PHPT with hypercalcemia; 4) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations should be measured and, if vitamin D insufficiency is present, it should be treated as part of any management course; 5) genetic testing has the potential to be useful in the differential diagnosis of familial hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: what is the role of parathyroid surgery? [^116iHbJD]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is classically associated with both an elevated or 'inappropriately normal' parathyroid hormone (PTH) level and raised serum calcium. However, in clinical practice, increasing numbers of patients present with raised PTH but normal serum calcium, renal function and vitamin D; this is known as normocalcaemic PHPT (nPHPT). Studies investigating the clinical presentation of this condition have shown that patients may present with hypertension, nephrolithiasis, impaired glucose tolerance, osteoporosis and fragility fractures. The prevalence of such complications in nPHPT is similar to that in classical hypercalcaemic PHPT (hPHPT). Although the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have developed guidelines for the management of PHPT generally, a consensus is yet to be reached on the optimal management of nPHPT specifically. A review of the literature on parathyroidectomy in the treatment of nPHPT revealed that nPHPT patients were more likely to present with multi-glandular disease and significantly less nPHPT patients had an intra-operative PTH fall of > 50% compared with those with hPHPT. These findings demonstrate that patients with nPHPT are more likely to receive bilateral neck explorations and require remedial surgery compared with hPHPT patients. Following surgery, improvements in bone mineral density (BMD) and renal stones are generally observed in those with nPHPT. Where surgery is not possible, medical management with alendronate has been shown to be effective in nPHPT patients. Given the higher incidence of multi-gland disease and greater possibility of remedial surgery in nPHPT, careful consideration of risks and benefits should be made on an individualised basis and surgery should be performed by surgeons experienced in four gland exploration.

### Surgery for asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the third international workshop [^1119hk9G]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Context

An international workshop on primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) was convened on May 13, 2008, to review and update the previous summary statement on the management of asymptomatic PHPT published in 2002.

Evidence Acquisition

Electronic literature sources were systematically reviewed, addressing critical aspects of the surgical issues pertaining to the indications, imaging, surgical treatment, and cost-effective management of patients with PHPT.

Evidence Synthesis

The surgical group concluded that many patients with "asymptomatic" PHPT have neurocognitive symptoms that may be unmasked after successful parathyroidectomy. Furthermore, reduced bone density and increased fracture risk can be improved with parathyroidectomy. When PHPT is symptomatic, it may be associated with nephrolithiasis, increased cardiovascular disease, and decreased survival. Preoperative imaging studies should only be performed to help plan the operation, and negative imaging should never preclude surgical referral. Noninvasive localization studies including ultrasound and sestamibi scans are often employed, especially in anticipation of focused explorations. Invasive localization studies should be reserved for remedial explorations where noninvasive imaging has been unsuccessful.

Conclusions

When performed by expert parathyroid surgeons, parathyroid surgery is safe, cost-effective, and associated with very low perioperative morbidity. Minimally invasive approaches to parathyroid surgery appear to be as effective as the classic bilateral cervical exploration approach.

### Hemodialysis patients' preferences for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism [^112AkioF]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Patient engagement and patient-centered care are critical to the optimal management of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and may improve patients' outcomes and satisfaction with treatment. The "pinnacle" of patient-centered care is shared decision making, whereby patients and physicians agree on a treatment strategy that accounts for the benefits and risks of the available options and patients' priorities for treatment. To promote shared decision making in ESRD, patients' goals, values, and preferences must be elicited, and treatment strategies should be tailored to reflect what is most important to patients. However, owing to the clinical complexity of ESRD, as well as limited time and competing educational priorities for providers, it may be difficult for a provider to fully understand a patient's preferences for each of the many treatment decisions that must be made in ESRD.

One example of a complication of ESRD for which treatment decisions must be made is secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), which is characterized by imbalances in bone and mineral metabolism due to diminished kidney function and particularly manifests in elevated blood levels of parathyroid hormone. SHPT is estimated to affect 72% of patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease. The clinical consequences of SHPT include increased risks of bone disease and vascular calcification.

Treatment options for SHPT center on medications (e.g. vitamin D; oral cinacalcet; and intravenous etelcalcetide, an investigational agent) and surgery (parathyroidectomy). Beyond differences in the type and mode of intervention, each treatment has its own benefit and risk profile, resulting in potentially complex treatment decisions for providers and patients in the management of SHPT. To inform a shared decision-making approach in the management of ESRD and its complications, we sought to elicit patients' preferences for SHPT treatment using a discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey. A study using similar methods was conducted to evaluate patients' preferences for the management of anemia.

### Parathyroidectomy for tertiary hyperparathyroidism: a systematic review [^1171bMy7]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Analyze the efficacy and indications for parathyroidectomy as an intervention for tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

Data Sources

PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library databases.

Review Methods

A systematic literature search was performed using the. Original research articles in English were retrieved using the search terms ("tertiary hyperparathyroidism" OR "3HPT") AND "parathyroidectomy". Articles were analyzed in regards to their surgical indications, operative endpoints, comparison between different surgical interventions, characterization of disease recurrence rates, and evaluation of alternative medical management.

Results

Thirty studies met the criteria for inclusion. Among the studies that report indications for parathyroidectomy, persistent hypercalcemia as well as clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia despite medical therapy predicted which patients would eventually need surgical intervention. The majority of studies comparing the extent of parathyroidectomy recommended a more focused approach to parathyroidectomy when warranted. All studies found that parathyroidectomy was an effective treatment for 3HPT. Three studies discussed alternative conservative approaches.

Conclusion

Interestingly, hyperparathyroidism alone is not an indication for surgery without other findings; rather, symptomatic hypercalcemia appears to be the main indication. Most studies recommend limited or subtotal parathyroidectomy for 3HPT. The operative endpoint of surgery is not necessarily a return of PTH to normal, but a > 50% drop in PTH level even if PTH remains above normal. Additionally, "success" or "cure" is defined as normal calcium levels regardless of whether or not PTH is elevated. It appears the goal of surgery for 3HPT is not a normal PTH value, but a normal calcium level at least six months postoperatively.

This commentary provides a US perspective on the 2009 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis, Evaluation, Prevention, and Treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD). KDIGO is an independent international organization with the primary mission of the promotion, coordination, collaboration, and integration of initiatives to develop and implement clinical practice guidelines for the care of patients with kidney disease. The National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI), recognizing that international guidelines need to be adapted for each country, convened a group of experts to comment on the application and implementation of the KDIGO guideline for patients with CKD in the United States. This commentary puts the KDIGO guideline into the context of the supporting evidence and the setting of care delivered in the United States and summarizes important differences between prior KDOQI guidelines and the newer KDIGO guideline. It also considers the potential impact of a new bundled payment system for dialysis clinics. The KDIGO guideline addresses the evaluation and treatment of abnormalities of CKD-MBD in adults and children with CKD stages 3–5 on long-term dialysis therapy or with a kidney transplant. Tests considered are those that relate to laboratory, bone, and cardiovascular abnormality detection and monitoring. Treatments considered are interventions to treat hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and bone disease in patients with CKD stages 3–5D and 1–5T. Limitations of the evidence are discussed. The lack of definitive clinical outcome trials explains why most recommendations are not of level 1 but of level 2 strength, which means weak or discretionary recommendations. Suggestions for future research highlight priority areas.

### Mild primary hyperparathyroidism: a literature review [^115ACQ1q]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

The biochemical profile of classic primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) consists of both elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. The standard of care is parathyroidectomy unless prohibited by medical comorbidities. Because more patients are undergoing routine bone density evaluation and neck imaging studies for other purposes, there is a subset of people identified with a biochemically mild form of the pHPT that expresses itself as either elevated calcium or parathyroid hormone levels. These patients often do not fall into the criteria for operation based on the National Institutes of Health consensus guidelines, and they can present a challenge of diagnosis and management. The purpose of this paper is to review the available literature on mild pHPT in an effort to better characterize this patient population and to determine whether patients benefit from parathyroidectomy. Evidence suggests that there are patients with mild pHPT who have overt symptoms that are found to improve after parathyroidectomy. There is also a group of patients with biochemically mild pHPT who are found to progress to classic pHPT over time; however, it is not predictable which group of patients this will be. Early intervention for this group with mild pHPT may prevent progression of bone, psychiatric, and renal complications, and parathyroidectomy has proven safe in appropriately selected patients at high volume centers.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: should surgery be performed on all patients? Current evidence and residual uncertainties [^115Jcdnu]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is the third most common endocrine disease and is characterized by hypercalcaemia and elevated or inappropriately 'normal' levels of the parathyroid hormone (PTH). The main target organs of PTH are the skeletal system and the kidneys. Before the 1970s, pHPT was a rarely detected disease associated with notable morbidity and premature mortality. Introduction of biochemical screening, allowing for a wide range of indications, has contributed to the detection of the full spectrum of the disease. A new entity with an isolated elevation of PTH, normocalcaemic HP, has emerged and is currently being explored. The highest incidence of pHPT, 3–5%, is observed amongst women, and the prevalence increases with age. The female-to-male ratio is 3–4: 1 except in younger patients where distribution is equal and known hereditary causes account for approximately 10% of the cases. In the last few decades, it has become evident that fewer patients than previously believed are truly asymptomatic. The cause of pHPT is often a benign tumour, a parathyroid adenoma, and the only definite treatment is parathyroidectomy (PTX). No medical treatment, single or combined, can achieve a curing of pHPT. Recent data indicate that PTX, despite being proven to be cost-effective compared to conservative treatment, is underutilized, especially in elderly pHPT patients. The decision of PTX should always be based on a safe diagnosis, and the potential benefits of curative treatment should not be outweighed by the risks of surgery or anaesthesia.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^112Pn7Py]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in the outpatient setting. Phenotypically, it has evolved from a disease of overt symptomatology to one of vague complaints and biochemical diagnosis. Preoperative localization and intraoperative parathyroid hormone have revolutionized the surgical management of these patients. Minimally invasive operations are now common worldwide with low morbidity and high patient satisfaction.

Perhaps most concerning is the substantial undertreatment of post-transplant hyperparathyroidism, with 73% of patients with persistent disease receiving no targeted therapy. This therapeutic gap likely represents a missed opportunity to mitigate skeletal complications in a population already at elevated fracture risk.

### Diagnosis of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the third international workshop [^112xV7fq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this report is to guide the use of diagnostic tests for this condition in clinical practice.

Participants

Interested professional societies selected a representative for the consensus committee and provided funding for a one-day meeting. A subgroup of this committee set the program and developed key questions for review. Consensus was established at a closed meeting that followed. The conclusions were then circulated to the participating professional societies.

Evidence

Each question was addressed by a relevant literature search (on PubMed), and the data were presented for discussion at the group meeting.

Consensus Process

Consensus was achieved by a group meeting. Statements were prepared by all authors, with comments relating to accuracy from the diagnosis subgroup and by representatives from the participating professional societies.

Conclusions

We conclude that: 1) reference ranges should be established for serum PTH in vitamin D-replete healthy individuals; 2) second- and third-generation PTH assays are both helpful in the diagnosis of PHPT; 3) DNA sequence testing can be useful in familial hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia; 4) normocalcemic PHPT is a variant of the more common presentation of PHPT with hypercalcemia; 5) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels should be measured and, if vitamin D insufficiency is present, it should be treated as part of any management course; and 6) the estimated glomerular filtration rate should be used to determine the level of kidney function in PHPT: an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 ml/min.1.73 m2 should be a benchmark for decisions about surgery in established asymptomatic PHPT.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^111YRX6p]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism is due to increased activity of the parathyroid glands, either from an intrinsic abnormal change altering excretion of parathyroid hormone (primary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism) or from an extrinsic abnormal change affecting calcium homoeostasis stimulating production of parathyroid hormone (secondary hyperparathyroidism). Primary hyperparathyroidism is the third most common endocrine disorder, with the highest incidence in postmenopausal women. Asymptomatic disease is common, and severe disease with renal stones and metabolic bone disease arises less frequently now than it did 20–30 years ago. Primary hyperparathyroidism can be cured by surgical removal of an adenoma, increasingly by minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. Medical management of mild disease is possible with bisphosphonates, hormone replacement therapy, and calcimimetics. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism, particularly in elderly people. However, the biochemical definition of vitamin D deficiency and its treatment are subject to much debate. Secondary hyperparathyroidism as the result of chronic kidney disease is important in the genesis of renal bone disease, and several new treatments could help achieve the guidelines set out by the kidney disease outcomes quality initiative.

### Surgical aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism [^116b6nbc]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Parathyroidectomy (PTX) is the treatment of choice for symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). It is also the treatment of choice in asymptomatic PHPT with evidence for target organ involvement. This review updates surgical aspects of PHPT and proposes the following definitions based on international expert consensus: selective PTX (and reasons for conversion to an extended procedure), bilateral neck exploration for non-localized or multigland disease, subtotal PTX, total PTX with immediate or delayed autotransplantation, and transcervical thymectomy and extended en bloc PTX for parathyroid carcinoma. The systematic literature reviews discussed covered (i) the use of intraoperative PTH (ioPTH) for localized single-gland disease and (ii) the management of low BMD after PTX. Updates based on prospective observational studies are presented concerning PTX for multigland disease and hereditary PHPT syndromes, histopathology, intraoperative adjuncts, localization techniques, perioperative management, "reoperative" surgery and volume/outcome data. Postoperative complications are few and uncommon (< 3%) in centers performing over 40 PTXs per year. This review is the first global consensus about surgery in PHPT and reflects the current practice in leading endocrine surgery units worldwide. © 2022 The Authors.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® parathyroid adenoma [^113ozvcX]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism is defined as excessive parathyroid hormone production. The diagnosis is made through biochemical testing, in which imaging has no role. However, imaging is appropriate for preoperative parathyroid gland localization with the intent of surgical cure. Imaging is particularly useful in the setting of primary hyperparathyroidism whereby accurate localization of a single parathyroid adenoma can facilitate minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. Imaging can also be useful to localize ectopic or supernumerary parathyroid glands and detail anatomy, which may impact surgery. This document summarizes the literature and provides imaging recommendations for hyperparathyroidism including primary hyperparathyroidism, recurrent or persistent primary hyperparathyroidism after parathyroid surgery, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Recommendations include ultrasound, CT neck without and with contrast, and nuclear medicine parathyroid scans. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### The efficacy and safety of medical and surgical therapy in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116GNMhu]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Both medical and surgical therapy represent potential management options for patients with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Because uncertainty remains regarding both medical and surgical therapy, this systematic review addresses the efficacy and safety of medical therapy in asymptomatic patients or symptomatic patients who decline surgery and surgery in asymptomatic patients. We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PubMed from inception to December 2020, and included randomized controlled trials in patients with PHPT that compared nonsurgical management with medical therapy versus without medical therapy and surgery versus no surgery in patients with asymptomatic PHPT. For surgical complications we included observational studies. Paired reviewers addressed eligibility, assessed risk of bias, and abstracted data for patient-important outcomes. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses to pool relative risks and mean differences with 95% confidence intervals and used Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess quality of evidence for each outcome. For medical therapy, 11 trials reported in 12 publications including 438 patients proved eligible: three addressed alendronate, one denosumab, three cinacalcet, two vitamin D, and two estrogen therapy. Alendronate, denosumab, vitamin D, and estrogen therapy all increased bone density. Cinacalcet probably reduced serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Cinacalcet and vitamin D may have a small or no increase in overall adverse events. Very-low-quality evidence raised the possibility of an increase in serious adverse events with alendronate and denosumab. The trials also provided low-quality evidence for increased bleeding and mastalgia with estrogen therapy. For surgery, six trials presented in 12 reports including 441 patients proved eligible. Surgery achieved biochemical cure in 96.1% (high quality). We found no convincing evidence supporting an impact of surgery on fracture, quality of life, occurrence of kidney stones, and renal function, but the evidence proved low or very low quality. Surgery was associated with an increase in bone mineral density. For patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic PHPT, who are not candidates for parathyroid surgery, cinacalcet probably reduced serum calcium and PTH levels; anti-resorptives increased bone density. For patients with asymptomatic PHPT, surgery usually achieves biochemical cure. These results can help to inform patients and clinicians regarding use of medical therapy and surgery in PHPT. © 2022 The Authors.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: what is the role of parathyroid surgery? [^117UPCBt]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Does surgical referral differ for nPHPT patients?

A key question remains as to whether nPHPT should be considered a different entity to hPHPT, or if they can be managed using a single approach. Whilst studies have reported that nPHPT presents differently to hPHPT, such as with a higher incidence of multi-glandular disease,– studies have also shown that a proportion of normocalcaemic patients will progress to hypercalcaemia. In line with this, a standardised approach to managing PHPT irrespective of serum calcium appears appropriate and the aforementioned NICE guidance for PHPT surgical referral remains applicable for nPHPT. However, it is important that discussions regarding surgery are individualised and patient expectations are comprehensively explored. This involves counselling the patient to ensure adequate understanding of both the positive (a reduction in end-organ effects) and adverse (risk of surgical complications) outcomes that may occur following surgery.

For clinicians, it is also important to avoid routinely screening PTH levels unless there is evidence to suggest measurement would be appropriate. This includes evidence of calcium homeostasis disturbance, renal dysfunction and occasionally if there is vitamin D deficiency.

Limitations of the current literature

Many of the studies investigating the role of surgery in the treatment of nPHPT consist of a relatively small cohort of patients. This is compounded by comparative studies in the field generally having a significantly larger number of hPHPT patients relative to nPHPT patients. Future studies should aim to analyse larger nPHPT cohorts, with comparative studies providing equal representation to nPHPT and hPHPT patients. Moreover, there is a need for large consortia based prospective registries of those managed both surgically and medically, with an extended follow up period of more than 10 years. This would enable the true natural history and adverse events of treatment to be observed, providing much needed clarity to clinicians.

Conclusions and Relevance Evidence-based recommendations were created to assist clinicians in the optimal treatment of patients with pHPT. The surgical treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism has undergone extensive change in the past 2 decades. The presentation, diagnosis, and medical management have been previously addressed by an international workshop. 1–4 To meet the need for a detailed focus on operative management, the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons developed evidence-based guidelines to delineate the safe and effective practice of parathyroidectomy to achieve definitive treatment. The full evidence statements supporting the recommendations appear in the eAppendix and eTable 1 in the Supplement. The Supplement also includes additional details, technical descriptions, discussions of controversy, and expert advice on the surgical management of pHPT. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment of pHPT.

Symptomatic patients are expected to derive clear benefits from curative parathyroidectomy, and patients considered to be asymptomatic frequently report improvement in quality-of-life indexes. 11–14 Observation and pharmacologic therapy are less effective and less cost-effective than surgery, even when the patient is considered asymptomatic. 15 Long-term hypercalcemia should be avoided because of potential deleterious effects. 16–18 Referral to an experienced parathyroid surgeon is advised to determine whether the likelihood and benefits of cure outweigh the anticipated risks of the procedure. Quiz Ref IDRecommendation 3–1: Parathyroidectomy is indicated, and is the preferred treatment, for all patients with symptomatic pHPT.

Recommendation 3–2: Parathyroidectomy is indicated when the serum calcium level is greater than 1 mg/dL above normal, regardless of whether objective symptoms are present or absent. Although many pharmacologic agents have been used in an attempt to reduce the serum calcium level or stabilize BMD, none have improved both. In formal cost-effectiveness analyses, pharmacologic treatment is not optimal at any life expectancy. 15, 23 Recommendation 3–12: Operative management is more effective and cost-effective than long-term observation or pharmacologic therapy. Recommendation 5–4: Patients with pHPT who present with hypercalcemic crisis should be medically managed, followed by parathyroidectomy.

### Diagnosis and management of primary hyperparathyroidism… [^113YBN3h]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common disorder of dysregulated calcium homeostasis. In 2013, its incidence in the US is estimated at 66 per 100 000 person-years among women and 25 per 100 000 among men. 1 The adoption of routine chemistry panel testing in the 1970s led to increased discovery of PHPT and changed its clinical presentation in developed nations from a rare, highly symptomatic disease to a milder, more subtle condition.
