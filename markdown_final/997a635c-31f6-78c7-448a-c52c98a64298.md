## Question

What is the ICD-10-CM code for decompression sickness during the initial encounter?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10-CM code for decompression sickness during the initial encounter. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct ICD-10-CM category for decompression sickness. Then, I should verify the seventh-character encounter type that denotes an initial encounter. Next, I will check whether any additional digits are required for specificity. Finally, I will confirm the exact code and ensure it aligns with authoritative guidance on injury coding and encounter types.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and where it sits in ICD-10-CM. Decompression sickness is a dysbaric injury and is classified under the injury and poisoning chapter, specifically in the T66–T78 range for effects of external causes, where decompression sickness is coded as T70.3, so the base code is T70.3 for decompression sickness itself [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the encounter-type convention. ICD-10-CM uses a seventh character to indicate encounter type: "A" for initial encounter, "D" for subsequent encounter, and "S" for sequela; for initial active treatment, the seventh character should be "A", and if the seventh character is missing, many surveillance frameworks treat it as an initial encounter by default, though I should confirm that assumption case-by-case [^dbb71c1c] [^5f0a2907].

> Hold on, I should verify whether T70.3 requires any additional digits beyond the decimal. T70.3 is a complete ICD-10-CM diagnosis code at the five-character level; there are no required additional subdigits for laterality or other specificity, so adding a seventh character for encounter type is appropriate and sufficient in this context [^notfound].

> Putting this together, the ICD-10-CM code for decompression sickness during the initial encounter is T70.3XXA, where the "A" denotes the initial encounter for active treatment. I initially thought I might need to add a sixth character for laterality, but wait, let me reconsider — T70.3 does not have laterality subcategories, so the correct final code is T70.3XXA with two placeholder Xs followed by the seventh character "A" to indicate initial encounter [^notfound].

> I should double-check that this aligns with injury coding principles. The CDC and injury surveillance guidance emphasize using the seventh character to distinguish initial from subsequent encounters and sequelae, and they commonly include initial encounters when analyzing acute injury events; applying that framework to T70.3 supports using T70.3XXA for an initial encounter of decompression sickness [^33894c69] [^653242a6].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for decompression sickness during the initial encounter is **T70.3XXA**. The seventh character "A" denotes the initial encounter, and the placeholder "X" is used because T70.3 does not require additional subclassification. Accurate coding supports appropriate billing, epidemiologic tracking, and clinical documentation of this dysbaric illness [^33894c69] [^653242a6].

---

## ICD-10-CM code structure and components

ICD-10-CM codes are **alphanumeric** and structured as follows:

- **Category**: The first three characters (e.g. T70) represent the category of the disease or condition.
- **Etiology**: The fourth character (e.g.3) provides additional detail about the etiology or manifestation.
- **Extension**: The fifth and sixth characters (often "XX") are placeholders or used for further specificity.
- **Encounter type**: The seventh character (e.g. "A") indicates the encounter type (initial, subsequent, or sequela).

---

## Specific ICD-10-CM code for decompression sickness

The specific ICD-10-CM code for decompression sickness is **T70.3XXA**, where:

- **T70**: Effects of air pressure and water pressure.
- **.3**: Decompression sickness.
- **XX**: Placeholder characters (no additional subclassification required).
- **A**: Initial encounter.

## Clinical significance of decompression sickness

Decompression sickness (DCS), also known as "the bends", is a condition resulting from rapid decompression, typically after diving or exposure to high-altitude environments. It is characterized by the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the bloodstream and tissues, leading to a range of symptoms, including:

- Joint and muscle pain
- Neurological symptoms (e.g. dizziness, confusion, paralysis)
- Respiratory symptoms (e.g. shortness of breath, chest pain)
- Skin manifestations (e.g. rash, itching)

Prompt recognition and treatment, particularly with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, are essential to prevent long-term complications and permanent injury [^930d910d] [^78628a95].

---

## Documentation requirements

Accurate ICD-10-CM coding for DCS requires thorough clinical documentation, including:

- **Detailed clinical history**: Document the patient's diving or altitude exposure history, including depth, duration, and ascent rate.
- **Clinical findings**: Record specific symptoms, physical examination findings, and diagnostic test results.
- **Encounter type**: Clearly indicate whether this is an initial encounter, subsequent encounter, or sequela.

---

## Common pitfalls and coding errors

Common pitfalls when coding DCS include:

- **Incorrect encounter type**: Using subsequent encounter codes (D) or sequela codes (S) instead of initial encounter code (A).
- **Lack of specificity**: Failing to document specific symptoms or clinical findings, leading to vague or unspecified coding.
- **Misclassification**: Confusing DCS with other barotrauma-related conditions, such as arterial gas embolism (AGE).

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of accurate coding and documentation for DCS. The CDC Yellow Book provides comprehensive guidance on recognizing, diagnosing, and treating DCS, highlighting the need for **hyperbaric oxygen therapy** and appropriate medical evaluation [^78628a95]. Additionally, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) provides recommendations on evaluating and managing patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) who experience DCS, underscoring the importance of individualized risk assessment and shared decision-making [^35240d0e] [^9bbd13f2].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for decompression sickness during the initial encounter is **T70.3XXA**. Accurate coding and documentation are essential for appropriate clinical management, billing, and epidemiological tracking. Clinicians should ensure thorough documentation of clinical findings, exposure history, and encounter type to avoid common coding errors and to align with clinical guidelines.

Methods

Data Source

The data used in this retrospective cohort study were obtained from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS), an administrative data set that captures a representative 20% of inpatient hospital encounters in the US. Although granular data regarding comorbidities or clinical outcomes may be lacking, the breadth of this particular data set makes it well suited to the study of longitudinal patterns across a variety of practice settings and reimbursement mechanisms. Given the transition of the NIS from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9) to International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10) codes in 2015 and the lack of direct correspondence between relevant procedural codes in the 2 systems, only data from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019, were queried. All analyses were conducted, reviewed, or updated on June 9, 2023. Because this study used deidentified administrative data from a national database, it was deemed exempt from review and informed consent by the institutional review board of Rhode Island Hospital. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cohort studies.

Participants

We first identified all adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) in the NIS with inpatient hospital encounters for primary diagnoses corresponding to lumbar stenosis and lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis using ICD-10 diagnosis codes and procedure codes corresponding to lumbar or lumbosacral decompression and a single level, but not multilevel, lumbar or lumbosacral fusion. Patients were then categorized as undergoing decompression alone or decompression with fusion. This initial search yielded 191 510 admissions with 2780 corresponding ICD-10 procedure codes.

Patients were excluded if they underwent nonelective surgical procedures, if their admissions were associated with other nondecompression or non–decompression with fusion ICD-10 procedure codes, or if admissions were associated with any ICD-10 procedure codes that implied either revision spine operations or management of nondegenerative pathologies, such as infection or tumor. In total, 121 745 patient admissions were included in the final analysis (Figure 1).

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### IMP-ICDX: an injury mortality prediction based on ICD-10-CM codes [^376628d1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Trauma score methods can be divided into two categories of systems. First, the injury severity score (ISS), the new injury severity score (NISS), the tangent injury severity score (TISS), the trauma mortality prediction model (TMPM), and injury mortality prediction (IMP) score methods based on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) lexicon. Their ability of predicting trauma death is also improved. However, the AIS codes must be evaluated by trauma surgeon experts. In these circumstances, a great deal of manpower and material resources is consumed. It is difficult for developed countries, let alone developing ones. These situations hinder the trauma score in-depth research and popularization. Second, the International Classification of Diseases Ninth Edition (ICD-9-CM) Injury Severity Score (ICISS) and the trauma mortality prediction model (TMPM)-ICD9 score methods based on ICD-9-CM lexicon. ICD-9-CM codes are the common disease diagnosis codes around the world. Currently, most countries and regions apply the updated ICD-10-CM. The number of diagnostic categories available is approximately over 9000, which is more than the number of AIS code categories. Although ICD-10-CM codes are not similar to AIS which implies injury severities, each diagnosis has implied the information of anatomy trauma, a variety of disease severity, and the possibility of mortality. ICD-10-CM codes also include the possibility of death, such as traumatic hemorrhage of right cerebrum with loss of consciousness of 30 min or less, initial encounter; displaced fracture of base of neck of right femur, initial encounter for closed fracture; and major laceration of liver, initial encounter.

### Validation of an international classification of diseases, ninth revision code algorithm for identifying Chiari malformation type 1 surgery in adults [^2b03f1fc]. Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The use of administrative billing data may enable large-scale assessments of treatment outcomes for Chiari Malformation type I (CM-1). However, to utilize such data sets, validated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9-CM) code algorithms for identifying CM-1 surgery are needed.

Objective

To validate 2 ICD-9-CM code algorithms identifying patients undergoing CM-1 decompression surgery.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the validity of 2 ICD-9-CM code algorithms for identifying adult CM-1 decompression surgery performed at 2 academic medical centers between 2001 and 2013. Algorithm 1 included any discharge diagnosis code of 348.4 (CM-1), as well as a procedure code of 01.24 (cranial decompression) or 03.09 (spinal decompression, or laminectomy). Algorithm 2 restricted this group to patients with a primary diagnosis of 348.4. The positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity of each algorithm were calculated.

Results

Among 340 first-time admissions identified by Algorithm 1, the overall PPV for CM-1 decompression was 65%. Among the 214 admissions identified by Algorithm 2, the overall PPV was 99.5%. The PPV for Algorithm 1 was lower in the Vanderbilt (59%) cohort, males (40%), and patients treated between 2009 and 2013 (57%), whereas the PPV of Algorithm 2 remained high (≥ 99%) across subgroups. The sensitivity of Algorithms 1 (86%) and 2 (83%) were above 75% in all subgroups.

Conclusion

ICD-9-CM code Algorithm 2 has excellent PPV and good sensitivity to identify adult CM-1 decompression surgery. These results lay the foundation for studying CM-1 treatment outcomes by using large administrative databases.

### Updates in decompression illness [^930d910d]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism, collectively known as decompression illness (DCI), are rare but serious afflictions that can result from compressed gas diving exposures. Risk is primarily determined by the pressure-time profile but is influenced by several factors. DCI can present idiosyncratically but with a wide range of neurologic symptoms. Examination is critical for assessment in the absence of diagnostic indicators. Many conditions must be considered in the differential diagnosis. High-fraction oxygen breathing provides first aid but definitive treatment of DCI is hyperbaric oxygen.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 3 environmental hazards and risks [^78628a95]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Decompression illness (DCI) — clinical features and initial management — describes bubble-related dysbaric injuries, including arterial gas embolism (AGE) and decompression sickness (DCS), and from a clinical and practical standpoint distinguishing between them in the field might be impossible and unnecessary because the initial treatment is the same for both; serious permanent injury or death can result from AGE or DCS. In arterial gas embolism, gas entering the arterial blood through ruptured pulmonary vessels can distribute bubbles into the body tissues, including the heart and brain, where they can disrupt circulation or damage vessel walls, and the clinical presentation of AGE ranges from minimal neurologic findings to dramatic symptoms requiring urgent and aggressive hyperbaric oxygen treatment. In general, suspect AGE in any scuba diver who surfaces unconscious or loses consciousness within 10 minutes after surfacing; initiate basic life support, including administration of the highest fraction of oxygen, and because relapses can and do occur, divers suffering AGE should be rapidly evacuated to a hyperbaric oxygen treatment facility even if they appear to have recovered fully. Table 3.4.1 lists clinical manifestations: for AGE, examples include ataxia, chest pain or bloody sputum, convulsions, dizziness, and loss of consciousness; for DCS, examples include collapse or unconsciousness, coughing spasms or shortness of breath, dizziness, itching, and joint aches or pain.

### Defining indicators for drug overdose emergency department visits and hospitalisations in ICD-10-CM coded discharge data [^653242a6]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
The anatomy of an ICD-10-CM drug poisoning diagnosis code. ICD-10-CM, International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification.

Several key changes in the diagnosis codes from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM guidance had to be considered when defining and tracking drug overdose indicators. These include the following:

External cause of injury codes for drug poisoning were combined with diagnostic codes in ICD-10-CM: under ICD-9-CM, poisoning surveillance indicators relied on both poisoning diagnosis codes, which described the substances involved, and poisoning external cause codes, which conveyed the intent (eg, suicide or unintentional). Under ICD-10-CM, the poisoning diagnosis codes or T-codes (T36-T50) include information on both the substances involved and intent of the injury (ie, '1': accidental, '2': intentional self-harm, '3': assault, '4': undetermined, '5': adverse effect and '6': underdosing).
Coding of undetermined and accidental poisonings changed in ICD-10-CM: under ICD-9-CM, medical coders were instructed to select undetermined intent for external causes of injury when the intent was unspecified in the medical record; however, the guidance under ICD-10-CM instructs coders to default to accidental intent and only select undetermined intent if the medical record explicitly indicates that the intent is undetermined.
ICD-10-CM introduced the concept of underdosing: ICD-10-CM introduced the concept of 'underdosing', the use of less than the prescribed drug according to a provider or drug manufacturer.
ICD-10-CM introduced the concept of encounter type: ICD-10-CM introduced the new concept of encounter type for many injury diagnosis codes. For drug poisoning T-codes, a seventh character of 'A' indicates an initial encounter, 'D' indicates a subsequent encounter and 'S' indicates sequela. An initial encounter captures when a patient is receiving active treatment for the injury event, though it may not be the first encounter related to that injury event (eg, receiving treatment from two physicians for the same injury). A subsequent encounter captures when a patient is seen after active treatment for a follow-up related to the initial injury (eg, follow-up visit related to an overdose). A sequela captures when a patient is being treated for a secondary condition that arose because of the injury (eg, peripheral neuropathy).

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^a36ea6dd]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Case selection

A total of 4832 records from MCA and 5211 records from MCB were included in the study and analysed in a parallel manner (table 2). On average, the ICD-9-CM subsets had more codes per record than the ICD-10-CM subsets: 8.9 versus 8.4 and 12.5 versus 12.3 in the MCA and MCB datasets, respectively. In the MCA dataset, 657 and 659 dually coded records had a principal diagnosis from the list of nature-of-injury codes shown in table 1, using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, respectively. In the MCB dataset, the corresponding numbers were 537 and 544 records, respectively.

Table 2
Sample selection and characteristics of the Clinical Modification of the 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM)/Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of ICD (ICD-10-CM) dually coded datasets

In the MCA dataset, five records had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas seven records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). In the MCB dataset, one record had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas eight records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). Specifically, the ICD-10-CM case definition for injury has been slightly expanded by the NCHS, such that initial encounters for periprosthetic fractures around internal prosthetic joints (T84.04 before 10/01/2016; M97 thereafter) and encounters for injuries and abuse complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (O9A.2-O9A.5) are now included. These expansions accounted for 9 of the additional 15 records that were selected as injuries based only on ICD-10-CM diagnoses, whereas the exclusion of subsequent encounters from the ICD-10-CM case definition accounted for five of the six records selected based only on ICD-9-CM diagnoses.

### Harnessing occupational and environmental medicine expertise to transform medical care: a catalyst for mitigating the human health impacts of climate change [^aa0105cc]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Case 4 — Coding a clinical encounter to include climate-driven environmental exposures outlines how accurate coding of a heat stress visit is "crucial for proper documentation, occupational safety, potential worker's compensation claims, and epidemiological tracking", and specifies ICD-10 codes T67.5XXA "Heat exhaustion, unspecified, initial encounter", Z57.6 "Occupational exposure to extreme temperature", Z59.1 "Inadequate housing (no air conditioning)", Z56.6 "Physical and mental strain related to work", and W92.XXXA "Exposure to excessive heat of man-made origin". Intervention codes include 99214 "Office visit (moderate complexity)" with "Appropriate for the level of medical decision-making required" and 99401 "Preventive medicine counseling (15 min)" with "Allows for patient education on heat illness prevention and management". It further states this level of documentation "establishes medical necessity", "supports worker's compensation claim", contributes to "climate-related illness identification", supports "occupational health outcomes", and enables "social determinants of health tracking".

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Survival strategies for tsunami of ICD-10-CM for interventionalists: pursue or perish! [^f1ee71f0]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The unfunded mandate for the implementation of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) is scheduled October 1, 2015. The development of ICD-10-CM has been a complicated process. We have endeavored to keep Interventional Pain Management doctors apprised via a variety of related topical manuscripts. The major issues relate to the lack of formal physician participation in its preparation. While the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) and American Hospital Association (AHA) as active partners in its preparation. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are major players; 3M and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association are also involved. The cost of ICD-10-CM implementation is high, similar to the implementation of electronic health records (EHRs), likely consuming substantial resources. While ICD-10, utilized worldwide, includes 14,400 different codes, ICD-10-CM, specific for the United States, has expanded to 144,000 codes, which also includes procedural coding system. It is imperative for physicians to prepare for the mandatory implementation. Conversion from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM coding in interventional pain management is not a conversion of one to one that can be easily obtained from software packages. It is a both a difficult and time-consuming task with each physician, early on, expected to spend on estimation at least 10 minutes per visit on extra coding for established and new patients. For interventional pain physicians, there have been a multitude of changes, including creation of new codes and confusing conversion of existing codes. This manuscript describes a variety of codes that are relevant to interventional pain physicians and often utilized in daily practices. It is our objective that this manuscript will provide coding assistance to interventional pain physicians.

### Defining indicators for drug overdose emergency department visits and hospitalisations in ICD-10-CM coded discharge data [^dbb71c1c]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The drug overdose epidemic has worsened over the past decade; however, efforts have been made to better understand and track nonfatal overdoses using various data sources including emergency department and hospital admission data from billing and discharge files.

Methods and Findings

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed surveillance case definition guidance using standardised discharge diagnosis codes for public health practitioners and epidemiologists using lessons learnt from CDC's funded recipients and the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) Drug Poisoning Indicators Workgroup and General Injury ICD-10-CM Workgroup. CDC's guidance was informed by health departments and CSTE's workgroups and included several key aspects for assessing drug overdose in emergency department and hospitalisation discharge data. These include: (1) searching all diagnosis fields to identify drug overdose cases; (2) estimating drug overdose incidence using visits for initial encounter but excluding subsequent encounters and sequelae; (3) excluding underdosing and adverse effects from drug overdose incidence indicators; and (4) using codes T36-T50 for overdose surveillance. CDC's guidance also suggests analysing intent separately for ICD-10-CM coding.

Conclusions

CDC's guidance provides health departments a key tool to better monitor drug overdoses in their community. The implementation and validation of this standardised guidance across all CDC-funded health departments will be key to ensuring consistent and accurate reporting across all entities.

### Identification of emergency care-sensitive conditions and characteristics of emergency department utilization [^700623bc]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

c Panelists were asked the 2 following questions: (1) for the average patient with this condition, to what extent does timely emergency care affect subsequent mortality, and (2) for the average patient with this condition, to what extent does timely emergency care affect subsequent morbidity. Panelists responded with a rating from 1 (no or little impact) to 9 (strong impact).

d For the 5 panelist-suggested condition groups, 119 ICD - 10 - CM subcodes were reviewed. Overall, 30 new subcodes were included, and 89 were excluded because they indicated pediatric, chronic, or subacute conditions. None of the subcodes indicated subsequent encounters or sequelae.

e Disagreement was defined as least 3 panelists rating the condition group in the range of 7 to 9 and at least 3 panelists rating the condition group in the range of 1 to less than 4.

### IMP-ICDX: an injury mortality prediction based on ICD-10-CM codes [^f37dc589]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

In this text, the total of the WMDP values is 8534 different ICD-10-CM coded injuries (see Additional file 4). These WMDP values range from 0.009 for a minor injury (ICD-10-CM, S42.412A: "Displaced simple supracondylar fracture without intercondylar fracture of left humerus, initial encounter for closed fracture") to a value of 1.927 for a severe injury (ICD-10-CM, S06.5X7A: "Traumatic subdural hemorrhage with loss of consciousness of any duration with death due to brain injury, initial encounter"). Although trauma ICD-10-CM codes are not set by experts and cannot show information of traumatic severity, which are different from AIS codes, this research calculates the WMDP values of different ICD-10-CM codes and uses them to react to the degree of severity of trauma. We believe that these WMDP values are appropriate and in accordance with the actual situation of clinical, not our subjective assume.

Patient demographics are summarized in Table 1. The median age of our cohort was 49 years. Males accounted for 61.3%, and 66.4% was non-Hispanic White. The majority of patients in this text were fall (44.4%) and motor vehicle collisions (35.8%). The overall mortality rate for the patients was 2.41%.

The statistical performance of all models is shown in Tables 2 and 3. The IMP-ICDX displays significantly better discrimination, calibration, or AIC statistic compared with both the ISS and SWI models. Figure 2 graphically displays the superior calibration of IMP-ICDX. The ISS values were distributed to the right of the dotted reference line. The IMP-ICDX values were uniformly distributed much closer to the dotted reference line.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^61217f1c]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Large scale cohort studies of early sub-acute, post-acute and longer-term phases of SCI/D show that variations in functioning, health and wellbeing are attributable, at least in part, to contextual factors. Notably, national registries are a platform for the selection of cohorts enroled in many large, international population health initiatives. Our data indicate that an understanding of differences in population health surveillance strategies within or between countries or WHO regions is central to the meaningful interpretation of the epidemiological literature. An exemplar, in relation to a national framework for population health surveillance across all-phases of SCI/D care is the well-funded USA Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems. Reference to Spinal Cord Injury Model System reports published to date shows the seminal importance of a better understanding of the influence of case-mix diversity on decision making in spinal cord injury medicine. In our study, a low cost ICD-10 codified search strategy combined with case-mix data demonstrated superior sensitivity to discriminate all-cause incident cases versus three-four rubric ICD-10 "Health conditions" codes alone. This general principle also held for traumatic cases, with the caveat that the modest attrition seen in the adjusted ICD-10 data yields versus point-of-care sub-acute surveillance is counterintuitive to USA reports of 7.5% peri-morbid mortality. The reasons for this disparity are unclear but may relate to differences in contextual factors between these countries. Although contingent on data quality, future investigations of the utility of Z, W and Y codes 9 encoding the activity from which mechanism of injury is derived may improve internal validity. In terms of external consistency, the explanation for this failure of ICD-10 coded point-of-acute care cases to reflect an effect of peri-morbid mortality remains unresolved. Importantly, this challenge to research uptake was not common to traumatic and non-traumatic aetiologies. With respect to neoplastic causes the literature shows that a diagnosis of primary or metastatic tumour represented 12% of all 2012 acute SCI admissions and 19% of all non-traumatic cases to a USA facility. Analysis of the incidence of primary or metastatic tumour diagnoses recorded in the comparator ASCIR (14; 3.6% of all cases) and APC/ICD-10 (8; 1.6% of all cases) data collections revealed comparable disease prevalence after adjustment of ICD-10 data for extracted cases (codes < 5). From our case-mix adjusted ICD-10 data a relatively high external consistency for neoplastic aetiologies (n = 12) might be inferred versus ASCIR without conducting a formal Cronbach's alpha. However, external consistency to published USA data was not established for this variable for any Australian repository. The reason for this apparent difference in the prevalence of neoplastic in-hospital deaths between well-resourced countries is unclear and shows the importance of evaluating contextual factors in conjunction with aetiological taxonomies.

### Surgeon input can increase the value of registry data: early experience from the American spine registry [^e91f7a84]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Clear diagnostic delineation is necessary for the development of a strong evidence base in lumbar spinal surgery. Experience with existing national databases suggests that International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition (ICD-10) coding is insufficient to support that need. The purpose of this study was to assess agreement between surgeon-specified diagnostic indication and hospital-reported ICD-10 codes for lumbar spine surgery.

Methods

Data collection for the American Spine Registry (ASR) includes an option to denote the surgeon's specific diagnostic indication for each procedure. For cases treated between January 2020 and March 2022, surgeon-delineated diagnosis was compared with the ICD-10 diagnosis generated by standard ASR electronic medical record data extraction. For decompression-only cases, the primary analysis focused on the etiology of neural compression as determined by the surgeon versus that determined on the basis of the related ICD-10 codes extracted from the ASR database. For lumbar fusion cases, the primary analysis compared structural pathology, which may have required fusion, as determined by the surgeon versus that determined on the basis of the extracted ICD-10 codes. This allowed for identification of agreement between surgeon delineation and extracted ICD-10 codes.

Results

In 5926 decompression-only cases, agreement between the surgeon and ASR ICD-10 codes was 89% for spinal stenosis and 78% for lumbar disc herniation and/or radiculopathy. Both the surgeon and database indicated no structural pathology (i.e., none) suggesting the need for fusion in 88% of cases. In 5663 lumbar fusion cases, agreement was 76% for spondylolisthesis but poor for other diagnostic indications.

Conclusions

Agreement between surgeon-specified diagnostic indication and hospital-reported ICD-10 codes was best for patients who underwent decompression only. In the fusion cases, agreement with ICD-10 codes was best in the spondylolisthesis group (76%). In cases other than spondylolisthesis, agreement was poor due to multiple diagnoses or lack of an ICD-10 code that reflected the pathology. This study suggested that standard ICD-10 codes may be inadequate to clearly define the indications for decompression or fusion in patients with lumbar degenerative disease.

### Descriptive exploration of overdose codes in hospital and emergency department discharge data to inform development of drug overdose morbidity surveillance indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM [^f960c8ff]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Background

The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), a coding system for all claims billing in the USA, went into effect on 1 October 2015, replacing the 9th Revision (ICD-9-CM). The coding transition brought with it benefits and challenges for drug overdose surveillance using hospital and emergency department (ED) discharge data. Increases in specificity of drug codes, the ability to distinguish initial encounters from subsequent encounters and sequelae, the inclusion of external cause information within drug overdose diagnosis codes and new concepts like 'underdosing' provide epidemiologists with richer data. However, these new features impact how injuries, including drug overdose, should be measured and interpreted using ICD-10-CM coded discharge data. Amid a continuing drug overdose epidemic in the USA, high-quality data and standardised surveillance methods are key for tracking and assessing drug overdose burden.

Several studies have characterised drug overdoses using ICD-10-CM coded discharge data, but have used varying selection criteria and indicator definitions to ascertain drug overdose cases. Specifically, these indicator definitions differ on the number of diagnosis fields searched, the encounter types included, the manner of injury/intent selected and the specific ICD-10-CM codes included. Some studies searched all diagnosis fields (ie, primary diagnosis field, secondary diagnosis and all other fields available)and others only included cases with a primary diagnosis of injury.

ICD-10-CM introduced the differentiation of encounter type, with codes for initial encounter, subsequent encounter and sequelae. Initial encounters represent active treatment of drug overdose, while subsequent encounters represent encounters taking place 'after the patient has completed active treatment of the condition and is receiving routine care for the condition during the healing or recovery phase'. Sequelae are new medical conditions or complications, occurring at any point after the acute phase of the injury, which are residual effects of the original injury. Some studies have included all encounters, while others have limited inclusion to initial encounter type.

### Self-harm injury hospitalisations: an analysis of case selection criteria [^39d339a2]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

In 2019, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published recommendations for an injury hospitalisation case definition based on ICD-10-CM codes. These recommendations focused on the creation of an injury subset that included records indicating an initial encounter for active treatment of an injury as the principal diagnosis (ie, the condition chiefly responsible for admission). Once the injury subset has been created, all diagnoses and external cause of morbidity codes noting an initial encounter are reviewed and the case is categorised by intent and mechanism of injury. Identification of cases involving intentional self-harm requires review of both diagnosis and external cause codes as some causes are reflected in unique diagnoses codes (poisoning, asphyxiation and suicide attempt) while others are reflected in unique external cause codes (all other means of intentional self-harm, such as cutting or firearms).

Though the CDC-recommended injury hospitalisation case definition restricts case selection to a subset based on principal diagnosis of injury, an earlier CDC publication indicated that, for self-harm, other considerations may be appropriate. One consideration involves expansion of the definition to include visits with any mention of self-harm (regardless of principal diagnosis). Studies have found strong associations between self-harm injuries and mental health disorders. These disorders may be prioritised in the principal diagnosis field and excluded from an injury subset that requires an injury principal diagnosis. Another consideration involves an exploration of encounter types. ICD-10-CM employs different codes to identify initial encounters (active treatment for a condition), subsequent encounters (routine care during recovery phase) and encounters for sequelae of injury (indicating complications or conditions that arise from a previous injury). ICD-10-CM coding allows for restriction of case selection to initial encounters only; however, this may not be useful or relevant for self-harm, as these injuries can differ from those of other intents. Self-harm injuries are more likely to be repeated, have more return visits to the ED or hospital, and are more likely to result in suicide compared with other injuries. This repeated nature may require consideration of all encounter types, especially if self-harm is viewed as an ongoing health condition requiring active attention.

The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of different case selection criteria of varying inclusivity to develop a standardised surveillance case definition for hospitalisations with ICD-10-CM codes noting self-harm.

### Use of ICD-10-CM coded hospitalisation and emergency department data for injury surveillance [^33894c69]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Epidemiologists and researchers who are transitioning from the use of ICD-9-CM coded data to ICD-10-CM coded data should note the substantial differences in the injury diagnosis and external cause-of-injury codes in the two coding systems. These differences, which have the potential to either introduce or alleviate bias in non-fatal injury measurement, have been described in detail elsewhere. Important differences that have implications for injury surveillance include:

Changes in the codes that identify events involving poisoning or toxic effects. In ICD-9-CM, two codes were required to describe each poisoning event — a diagnosis code (960–979 and 980–989) to describe the type of drug or toxic substance involved and an external cause code (E850–E858, E860–E869, E930–E949, E950–E952, E961–E962 and E980–E982) to describe the intent of the poisoning or adverse effect (eg, accidental (unintentional), intentional self-harm, homicide or undetermined). In ICD-10-CM, the information about both the drug or substance involved and the intent are captured in a single code (T36–T50 for drugs and biological substances, and T51–65 for toxic effects of non-drug substances). These T codes contain a character in the code to specify the intent of the poisoning (ie, accidental (unintentional), intentional self-harm, assault, undetermined, adverse effect and underdosing).
Expansion of codes to identify events involving asphyxiation. ICD-10-CM contains more than 40 diagnosis codes for asphyxiation or strangulation by different mechanisms (T71 codes), compared with a single diagnosis code in ICD-9-CM (994.7). The T71 codes include a character in the code to specify the intent (ie, accidental (unintentional), intentional self-harm, assault and undetermined) of the asphyxiation.
Separate codes in ICD-10-CM (T74 and T76) distinguish between suspected and confirmed child and adult abuse and neglect.
Introduction of the new concept of encounter type in ICD-10-CM. Most injury diagnosis codes and external cause codes in ICD-10-CM include a seventh character (a letter) that provides information on the type of medical care encounter when the diagnosis or external cause-of-injury was determined. The character specifies whether the injury diagnosis is related to: (1) the initial encounter, defined as while the patient is receiving active treatment for the condition, (2) a subsequent encounter, defined as routine care during the healing or recovery phase after the active treatment phase has ended or (3) sequelae, defined as complications or conditions that arise as a direct result of an injury.
Consideration of both diagnosis codes and external cause codes to identify all cases of intentional self-harm. In ICD-9-CM, all mechanisms of intentional self-harm were captured using external cause codes. In ICD-10-CM, while many mechanisms of intentional self-harm are captured using external cause codes (X71–X83), intentional self-harm involving poisoning or asphyxiation are captured by diagnosis codes (subsets of T36–T65 and T71).

### The complexity and challenges of the international classification of diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification to international classification of diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification transition in EDs [^9b81e000]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Beginning October 2015, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services will require medical providers to use the vastly expanded International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) system. Despite wide availability of information and mapping tools for the next generation of the ICD classification system, some of the challenges associated with transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM are not well understood. To quantify the challenges faced by emergency physicians, we analyzed a subset of a 2010 Illinois Medicaid database of emergency department ICD-9-CM codes, seeking to determine the accuracy of existing mapping tools in order to better prepare emergency physicians for the change to the expanded ICD-10-CM system. We found that 27% of 1830 codes represented convoluted multidirectional mappings. We then analyzed the convoluted transitions and found that 8% of total visit encounters (23% of the convoluted transitions) were clinically incorrect. The ambiguity and inaccuracy of these mappings may impact the workflow associated with the translation process and affect the potential mapping between ICD codes and Current Procedural Codes, which determine physician reimbursement.

### Chiari malformation type I surgery in pediatric patients. part 1: validation of an ICD-9-CM code search algorithm [^61ff9c68]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Administrative billing data may facilitate large-scale assessments of treatment outcomes for pediatric Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I). Validated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code algorithms for identifying CM-I surgery are critical prerequisites for such studies but are currently only available for adults. The objective of this study was to validate two ICD-9-CM code algorithms using hospital billing data to identify pediatric patients undergoing CM-I decompression surgery. METHODS The authors retrospectively analyzed the validity of two ICD-9-CM code algorithms for identifying pediatric CM-I decompression surgery performed at 3 academic medical centers between 2001 and 2013. Algorithm 1 included any discharge diagnosis code of 348.4 (CM-I), as well as a procedure code of 01.24 (cranial decompression) or 03.09 (spinal decompression or laminectomy). Algorithm 2 restricted this group to the subset of patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of 348.4. The positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity of each algorithm were calculated. RESULTS Among 625 first-time admissions identified by Algorithm 1, the overall PPV for CM-I decompression was 92%. Among the 581 admissions identified by Algorithm 2, the PPV was 97%. The PPV for Algorithm 1 was lower in one center (84%) compared with the other centers (93%-94%), whereas the PPV of Algorithm 2 remained high (96%-98%) across all subgroups. The sensitivity of Algorithms 1 (91%) and 2 (89%) was very good and remained so across subgroups (82%-97%). CONCLUSIONS An ICD-9-CM algorithm requiring a primary diagnosis of CM-I has excellent PPV and very good sensitivity for identifying CM-I decompression surgery in pediatric patients. These results establish a basis for utilizing administrative billing data to assess pediatric CM-I treatment outcomes.

### Emergency department visits within ninety days of endoscopic lumbar decompression [^7e11f076]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Database and Cohort

Data for this retrospective cohort study were abstracted from the PearlDiver M165Ortho data set. This is a large national health administrative database containing deidentified Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant information on over 165 million orthopaedic patients in the United States. All PearlDiver data are aggregated and deidentified — as such, our Institutional Review Board granted studies using this data set exempt from review.

Patients with endoscopic lumbar decompression were identified by Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 62380. Patients who underwent concomitant lumbar spinal procedures other than endoscopic lumbar decompression were excluded by identifying patients with CPT codes CPT-22558, CPT-22612, CPT-22800, CPT-22802, CPT-22804, CPT-22840, CPT-22842, CPT-22843, CPT-22844, CPT-63005, CPT-63047, CPT-63035, and CPT-63030. Patients younger than 18 years, with a diagnosis of trauma, neoplasm, or infection on the day of surgery, or without at least 90 days of follow-up in the data set following endoscopic decompression were also excluded.

Following cohort identification, patient demographics were abstracted, including age, sex, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI, a longitudinal patient comorbidity index developed using international classification of disease (ICD) diagnosis codes where each chronic comorbidity diagnosis contributes one point to the overall ECI), region of the country according to US census bureau definitions (West, South, Midwest, and Northeast), and patient insurance plan (Commercial, Medicaid, and Medicare).

### Multisite medical record review of emergency department visits for traumatic brain injury [^69bc870c]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

The study design was a retrospective, cross-sectional review of medical records at ED sites in four states: Colorado, Kentucky, Maryland and Massachusetts. To assess PPV for TBI, each study site team selected two random samples of ED billing records based on any ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for: (1) only skull fracture without other proposed TBI codes or (2) intracranial injury (S06) with or without other proposed TBI codes.(In Maryland, one site of the two sites was a neurotrauma referral centre, not an ED, and its trauma registry was used for sampling.) To replicate methods of US public health surveillance of TBI-related ED visits, the sampling frame was limited to records that documented initial medical encounters for patients treated in EDs and discharged home during 2015–2018 (Faul et al, p. 49). Reviewers recorded signs and symptoms related to TBI and head imaging findings from the medical records for each sample.

Case definitions

The study focused on ICD-10-CM codes for skull fracture and intracranial injury as the potential TBI cases of interest in ICD-10-CM-coded ED discharge records, grouped as follows:

Fracture of skull bones: ICD-10-CM codes S02.0, S02.1-, S02.8- or S02.91 for initial encounter (seventh character in the ICD-10-CM code of 'A' or 'B' or missing) in any discharge diagnostic field (first-listed or secondary diagnosis), without concurrent ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for intracranial injury (S06); and
Intracranial injury: ICD-10-CM codes S06 for initial encounter (seventh character of 'A' or missing) in any diagnostic field, with or without a code for skull fracture or other proposed TBI codes (S04.02 for injury to optic chiasm, S04.03- for injury to optic pathways, S04.04- for injury to visual cortex, S07.1 for crushing injury of skull or T74.4 for shaken infant syndrome).

### Monitoring new symptoms after COVID-19 infection among primary care patients in New York city [^50b4d8df]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

COVID-19 affects multiple organ systems causing substantial long-term morbidity. The implications of the Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly for primary care, remain unknown. This cross-sectional study examines new symptoms reported at primary care encounters during three post-acute follow-up intervals after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods

Electronic health record data from the NYU Langone COVID Deidentified Dataset were queried for adults with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, and then restricted to those with a new ICD-10-CM code documented at a post-acute COVID-related primary care follow-up > 14 days after testing positive. New diagnoses and the corresponding Clinical Classifications Software Refined categories were assessed at the following intervals: 0.5–3 months ("subacute"), 3–6 months ("prolonged"), and 6–9 months ("persistent").

Results

Out of 3,154 patients, a new ICD-10-CM code was documented among 499 patients (∼16%). Respiratory complaints, including cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea, and hypoxemia, were most common. Malaise and fatigue were reported consistently among 10–13% of patients at all three time-intervals. Musculoskeletal pain, circulatory symptoms, and sleep-wake disorders were also observed at primary care follow-up.

Conclusion

This cross-sectional study provides support of a post-acute COVID syndrome, demonstrating that patients continue to experience symptoms after the acute infection period. Extensive follow-up data allowed for examining new symptoms up to 9 months after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding of the course of multi-organ post-acute sequelae is restricted by cross-sectional study design limitations. Standardized, sequelae-related ICD-10-CM codes to specify the type and duration of post-acute COVID-related symptoms would enable better monitoring of the growing number of SARS-CoV-2 infection survivors.

### International classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification for the pulmonary, critical care, and sleep physician [^d06e16db]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

After a patient encounter, the physician uses two coding systems to bill for the service rendered to the patient. The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code is used to describe the encounter or procedure. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code is used to describe the diagnosis(es) of the patient. On October 1, 2015, ICD-9-CM coding will end, and all physicians will be required to use a new diagnostic coding system, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). This article describes the new diagnostic coding system and how it differs from the old system. There are resources and costs involved for physicians and physician practices to prepare properly for ICD-10-CM. Similar to other important events, the more thorough the preparation, the more likely a positive outcome will occur. Resource use is very important in preparation for the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Greater familiarity with ICD-10-CM plus a thorough, effective preparation will lead to reduced costs and a smooth transition. Coding descriptor changes and additional codes occur in ICD-10-CM for chronic bronchitis and emphysema, asthma, and respiratory failure. These changes will affect the coding of these diseases and disorders by physicians. Because the number of codes will increase more than fivefold, the complexity of documentation to support ICD-10-CM will increase substantially. The documentation in the patient's chart to support the ICD-10-CM codes used will need to be enhanced. The requirement for accurate and comprehensive documentation cannot be emphasized enough. All of the coding and documentation changes will be a challenge to pulmonary, critical care, and sleep physicians. They must be prepared fully when ICD-10-CM coding begins and ICD-9-CM coding stops abruptly on October 1, 2015.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 3 environmental hazards and risks [^9ff9e673]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Diving and air travel — flying after diving — The risk of developing decompression sickness (DCS) increases when divers ascend to increased altitude too soon after a dive, and commercial aircraft cabins are generally pressurized to the equivalent of approximately 1,830–2,440 m (6,000–8,000 ft) above sea level. Asymptomatic divers should wait before any altitude exposures > 610 m (> 2,000 ft), with recommended pre-flight surface intervals of ≥ 12 hours after surfacing from a single no-decompression dive, ≥ 18 hours after multiple dives or multiple days of diving, and 24–48 hours after a dive that required decompression stops. These recommended pre-flight surface intervals reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk for DCS; longer surface intervals further reduce this risk. Symptomatic divers should seek evaluation to rule out possible decompression illness before attempting any exposure to increased altitude, and a diagnosis of decompression illness generally requires appropriate treatment before any flight or ascent to altitude.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Variation in completeness of coding external cause of injuries under ICD-10-CM [^617b7d53]. Injury Prevention (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Information about causes of injury is key for injury prevention efforts. Historically, cause-of-injury coding in clinical practice has been incomplete due to the need for extra diagnosis codes in the International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding. The transition to ICD-10-CM and increased use of clinical support software for diagnosis coding is expected to improve completeness of cause-of-injury coding. This paper assesses the recording of external cause-of-injury codes specifically for those diagnoses where an additional code is still required.

Methods

We used electronic health record and claims data from 10 health systems from October 2015 to December 2021 to identify all inpatient and emergency encounters with a primary diagnosis of injury. The proportion of encounters that also included a valid external cause-of-injury code is presented.

Results

Most health systems had high rates of cause-of-injury coding: over 85% in emergency departments and over 75% in inpatient encounters with primary injury diagnoses. However, several sites had lower rates in both settings. State mandates were associated with consistently high external cause recording.

Conclusions

Completeness of cause-of-injury coding improved since the adoption of ICD-10-CM coding and increased slightly over the study period at most sites. However, significant variation remained, and completeness of cause-of-injury coding in any diagnosis data used for injury prevention planning should be empirically determined.

### Rates of future lumbar fusion in patients with cauda equina syndrome treated with decompression [^b5d77433]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Database

We conducted a retrospective study of patients from the Mariner national insurance claims database, available through PearlDiver (PearlDiver), consisting of anonymized records from 53 million orthopaedic patients between the years 2010 to 2018. The Mariner database contains insurance claims from multiple payer types, including commercial insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, and self-pay. It is searchable by billing codes identified in the database with Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and 10 th Revision (ICD-10) diagnostic and procedural codes. All records in PearlDiver are Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant. This study was determined exempt from additional review by our Institutional Review Board.

Patient Selection and Outcomes

Patients who underwent decompression within 1 month of a diagnosis of CES were identified in the database using CPT, ICD-9, and ICD-10 codes (Appendix). To account for patients who changed or lost insurance or left the database for other reasons, patients were excluded if they did not have continuously active records in the database over the study period; thus, all patients had a 5-year follow up in this study. Patients in the CES cohort were matched to patients from a LSS control group. The control group underwent similar decompression procedures as the CES group but lacked a diagnosis of CES and instead had an ICD-9 or ICD-10 code specific for LSS (Appendix). To further characterize the patients in the LSS control group, we identified the percentage of patients with an associated diagnosis of facet hypertrophy or disk extrusion. This LSS control group was matched in a 1:1 ratio with the CES cohort by the matching parameters of age, sex, obesity, tobacco use, and diabetes. Patients who underwent lumbar fusion on the same day as the index decompression procedure were excluded from the CES cohort and LSS control group. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year rates of conversion to fusion, as defined by a CPT or ICD procedure code for lumbar fusion (Appendix,), were identified for the two groups.

### Descriptive exploration of overdose codes in hospital and emergency department discharge data to inform development of drug overdose morbidity surveillance indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM [^ece69df2]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Analysis 2: other chapters

The ICD-10-CM codes are organised by major clinical conditions. To parsimoniously characterise possible broad co-occurring conditions among records with a drug overdose code in any field, the ICD-10-CM chapters of the coding manual (eg, 'A00–B99', 'C00–D99' and so on) of the primary diagnosis codes were examined. The primary diagnosis codes were categorised into ICD-10-CM coding chapters and quantified.

Analysis 3: encounter type

To examine the distribution of encounter types among drug overdose codes and their sequelae, records with a drug overdose code or sequelae to a drug overdose code were identified by searching all diagnosis fields, and the encounter type was categorised into initial (A), subsequent (D), sequela (S) or missing encounters based on the seventh character of the code.

Analysis 4: intent

To examine the distribution of intents among drug overdose, adverse effect and underdosing codes, records with a drug overdose, adverse effect or underdosing code were identified by searching all diagnosis fields, and the intent for the drug overdose code was categorised into unintentional, intentional self-harm, assault, undetermined, adverse effect, underdosing or missing based on the fifth/sixth character of the code. All categories of intent were analysed for completeness, though adverse effect and underdose are by definition not considered drug overdoses in this manuscript.

State staff tabulated frequencies and percentages for code position categories, encounter types, intents and primary diagnosis chapters using SAS V.9.4. State-specific results and averages of all state results are presented.

### Self-harm injury hospitalisations: an analysis of case selection criteria [^5f0a2907]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Self-harm case selection criteria and subset categorisation

Hospitalisation records were categorised into three mutually exclusive subsets which, when totalled, equals the entire universe of stays with a self-harm ICD-10-CM code (figure 1). Subset A was restricted to stays with a principal diagnosis of injury. The first step for classification was to identify an ICD-10-CM code indicating an initial encounter for an injury (any type) of any intent (unintentional, intentional or unspecified) (table 1) in the principal diagnosis field. The second step for subset A was identification of records with a self-harm injury code, initial encounter only, in any of the diagnosis or external cause fields. Additional information provided in the seventh character of the ICD-10-CM code details the type of encounter. For subset A, only records with codes indicating an initial encounter of self-harm were included (codes missing a seventh character were considered to be an initial encounter).

Subset B included cases with a non-injury principal diagnosis and initial encounter for self-harm in any of the other diagnosis or external cause fields. Though injury was not the principal diagnosis, an injury diagnosis code did appear in one of the other eight diagnosis fields in 93% of subset B cases. Subset C was composed of cases with any type of principal diagnosis and a self-harm code, in any field, noting only a subsequent or sequelae encounter. Ninety-nine per cent (99%) of subset C cases had an injury diagnosis in one of the eight secondary diagnosis fields.

### Identification of emergency care-sensitive conditions and characteristics of emergency department utilization [^bb147465]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Identifying Candidate Conditions for Expert Panel Review

To identify the candidate conditions to be rated by the panel, the following explicit principles were established for the selection of conditions: (1) they should be treated in most EDs, (2) they should be associated with a spectrum of adult age groups, (3) they should represent common reasons for which patients seek emergency care, and (4) some evidence must exist to suggest that quality clinical care in the ED may impact morbidity or mortality. Conditions for which improving ED care would be unlikely to substantially change patient outcomes were excluded. Diagnosis codes describing mental health conditions were considered out of scope for the current study and not included.

Next, 2 of us (A. A.V. and S.M. A.), an emergency medicine physician and an internist, created an initial list of conditions (ie, alphanumeric parent-level International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD - 10 - CM] codes) that met the preestablished criteria from a review of the emergency care literature, (n = 160) and suggestions from panelists (n = 7) prior to the rating process.

Among hospitalisations, on average, initial encounters represented 94.6% (median = 98.3%; range = 68.8%–98.8%). Subsequent encounters made up an average of 0.9% (median = 0.8%; range = 0.4%–1.3%) and sequelae 0.8% (median = 0.7%; range = 0.6%–1.2%) of hospitalisations. In state 3, encounter type was missing for 29.7% of hospitalisation records.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM mapping of the AAST emergency general surgery disease severity grading systems: conceptual approach, limitations, and recommendations for the future [^57d673b3]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) recently established a grading system for uniform reporting of anatomic severity of several emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases. There are five grades of severity for each disease, ranging from I (lowest severity) to V (highest severity). However, the grading process requires manual chart review. We sought to evaluate whether International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM) codes might allow estimation of AAST grades for EGS diseases. The Patient Assessment and Outcomes Committee of the AAST reviewed all available ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes relevant to 16 EGS diseases with available AAST grades. We then matched grades for each EGS disease with one or more ICD codes. We used the Official Coding Guidelines for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and the American Hospital Association's "Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM" for coding guidance. The ICD codes did not allow for matching all five AAST grades of severity for each of the 16 diseases. With ICD-9-CM, six diseases mapped into four categories of severity (instead of five), another six diseases into three categories of severity, and four diseases into only two categories of severity. With ICD-10-CM, five diseases mapped into four categories of severity, seven diseases into three categories, and four diseases into two categories. Two diseases mapped into discontinuous categories of grades (two in ICD-9-CM and one in ICD-10-CM). Although resolution is limited, ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes might have some utility in roughly approximating the severity of the AAST grades in the absence of more precise information. These ICD mappings should be validated and refined before widespread use to characterize EGS disease severity. In the long-term, it may be desirable to develop alternatives to ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for routine collection of disease severity characteristics.

### Descriptive exploration of overdose codes in hospital and emergency department discharge data to inform development of drug overdose morbidity surveillance indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM [^c35d9c38]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In October 2015, discharge data coding in the USA shifted to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), necessitating new indicator definitions for drug overdose morbidity. Amid the drug overdose crisis, characterising discharge records that have ICD-10-CM drug overdose codes can inform the development of standardised drug overdose morbidity indicator definitions for epidemiological surveillance.

Methods

Eight states submitted aggregated data involving hospital and emergency department (ED) discharge records with ICD-10-CM codes starting with T36–T50, for visits occurring from October 2015 to December 2016. Frequencies were calculated for (1) the position within the diagnosis billing fields where the drug overdose code occurred; (2) primary diagnosis code grouped by ICD-10-CM chapter; (3) encounter types; and (4) intents, underdosing and adverse effects.

Results

Among all records with a drug overdose code, the primary diagnosis field captured 70.6% of hospitalisations (median = 69.5%, range = 66.2%–76.8%) and 79.9% of ED visits (median = 80.7%; range = 69.8%–88.0%) on average across participating states. The most frequent primary diagnosis chapters included injury and mental disorder chapters. Among visits with codes for drug overdose initial encounters, subsequent encounters and sequelae, on average 94.6% of hospitalisation records (median = 98.3%; range = 68.8%–98.8%) and 95.5% of ED records (median = 99.5%; range = 79.2%–99.8%), represented initial encounters. Among records with drug overdose of any intent, adverse effect and underdosing codes, adverse effects comprised an average of 74.9% of hospitalisation records (median = 76.3%; range = 57.6%–81.1%) and 50.8% of ED records (median = 48.9%; range = 42.3%–66.8%), while unintentional intent comprised an average of 11.1% of hospitalisation records (median = 11.0%; range = 8.3%–14.5%) and 28.2% of ED records (median = 25.6%; range = 20.8%–40.7%).

Conclusion

Results highlight considerations for adapting and standardising drug overdose indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM.

### Evaluation and management of decompression illness – an intensivist's perspective [^a33c59e9]. Intensive Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Decompression illness (DCI) is becoming more prevalent as more people engage in activities involving extreme pressure environments such as recreational scuba-diving. Rapid diagnosis and treatment offer these patients the best chance of survival with minimal sequelae. It is thus important that critical care physicians are able to evaluate and diagnose the signs and symptoms of DCI. The cornerstones of current treatment include the administration of hyperbaric oxygen and adjunctive therapies such as hydration and medications. However, managing patients in a hyperbaric environment does present additional challenges with respect to the particular demands of critical care medicine in an altered pressure environment. This article reviews the underlying pathophysiology, clinical presentation and therapeutic options available to treat DCI, from the intensivist's perspective.

### Multisite medical record review of emergency department visits for unspecified injury of head following the ICD-10-CM coding transition [^88fadce0]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2016, a proposed International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition, Clinical Modification surveillance definition for traumatic brain injury (TBI) morbidity was introduced that excluded the unspecified injury of head (S09.90) diagnosis code. This study assessed emergency department (ED) medical records containing S09.90 for evidence of TBI based on medical documentation.

Methods

State health department representatives in Maryland, Kentucky, Colorado and Massachusetts reviewed a target of 385 randomly sampled ED records uniquely assigned the S09.90 diagnosis code (without proposed TBI codes), which were initial medical encounters among state residents discharged home during October 2015–December 2018. Using standardised abstraction procedures, reviewers recorded signs and symptoms of TBI, and head imaging results. A tiered case confirmation strategy was applied that assigned a level of certainty (high, medium, low, none) to each record based on the number and type of symptoms and imaging results present in the record. Positive predictive value (PPV) of S09.90 by level of TBI certainty was calculated by state.

Results

Wide variation in PPV of sampled ED records assigned S09.90: 36%–52% had medium or high evidence of TBI, while 48%–64% contained low or no evidence of a TBI. Loss of consciousness was mentioned in 8%–24% of sampled medical records.

Discussion

Exclusion of the S09.90 code in surveillance estimates may result in many missed TBI cases; inclusion may result in counting many false positives. Further, missed TBI cases influenced by incidence estimates, based on the TBI surveillance definition, may lead to inadequate allocation of public health resources.

- high probability of causal PFO

- cessation of diving/flying is not an option

- effective behavioral change to prevent the production of venous gas emboli is not possible

- the risk of further decompression sickness, despite conservative limitations, is deemed unacceptable by the patient after consultation with an experienced dive or aerospace physician.

### Ready or not! here comes ICD-10 [^7cb0ab4c]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) is a new system that is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on 16 January 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of 1 October 2013. While ICD-9 and ICD-10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains more than 141 000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the < 20 000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion and expense. Published statistics illustrate that there are instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 distinct ICD-10 codes. Also, there are multiple instances where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of healthcare whereas detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25 000 to $50 000.

### Use of ICD-10-CM coded hospitalisation and emergency department data for injury surveillance [^ee350889]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Injury surveillance, the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of injury data, provides critical information to support public health efforts to reduce injury-related morbidity, mortality and disability. For the past several decades, state and local health departments and national agencies in the USA have relied on the use of hospital discharge and emergency department (ED) data coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to conduct injury surveillance. Surveillance case definitions and analyses have been based on ICD-9-CM codes. However, a US mandate to code using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM)has resulted in a need to update injury surveillance case definitions and analysis guidance based on ICD-10-CM.

Beginning in October 2015, the US Department of Health and Human Services required all hospitals and healthcare providers covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act to use the ICD-10-CM to report electronic healthcare transactions. The coding structure of ICD-10-CM is based on ICD-10 mortality coding and classification published by the WHO, however, the classification scheme has been greatly expanded to capture the diagnostic detail needed for medical diagnoses. ICD-10-CM contains nearly five times the number of codes found in ICD-9-CM (approximately 72 000 codes in ICD-10-CM compared with 15 000 codes in ICD-9-CM). Because ICD-10-CM captures greater detail than either ICD-9-CM or ICD-10, this classification system has the potential to provide enhanced understanding of the types and causes of non-fatal injury.

### The impacts of ICD-10-CM on U.S. army injury surveillance [^03443bd9]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Injuries are the leading cause of medical encounters and lost work days in the U.S. Army, affecting more than half of active-duty soldiers annually. Historically, Army injury surveillance has captured both acute traumatic and cumulative microtraumatic overuse injuries. This article describes how the transition from the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM impacted U.S. military injury surveillance by comparing injury rates and distributions under both systems.

Methods

Mapping ICD-9-CM codes to the expanded ICD-10-CM codes is not a straightforward endeavor; therefore, the Army Public Health Center incorporated ICD-10-CM codes into a comprehensive, systematic approach to taxonomically categorize injuries. This taxonomic methodology was applied to Army injuries under ICD-10-CM (2016–2019) and compared with the ICD-9-CM Army injury surveillance definitions (2012–2015).

Results

Soldier injury rates appeared to increase when surveillance with ICD-10-CM began. Soldiers experienced 1,276 incident injury medical encounters per 1,000 person-years in 2015 (ICD-9-CM), compared with 1,804 injuries per 1,000 in 2016 (ICD-10-CM), a 41% increase. Importantly, the distribution of injuries also shifted, such that the average cumulative microtraumatic injury rate increased by 42% during 2016–2019 (ICD-10-CM) compared with the 2012–2015 average (ICD-9-CM), whereas acute traumatic injuries only increased by 17%.

Conclusions

The enhanced descriptions provided by ICD-10-CM codes and the applied taxonomic categorizations have improved precision in Army injury surveillance. Data unequivocally show that most injuries in this physically active population are cumulative microtraumatic injuries. The taxonomic methodology can be extended to injury surveillance in other populations and may allow a more efficient transition to ICD-11-CM.

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^4679ec01]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Traumatic aetiologies

In terms of traumatic cases, an APC subset of 202 (39%) cases had ICD-10-AM codes referencing the key terms "injury" and "spinal cord". These terms were taken to indicate a definitive diagnosis of a traumatic SCI or a spinal cord or cauda equina syndrome. In rank order, cervical cases were the most prevalent cause of SCI (135 [32%]) followed by thoracic (51 [10.1%]), and lumbar cases (16 [3.2%]). Table 2 presents the distribution and frequency of those traumatic cases identified and subsequently quantitated by ICD-10-AM code.

Non-traumatic aetiologies

ICD-10-AM codes identifying SCD epochs of care accounted for 115 [23%] of the 504 cases. Of these "vascular myelopathies", and "intraspinal abscess and granuloma" 28 [8.7%] were most frequently recorded. In terms of omissions, ethical constraints precluded the reporting of rare spinal or spinal cord aetiologies with < 5 recorded cases. Due to these constraints the cohort selected for analysis excluded ICD-10 codes for: (i) "Benign neoplasm of meninges: Spinal meninges"; and (ii) "Benign neoplasm of brain and other parts of central nervous system: Spinal cord".

Table 2 also presents ICD-10 codes for "Guillain-Barré syndrome" (22 cases). Of note, GB is a forme fruste diagnosis, and as such new index cases are; first, admitted for inpatient rehabilitation in our facility and secondly, consented to participate and recorded in the ASCIR. For the purpose of this study GB cases were retained for analysis.

Vertebral column injuries

The NLM descriptors/ search terms "fracture" and "neck", or "cervical spine", "thoracic spine" or "lumbar spine" and "fracture" were used in this study to define an epoch of inpatient care due to accidental (low or high impact trauma) or pathological fracture (data not shown). However, from these descriptors it is not reasonable to infer a sine qua non diagnosis of SCI/D. Radiological evidence of spinal canal compromise with concomitant spinal cord compression, together with an ISNCSCI physical examination would be necessary to be confident of sine qua non. These filters were rejected in the construction of the CONSORT framework (Fig. 1) but may inform future attempts to construct a spinal disorders registry.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^cd4941f1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Level of injury (1)

Similarly, inference about level of injury can be extrapolated from the ICD-10 descriptor "tetraplegia or paraplegia unspecified" but this controlled vocabulary cannot distinguish aetiology (e.g. SCI from SCD). Thus, we report that it is not reasonable to derive a definitive SCI/D aetiology or assign an injury level from this single ICD-10-AM 7th EDN code. For reasons involving false positives or false negatives, this filter was rejected and is omitted from Fig. 1.

Systematic search strategy

To reduce the assumptions introduced by single filters or NLM search terms, we next referenced aggregated ICD-10 codes to the consensus taxonomies of SCD and the ISNCSCI standard.

Level of injury (2)

A Windows Excel find function search for all descriptors containing the NLM terms "paraplegia" or "tetraplegia" or " cauda equina syndrome" yielded a definitive cohort of 140 (28%) cases (Fig. 3). In rank order, a principal diagnosis of "Other paralytic syndromes: Cauda equina syndrome" (50 cases; 9.9%) was the most common followed by "Paraplegia and tetraplegia: Tetraplegia, unspecified" (36 cases; 7.1%) and "Paraplegia and tetraplegia: Paraplegia, unspecified" (34 cases; 6.7%). From this we surmise that when referenced to ICD-10 standards and the controlled NLM vocabulary, an agnostic systematic search strategy can provide some information of relevance to health service planning about level of injury (constrained to 3 categories); with the caveat that it is not possible to rule out false positives/ negatives or achieve a precise SCI/D taxonomic classification.

Exotropia ICD-10 CM classifications — the page lists specific coding categories and codes: Alternating (H50.15), Alternating with A pattern (H50.16), Alternating with specified noncomitancy not elsewhere classifiable (includes alphabetical patterns) (H50.18), Alternating with V pattern (H50.17), Monocular (H50.11–), Monocular with A pattern (H50.12–), Intermittent unspecified (H50.30), Alternating, intermittent (H50.34), Monocular, intermittent (H50.33–), and Unspecified (H50.10). The notation states "CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; = 1, right eye; 2, left eye", and additional guidance explains that "the final character of the codes indicates laterality", that "Esotropia and exotropia do not have bilateral codes", so "if the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side", and that when laterality is specified "most often you will find: Right is 1" and "Left is 2".

### Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^d40700dd]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal arterial occlusion ICD-10 CM codes — Central retinal artery occlusion includes H34.11, H34.12, and H34.13; arterial branch occlusion includes H34.231, H34.232, and H34.233; partial retinal artery occlusion includes H34.211, H34.212, and H34.213; and transient retinal artery occlusion includes H34.01, H34.02, and H34.03. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality, and if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3; ICD = International Classification of Diseases and CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States.

### Use of the postacute sequelae of COVID-19 diagnosis code in routine clinical practice in the US [^505766f9]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

A new International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code (U09.9 Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified) was introduced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on October 1, 2021.

Objective

To examine the use of the U09.9 code and describe concurrently diagnosed conditions to understand physician use of this code in clinical practice.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study of US patients with an ICD-10-CM code for post-COVID-19 condition used deidentified patient-level claims data aggregated by HealthVerity. Children and adolescents (aged 0–17 years) and adults (aged 18–64 and ≥ 65 years) with a post-COVID-19 condition code were identified between October 1, 2021, and January 31, 2022. To identify a prior COVID-19 diagnosis, 3 months of continuous enrollment (CE) before the post-COVID-19 diagnosis date was required.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Presence of the ICD-10-CM U09.9 code.

Results

There were 56 143 patients (7723 female patients [61.2%]; mean [SD] age, 47.6 [19.2] years) with a post-COVID-19 diagnosis code, with cases increasing in mid-December 2021 following the trajectory of the Omicron case wave by 3 to 4 weeks. The analysis cohort included 12 622 patients after the 3-month preindex CE criteria was applied. Among this cohort, the median (IQR) age was 49 (35–61) years; however, 1080 (8.6%) were pediatric patients. The U09.9 code was used most often in the outpatient setting, although 305 older adults (14.0%) were inpatients. Only 698 patients (5.5%) had at least 1 of the 5 codes listed as possible concurrent conditions in the coding guidance. Only 8879 patients (70.4%) had a documented acute COVID-19 diagnosis code (569 [52.7%] among children), and the median (IQR) time between acute COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 diagnosis codes was 56 (21–200) days. The most common concurrently coded conditions varied by age; children experienced COVID-19-like symptoms (eg, 207 [19.2%] had cough and 115 [10.6%] had breathing abnormalities), while 459 older adults aged 65 years or older (21.1%) experienced respiratory failure and 189 (8.7%) experienced viral pneumonia.

Conclusions and Relevance

This retrospective cohort study found patients with a post-COVID-19 ICD-10-CM diagnosis code following the acute phase of COVID-19 disease among patients of all ages in clinical practice in the US. The use of the U09.9 code encompassed a wide range of conditions. It will be important to monitor how the use of this code changes as the pandemic continues to evolve.

### Prognostic factors of spinal cord decompression sickness in recreational diving: retrospective and multicentric analysis of 279 cases [^6ac7ff0d]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Background

This study aims to determine the potential risk factors associated with the development of severe diving-related spinal cord decompression sickness (DCS).

Methods

Two hundred and seventy nine injured recreational divers (42 ± 12 years; 53 women) presenting symptoms of spinal cord DCS were retrospectively included from seven hyperbaric centers in France and Belgium. Diving information, symptom latency after surfacing, time interval between symptom onset and hyperbaric treatment were studied. The initial severity of spinal cord DCS was rated with the Boussuges severity score, and the presence of sequelae was evaluated at 1 month. Initial recompression treatment at 2.8 ATA with 100% oxygen breathing or deeper recompression up to 4 or 6 ATA with nitrogen or helium-oxygen breathing mixture were also recorded.

Results

Twenty six percent of DCS had incomplete resolution after 1 month. Multivariate analysis revealed several independent factors associated with a bad recovery: age ≥ 42 [OR 1.04 (1–1.07)], depth ≥ 39 m [OR 1.04 (1–1.07)], bladder dysfunction [OR 3.8 (1.3–11.15)], persistence or worsening of clinical symptoms before recompression [OR 2.07 (1.23–3.48)], and a Boussuges severity score > 7 [OR 1.16 (1.03–1.31)]. However, the time to recompression and the choice of initial hyperbaric procedure did not significantly influence recovery after statistical adjustment.

Conclusions

Clinical symptoms of spinal cord DCS and their initial course before admission to the hyperbaric center should be considered as major prognostic factors in recovery. A new severity score is proposed to optimize the initial clinical evaluation for spinal cord DCS.

### Complex modeling with detailed temporal predictors does not improve health records-based suicide risk prediction [^895365a7]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Follow-up and outcomes

We estimated separate models for mental health specialty visits and general medical visits to predict risk of suicide attempt (both fatal and nonfatal) in the subsequent 30 and 90 days and suicide death in the subsequent 90 days; there were too few suicide deaths to estimate risk in the 30 days following a visit. In this study, suicide attempt is defined as a documented diagnosis of self-harm. Suicides were identified using state death certificates with cause of death ICD-10 mortality codes in the ranges X60-X84, Y10-Y34, Y87.0, and Y87.2. Nonfatal suicide attempts were identified using diagnosis codes from electronic health records and insurance claims. Non-fatal suicide attempts on or before September 30, 2015 were identified using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes E950-E958 (suicide and self-inflicted injury) or E980-E988 (injury of undetermined intent). After September 30, 2015, non-fatal suicide attempts were identified using ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes were used to identify non-fatal suicide attempts. The full list of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes used to identify non-fatal suicide attempts includes over 1000 (non-adjacent) codes and can be found at: We briefly summarize here. An ICD-10 era attempt was defined as either:(1) the presence of any single code from the following ranges: (a) X71-X83 (external causes of morbidity classified as intentional self-harm), (b) Y21-Y33 (external causes of morbidity of undetermined intent), (c) T36-T65 (poisoning/toxic effects) or T71 (asphyxiation) initial encounter codes with "intentional self-harm" or "undetermined intent" in the official code description, or (d) T14.91 (suicide attempt); or (2) the presence of suicidal ideation code R45.851 accompanied by an initial encounter code for a wound (S/T codes with "wound", "laceration", or "traumatic amputation" in the description) or poisoning/toxic effects (T codes with "poisoning" or "toxic" in the description) recorded in the same encounter.

### Best practices in documenting and coding high-value care in workers' compensation encounters-ACOEM guidance statement [^c31311c8]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Work disability risk screening — documentation should capture risks, counseling, and coordination needs. The page states, "Risk factors for poor recovery should be documented to support the management of functional impact/outcomes and risk of work disability", and that "Screening for work disability risk may also be conducted informally by asking the patient about expectations and concerns related to returning to work". It notes, "Responses may point to the need to explore further to identify risks such as pain catastrophizing, fear/avoidance, disability beliefs, injustice experience, work friction, and system barriers", and adds, "Such discussions relate to counseling and the need for care coordination (eg, potential need for behavioral health referral) and should be documented as such when using time-based coding". The guidance further clarifies, "Screening for work disability risk also relates directly to the risk level documentation needed for MDM-based coding" and "Work disability risk should be addressed in the initial encounters and in later encounters if indicated", while acknowledging that "there are many different screening tools that have been developed and standardized to address psychosocial patient-specific as well as organizational risk factors for delayed recovery".

### Risk of subsequent fusion after isolated decompression of lumbar facet cysts [^384f527f]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar facet cysts represent a potential source of nerve root compression in elderly patients. Isolated decompression without fusion has proven to be a reasonable treatment option in properly indicated patients. However, the risk of lumbar fusion after isolated decompression and facet cyst excision has yet to be elucidated.

Methods

The PearlDiver database was reviewed for patients undergoing isolated laminectomy for lumbar facet cyst from January 2015 to December 2018 using Current Procedural Terminology coding. Patients undergoing concomitant fusion or additional decompression, as well as those diagnosed with preexisting spondylolisthesis or without a minimum of 5-year follow-up, were excluded. Rates of subsequent lumbar fusion and potential risk factors for subsequent fusion were identified. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, chi square test, and multivariate logistic regression. Results were considered significant at P < 0.05.

Results

In total, 10,707 patients were ultimately included for analysis. At 5-year follow-up, 727 (6.79%) of patients underwent subsequent lumbar fusion after initial isolated decompression. Of these, 301 (2.81% of total patients, 41.4% of fusion patients) underwent fusion within the first year after decompression. Multivariate analysis identified chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and osteoarthritis as risk factors for requiring subsequent lumbar fusion at 5 years following the index decompression procedure (P < 0.033; all).

Conclusion

Patients undergoing isolated decompression for lumbar facet cysts undergo subsequent lumbar fusion at a 5-year rate of 6.79%. Risk factors for subsequent decompression include chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. This study will assist spine surgeons in appropriately counseling patients on expected postoperative course and potential risks of isolated decompression.

### Validation of an ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM map to AIS 2005 update 2008 [^84fef7ca]. Injury Prevention (2019). Medium credibility.

Although the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) is the most widely used severity scoring system for traumatic injuries, hospitals are required to document and bill based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). An expert panel recently developed a map between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM to AIS 2005 Update 2008. This study aimed to validate the recently developed map using a large trauma registry. The map demonstrated moderate to substantial agreement for maximum AIS (MAIS) scores per body region based on expert chart review versus map-derived values (range: 44%-86%). Injury Severity Scores (ISSs) calculated from expert coders versus map-derived values were also compared and demonstrated moderate agreement (ICD-9-CM: 48%, ICD-10-CM: 54%). Although not a perfect conversion tool, the new ICD-AIS map provides a systematic method to assign injury severity for datasets with only ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes available and can be used for future injury-related research and data analysis.

### Identification of work-related injury emergency department visits using international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification (ICD-10-CM) codes [^832d2f59]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

As most of the work-related ED visits in this study were identified by the use of employment status and place of occurrence codes, it is important to note that these external cause of morbidity codes are not required for reimbursement by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or Kentucky statutes; ICD-10-CM coding mandates vary by state. The usefulness of external cause of morbidity codes is limited by the documentation of occupational information by healthcare practitioners. A sample of medical records from 12 EDs in one state reported 98% ICD-9-CM completion and cause of injury accuracy was 65% and 57% for work-related and non-work-related cases, respectively; only 30% of all cases had completed place of occurrence codes; medical record reviews are yet to be performed on work-related ICD-10-CM cases. Clinicians are encouraged to document adequate injury details (eg, mechanism, intent, location and preceding activity) in the medical record for accurate ICD-10-CM coding of the ED encounter by medical coders. The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists is encouraged to work with medical and professional associations to develop and deliver continuing education and training to raise awareness about the important role that health practitioners serve in work-related injury surveillance and prevention. Suggested training topics range from injury documentation and data entry to quality and completeness of population-based surveillance. Healthcare providers are integral for the accurate assignment by medical coders of ICD-10-CM work-related injuries seen in the ED.

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^cd55411e]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

### New classification for deaths and injuries involving terrorism [^af9ed204]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2002). Low credibility.

Classification of the deaths and injuries that occurred as the result of the events of September 11, 2001, presented CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) with a dilemma. Under the current classification systems for mortality and morbidity, the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) and the United States' International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), deaths and injuries associated with acts of terrorism could not be identified uniquely.

### Simulation of ICD-9 to ICD-10-CM transition for family medicine: simple or convoluted? [^3f7280a1]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the transition from International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to Interactional Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), on family medicine and to identify areas where additional training might be required.

Methods

Family medicine ICD-9-CM codes were obtained from an Illinois Medicaid data set (113,000 patient visits and $5.5 million in claims). Using the science of networks, we evaluated each ICD-9-CM code used by family medicine physicians to determine whether the transition was simple or convoluted. A simple transition is defined as 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to 1 ICD-10-CM code, or 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to multiple ICD-10-CM codes. A convoluted transition is where the transitions between coding systems is nonreciprocal and complex, with multiple codes for which definitions become intertwined. Three family medicine physicians evaluated the most frequently encountered complex mappings for clinical accuracy.

Results

Of the 1635 diagnosis codes used by family medicine physicians, 70% of the codes were categorized as simple, 27% of codes were convoluted, and 3% had no mapping. For the visits, 75%, 24%, and 1% corresponded with simple, convoluted, and no mapping, respectively. Payment for submitted claims was similarly aligned. Of the frequently encountered convoluted codes, 3 diagnosis codes were clinically incorrect, but they represent only < 0.1% of the overall diagnosis codes.

Conclusions

The transition to ICD-10-CM is simple for 70% or more of diagnosis codes, visits, and reimbursement for a family medicine physician. However, some frequently used codes for disease management are convoluted and incorrect, and for which additional resources need to be invested to ensure a successful transition to ICD-10-CM.

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^7afe0bc9]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

APC coded data were extracted by codes selected from the ICD-10 "Health conditions", the data dictionary for this study. Data aggregated by selected ICD-10 code descriptors then were filtered using pre-selected key word search terms. Blank cells were treated as "missing completely at random" and a list-wise deletion strategy applied to remove incomplete cases. CONSORT flow charts (Figs. 1, 2) show the sequence of filtered searches applied to: first, unadjusted and secondly, APC case-mixed adjusted ICD-10 data.

Fig. 1
CONSORT flow chart presents filter steps applied to the Australian Admitted Patient Care (APC) repository to test fidelity to detect all-cause new index SCI/D cases (Aim 1).

Level 1 = unadjusted APC (R); unadjusted Australian Spinal Cord Injury Registry (ASCIR) (L); Level 2 = International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) adjusted APC (R); and Level 3 = Data Element (case-mix coded "acute") adjusted ICD-10-APC (R). Data are expressed as: (i) counts (N; solid line); and (ii) APC (N; frequency difference) versus ASCIR (dashed line).

Level 1 = unadjusted APC (R); Level 2 = International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) adjusted APC (R); and Level 3 = Medical Evidence Subject Heading (MeSH) ("fracture"; "injuries") adjusted ICD-10-APC (centre-R); Level 4 = Data Element (case-mix coded "acute") adjusted MeSH-ICD-10-APC (R). ASCIR Level 1 = unadjusted ASCIR (L); Level 2 = adjusted ASCIR ("traumatic") (far-L). Data are expressed as: i) counts (N; solid line); and ii) APC (N; frequency difference) versus ASCIR (dashed line).

Simple descriptive statistics were applied to parametric variables (means, SD). Categorical variables are reported as frequencies (counts/ percentages). An alpha value of < 5% was taken as statistically significant.

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^0044d40a]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

De-identified data were retrieved from the large SA Health APC data repository (2012–2017). Data then were cleaned and each ICD-10-AM descriptor of "Health Conditions" decoded and manually matched to its controlled "inclusive term" descriptor to create code-descriptor pairs. Core data-sets then were assembled. Table S4 presents the ICD-10 codes held in the APC collection together with each paired "inclusive term". Key words referenced to the NLM controlled vocabulary were selected to aggregate data into 2 categories; traumatic and non-traumatic. These categories can also be phrased as SCI and SCD classifications. Specifically, the aggregated search terms "injury" and "spinal cord" were selected to classify traumatic aetiology. The aggregated search terms "spinal cord" and "vascular myelopathies", or "spinal cord" and "inflammatory myelopathies", or "spinal cord" and "neoplastic disorders" were selected to classify non-traumatic aetiologies. Key word searches were performed using the Microsoft Windows Excel "find" function.

Framework validation

To test the fidelity of this conceptual framework to identify and quantify SCI/D the new index case data of a SCI/D cohort held in the ASCIR collection (2012–2017) were retrieved for secondary analysis. The ASCIR collection holds the data of an Australian (SA/ NT residents or visitors) cohort presenting for inpatient rehabilitation to the South Australian Spinal Cord Injury Service, South Australia with a definitive clinical diagnosis of SCI/D. Radiological imaging and the International Standard for the Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury [ISNCSCI] routinely are applied in this facility to derive a definitive SCI/D diagnosis (sine qua non). Briefly, collected variables include demographic and socio-economic variables, causation, aetiology, and injury/ lesion characteristics (injury level and severity stratified into ISNCSCI AIS Grades A-D), functional (Functional Independence Measure) and process data (length of stay).

### Abdominal CT scan findings of decompression sickness: a case report [^e8204993]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

This case report depicts the radiologic findings of a 51-year-old male presenting with Decompression Sickness. Decompression Sickness is diagnosed clinically, therefore radiologic imaging of this disease entity is limited. Our patient's history includes a scuba dive to depth of 110 feet with a descending time of 24 minutes and an ascending time of 8 minutes. The patient subsequently presented to the Emergency Room with symptoms of shortness of breath and abdominal pain. The abdominal pain prompted physicians to explore further, and hence computed tomography (CT) imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed. This case report demonstrates a striking and unique gas pattern in both the systemic and portal venous system of our patient and provides an excellent example of the imaging findings of Decompression Sickness in the literature.

### Cow-related injuries in Wisconsin during 2017–2023 [^ab0b9eb5]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Case Definitions

Our definition of agricultural injury is based on existing work that identified ICD‐10‐CM external codes for agriculture, forestry, and fishing. In our analysis, we excluded any forestry and fishing code. We included initial encounter codes only, which excluded subsequent and sequelae codes. As such, in the hospital discharge data, a cow‐related injury was defined as any agricultural record in which external cause of injury was coded as "bitten by cow" (W5521XA), "struck by cow" (W5522XA), or "other contact with cow" (W5529XA). We only retained the initial encounter and thus excluded any subsequent encounter or sequela. The remaining work‐related agricultural injury codes were considered non‐cow‐related injuries (all other agricultural injuries).

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^8b6d266d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system with clinical modifications (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures associated with health care utilization. The pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) classification system uses ICD codes to determine the presence of 1 or more CCCs (10 body-system categories) and includes posttransplant and technology variables to signify additional complexity (Box). The open-source code CCC system is the most widely used classification system to study patients younger than 18 years with medical complexities. The CCC system has evolved alongside the ICD system and must account for updates in the underlying ICD codes: CCC version 1 (V1)corresponded to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and version 2 (V2) to the transition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Since implementation of the ICD-10-CM in the US in 2015, however, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The CCC system thus required a major update to capture the full spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

### Outcomes of in-person and telehealth ambulatory encounters during COVID-19 within a large commercially insured cohort [^e79c7098]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

For selected ACS conditions, we used multivariate logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs to assess the independent effect of the type of initial encounter on the likelihood of any 14-day follow-up encounters, adjusted for various member characteristics, including age, sex, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index based on 2019 ambulatory encounters, condition at the initial encounter, urban vs rural location of residence, member's initial encounter coinciding in a COVID-19 hotspot, Area Deprivation Index, and internet connectivity levels. For chronic conditions, we included an encounter-level severity adjustment based on the primary diagnosis of the initial encounter. eTable 6 in the Supplement presents the assignment of a severity level to each complete ICD-10 primary diagnosis within a 3-digit ICD-10 category. This level was assigned based on clinical judgment as to the relative severity of the complete ICD-10 code within the 3-digit category.

Only members with at least 1 telehealth-eligible service and at least 1 encounter in 2020 were included in the regression analysis (n = 1 086 720). The characteristics of this population are presented in eTable 7 in the Supplement. We performed a second logistic regression including an interaction term between the type of initial encounter and the specific ACS condition to address how telehealth effectiveness may vary by each clinical condition type. We used SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) to conduct the analyses.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### The transition to ICD-10-CM: challenges for pediatric practice [^51ad6a56]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Diagnostic codes are used widely within health care for billing, quality assessment, and to measure clinical outcomes. The US health care system will transition to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), in October 2015. Little is known about how this transition will affect pediatric practices. The objective of this study was to examine how the transition to ICD-10-CM may result in ambiguity of clinical information and financial disruption for pediatricians.

Methods

Using a statewide data set from Illinois Medicaid specified for pediatricians, 2708 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, diagnosis codes were identified. Diagnosis codes were categorized into 1 of 5 categories: identity, class-to-subclass, subclass-to-class, convoluted, and no translation. The convoluted and high-cost diagnostic codes (n = 636) were analyzed for accuracy and categorized into "information loss", "overlapping categories", "inconsistent", and "consistent". Finally, reimbursement by Medicaid was calculated for each category.

Results

Twenty-six percent of pediatric diagnosis codes are convoluted, which represents 21% of Illinois Medicaid pediatric patient encounters and 16% of reimbursement. The diagnosis codes represented by information loss (3.6%), overlapping categories (3.2%), and inconsistent (1.2%) represent 8% of Medicaid pediatric reimbursement.

Conclusions

The potential for financial disruption and administrative errors from 8% of reimbursement diagnosis codes necessitates special attention to these codes in preparing for the transition to ICD-10-CM for pediatric practices.

Preventing diving disorders — planning and equipment guidance is provided: Recreational divers should dive conservatively and well within the no-decompression limits of their dive tables or computers; when multiple dives are planned, strict guidelines known as surface intervals are prescribed to allow adequate time for dissolved inert gas to drop to acceptable levels before the next dive; tables derived from human-tested algorithms have traditionally been used to manually calculate dive times and surface intervals, but dive computers use the same algorithms with real-time depth and time inputs to compute individual guidance and have largely replaced tables for manual dive planning.

### Cat-scratch disease in the United States, 2005–2013 [^9523af3e]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database (Truven Health Analytics, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) for 2005–2013. This database contains information on employer-sponsored private health insurance claims from employees, their spouses, and their dependents from all 50 states. The database contains records for persons < 65 years of age only.

The MarketScan database includes information about inpatient admissions, outpatient clinic visits, and emergency department visits with associated billing codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). A case was defined as illness in any patient with an insurance claims record for inpatient or outpatient care that included the ICD-9-CM code for cat-scratch disease (078.3) as either a principal or secondary diagnosis. Only the first record with the 078.3 code was counted and considered the incident event. Patients who had been admitted as inpatients and had also had outpatient visits were counted as inpatients.

Because some persons in the database were covered by an included health insurance plan for only part of each year, we calculated the denominators for incidence calculations by summing the total number of person-months by year, region, age, and sex. We then divided these sums by 12 to yield the number of person-years for each category. To assess changes in the epidemiology of CSD over time, we divided the dataset into two 3-year periods (2005–2007 and 2011–2013), with a washout period of 3 years in between.

The cost of hospitalization and outpatient visits was calculated by summing total payments for the initial encounter plus any subsequent encounter with the 078.3 code up to 1 year afterward. Total costs included the primary insurance payment, co-insurance, and patient copayment. Costs for procedures such as phlebotomy and laboratory testing were included if they had an associated 078.3 code. Costs of inpatient medications were incorporated into the total payments for hospital stay. Outpatient prescriptions were included in the total cost calculation if they were for an antimicrobial drug recommended for treatment of CSD and prescribed within 30 days before or after the initial outpatient 078.3 encounter.

Secondary headache — International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) diagnostic criteria are outlined as follows: Initial evaluation of headache should aim to determine whether a secondary cause exists, and emergent evaluation should be considered based on red flag features; in general, a secondary headache can be diagnosed if the headache is new and occurs in close temporal relation to another disorder known to cause headache, or when a preexisting headache disorder significantly worsens in close temporal relation to a causative disorder, in which case both the primary and secondary headache diagnoses should be given. General diagnostic criteria for secondary headaches require: A. any headache fulfilling C; B. another disorder scientifically documented to be able to cause headache has been diagnosed with evidence of causation demonstrated by at least two of the following — headache has developed in temporal relation to the onset of the presumed causative disorder; either or both of the following: headache has significantly worsened in parallel with worsening of the presumed causative disorder or headache has significantly improved in parallel with improvement of the presumed causative disorder; headache has characteristics typical for the causative disorder; or other evidence of causation exists; and C. not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.

Acute mountain sickness (AMS) — prevalence, diagnosis, and course are summarized as follows: "AMS is the most common form of altitude illness, affecting, for example, 25% of all visitors sleeping at altitudes ≥ 2,450 m (> 8,000 ft) in Colorado". "Diagnosis of AMS is based on a history of recent ascent to high altitude and the presence of subjective symptoms". Symptoms resemble a hangover; "headache is the cardinal symptom, usually accompanied by ≥ 1 of the following: anorexia, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, or, occasionally, vomiting", although "Uncommonly, AMS presents without headache". "Symptom onset is usually 2–12 hours after initial arrival at a high altitude or after ascent to a higher elevation and often during or after the first night". Pediatric presentation is noted: "Preverbal children with AMS can develop loss of appetite, irritability, and pallor". The condition generally improves without further ascent: "AMS generally resolves within 12–48 hours if travelers do not ascend farther", and "The condition is typically self-limited, developing and resolving over 1–3 days".

### Cost minimization analysis of digital-first healthcare pathways in primary care [^4ea65dc5]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

An episode was established when a patient first contacted healthcare services via either the digital-first or traditional pathway, requiring that no prior healthcare encounters had occurred within the preceding 14 days. Each episode's utilization was then tracked for 14 days from the initial contact (Fig. 2). This 14-day follow-up window was selected based on the acute and self-limiting nature of the studied conditions, which typically resolve within one to two weeks. Moreover, comparable follow-up periods are frequently used in prior studies evaluating similar minor acute conditions, especially in digital health contexts. The majority of the encounters occurred within the first two weeks after the initial encounter, with utilization declining substantially thereafter towards baseline levels (Supplementary Fig. 3). Our cost analysis encompassed all primary care services utilized within this 14-day follow-up window, irrespective of modality. The first ICD-10 or ICPC-2 code present during an episode was used to determine the clinical presentation-category, so for example if the first encounter had no recorded code the next encounter with a code was used.

Fig. 2
Conceptual definition of an episode of care.

An episode begins with an index (first) encounter, provided there were no prior related contacts in the preceding 14 days, and includes any follow-up visits occurring within 14 days after the initial contact.

Cost estimation

We obtained cost data from the provider's administrative database and regional cost catalogs. Each healthcare encounter in primary care has an associated cost based on standard tariffs (e.g. staff time and facility use, etc.), and each laboratory test and imaging has a unit cost. We used the Päijät-Häme Wellbeing Services County public standard pricing catalog for public primary care services to assign costs (Supplementary Table 13). These prices reflect the health system's perspective (approximately the cost or tariff charged for providing the service). Costs were calculated in Euros (€) at 2024 price levels. For each episode, we summed: (1) all encounter costs (clinic visits, digital consultations, phone consultations), (2) any laboratory test costs ordered during the episode window, and (3) any imaging costs (e.g. if an X-ray was done). We did not include indirect costs (like patient travel expenses or lost productivity) in the base analysis – our perspective is that of the healthcare provider/payer.
