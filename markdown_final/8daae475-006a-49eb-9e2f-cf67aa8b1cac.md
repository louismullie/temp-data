## Question

Do you have to get afib cardioverted if normal heart rate

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient with atrial fibrillation and a normal ventricular heart rate should undergo cardioversion, and under what circumstances cardioversion is indicated despite adequate rate control. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "normal heart rate" means in the context of AF and whether rate control alone is sufficient. Then, I should verify the core principle that rhythm control is symptom-driven, not rate-driven. Next, I will review guideline-based indications for cardioversion, including special scenarios like early AF, heart failure, and pre-excitation. After that, I need to check the anticoagulation requirements and thromboembolic risk around cardioversion. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and state when cardioversion is and is not appropriate in a patient with AF and a controlled ventricular rate.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misinterpret the question: "normal heart rate" in AF typically refers to a controlled ventricular response, often defined as resting HR less than about 80–100 bpm, which is a rate-control target rather than restoration of sinus rhythm; importantly, the patient remains in AF unless cardioversion or spontaneous conversion occurs, so rate control does not equal rhythm control [^1129PNwd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does a normal ventricular rate obviate the need for cardioversion? I should confirm the core principle: rhythm-control decisions are primarily symptom-driven, not dictated by heart rate alone; guidelines consistently prioritize rate control and anticoagulation for most patients, reserving rhythm control — including cardioversion — for those with persistent symptoms, specific comorbidities, or patient preference after shared decision-making [^114yg1fo] [^116XDtfT].

> Next, I should review when cardioversion is indicated despite a normal ventricular rate; let me think about the main buckets: symptomatic persistent AF where rhythm control is pursued, early AF where early rhythm control may improve outcomes, heart failure contexts where rhythm control can be beneficial, and special populations such as pre-excitation or pregnancy; I need to ensure I'm aligning each with guideline language and evidence [^111iJvyR] [^112w9rgz] [^112xnBjM] [^117HeMaZ].

> I will now examine symptomatic persistent AF with adequate rate control; guidelines recommend considering cardioversion as part of a rhythm-control strategy when symptoms persist despite rate control, with the aim of improving quality of life and exercise tolerance, recognizing that AFFIRM and RACE showed no mortality advantage of rhythm over rate control in older, comorbid populations but did not negate symptom-driven rhythm restoration in appropriately selected patients [^111iJvyR] [^115izmTN] [^1133Nt8V].

> But wait, what if the AF is recent-onset; does timing change the calculus? Early rhythm control within the first year of diagnosis has been associated with fewer adverse cardiovascular outcomes in EAST-AFNET 4, and observational registry data suggest lower mortality with early cardioversion; thus, even with a controlled ventricular rate, early AF may be a scenario where a trial of rhythm control — including cardioversion — can be reasonable after addressing anticoagulation and candidacy [^112w9rgz] [^1139n1hJ] [^113qYq9C].

> Let me consider heart failure phenotypes; in HFrEF, rhythm control may improve symptoms and outcomes in selected patients, and in HFpEF, observational data suggest lower mortality with rhythm control compared with rate control; I should double-check that guidelines support considering rhythm control in HF patients with persistent symptoms or AF-mediated cardiomyopathy, which they do, often alongside a stricter rate target when AF-induced cardiomyopathy is suspected [^116TK1rq] [^1177LmhS] [^116Kz6Bc].

> I need to ensure I cover special populations; in Wolff-Parkinson-White with AF, AV nodal blockers are contraindicated and urgent cardioversion is indicated if there is hemodynamic instability or very rapid pre-excited conduction, so a "normal" ventricular rate does not apply here because the pathway physiology changes the risk profile entirely; similarly, in pregnancy with hemodynamic compromise or pre-excited AF, immediate cardioversion is recommended to protect maternal–fetal status [^112xnBjM] [^117HeMaZ].

> Next, I should review anticoagulation and thromboembolic risk because cardioversion changes stroke risk; if AF duration is more than 24–48 hours or unknown, I should confirm that guidelines require either 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation before elective cardioversion or a TEE to exclude left atrial appendage thrombus, followed by at least 4 weeks of anticoagulation after restoration of sinus rhythm; DOACs are preferred over VKAs when eligible, and in higher thromboembolic risk patients with short-duration AF not on anticoagulation, pre-cardioversion imaging is reasonable even if duration is less than 48 hours [^116AHvM2] [^116wUj3z] [^113w9Jzu].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about asymptomatic AF with a normal ventricular rate; should we cardiovert proactively? I should confirm that routine cardioversion is not recommended in asymptomatic patients without another indication, as AFFIRM and RACE showed no survival advantage and rhythm control increases hospitalizations; however, a diagnostic cardioversion trial can be considered when symptoms are uncertain or to clarify AF-attributable complaints, recognizing recurrence is common and maintenance therapy may be needed if symptoms recur [^1133Nt8V] [^114yg1fo] [^115DYuSv].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework so I don't miss anything: if the patient has persistent AF with bothersome symptoms despite a controlled ventricular rate, cardioversion is reasonable as part of a rhythm-control plan; if AF is recent-onset, early rhythm control may confer outcome benefits and cardioversion can be considered; if there is AF with pre-excitation or pregnancy with instability, cardioversion is indicated regardless of rate; if the patient is asymptomatic with good rate control, continue rate control and anticoagulation without routine cardioversion, while using shared decision-making to align with patient preferences and comorbidities [^111iJvyR] [^112w9rgz] [^112xnBjM] [^117HeMaZ] [^115DYuSv].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the answer clearly: no, you do not have to cardiovert atrial fibrillation just because the ventricular rate is "normal"; cardioversion is indicated when symptoms persist despite rate control, when early rhythm control is pursued in recent AF, in specific high-risk contexts like pre-excitation or pregnancy with instability, or when patient preference and comorbidities favor rhythm restoration after discussing risks, benefits, and anticoagulation requirements [^116XDtfT] [^114yg1fo] [^112w9rgz] [^116AHvM2].

---

No, you do not need to cardiovert atrial fibrillation (AF) just because the heart rate is normal. Cardioversion is **only indicated** for symptomatic AF or when there is hemodynamic instability, heart failure, or other clinical reasons to restore sinus rhythm [^111iJvyR] [^115TCGPH]. If the patient is asymptomatic or has minimal symptoms and the heart rate is controlled, **rate control with anticoagulation is appropriate** and preferred for most patients [^116XDtfT] [^115TCGPH]. Cardioversion does not improve survival or reduce stroke risk compared with rate control, and it carries procedural risks and recurrence risk, so it should be individualized based on symptoms, AF duration, and patient preference [^115izmTN] [^112EyzHx].

---

## Indications for cardioversion in atrial fibrillation

Cardioversion is **not routinely indicated** solely based on a normal heart rate. The decision to cardiovert should be guided by clinical symptoms, hemodynamic stability, and patient-specific factors. The following are the primary indications for cardioversion in AF:

- **Symptomatic AF**: Patients experiencing significant symptoms such as palpitations, dyspnea, fatigue, chest discomfort, or dizziness despite adequate rate control [^111iJvyR] [^114yg1fo].

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Patients with hypotension, acute coronary syndrome, or acute heart failure exacerbation require immediate cardioversion [^116Kz6Bc] [^114XsYAu].

- **Persistent AF with structural heart disease**: Patients with persistent AF and structural heart disease may benefit from rhythm control strategies, including cardioversion, to prevent progression of atrial remodeling and heart failure [^116anPPa] [^111CcUbX].

- **Patient preference**: Some patients may prefer rhythm control over rate control due to quality-of-life considerations, occupational factors, or personal preferences [^114aKSkj] [^116XDtfT].

---

## Rate control versus rhythm control strategies

Rate control aims to control the ventricular rate, allowing AF to continue, whereas rhythm control seeks to restore and maintain sinus rhythm. Large randomized controlled trials, including AFFIRM and RACE, have demonstrated that **rate control is not inferior to rhythm control** in terms of mortality, stroke risk, and quality of life in most patients with AF [^115izmTN] [^112EyzHx]. Rate control is generally preferred for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients, older adults, and those with comorbidities such as heart failure or coronary artery disease [^114aKSkj] [^1163rcjr]. Rhythm control, including cardioversion, is reserved for symptomatic patients, younger individuals, or those with specific clinical indications as outlined above [^111iJvyR] [^114aKSkj].

---

## Risks and benefits of cardioversion

Cardioversion, whether electrical or pharmacological, carries certain risks and benefits that must be weighed carefully:

| **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|
| Restoration of sinus rhythm | Thromboembolic complications (stroke, systemic embolism) [^116AHvM2] |
| Improvement in symptoms and quality of life | Procedural complications (arrhythmias, sedation-related risks) [^11181GGm] |
| Potential reduction in atrial remodeling | Recurrence of AF [^116jQ8Hb] |
| Improved hemodynamics in selected patients | Requirement for anticoagulation and monitoring [^116wUj3z] |

---

## Anticoagulation considerations

Anticoagulation is **critical** around cardioversion to prevent thromboembolic complications. Current guidelines recommend therapeutic anticoagulation for at least three weeks before and four weeks after cardioversion if AF duration is longer than 48 hours or unknown [^116AHvM2]. Alternatively, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can be performed to exclude intracardiac thrombus before cardioversion, allowing immediate cardioversion if no thrombus is detected [^116AHvM2]. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for thromboembolic risk reduction in eligible patients undergoing cardioversion [^116wUj3z].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing decision-making

Several patient-specific factors influence the decision to cardiovert AF with a normal heart rate:

- **Age**: Younger patients may benefit more from rhythm control strategies, while older patients may prefer rate control due to lower procedural risks and fewer hospitalizations [^114aKSkj] [^1163rcjr].

- **Comorbidities**: Patients with heart failure, coronary artery disease, or other structural heart diseases may have different risk-benefit profiles for cardioversion [^116anPPa] [^1163rcjr].

- **AF duration**: Longer AF duration increases the risk of recurrence after cardioversion and may influence the decision to pursue rhythm control [^111hWPBd] [^116jQ8Hb].

- **Patient preference**: Shared decision-making is essential, incorporating patient values, lifestyle, and preferences regarding rhythm control versus rate control strategies [^1129PNwd] [^115TCGPH].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current clinical guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) provide clear recommendations on the management of AF with a normal heart rate:

- **Rate control**: Recommended as the initial strategy for most patients with AF, particularly those who are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic [^116chuoS] [^114aKSkj].

- **Rhythm control**: Reserved for symptomatic patients, those with hemodynamic instability, or specific clinical indications as outlined above [^111iJvyR] [^116AHvM2].

- **Anticoagulation**: Essential for stroke prevention in patients with AF, regardless of rhythm control strategy [^116kckTa] [^113XJbmX].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

In summary, **cardioversion is not indicated solely based on a normal heart rate** in patients with atrial fibrillation. The decision to cardiovert should be individualized, considering patient symptoms, hemodynamic stability, AF duration, comorbidities, and patient preferences. Rate control with appropriate anticoagulation remains the preferred strategy for most patients, with rhythm control reserved for specific clinical indications.

### Predictors of long-term maintenance of normal sinus rhythm after successful electrical cardioversion [^113thPfs]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Electrical cardioversion (EC) for atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common procedure performed in an attempt to restore normal sinus rhythm (NSR). Many factors predict long-term maintenance of NSR and the risk of AF recurrence. The duration of AF, cardiac size and function, rheumatic heart disease, significant mitral valve disease, left atrial enlargement, and older age are among the most common recognized factors. A number of interventions can potentially decrease the AF recurrence rate. Identifying and treating reversible causes and the use of antiarrhythmic medications in certain situations can help decrease the risk of AF recurrence. The role of the newer anticoagulants is expanding, and wider application is expected in the near future. We hope that this summary will serve as a guide to physicians and healthcare providers to address the question of who should undergo cardioversion, as there are patients who are most likely to benefit from this procedure and others that will revert back into AF within a short period. To identify who would benefit most from EC and have a reasonable chance of long-term maintenance of NSR, a thorough evaluation of each individual patient should be performed to tailor the best therapy to each individual.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation: part I. rate and rhythm control [^117BqSuj]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the arrhythmia most commonly encountered in family practice. Serious complications can include congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and thromboembolism. Initial treatment is directed at controlling the ventricular rate, most often with a calcium channel blocker, a beta blocker, or digoxin. Medical or electrical cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm is the next step in patients who remain in atrial fibrillation. Heparin should be administered to hospitalized patients undergoing medical or electrical cardioversion. Anticoagulation with warfarin should be used for three weeks before elective cardioversion and continued for four weeks after cardioversion. The recommendations provided in this two-part article are consistent with guidelines published by the American Heart Association and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

### Atrial fibrillation: common questions and answers about diagnosis and treatment [^115TCGPH]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia that increases the risk of stroke and all-cause mortality. It is the most common cardiac dysrhythmia in adults in the primary care setting, and its prevalence increases with age. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening asymptomatic adults older than 50 years for atrial fibrillation. Many patients with atrial fibrillation are asymptomatic, but symptoms can include palpitations, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination findings and should be confirmed with 12-lead electrocardiography or other recording device. The initial evaluation should include transthoracic echocardiography; serum electrolyte levels; complete blood count; and thyroid, kidney, and liver function tests. Stroke risk should be assessed in patients with atrial fibrillation using the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke by preventing atrial thrombus formation and subsequent cerebral or systemic emboli. Hemodynamically unstable patients, including those with decompensated heart failure, should be evaluated and treated emergently. Most hemodynamically stable patients should be treated initially with rate control and anticoagulation. Rhythm control, using medications or procedures, should be considered in patients with hemodynamic instability or in some patients based on risk factors and shared decision-making. Electrical cardioversion may be appropriate as first-line rhythm control. Conversion to sinus rhythm with catheter ablation may be considered in patients who are unable or unwilling to take rate or rhythm control medications long-term or if medications have been ineffective.

### Management of newly detected atrial fibrillation: a clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians [^116XDtfT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation and developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. The recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care. The recommendations are as follows: RECOMMENDATION 1: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 2: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, alcoholism). Grade: 1A. RECOMMENDATION 3: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended for their demonstrated efficacy in rate control during exercise and while at rest: atenolol, metoprolol, diltiazem, and verapamil (drugs listed alphabetically by class). Digoxin is only effective for rate control at rest and therefore should only be used as a second-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Grade: 1B. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients who elect to undergo acute cardioversion to achieve sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation, both direct-current cardioversion (Grade: 1C+) and pharmacological conversion (Grade: 2A) are appropriate options. RECOMMENDATION 5: Both transesophageal echocardiography with short-term prior anticoagulation followed by early acute cardioversion (in the absence of intracardiac thrombus) with postcardioversion anticoagulation versus delayed cardioversion with pre- and postanticoagulation are appropriate management strategies for those patients who elect to undergo cardioversion. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 6: Most patients converted to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation should not be placed on rhythm maintenance therapy since the risks outweigh the benefits. In a selected group of patients whose quality of life is compromised by atrial fibrillation, the recommended pharmacologic agents for rhythm maintenance are amiodarone, disopyramide, propafenone, and sotalol (drugs listed in alphabetical order). The choice of agent predominantly depends on specific risk of side effects based on patient characteristics. Grade: 2A.

### Pharmacological cardioversion for atrial fibrillation and flutter [^112EyzHx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation is the commonest cardiac dysrhythmia. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There are two approaches to the management of atrial fibrillation: controlling the ventricular rate or converting to sinus rhythm in the expectation that this would abolish its adverse effects.

Objectives

To assess the effects of pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in adults on the annual risk of stroke, peripheral embolism, and mortality.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (2000 to 2002), EMBASE (1998 to 2002), CINAHL (1982 to 2002), Web of Science (1981 to 2002). We hand searched the following journals: Circulation (1997 to 2002), Heart (1997 to 2002), European Heart Journal (1997–2002), Journal of the American College of Cardiology (1997–2002) and selected abstracts published on the web site of the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (2001, 2002).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials of pharmacological cardioversion versus rate control in adults (> 18 years) with acute, paroxysmal or sustained atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, of any duration and of any aetiology.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer applied the inclusion criteria and extracted the data. Trial quality was assessed and the data were entered into RevMan.

Main Results

We identified two completed studies AFFIRM (n = 4060) and PIAF (n = 252). We found no difference in mortality between rhythm control and rate control relative risk 1.14 (95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.31). Both studies show significantly higher rates of hospitalisation and adverse events in the rhythm control group and no difference in quality of life between the two treatment groups. In AFFIRM there was a similar incidence of ischaemic stroke, bleeding and systemic embolism in the two groups. Certain malignant dysrhythmias were significantly more likely to occur in the rhythm control group. There were similar scores of cognitive assessment. In PIAF, cardioverted patients enjoyed an improved exercise tolerance but there was no overall benefit in terms of symptom control or quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence that pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm is superior to rate control. Rhythm control is associated with more adverse effects and increased hospitalisation. It does not reduce the risk of stroke. The conclusions cannot be generalised to all people with atrial fibrillation. Most of the patients included in these studies were relatively older (> 60 years) with significant cardiovascular risk factors.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC atrial fibrillation — recurrent persistent atrial fibrillation: Patients with minimal or no symptoms who have undergone at least one attempt to restore sinus rhythm may remain in AF after recurrence, with therapy for rate control and prevention of thromboembolism as needed, whereas those with symptoms favoring sinus rhythm should be treated with an antiarrhythmic agent in addition to rate control and anticoagulation before cardioversion; selection of the antiarrhythmic drug should be based on the same algorithm used for recurrent paroxysmal AF.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC atrial fibrillation — newly discovered atrial fibrillation: When AF persists, one option is to accept progression to permanent AF with antithrombotic therapy and control of the ventricular rate, and the diagnosis of AF in a patient with risk factors for thromboembolism should prompt long-term anticoagulation. Although it may seem reasonable to make at least one attempt to restore sinus rhythm, the AFFIRM study showed no difference in survival or quality of life with rate-control compared with rhythm-control strategies, so the decision to attempt restoration of sinus rhythm should be based on the severity of arrhythmia-related symptoms and the potential risk of antiarrhythmic drugs, with anticoagulation and rate control important before cardioversion. In patients with AF present for more than 3 mo, early recurrence is common after cardioversion, and antiarrhythmic medication may be initiated before cardioversion (after adequate anticoagulation) to reduce the likelihood of recurrence, with the duration of drug therapy brief (e.g., 1 mo).

### Screening for atrial fibrillation: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116BhRnZ]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation treatment or intervention — care generally has 2 components (managing symptomatic arrhythmia and preventing stroke); symptomatic arrhythmia can be managed by rate control or restoring normal rhythm, with methods including electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion and surgical or catheter ablation; to reduce stroke risk, oral anticoagulants include warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants; guidelines recommend anticoagulant therapy for persons at high risk of stroke; and stroke risk stratification instruments such as CHA2DS2-VASc, which include age ≥ 75 years [doubled] and age 65–74 years among factors, were developed from clinically diagnosed rather than screen-detected AF populations.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rhythm control, general indications, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering a trial of rhythm control (cardioversion or pharmacotherapy) to determine what, if any, symptoms are attributable to AF when symptoms associated with AF are uncertain.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment after cardiac surgery — rate/rhythm control, cardioversion, and anticoagulation: In postoperative cardiac surgery patients, beta blockers are recommended to achieve rate control for AF unless contraindicated or ineffective, in which case a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is recommended; in hemodynamically stable patients with postoperative AF, rate-control (target heart rate, < 100 bpm) and/or rhythm-control medications are recommended as initial therapy based on symptoms and hemodynamic consequences; in poorly tolerated AF after surgery, direct current cardioversion with antiarrhythmic drug therapy is recommended, with imaging to rule out left appendage thrombus when AF has been present ≥ 48 hours without anticoagulation; in postoperative AF, it is reasonable to administer anticoagulation when safe for 60 days after surgery with reassessment for longer-term need, and for those managed with rate control, at 30- to 60-day follow-up it is reasonable to perform rhythm assessment and, if AF does not revert spontaneously, consider cardioversion after an adequate duration of anticoagulation.

Atrial fibrillation — rate versus rhythm control trials: Randomized comparisons show that Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) found no difference in mortality or stroke rate between patients assigned to one strategy or the other, and the Rate Control versus Electrical Cardioversion for persistent atrial fibrillation (RACE) trial found rate control not inferior to rhythm control for prevention of death and morbidity. In Table 7 for AFFIRM, patients in sinus rhythm were 35% vs. 63% (at 5 y), and clinical events were stroke/embolism 88/2027 vs 93/2033 and death 310/2027 vs 356/2033 for rate versus rhythm arms, respectively.

Atrial fibrillation — pharmacological management of recurrent persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation is organized by symptoms and rhythm strategy. Minimal or no symptoms are managed with anticoagulation and rate control as needed, while disabling symptoms in AF proceed from anticoagulation and rate control to electrical cardioversion as needed, followed by continuation of anticoagulation as needed and therapy to maintain sinus rhythm; consider ablation for severely symptomatic recurrent AF after failure of greater than or equal to 1 AAD plus rate control. For permanent AF, anticoagulation and rate control as needed are used. Initiate drug therapy before cardioversion to reduce the likelihood of early recurrence of AF, and AAD indicates antiarrhythmic drug.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common outpatient arrhythmia. The recent ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines outline a variety of approaches to the management of AF, but their implementation into clinical practice requires multi-faceted patient evaluations and assessments for optimizing patient care. Using a case-based approach, issues such as rate versus rhythm control, anticoagulation, cardioversion, pharmacological and catheter ablation for maintenance of sinus rhythm, and the pathophysiology of AF are discussed. These data were originally presented at a satellite symposium titled Case Studies with the Experts: Management Decisions in AF, held on May 10, 2007, during the annual Heart Rhythm Society meeting.

### Electrical energy by electrode placement for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116fmx2q]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in clinical practice, with a lifetime risk of one in three. In contemporary practice, patients with incident AF lose on average 2 years of expected lifetime over 10 years of follow-up. Rhythm control constitutes a central part of symptom management in the Atrial fibrillation Better Care pathway for integrated care. Elective electrical cardioversion is often used for rhythm control of AF and has a high immediate success rate for restoring normal sinus rhythm, but the intermediate-term and long-term recurrence rates are high.

The current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines include no specific guidance on the electrode position. Yet, more systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have recently examined the optimal electrode position for cardioverting AF, but the results are conflicting. Lately, attention has increasingly been focused on the electrical energy delivered and the success rate of electrical cardioversion. Systematic reviews with meta-analysis have sparsely analysed the association between energy dose and effect, and the ESC guidelines for AF do not state any recommendations on the most effective strategy.

In this study, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the dose–response relation between applied energy and cardioversion rates. As patch position may influence the success rate of electrical cardioversion, we included RCTs that examined self-adhesive patches positioned anterior lateral (AL) or anterior–posterior. The review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — antiarrhythmic pretreatment around cardioversion and safety: Antiarrhythmic medications may be initiated out of hospital or in hospital immediately prior to direct-current cardioversion, but risks include paradoxically increasing the defibrillation threshold with flecainide, accelerating the ventricular rate when class IA or IC drugs are given without an atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking agent, and inducing ventricular arrhythmias. Prophylactic drug therapy to prevent early recurrence of AF should be considered individually for each patient; pretreatment with pharmacological agents is most appropriate in patients who fail to respond to direct-current cardioversion and in those who develop immediate or subacute recurrence of AF. In patients with late recurrence and those undergoing initial cardioversion of persistent AF, pretreatment is optional. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy is recommended in conjunction with a second cardioversion attempt, particularly when early relapse has occurred, whereas additional cardioversion, beyond a second attempt, is of limited value and should be reserved for carefully selected patients; infrequently repeated cardioversions may be acceptable in patients who are highly symptomatic upon relapse to AF.

Atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery — supportive text on rate/rhythm control and anticoagulation states that "The use of beta blockers to control heart rate is well documented" and that "Calcium channel blockers are an option for rate control when beta blockers are ineffective". Rate control or rhythm control "are both acceptable options in hemodynamically stable patients" because "neither has a distinct clinical advantage over the other based on a randomized study that included 529 patients", and "patients in the rhythm-control group received amiodarone". "Cardioversion of patients with sustained postoperative AF is regularly performed", "routinely combined with pharmacological therapy, especially amiodarone". A review of "8 observational studies that included 15 335 patients found a protective impact on the mortality rate at 5 years but no differences in thromboembolic events" with anticoagulants. "In general, the duration of anticoagulation is a minimum of 60 days"; in a randomized trial, if AF "remained" or "recurrent" "48 hours after randomization, anticoagulation was recommended to be continued for 60 days, unless complications occurred", and "Patients should be evaluated before discontinuation to determine underlying rhythm". Postdischarge, "The need for a rhythm-control strategy should be evaluated", as patients on rate control "often convert spontaneously after 6 to 8 weeks", with "earlier discharge" for hemodynamically stable patients; those not converting "can be managed accordingly with rhythm-control strategy". For poorly controlled AF, "cardioversion is reasonable", and for those with " > 48 hours" of AF, "imaging of the LA (even if surgically closed) should be considered".

Atrial fibrillation — implications of the rhythm-control versus rate-control trials: Theoretically, rhythm control should have advantages over rate control, yet a trend toward lower mortality was observed in the rate-control arm of the AFFIRM study and did not differ in the other trials from the outcome with the rhythm-control strategy. The RACE and AFFIRM trials did not address AF in younger, symptomatic patients with little underlying heart disease, in whom restoration of sinus rhythm by cardioversion antiarrhythmic drugs or nonpharmacological interventions still must be considered a useful therapeutic approach. One may conclude from these studies that rate control is a reasonable strategy in elderly patients with minimal symptoms related to AF, and an effective method for maintaining sinus rhythm with fewer side effects would address a presently unmet need.

Prevention of thromboembolism during cardioversion in atrial fibrillation — For atrial fibrillation (AF) of 48-h duration or longer or unknown duration, anticoagulation with an international normalized ratio (INR) 2.0 to 3.0 is recommended for at least 3 wk prior to and 4 wk after cardioversion. For AF of more than 48-h duration with hemodynamic instability requiring immediate cardioversion, heparin should be administered concurrently by an initial intravenous bolus followed by a continuous infusion to prolong activated partial thromboplastin time to 1.5 to 2 times the reference control value; thereafter, oral anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0) should be provided for at least 4 wk, and limited data support subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin in this indication. For AF of less than 48-h duration associated with hemodynamic instability, cardioversion should be performed immediately without delay for prior initiation of anticoagulation. During the first 48 h after onset of AF, the need for anticoagulation before and after cardioversion may be based on the patient's risk of thromboembolism. As an alternative to preprocedural anticoagulation, it is reasonable to perform transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to search for thrombus in the left atrium (LA) or left atrial appendage (LAA); if no thrombus is identified, cardioversion is reasonable immediately after unfractionated heparin with activated partial thromboplastin time 1.5 to 2 times the control value until a vitamin K antagonist achieves an INR equal to or greater than 2.0, followed by oral anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0) for at least 4 wk. For patients with thrombus identified by TEE, oral anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0) is reasonable for at least 3 wk prior to and 4 wk after restoration of sinus rhythm.

### Does intensity of rate control influence outcome in persistent atrial fibrillation? Data of the RACE study [^115qTYui]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Large trials have demonstrated that rate control is an acceptable alternative for rhythm control. However, optimal heart rate during atrial fibrillation (AF) remains unknown. Aim of this analysis was to compare outcome between rate control ≥ 80 and < 80 beat/min in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation.

Methods

In the RAte Control versus Electrical cardioversion for persistent atrial fibrillation study, 522 patients were included, and 256 were randomized to rate control. This post hoc analysis included patients randomized to rate control. Patients were divided according to their mean resting heart rate during follow-up, < 80 beat/min (n = 75) or ≥ 80 beat/min (n = 139). The end point, a composite of cardiovascular mortality, heart failure, thromboembolic complications, bleeding, pacemaker implantation, and severe drug side effects, was compared between both groups.

Results

During follow-up (2.3 ± 0.6 years), a significant difference between both groups in heart rate was observed (72 ± 5 vs 90 ± 8 beat/min; P < .001). Rate control drugs were not significantly different between both groups. New York Heart Association class and fractional shortening remained unchanged in both groups. There were 17 (23%) end points in the low heart rate group and 24 (17%) in the higher heart rate group (absolute difference, 5.4 [-7.3 to 8.2]; P = ns). Independent predictors for the primary end point were coronary artery disease, digoxin use, and interrupted anticoagulation, not high heart rate. Quality of life was comparable in both groups during follow-up.

Conclusions

In patients treated with a rate control strategy, no differences were observed in terms of cardiovascular morbidity, mortality, and quality of life between the observed differences in level of rate control throughout follow-up.

### Cardioversion strategy impacts rate control during recurrences in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: a subanalysis of the RACE 7 ACWAS trial [^115NJPz9]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Atrial fibrillation (AF) may present with a variety of symptoms and can severely compromise daily functioning and quality of life, often prompting patients to seek medical care. In the Rate Control versus Electrical Cardioversion Trial 7–Acute Cardioversion versus Wait and See (RACE 7 ACWAS), patients presenting with recent‐onset AF at the emergency department (ED) were randomized to either an early or a delayed cardioversion strategy. Within the delayed cardioversion strategy, more focus was given to initial rate control treatment at the ED. In general, rate control aims to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. Adequate rate control remains advised in all AF patients, complementary to rhythm control strategies such as catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic drugs. Current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of AF advise a lenient rate control strategy as an acceptable initial approach with a target resting heart rate of < 110 beats per minute (bpm) and more strict rate control if complaints persist. Whether a delayed cardioversion strategy also impacts the quality of rate control during recurrences of AF beyond the presenting episode, is currently unknown.

The aim of this prespecified sub‐analysis of the RACE 7 ACWAS trialwas to evaluate heart rate during recurrences after an ED visit for recent‐onset AF using a mobile Health (mHealth) device and to assess factors associated with heart rate during recurrences.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — recurrence and predictors: An AFFIRM substudy found that with AF recurrence, if one is willing to cardiovert and continue or change the antiarrhythmic drug, about 80% of all patients will be in sinus rhythm by the end of 1 y. Most patients with AF, except those with postoperative or self-limited AF secondary to transient or acute illness, eventually experience recurrence, and risk factors for frequent recurrence of paroxysmal AF (more than 1 episode per month) include female gender and underlying heart disease. In one study of patients with persistent AF, the 4-y arrhythmia-free survival rate was less than 10% after single-shock direct-current cardioversion without prophylactic drug therapy, with predictors of recurrences including hypertension, age over 55 y, and AF duration longer than 3 mo. Serial cardioversions and prophylactic drug therapy resulted in freedom from recurrent AF in approximately 30% of patients, and with this approach predictors of recurrence included age over 70 y, AF duration beyond 3 mo, and HF; other risk factors include LA enlargement and rheumatic heart disease.

### Cardioversion strategy impacts rate control during recurrences in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: a subanalysis of the RACE 7 ACWAS trial [^112Ps1Eb]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, in patients with recent‐onset AF presenting at the ED, a delayed cardioversion strategy translated into a more optimal rate control during AF recurrences compared to early cardioversion without significant group‐differences in baseline or adjusted use of rate control medication. With a delayed cardioversion strategy, median heart rate at AF recurrence was lower as were peak heart rates. Apart from the randomized treatment, heart rate at presentation was independently associated with heart rate during AF recurrences.

Aiming for optimal rate control in AF patients to achieve symptom alleviation remains a main pillar of AF treatment strategies. Complementary to rhythm control strategies with catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic drugs, the RACE 7 ACWAS findings support acute management at the ED. Data on spontaneous conversion can help to determine the degree of the underlying AF substrate and may provide interesting information to help decide on the best rhythm control strategy. The data provided in this prespecified sub‐analysis of the RACE 7 ACWAS trial provides information about feasibility and effectivity of rate control within the early and delayed cardioversion strategy.

Integrated AF care aligned with patient needs

Once AF is diagnosed, patients should be offered treatment in five domains:
acute haemodynamic stabilisation in haemodynamically unstable patients (eg, by cardioversion, rate control, circulatory support, etc);
detection and treatment of concomitant cardiovascular conditions;
stroke risk assessment and oral anticoagulation in patients with AF at risk for stroke;
rate control therapy in patients with elevated ventricular rates during AF;
rhythm control therapy in patients who remain symptomatic on rate control therapy.

Optimal management of patients with AF requires input from different medical specialties and professions. Integrated care models should be considered for all patients with AF, supporting shared decision-making and empowering patients to own their care, providing support where needed and giving access to all specialist treatment options when appropriate (figure 1). Such care models will require close cooperation between AF specialists, stroke physicians, AF surgeons, general cardiologists and general practitioners. In addition, continued high-quality care may need further support from allied healthcare professionals, patients, and family members.

Atrial fibrillation — effects on mortality and hospitalization: In the AFFIRM study, a trend toward increased overall mortality was observed in patients treated for rhythm control compared with rate control after an average of 3.5 y (26.7% vs. 25.9%, p = 0.08). The rhythm-control strategy was associated with excess mortality among older patients, those with HF, and those with CAD, and a substudy suggested that deleterious effects of antiarrhythmic drugs (mortality increase of 49%) may have offset the benefits of sinus rhythm (which was associated with a 53% reduction in mortality). Hospitalization was more frequent in the rhythm-control arms in all trials, mainly due to admissions for cardioversion, and a substudy of RACE found no benefit of rhythm control even in a selected subgroup.

### Cardioversion in patients with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation: observational study using prospectively collected registry data [^1139n1hJ]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this study of a large sample of patients with recent onset atrial fibrillation who were followed up for two years, a small number received cardioversion at baseline. Importantly, we found that patients treated with baseline cardioversion appeared to have a significantly lower mortality risk during follow-up after adjustment for known confounders (event rates per 100 patient years 2.52 v 3.87, weighted hazard ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.85, P < 0.001). Our analyses show that most patients treated with cardioversion receive a direct current approach. Event rates for all cause mortality in these patients, given differences in baseline risk, appear similar to those for patients who received pharmacological cardioversion.

Of the 44 201 patients included in the analysis of cardioversion versus no cardioversion at baseline, an attempt was made to restore sinus rhythm in only 14.9%. Given that the study population consisted of patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation, this number seems low. Studies suggest that recent onset atrial fibrillation responds favourably to rhythm controlbecause a long duration of atrial fibrillation could make cardioversion less likely to succeed. Additionally, patients may experience symptom relief after rhythm control even when not obviously symptomatic before cardioversion. Therefore, international guidelines suggest a rhythm control strategy should be considered with the aim of reducing atrial fibrillation related symptoms and improving quality of life. However, several randomised controlled trials comparing rate control and rhythm control strategies have not found significant differences in mortality rates or other adverse outcomes, but a higher hospital rate has been reported for rhythm control. In the recently published EAST-AFNET 4that included patients diagnosed one year or less before enrolment, a rhythm control strategy was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes and a similar hospital admission rate compared with usual care among patients with early atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular conditions. Our observations support a rhythm control strategy being beneficial for patients with recent onset non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

A simplified approach to rhythm control therapy in patients with symptomatic AF

There are no major changes to the recommendations for rate control therapy. Rhythm control therapy continues to be indicated to improve AF-related symptoms, usually on top of management of concomitant conditions, stroke prevention therapy and rate control therapy. The indications for antiarrhythmic drug therapy have not changed. The new guidelines provide more detailed information about the ECG changes that are warning signs for proarrhythmia. Catheter ablation targeting isolation of the pulmonary veinsis a valid rhythm control therapy option and should be discussed with patients in need for rhythm control therapy. When AF recurs and further rhythm control therapy is warranted, 'hybrid therapy' (eg, combining antiarrhythmic drugs with catheter ablation) will often help: in patients who need further rhythm control therapy despite antiarrhythmic drug therapy, catheter ablation is often effective. Patients who need a third attempt to rhythm control therapy should be discussed with an AF Heart Team including consideration of AF surgery.

The new guidelines suggest a very similar approach to rhythm control in patients with paroxysmal (self-terminating) and persistent AF: the flow charts are not different by AF pattern. This simplification is supported by two observations: the time in sinus rhythm as assessed by an implanted device is not that different between patients who are clinically classified as 'paroxysmal' or 'persistent' AF. Furthermore, the available controlled trials suggest that catheter ablation is more effective than antiarrhythmic drugs and cardioversion in patients with persistent AF, similar to paroxysmal AF.

### Emergency medicine updates: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response [^114XsYAu]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) may lead to stroke, heart failure, and death. When AF occurs in the context of a rapid ventricular rate/response (RVR), this can lead to complications, including hypoperfusion and cardiac ischemia. Emergency physicians play a key role in the diagnosis and management of this dysrhythmia.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning AF with RVR for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Differentiating primary and secondary AF with RVR and evaluating hemodynamic stability are vital components of ED assessment and management. Troponin can assist in determining the risk of adverse outcomes, but universal troponin testing is not required in patients at low risk of acute coronary syndrome or coronary artery disease - especially patients with recurrent episodes of paroxysmal AF that are similar to their prior events. Emergent cardioversion is indicated in hemodynamically unstable patients. Rate or rhythm control should be pursued in hemodynamically stable patients. Elective cardioversion is a safe option for select patients and may reduce AF symptoms and risk of AF recurrence. Rate control using beta blockers or calcium channel blockers should be pursued in those with AF with RVR who do not undergo cardioversion. Anticoagulation is an important component of management, and several tools (e.g. CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc) are available to assist with this decision. Direct oral anticoagulants are the first-line medication class for anticoagulation. Disposition can be challenging, and several risk assessment tools (e.g. RED-AF, AFFORD, and the AFTER (complex, modified, and pragmatic) scores) are available to assist with disposition decisions.

Conclusion

An understanding of the recent updates in the literature concerning AF with RVR can assist emergency clinicians in the care of these patients.

### A comparison of rate control and rhythm control in patients with recurrent persistent atrial fibrillation [^115izmTN]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

Maintenance of sinus rhythm is the main therapeutic goal in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, recurrences of atrial fibrillation and side effects of antiarrhythmic drugs offset the benefits of sinus rhythm. We hypothesized that ventricular rate control is not inferior to the maintenance of sinus rhythm for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.

Methods

We randomly assigned 522 patients who had persistent atrial fibrillation after a previous electrical cardioversion to receive treatment aimed at rate control or rhythm control. Patients in the rate-control group received oral anticoagulant drugs and rate-slowing medication. Patients in the rhythm-control group underwent serial cardioversions and received antiarrhythmic drugs and oral anticoagulant drugs. The end point was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, heart failure, thromboembolic complications, bleeding, implantation of a pacemaker, and severe adverse effects of drugs.

Results

After a mean (± SD) of 2.3 ± 0.6 years, 39 percent of the 266 patients in the rhythm-control group had sinus rhythm, as compared with 10 percent of the 256 patients in the rate-control group. The primary end point occurred in 44 patients (17.2 percent) in the rate-control group and in 60 (22.6 percent) in the rhythm-control group. The 90 percent (two-sided) upper boundary of the absolute difference in the primary end point was 0.4 percent (the prespecified criterion for noninferiority was 10 percent or less). The distribution of the various components of the primary end point was similar in the rate-control and rhythm-control groups.

Conclusions

Rate control is not inferior to rhythm control for the prevention of death and morbidity from cardiovascular causes and may be appropriate therapy in patients with a recurrence of persistent atrial fibrillation after electrical cardioversion.

Calcium channel blockers

Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil or diltiazem) are not recommended in patients with significantly impaired left ventricular function due to their negative inotropic effects, although specific data are limited. In the Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial, patients were randomized to diltiazem or placebo 3–15 days after the onset of myocardial infarction.HF patients, including 490 with evidence of pulmonary congestion, had an increase in the composite of cardiac death or non-fatal re-infarction (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01–1.96). In subsequent analysis, diltiazem was found to increase late-onset HF in those with LVEF < 40%. Verapamil did not improve outcomes after myocardial infarction in patients who developed HF in the Danish Verapamil Infarction Trials.

Heart rate targets for atrial fibrillation in the context of heart failure and reduced ejection fraction

Following the publication of the Rate Control Efficacy in Permanent Atrial Fibrillation (RACE II) trial, patients with AF can initially be treated to a more lenient heart rate regime (< 110 beats/min resting heart rate). To summarize, 614 patients with permanent AF were randomized to a heart rate < 80 b.p.m. at rest and < 110 b.p.m. during moderate exercise or lenient control, with results showing a similar rate of composite clinical events in each arm. There were also no differences in functional outcomes, hospital admissions, or symptoms. Fifteen percent of the population had LVEF < 40% but it remains unclear if these targets apply to AF patients with HFrEF. However, these findings are consistent with other results, and would suggest that heart rate in AF is more a marker of disease than a therapeutic target and that a lenient heart rate may be acceptable if symptoms are controlled and tachycardia is avoided. It is worth noting that other guideline recommendations continue to advocate a resting heart rate < 80 b.p.m. in patients with symptomatic AF and left ventricular dysfunction.

Specific rhythm-control strategies

Cardioversion

The first step in rhythm control is the restoration of sinus rhythm, which often requires cardioversion. Urgent cardioversion is recommended in any patient with significant haemodynamic impairment secondary to AF. Elective cardioversion is indicated in individuals with symptomatic persistent AF. Unfortunately, recurrence of AF after successful cardioversion is a frequent problem (∼50% at 6 months), particularly in patients with HF. Over half of inpatients undergoing cardioversion for atrial arrhythmias have HF.

### Cardioversion in patients with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation: observational study using prospectively collected registry data [^116DFXb1]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

After anticoagulation treatment for stroke prevention has been prescribed to appropriate patients (those with increased risk of stroke), there are two main treatment approaches for atrial fibrillation. One approach is to try and restore sinus rhythm, which can be achieved by direct current or pharmacological cardioversion. Rhythm control can potentially relieve symptoms and prevent progression of atrial fibrillationand left atrial remodelling. The other treatment option is to allow atrial fibrillation to continue but to control the ventricular rate (rate control). Several randomised controlled trials have shown that this treatment strategy is non-inferior to rhythm control when considering endpoints such as stroke rates and mortality. Previous studies also indicate that rates of hospital admission for rate control are lower than those for rhythm control. Guidelines in Europe and America support both strategies but stress the need for better knowledge about their efficacy and safety. However, the recently reported Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention Trial (EAST-AFNET 4)showed that early rhythm control was superior to guideline mandated management, which consisted largely of rate control until or unless symptoms became refractory.

The Global Anticoagulant Registry in the FIELD-AF (GARFIELD-AF) is a worldwide prospective study of adult patients with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The registry includes information on baseline patient characteristics, rate of interventions such as cardioversions, and clinical outcomes. Only patients with first time onset of atrial fibrillation within six weeks were included, and so a high proportion might be eligible for an early rhythm control strategy. These data assess the use of cardioversion in daily clinical practice and might provide important information for clinicians treating patients with recent onset non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

In the current study, we aimed to investigate the characteristics of patients who received cardioversion treatment at baseline versus those who did not, and to assess types of cardioversion performed. We also describe the associations between cardioversion and clinical outcomes in a large dataset of patients presenting with recent onset non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation: part II. prevention of thromboembolic complications [^112tKRoA]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Family physicians should be familiar with the acute management of atrial fibrillation and the initiation of chronic therapy for this common arrhythmia. Initial management should include hemodynamic stabilization, rate control, restoration of sinus rhythm, and initiation of antithrombotic therapy. Part II of this two-part article focuses on the prevention of thromboembolic complications using anticoagulation. Heparin is routinely administered before medical or electrical cardioversion. Warfarin is used in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation who are at higher risk for thromboembolic complications because of advanced age, history of coronary artery disease or stroke, or presence of left-sided heart failure. Aspirin is preferred in patients at low risk for thromboembolic complications and patients with a high risk for falls, a history of noncompliance, active bleeding, or poorly controlled hypertension. The recommendations provided in this article are consistent with guidelines published by the American Heart Association and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. It impairs cardiac function and increases the risk of stroke. The incidence of atrial fibrillation increases with age. Key treatment issues include deciding when to restore normal sinus rhythm, when to control rate only, and how to prevent thromboembolism. Rate control is the preferred management option in most patients. Rhythm control is an option for patients in whom rate control cannot be achieved or who have persistent symptoms despite rate control. The current recommendation for strict rate control is a resting heart rate of less than 80 beats per minute. However, one study has shown that more lenient rate control of less than 110 beats per minute while at rest was not inferior to strict rate control in preventing cardiac death, heart failure, stroke, and life-threatening arrhythmias. Anticoagulation therapy is needed with rate control and rhythm control to prevent stroke. Warfarin is superior to aspirin and clopidogrel in preventing stroke despite its narrow therapeutic range and increased risk of bleeding. Tools that predict the risk of stroke (e.g. CHADS2) and the risk of bleeding (e.g. Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index) are helpful in making decisions about anticoagulation therapy. Surgical options for atrial fibrillation include disruption of abnormal conduction pathways in the atria, and obliteration of the left atrial appendage. Catheter ablation is an option for restoring normal sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and normal left atrial size. Referral to a cardiologist is warranted in patients who have complex cardiac disease; who are symptomatic on or unable to tolerate pharmacologic rate control; or who may be candidates for ablation or surgical interventions.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation — rate control (Class IIa): A combination of digoxin and either a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist is reasonable to control heart rate at rest and during exercise in AF, with individualized choice and dose modulation to avoid bradycardia (Level of Evidence: B). It is reasonable to use ablation of the atrioventricular (AV) node or accessory pathway to control heart rate when pharmacological therapy is insufficient or causes side effects (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous amiodarone can be useful to control heart rate when other measures are unsuccessful or contraindicated (Level of Evidence: C). When electrical cardioversion is not necessary in AF with an accessory pathway, intravenous procainamide or ibutilide is a reasonable alternative (Level of Evidence: C).

### Rate or rhythm control for atrial fibrillation: update and controversies [^112cXLrx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is associated with increased mortality and considerable morbidity, including stroke, heart failure, and diminished quality of life. Despite these adverse outcomes, rhythm control has not demonstrated benefit in clinical trials. Antiarrhythmic medications, including recently developed agents, have limited efficacy in achieving durable sinus rhythm and substantial toxicity. A rate-control strategy is therefore more attractive for minimally symptomatic patients, but younger and more symptomatic patients may benefit from restoration of sinus rhythm. Catheter ablation is more effective than medications in preventing arrhythmia recurrence, avoids adverse effects associated with antiarrhythmic drugs, and should be considered early in symptomatic patients when success is likely. However, more definitive data are needed from randomized trials assessing long-term outcomes after ablation, including stroke risk and mortality. Clinical decision tools help select the appropriate management for individual patients. Lenient rate management is easy to achieve and seems reasonably safe for certain patients, although the optimum rate varies with individual comorbidities. Because safer and more effective pharmacologic and interventional therapies are now available, an individualized approach to atrial fibrillation management is essential.

Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased risk of heart failure (HF), thromboembolic events, and cardiovascular death. Rhythm control (including catheter ablation) for AF is associated with lower rates of both death and HF exacerbation. In addition, rhythm control results in improvements in quality of life (QoL), especially via catheter ablation or electrical cardioversion. Therefore, current guidelines recommend that AF‐related symptoms be quantified to aid in rhythm control treatment decisions. The primary indication for rhythm control is need for reduced AF‐related symptoms in symptomatic patients with AF. However, no trials to date have evaluated whether asymptomatic patients have better outcomes with rhythm control of AF. Previous studies have reported that ≈10% of ischemic strokes are related to unrecognized asymptomatic AF. In addition, progression of asymptomatic subclinical AF has been associated with HF hospitalization.

The Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality‐of‐Life (AFEQT) survey has been validated to assess the impact of AF on QoL. The objective of this study was to compare AF‐related outcomes according to the baseline symptom scale using AFEQT scores and to determine the best treatment strategy for asymptomatic patients.

### Risks and benefits of rate control versus maintenance of sinus rhythm [^115rkqJn]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

There are 2 fundamental approaches to managing patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF): to restore and maintain sinus rhythm with cardioversion and/or antiarrhythmic drugs, or to control the ventricular rate only. Over the past few years, there have been several important prospective clinical trials comparing rate control with rhythm control in patients with recurrent AF. The Pharmacological Intervention in Atrial Fibrillation (PIAF) trial was the first prospective randomized study to test the hypothesis of equivalency between the 2 management strategies for AF. The trial demonstrated that rate control was not inferior to rhythm control with respect to symptoms, quality of life, or number of hospitalizations in patients with persistent AF. The Strategies of Treatment in Atrial Fibrillation (STAF) trial was a pilot study that enrolled approximately 200 patients with AF who were randomized to either ventricular rate control or cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm. The results showed that over a 1-year period there was little difference in outcome in terms of morbidity or symptoms. In the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial, patients with AF and risk factors for stroke were randomized to either rhythm control or rate control, with both groups receiving anticoagulation with warfarin. There was no difference in the composite end point of death, disabling stroke or anoxic encephalopathy, major bleeding, or cardiac arrest between the 2 arms. In addition, no major differences were noted in functional status or quality of life. The Rate Control Versus Electrical Cardioversion (RACE) trial also reached a similar conclusion. Thus, rate control is an acceptable primary strategy for management of patients with recurrent AF.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^111vvtzm]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation baseline stroke risk — patterns and independent risk factors — is described by defining paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), and permanent AF as follows: PAF episodes terminate spontaneously "within 7 days and usually in < 48 h", persistent AF "does not self-terminate within 7 days or is terminated by cardioversion", and permanent AF is present when cardioversion "either has failed or has not been attempted". Risk-based treatment recommendations apply to PAF as well as persistent and permanent AF. Independent factors associated with increased stroke risk in AF include a prior ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, older age, hypertension, and diabetes; impaired left ventricular systolic function is a risk factor, but whether congestive heart failure per se increases ischemic stroke risk is conflicting, and low-quality evidence suggests atherosclerotic vascular disease (such as complex aortic plaque on transesophageal echocardiography or peripheral arterial disease) may independently predict stroke risk.

3.2 Assessment of optimal rate control

Figure 2 shows heart rate profiles during AF recurrences for all individual 99 patients. Overall, patients had optimal rate control (rate < 110 bpm) in a median of 52.1 [7.5–100]% of recordings (per patient, median number of recordings: 6 [3–12]). With a median number of 5 [2–16] recordings in the delayed cardioversion group and 6 [3–11] in the early cardioversion group, optimal rate control was present in a median of 68.4 [21.3–100]% and 33.3 [0–77.5]% of recordings, respectively (p = .01). Rate control was optimal in 100% of the recordings in 26 patients (26.5%), of whom 18 were in the delayed and 8 in the early cardioversion group. Rate control was never optimal in 20 patients (20.4%), of whom 7 were in the delayed and 13 were in the early cardioversion group (p = .021).

### Anteriolateral versus anterior-posterior electrodes in external cardioversion of atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [^1176gHWX]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia worldwide. The global burden of AF has increased significantly due to the aging population. By 2030, the United States may have over 12 million people with AF. AF has significant morbidity, linked to a threefold increased risk of heart fail­ure, a fivefold increased risk of stroke, and a 1.5–1.9‐fold increased chance of death. Rate or rhythm control, as well as anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic complications, are the two basic techniques of controlling AF. The rate control strategy utilizes atrioventricular nodal blocking agents and long‐term anticoagulation. In the rhythm control strategy, sinus rhythm is restored through either pharmacological, electrical, or catheter ablation. Rate control was the primary strategy over the last decade based on the data from the AFFIRM trial that showed no survival benefit from the rhythm control over the rate control. However, recent data suggest that rhythm control, especially early in the disease, has fewer adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Electrical cardioversion is the most popular method of rhythm control in cardiology practice. It effectively terminates the AF in more than 90% of the cases. Electrical cardioversion can be safely done during the first 48 hours where the risk of clot formation is low. If the duration is more than 48 hours or unknown, a transthoracic echocardiogram is warranted to exclude atrial thrombus or systemic anticoagulation for 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after the cardioversion. Successful electrical cardioversion depends on proper patient selection, amount of electrical current delivery, number of shocks delivered, electrode size, and electrodeposition. The most common positions in practice are anterior–posterior and anterior–lateral. The evidence comparing their efficacy is uncertain. Some evidence suggests that the anterior–posterior posture is optimal for the external cardioversion of AF. On the other hand, others have shown no difference in cardioversion success between the two positions. As a result, we conducted a meta‐analysis of trials to see how the electrodeposition affects cardioversion success.

### Treatment timing and the effects of rhythm control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation: nationwide cohort study [^112w9rgz]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of mortality and morbidity from stroke and congestive heart failure, and impaired quality of life, even for patients with optimal anticoagulation and rate control treatment. Rate control is integral to the management of atrial fibrillation, and is often sufficient to improve related symptoms. Rhythm control refers to attempts to restore and maintain sinus rhythm using antiarrhythmic drug treatment, cardioversion, and atrial fibrillation ablation together with adequate rate control. Such treatment improves symptoms and the quality of life of patients. Several randomised trials have compared rhythm control with rate control, including the landmark Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Sinus Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial, and shown no significant differences between these treatment strategies in their effect on mortality and stroke. It has been suggested that ablation improves outcomes in selected patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure, in comparison with antiarrhythmic drug treatment combined with rate control. One trial showed, that in comparison with a placebo, the antiarrhythmic drug dronedarone reduced the composite outcome of death from any causes or the first admission to hospital for cardiovascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation. Data on the prognostic effect of rhythm control treatment are inconclusive, with no clear indication of benefit or harm.

Recently, the Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention Trial (EAST-AFNET 4) showed that rhythm control treatment was associated with a lower risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes than usual care among patients who had recently (within one year) been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. It is unclear whether the results can be generalised to patients in whom rhythm control is initiated later, or to the non-trial clinical setting without the structured protocol based follow-up of randomised trials.

To investigate whether the results of a rhythm control strategy are related to the duration between atrial fibrillation diagnosis and treatment initiation, we examined the association between rhythm control and clinical outcomes in comparison with rate control, stratified by timing of treatment initiation.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Atrial septal defect (ASD) — medical therapy and follow‑up guidance states that cardioversion after appropriate anticoagulation is recommended to attempt restoration of the sinus rhythm if atrial fibrillation occurs, and rate control and anticoagulation are recommended if sinus rhythm cannot be maintained by medical or interventional means (both Level of Evidence: A). Patients with small shunts and normal right ventricular (RV) size are generally asymptomatic and require no medical therapy; routine follow‑up without RV enlargement or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) should include assessment of symptoms and a repeat echocardiogram every 2 to 3 years to assess RV size and function and pulmonary pressure. Atrial arrhythmias should be treated to restore and maintain sinus rhythm if possible, and if atrial fibrillation occurs, both antiarrhythmic therapy and anticoagulation should be recommended. ASDs large enough to cause PAH should be closed provided there is evidence of pulmonary vascular reactivity and a net left‑to‑right shunt, whereas medical therapy for PAH is indicated only for those considered to have irreversible PAH and therefore are not eligible for ASD closure.

### Eligibility for early rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation in the UK biobank [^117QrDpm]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

This analysis of a population-based cohort yielded important findings (figure 4):

The majority of participants with newly diagnosed AF (approximately 80% in the UKB population) are eligible for early rhythm control therapy.
Early rhythm control appeared safe in this population-based sample receiving routine care.

Following the AFFIRM (Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management) and RACE (Rate Control versus Electrical Cardioversion for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation) trials, utilisation of rhythm control in AF therapy (electrical cardioversions and AAD) declined in the United States. Similar observations are made in Europe where 75%–90% of participants with AF are managed without rhythm control therapy. Recently, several relatively small, randomised trials identified a positive effect of rhythm control therapy using AF ablation in participants with AF and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The EAST-AFNET4 trial reported a 21% reduction in a composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke or hospitalisation with worsening of heart failure or acute coronary syndrome in participants receiving rhythm control within 1 year of diagnosis compared with those who received usual care (HR 0.79; 96% CI 0.66 to 0.94; p = 0.005). The clinical effectiveness of early rhythm control therapy was consistent in asymptomatic and symptomatic participants. These findings support a paradigm shift towards offering rhythm control therapy to all participants with recently diagnosed AF.

### Should we perform catheter ablation for asymptomatic atrial fibrillation? [^1117DdwZ]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Since the original description of atrial fibrillation ablation, numerous studies have demonstrated the superiority of catheter ablation over pharmacological therapy for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with both paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation. However, to date, no randomized studies have been powered to demonstrate a mortality or stroke reduction benefit of rhythm control with catheter ablation over a rate control strategy. The results of such ongoing studies are not expected until 2018 or 2019. Thus, the only indication for atrial fibrillation ablation in recent guidelines has been the presence of symptoms. However, up to 40% of an atrial fibrillation population may be asymptomatic. In 2017, in the absence of randomized studies, are there nevertheless data that support atrial fibrillation ablation in asymptomatic patients?

### Comparing the guidelines: anticoagulation therapy to optimize stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation [^117Awxd8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an important risk factor for stroke. According to a pooled analysis of controlled clinical trials with warfarin, anticoagulation therapy reduces stroke risk by 62%. However, clinicians must decide whether the benefit of long-term anticoagulation therapy with available agents outweighs the risk of bleeding for individual patients. Guidelines issued by the American College of Chest Physicians and by the joint American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and the European Society of Cardiology task force recommend antithrombotic therapy to protect AF patients from stroke based on risk-stratification algorithms. Risk factors for stroke AF patients include age ≥ 75 years; hypertension; thyrotoxicosis; diabetes; cardiovascular disease; congestive heart failure; and history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or thromboembolism. Patients at high risk for stroke experience greater absolute benefit from anticoagulation therapy than patients at low risk. The guidelines are consistent in recommendations for high-risk patients (warfarin therapy, international normalized ratio 2.0 to 3.0) and low-risk patients (aspirin 325 mg), but differ for intermediate-risk patients with diabetes or heart disease. The guidelines continue to evolve, and future guidelines are likely to incorporate new clinical data, including the CHADS(2) algorithm for determining risk and the results of the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management trial, the Rate Control versus Electrical Cardioversion for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation study, and the Stroke Prevention Using an Oral Thrombin Inhibitor in Atrial Fibrillation II to V trials.

Atrial fibrillation — physical examination/anatomy considerations for choosing between rate control and rhythm control are juxtaposed.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) progression — strategy comparisons — indicates that AF commonly, but not always, progresses over time, with large registries showing more progression on a rate-control strategy than a rhythm-control strategy over a 1- to 2-year period. Across two registry studies, progression to a more sustained AF burden occurred in 26% to 28% with rate control versus 6% to 11% with rhythm control, whereas in ORBIT AF progression was common regardless of strategy (66% for rate control and 56% for rhythm control). Additional factors important to AF progression include age, presence or absence of heart failure (HF) or other comorbidities, left atrial (LA) size, heart rate, and modifiable risk factors.

### Rate control vs rhythm control strategies in atrial fibrillation [^113F62Lu]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Rhythm management for atrial fibrillation is a subject of intense interest. In this review, the two main strategies for rhythm management in atrial fibrillation, the "heart rate control" strategy and the "heart rhythm control" strategy, are discussed under several headings. Some of the basic issues surrounding heart rate control and heart rhythm control and their study in clinical trials are reviewed. Seven published trials that deal with a comparison of these two strategies are reviewed in some detail. In summary, no distinct advantage of the rhythm control strategy has been identified so far. With respect to pharmacologic therapies and the type of patient studied in most of these trials, advantages seem to accrue to the rate control strategy. Those advantages include fewer adverse drug effects, fewer hospitalizations, and lower cost. Two trials studying quite different patients, and in one case quite different drug therapies, are currently in progress, and these two trials are also briefly reviewed. Current guidelines have not taken into account fully the findings of the studies described in this review, and comment is offered on the current guidelines. Finally, some of the possibilities for future research around this question are highlighted.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111KoQ9y]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrioventricular nodal ablation (AVNA) in atrial fibrillation (AF) — recommendations: In patients with AF and a persistently rapid ventricular response who undergo AVNA, initial pacemaker lower rate programming should be 80 to 90 bpm to reduce the risk of sudden death. In patients with AF and uncontrolled rapid ventricular response refractory to rate-control medications (who are not candidates for or in whom rhythm control has been unsuccessful), AVNA can be useful to improve symptoms and quality of life. In patients with AF who are planned to undergo AVNA, implantation of a pacemaker before the ablation (ie, before or same day of ablation) is recommended to ensure adequate back-up pacing leads before performing ablation. In patients with AF with normal ejection fraction undergoing AVNA, conduction system pacing of the His bundle or left bundle area may be reasonable.

### Contemporary management of atrial fibrillation: what can clinical registries tell us about stroke prevention and current therapeutic approaches? [^1149wqUw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Registries may offer insights into the off‐label use of OAC drugs. The safety and efficacy of periprocedural dabigatran in patients undergoing AF ablation was evaluated in a multicenter registry(Table 3), in which dabigatran was associated with a significant increase in the risk of bleeding and thromboembolism compared to uninterrupted warfarin therapy, although different lengths of time on treatment confounds interpretation of these observations. Two other systematic reviews showed no differences in bleeding or thromboembolism with periprocedural dabigatran versus warfarin in patients undergoing ablation. – Given these contradictory results, more data are needed. Whereas registry data can point to potential new approaches to management, investigation in a controlled trial is the preferred way to compare therapeutic strategies and provide robust, reliable evidence with which to inform practice.

Registries on AAD Therapy and Cardioversion

Among the registries listed in Table 2, the RECORD‐AF registry involving 21 countries worldwide provides insight into the use of AADs, factors affecting progression from paroxysmal to persistent or permanent AF, and reveals the extent to which clinical practice follows practice guidelines. –, RECORD‐AF reported an overall success rate of 54% for antiarrhythmic therapy, 60% success for maintenance of sinus rhythm, and 47% for maintaining the heart rate at or below 80 beats per minute at 1 year. Key clinical outcomes reported for rate control and rhythm control strategies at 1 year are shown in Table 6. The data suggest that clinical outcomes of AF are driven by arrhythmia‐related hospitalization, rather than rate or rhythm management strategy, but in patients assigned to rate control, there was relatively rapid progression from paroxysmal to persistent AF. In RECORD‐AF, use of digoxin in patients without HF was uncommon, especially in North America, and amiodarone was used infrequently, except in patients with HF. One‐year findings from the related RECORD‐AF Asia Pacific registry showed that rhythm control strategies were often applied to patients with persistent AF and a history of HF or valvular heart disease (37% of patients), and rate‐control strategies to patients with recently identified, paroxysmal AF (63%). Patients in the rhythm‐control group were prescribed class Ic (39%) or III (49%) AADs, with lower use of β‐blockers in this group in the Asia Pacific registry (35%) compared with the global RECORD‐AF registry (51%).

### Cost-effectiveness of rhythm versus rate control in atrial fibrillation [^113wLzwZ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of sustained cardiac arrhythmia, but recent trials have identified no clear advantage of rhythm control over rate control. Consequently, economic factors often play a role in guiding treatment selection.

Objective

To estimate the cost-effectiveness of rhythm-control versus rate-control strategies for atrial fibrillation in the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM).

Design

Retrospective economic evaluation. Nonparametric bootstrapping was used to estimate the distribution of incremental costs and effects on the cost-effectiveness plane.

Data Sources

Data on survival and use of health care resources were obtained for all 4060 AFFIRM participants. Unit costs were estimated from various U.S. databases.

Target Population

Patients with atrial fibrillation who were 65 years of age or who had other risk factors for stroke or death, similar to those enrolled in AFFIRM.

Time Horizon

Mean follow-up of 3.5 years.

Perspective

Third-party payer.

Interventions

Management of patients with atrial fibrillation with antiarrhythmic drugs (rhythm control) compared with drugs that control heart rate (rate control).

Outcome Measures

Mean survival, resource use, costs, and cost-effectiveness.

Results Of Base-Case Analysis

A mean survival gain of 0.08 year (P = 0.10) was observed for rate control. Patients in the rate-control group used fewer resources (hospital days, pacemaker procedures, cardioversions, and short-stay and emergency department visits). Rate control costs 5077 dollars less per person than rhythm control.

Results Of Sensitivity Analysis

Cost savings ranged from 2189 dollars o 5481 dollars per person. Rhythm control was more costly and less effective than rate control in 95% of the bootstrap replicates over a wide range of cost assumptions.

Limitations

Resource use was limited to key items collected in AFFIRM, and the results are generalizable only to similar patient populations with atrial fibrillation.

Conclusion

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Management overview — Management of patients with AF involves 3 objectives — rate control, prevention of thromboembolism, and correction of the rhythm disturbance, and these are not mutually exclusive. The initial management decision involves primarily a rate-control or rhythm-control strategy; under the rate-control strategy, the ventricular rate is controlled with no commitment to restore or maintain sinus rhythm, while the rhythm-control strategy attempts restoration and/or maintenance of sinus rhythm and also requires attention to rate control. Depending on the patient's course, the strategy initially chosen may prove unsuccessful and the alternate strategy is then adopted.

### The 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association practical guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112FikNY]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The current manuscript is the second update of the original Practical Guide, published in 2013 [Heidbuchel et al. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625–651; Heidbuchel et al. Updated European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2015;17:1467–1507]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations remain. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) set out to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians on the use of the different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows i.e., (1) Eligibility for NOACs; (2) Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (3) Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake; (4) Switching between anticoagulant regimens; (5) Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs; (6) NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced liver disease; (7) How to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (8) NOAC plasma level measurement: rare indications, precautions, and potential pitfalls; (9) How to deal with dosing errors; (10) What to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a potential risk of bleeding; (11) Management of bleeding under NOAC therapy; (12) Patients undergoing a planned invasive procedure, surgery or ablation; (13) Patients requiring an urgent surgical intervention; (14) Patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (15) Avoiding confusion with NOAC dosing across indications; (16) Cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (17) AF patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (18) NOACs in special situations; (19) Anticoagulation in AF patients with a malignancy; and (20) Optimizing dose adjustments of VKA. Additional information and downloads of the text and anticoagulation cards in different languages can be found on an EHRA website (www.NOACforAF.eu).

Atrial fibrillation — age-related considerations and applicability of RACE and AFFIRM data: In a patient with asymptomatic persistent AF, attempts to restore sinus rhythm may not be needed, and prospective studies like RACE and AFFIRM showed that patients who could tolerate rate-controlled AF had outcomes similar to those randomized to rhythm control; however, these studies enrolled predominantly older patients (average 70 y), of whom most had persistent AF and heart disease, and follow-up extended over just a few years, so the trial data do not necessarily apply to younger patients without heart disease or to patients whose dependency upon sinus rhythm is likely to change appreciably over time, and allowing AF to persist for years may make it impossible to restore sinus rhythm for long periods due to electrical and structural remodeling that favor permanent AF.

### Concise review of atrial fibrillation: treatment update considerations in light of AFFIRM and RACE [^115uZQvu]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinically significant arrhythmia seen by clinicians. Prevalence is as high as 9.0% in patients aged ≥ 80 years, and incidence is projected to be more than 5.6 million patients in the U.S. by 2050. Recently, new trials have challenged the traditional belief that rhythm control is inherently superior to rate control in these patients. This article reviews the basic tenets of treatment for AF and discusses how new trial data integrate into these protocols. A concise treatment algorithm is provided and new and upcoming more aggressive interventional treatment options are discussed. This review is designed to help the general practitioner decide how to treat patients in the outpatient setting, evaluate which patients should be hospitalized for management, and which patients should be referred to a cardiologist.

### Rhythm control versus rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: insights from get with the guidelines-heart failure [^116TK1rq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data exist to guide treatment for patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and atrial fibrillation, including the important decision regarding rate versus rhythm control.

Methods and Results

We analyzed the Get With The Guidelines — Heart Failure (GWTG‐HF) registry linked to Medicare claims data from 2008 to 2014 to describe current treatments for rate versus rhythm control and subsequent outcomes in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and atrial fibrillation using inverse probability weighted analysis. Rhythm control was defined as use of an antiarrhythmic medication, cardioversion, orablation or surgery. Rate control was defined as use of any combination of β‐blocker, calcium channel blocker, and digoxin without evidence of rhythm control. Among 15 682 fee‐for‐service Medicare patients, at the time of discharge, 1857 were treated with rhythm control and 13 825 with rate control, with minimal differences in baseline characteristics between groups. There was higher all‐cause death at 1 year in the rate control compared with the rhythm control group (37.5% and 30.8%, respectively, P < 0.01). The lower 1‐year all‐cause death in the rhythm control group remained after risk adjustment (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.86; 95%, 0.75–0.98; P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Rhythm control in patients aged 65 and older with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction andwas associated with a lower risk of 1 year all‐cause mortality. Future prospective randomized studies are needed to explore this potential benefit.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation risk assessment when initiating oral anticoagulation (OAC) — it is important to first assess thromboembolic and bleeding risks. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is the most extensively validated tool to assess stroke or systemic embolism risk; current ACC/AHA/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines recommend that men with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 and women with a score ≥ 3 take an OAC. Patients with lower scores may be considered for OAC based on additional clinical factors and patient preference. Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or rheumatic mitral stenosis are advised to take an OAC regardless of the CHA2DS2-VASc score; similar guidance exists for patients undergoing electrical cardioversion or AF ablation. The type of AF, symptoms, and AF burden do not usually affect OAC decision-making, although OAC for brief, asymptomatic, device-detected AF is uncertain. Several bleeding risk scores (e.g. HAS-BLED, HEMORR2HAGES, ATRIA) and definitions (e.g. ARC-HBR) exist, but none are perfectly discriminant.

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter — Comprehensive knowledge of the epidemiology, anatomy, and multifactorial pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter is essential for clinical cardiac electrophysiology (CCEP) training. Trainees should understand the relationship among sleep apnea, obesity, and AF, and the electrophysiologist must have a clear understanding of the natural history of atrial arrhythmias and potential consequences including stroke, dementia, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, sudden death, and hospitalizations, with familiarity with the evidence base for increased risk of stroke and proven therapeutic strategies that can reduce stroke risk. For oral anticoagulant therapy, understanding the individual patient at risk and the mechanisms and pharmacology of specific agents that can reduce stroke risk is essential, and atrial arrhythmias can be treated with either a rate control or rhythm control strategy. Electrophysiologists must have a comprehensive knowledge of the risks, benefits, and limitations of rate control and rhythm control strategies and be able to explain alternatives to patients and caregivers; initial and serial evaluation of AF will often require diagnostic tests to evaluate arrhythmia burden, adequacy of rate control, and identification of associated cardiac and noncardiac diseases or problems. In deciding on a treatment plan, the electrophysiologist must understand and consider different drug therapies, catheter ablation procedures, and surgical options, and the mechanisms of action, metabolism, risks, and pharmacology of both rate control and rhythm control medications are an important part of EP training. The electrophysiologist must be aware of the risks, benefits, and potential adverse outcomes of catheter ablation, surgical procedures, and device therapy in AF, and EP training should emphasize individualized patient-centered and longitudinal care, with programs having a mechanism to integrate rapidly evolving AF treatment options into teaching and clinical practice.

### Diagnosis and treatment of atrial fibrillation [^1172qmbG]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia that adversely affects cardiac function and increases the risk of stroke. It is the most common arrhythmia and a major source of morbidity and mortality; its prevalence increases with age. Pulse rate is sensitive, but not specific, for diagnosis, and suspected atrial fibrillation should be confirmed with 12-lead electrocardiography. Because normal electrocardiographic findings do not rule out atrial fibrillation, home monitoring is recommended if there is clinical suspicion of arrhythmia despite normal test results. Treatment is based on decisions made regarding when to convert to normal sinus rhythm vs. when to treat with rate control, and, in either case, how to best reduce the risk of stroke. For most patients, rate control is preferred to rhythm control. Ablation therapy is used to destroy abnormal foci responsible for atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation reduces the risk of stroke while increasing the risk of bleeding. The CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system assesses the risk of stroke, with a score of 2 or greater indicating a need for anticoagulation. The HAS-BLED score estimates the risk of bleeding. Scores of 3 or greater indicate high risk. Warfarin, dabigatran, factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban), and aspirin are options for stroke prevention. Selection of therapy should be individualized based on risks and potential benefits, cost, and patient preference. Left atrial appendage obliteration is an option for reducing stroke risk. Two implantable devices used to occlude the appendage, the Watchman and the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug, appear to be as effective as warfarin in preventing stroke, but they are invasive. Another percutaneous approach to occlusion, wherein the left atrium is closed off using the Lariat, is also available, but data on its long-term effectiveness and safety are still limited. Surgical treatments for atrial fibrillation are reserved for patients who are undergoing cardiac surgery for other reasons.

### Pharmacologic cardioversion for atrial fibrillation and flutter… [^115wYd2C]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Scenario A 70-year-old man comes to the clinic for routine follow-up of hypertension and is found to have new atrial fibrillation of unknown duration. Clinical Question Should antiarrhythmic medications be used to restore sinus rhythm for patients with atrial fibrillation. Evidence-Based Answer There is no evidence that rhythm control in older patients with atrial fibrillation is more effective than rate control for improving patient-oriented outcomes.

1. Practice Pointers Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of mortality and stroke. Furthermore, diminished atrial filling of the ventricles and irregular ventricular contraction can reduce cardiac output, leading to palpitations, dyspnea, and dizziness.

Whereas rate-control strategies for managing atrial fibrillation advocate medically slowing ventricular response to the fibrillating atrium and using anticoagulation to reduce stroke risk, rhythm-control strategies involve medical or electrical conversion to sinus rhythm to improve hemodynamics and symptoms and, theoretically, reduce stroke risk. 4 The American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians go further, recommending rate control with chronic anticoagulation as the best strategy for most patients with atrial fibrillation. 5 Both guidelines, 4, 5 however, state that rhythm control may be appropriate in certain situations, depending on specific patient characteristics such as the desire for symptom control or improvement in exercise tolerance. Both studies showed significantly higher rates of hospitalization and adverse events in the rhythm-control group and no difference in quality of life between the two treatment groups.

In AFFIRM, there was a similar incidence of ischemic stroke, bleeding, and systemic embolism in the two groups. Certain malignant dysrhythmias were significantly more likely to occur in the rhythm-control group. There were similar scores of cognitive assessment. In PIAF, cardioverted patients enjoyed an improved exercise tolerance, but there was no overall benefit in terms of symptom control or quality of life. Reviewers' Conclusions. The authors conclude that there is no evidence that pharmacologic cardioversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm is superior to rate control. Rhythm control is associated with more adverse effects and increased hospitalization, and it does not reduce the risk of stroke. This conclusion cannot be generalized to all persons with atrial fibrillation. Most of the patients included in these studies were older than 60 years and had significant cardiovascular risk factors. 1 supports using rate control with anticoagulation primarily.

If rhythm control is attempted, continued use of anticoagulation appears necessary to maintain a reduced risk of stroke.

### Atrial fibrillation (acute) [^1135qi3w]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

What are the effects of interventions for conversion to sinus rhythm. TRADE OFF BETWEEN BENEFITS AND HARMS. Another RCT found that compared with amiodarone, a higher proportion of people converted to sinus rhythm with oral propafenone within two and one-half hours, but the difference did not remain significant at 24 hours in people with onset of atrial fibrillation of less than two weeks. Two RCTs found no significant difference between flecainide and propafenone. Propafenone and flecainide are not used in people with known or suspected ischemic heart disease caused by possible proarrhythmic effects. What are the effects of interventions to control heart rate. LIKELY TO BE BENEFICIAL Digoxin We found no RCTs in people with only acute atrial fibrillation. Two RCTs found that digoxin versus placebo significantly reduced ventricular rate within two hours in people with atrial fibrillation of up to seven days' duration.

Timolol One small RCT in people with atrial fibrillation of unspecified duration found that intravenous timolol significantly reduced ventricular rate within 20 minutes compared with placebo. Verapamil Two RCTs found that intravenous verapamil reduced heart rate at 10 or 30 minutes compared with placebo in people with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. One RCT found no significant difference in rate control or measures of systolic function with intravenous verapamil versus intravenous diltiazem in people with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, but verapamil caused hypotension in some people. Prognosis We found no evidence about the proportion of people with acute atrial fibrillation who develop more chronic forms of atrial fibrillation.

Observational studies and placebo arms of RCTs have found that more than 50 percent of people with acute atrial fibrillation revert spontaneously within 24 to 48 hours, especially if atrial fibrillation is associated with an identifiable precipitant such as alcohol or myocardial infarction. 7 Onset of atrial fibrillation reduces cardiac output by 10 to 20 percent irrespective of the underlying ventricular rate 8, 9 and can contribute to heart failure. People with acute atrial fibrillation who present with heart failure have a worse prognosis. Acute atrial fibrillation is associated with a risk of imminent stroke.
