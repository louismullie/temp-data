## Question

Clopidogrel for hemorrhagic stroke secondary prevention

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether clopidogrel should be used for secondary prevention after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and how to approach antiplatelet decisions in this setting.

> Bottom line: Do not use clopidogrel routinely after ICH solely to prevent recurrent hemorrhage; prioritize strict blood pressure control as the cornerstone of secondary prevention, and consider restarting a single antiplatelet agent only if there is a compelling non-ICH indication (for example, coronary stent), after hematoma stability is confirmed and the benefit-risk balance is individualized; avoid dual antiplatelet therapy unless an overriding indication exists and multidisciplinary agreement is reached [^111QAfiz].

> Evidence summary: The RESTART randomized trial in ICH survivors who had previously used antithrombotics found that resuming antiplatelet therapy (mostly monotherapy with aspirin, dipyridamole, or clopidogrel) did not significantly increase recurrent ICH and suggested a possible reduction (4% vs 9%; HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.25–1.03), with no clear differences in major hemorrhagic or major occlusive vascular events; however, the trial did not isolate clopidogrel-specific effects and was underpowered for firm subgroup conclusions, a finding reinforced by extended follow-up analyses that maintained no excess in recurrent ICH with antiplatelet resumption [^114XAokc] [^117Ce6sf] [^112aW6MH].

> Guideline stance: The 2022 AHA/ASA ICH guideline emphasizes aggressive blood pressure control for secondary prevention and does not recommend routine antiplatelet therapy solely to prevent ICH recurrence; antiplatelets can be considered only when another vascular indication clearly warrants them, with individualized decision-making regarding timing and agent choice [^111QAfiz].

> Dual antiplatelet therapy harms: In ischemic stroke populations, adding clopidogrel to aspirin increases major bleeding without clear long-term ischemic benefit, underscoring that dual therapy should be avoided after ICH unless absolutely necessary for another indication; MATCH showed higher life-threatening bleeding with clopidogrel plus aspirin versus clopidogrel alone, and POINT demonstrated more major hemorrhage with clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone despite early ischemic benefit, neither of which supports DAPT use after a recent ICH [^117U7hfQ] [^115izYWJ].

> Practical approach: If a compelling indication exists to resume antiplatelet therapy after ICH, favor single-agent therapy and coordinate timing with neurology and cardiology after radiographic hematoma stability, while addressing modifiable hemorrhage risks and maintaining strict blood pressure control; there is no high-quality evidence that clopidogrel monotherapy is superior to other single antiplatelet options specifically for preventing recurrent ICH, and agent selection should be individualized based on the non-ICH indication and bleeding risk profile [^111QAfiz] [^114XAokc].

> Do not extrapolate ischemic-stroke DAPT guidance to ICH: AHA/ASA 2021 guidance supporting short-term DAPT (aspirin plus clopidogrel) after minor noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA does not apply to spontaneous ICH and should not be used to justify antiplatelet intensification after hemorrhagic stroke [^111NF3pH].

> Conclusion: Clopidogrel is not guideline-supported for routine secondary prevention after spontaneous ICH; if antiplatelet therapy must be resumed for another clear indication, use single agent therapy with careful risk stratification and vigilant blood pressure control, and avoid dual antiplatelet therapy in the absence of an overriding, time-limited cardiovascular necessity [^111QAfiz] [^114XAokc].

Clopidogrel is **not routinely recommended after hemorrhagic stroke** due to the risk of recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) [^111QAfiz]. The RESTART trial showed that restarting antiplatelet therapy (including clopidogrel) did not significantly increase recurrent ICH [^114XAokc], but the trial was underpowered and not specific to clopidogrel [^117Ce6sf]. Current guidelines prioritize blood pressure control and risk factor management; **antiplatelets are only considered if there is a compelling ischemic indication** (e.g. coronary stent) and after careful risk–benefit assessment [^111QAfiz]. If antiplatelets are used, monotherapy is preferred, and dual therapy should be avoided due to higher bleeding risk [^115Pac7T] [^117U7hfQ].

---

## Evidence from clinical trials

Evidence from clinical trials includes the **RESTART trial**, a randomized study of 537 survivors of spontaneous ICH previously on antithrombotic therapy that compared restarting antiplatelets (aspirin, dipyridamole, or clopidogrel) with avoidance [^114XAokc]; at a median 2-year follow-up, recurrent ICH occurred in 4% with antiplatelets vs 9% without (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.25–1.03), although the trial was underpowered and not specific to clopidogrel [^113rYudL]. The **SPS3 trial**, in patients with recent lacunar infarcts, found that dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) nearly doubled the risk of major hemorrhage (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.41–2.71) without significantly reducing recurrent stroke, highlighting bleeding risk with clopidogrel-containing regimens [^115Pac7T].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Current guideline recommendations emphasize strict blood pressure control for secondary prevention after spontaneous ICH; antiplatelet therapy is not routinely recommended and should be individualized based on ischemic and bleeding risk per the **AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines** [^111QAfiz]. The **RESTART trial** suggests antiplatelets may not markedly increase recurrent ICH [^114XAokc]; however, the evidence is limited and not specific to clopidogrel, so decisions should be individualized [^113rYudL].

---

## Risks and benefits of clopidogrel therapy

Balancing the **benefits** — reduced ischemic events in high-risk cardiovascular patients — against the **risks** — increased bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage, particularly in those with prior hemorrhagic stroke [^116ZL2Zu] [^111QAfiz] — is essential in ICH survivors.

---

## Patient populations where clopidogrel may be considered

Clopidogrel may be considered for patients with **compelling ischemic indications** — such as coronary stents — after careful risk–benefit assessment and shared decision-making [^111QAfiz]. It may also be reasonable as monotherapy in selected patients with **high ischemic risk and low bleeding risk**, though evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized [^114XAokc].

---

## Alternative antiplatelet therapies

Alternative antiplatelet options include **aspirin**, commonly used for secondary prevention after ischemic stroke but not routinely recommended after hemorrhagic stroke because of bleeding risk, and **cilostazol**, which may reduce ischemic events with lower bleeding risk than aspirin or clopidogrel [^112yDS45] [^111EeV9s] however, evidence is limited and use is region-specific [^113KKVrF].

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

- **Blood pressure control**: Strict blood pressure control is essential to reduce recurrent hemorrhagic stroke risk [^111QAfiz].

- **Regular monitoring**: Patients on clopidogrel require regular monitoring for bleeding complications and adherence to therapy [^113wnj3Z].

- **Individualized decision-making**: Decisions should consider patient-specific factors, including ischemic and bleeding risk, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^113rYudL].

---

Clopidogrel is **not routinely recommended** for secondary prevention after hemorrhagic stroke due to bleeding risk. It may be considered in selected patients with compelling ischemic indications, but decisions should be individualized and based on careful risk–benefit assessment [^111QAfiz].

### Recent clinical trials of antiplatelet therapy in secondary stroke prevention: Expectations and results for application in primary care settings [^113XVHTi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapies significantly reduce the risk of secondary noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. First-line treatment for secondary stroke prevention involves the use of antiplatelet drugs over oral anticoagulation therapies; antiplatelet treatment options include aspirin, aspirin in combination with extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP), or clopidogrel. Aspirin plus ER-DP has been shown to be effective for secondary stroke prevention, whereas aspirin plus clopidogrel offers no additive benefits and is associated with safety issues.

During the past several years, significant progress has been made in secondary stroke prevention, which continues to be an active area of interest. Today's primary care physicians are challenged with keeping abreast of new findings and ensuring that guideline-recommended therapies are initiated and maintained as indicated. It is important that primary care physicians be knowledgeable of the evidence by which clinical practice guidelines have been developed and on which their treatment decisions are based.

In the future, antiplatelet treatment may be tailored based on patient risk. Forthcoming trial data may offer additional insight into the roles of antiplatelet agents and appropriate identification and treatment of different patient types. This review provides primary care physicians with timely evidence- and guideline-based recommendations on the prevention of secondary stroke.

### Secondary prevention of stroke and transient ischemic attack: Is more platelet inhibition the answer [^115CSEkX]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Cerebrovascular events constitute an estimated 200,000 of the 700,000 strokes reported annually in the United States, which makes secondary stroke prevention an important goal in the management of disease among patients who have experienced stroke or transient ischemic attack.

- **Methods and results**: Various pharmacological approaches have been advocated, but the relative efficacy and safety of these regimens has remained the subject of much debate. The results of recent clinical trials on the use of antiplatelet therapy suggest that patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack may constitute a population distinct from patients with coronary or peripheral vascular disease. This may be caused, in part, by the differing etiologies of stroke and the increased vulnerability of cerebral vessels to bleeding. Indeed, dual antiplatelet therapy, which has been found beneficial for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes and percutaneous coronary interventions, does not confer secondary stroke protection. The emerging paradigm is that some level of platelet inhibition is required for secondary stroke protection; a level beyond which increased risk of bleeding arises.

- **Conclusions**: Because the vast majority of patients with ischemic stroke have recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack, rather than myocardial infarction, as their next event, antiplatelet therapies for these patients should be administered according to what has been shown to be efficacious for secondary stroke protection rather than for myocardial protection.

### Multiple versus fewer antiplatelet agents for preventing early recurrence after ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack [^115NWiMF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Antiplatelet agents are considered to be the cornerstone for the secondary prevention of stroke, but the role of using multiple antiplatelet agents early after stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) to improve outcomes has not been established.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness and safety of initiating, within 72 hours after an ischaemic stroke or TIA, multiple antiplatelet agents versus fewer antiplatelet agents to prevent stroke recurrence. The analysis explores the evidence for different drug combinations.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 6 July 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 7 of 12, 2020) (last searched 6 July 2020), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946 to 6 July 2020), Embase (1980 to 6 July 2020), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. We also searched the reference lists of identified studies and reviews and used the Science Citation Index Cited Reference search for forward tracking of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of multiple versus fewer antiplatelet agents initiated within 72 hours after stroke or TIA.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data from eligible studies for the primary outcomes of stroke recurrence and vascular death, and secondary outcomes of myocardial infarction; composite outcome of stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death; intracranial haemorrhage; extracranial haemorrhage; ischaemia.

### Clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin alone for the prevention of atherothrombotic events [^116HRdnv]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel plus low-dose aspirin has not been studied in a broad population of patients at high risk for atherothrombotic events. We randomly assigned 15,603 patients with either clinically evident cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors to receive clopidogrel (75 mg per day) plus low-dose aspirin (75 to 162 mg per day) or placebo plus low-dose aspirin and followed them for a median of 28 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes.

- **Methods**: The rate of the primary efficacy endpoint was 6.8 percent with clopidogrel plus aspirin and 7.3 percent with placebo plus aspirin (relative risk, 0.93; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.05; P = 0.22). The respective rate of the principal secondary efficacy endpoint, which included hospitalizations for ischemic events, was 16.7 percent and 17.9 percent (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.995; P = 0.04).

- **Results**: The rate of severe bleeding was 1.7 percent and 1.3 percent (relative risk, 1.25; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.61; P = 0.09). The rate of the primary endpoint among patients with multiple risk factors was 6.6 percent with clopidogrel and 5.5 percent with placebo (relative risk, 1.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.59; P = 0.20), and the rate of death from cardiovascular causes also was higher with clopidogrel (3.9 percent vs. 2.2 percent, P = 0.01). In the subgroup with clinically evident atherothrombosis, the rate was 6.9 percent with…

### Cost-effectiveness of cilostazol added to aspirin or clopidogrel for secondary prevention after noncardioembolic stroke [^113rUccr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

The objective of the study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of cilostazol, a selective phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor, when added to aspirin or clopidogrel for secondary stroke prevention in patients with noncardioembolic stroke. A Markov model decision tree was employed to examine lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of patients treated with either aspirin or clopidogrel, with or without additional cilostazol 100 mg twice daily. Cohorts were followed until all patients died from competing risks or ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.

- **Probabilistic sensitivity analysis**: This was conducted using a Monte Carlo simulation to model 10,000 cohorts of 10,000 patients. The addition of cilostazol to aspirin or clopidogrel proved to be strongly cost-saving. In all 10,000 simulations, the cilostazol strategy resulted in lower health care costs compared with aspirin or clopidogrel alone (mean $13,488 cost savings per patient; SD $8,087) and led to higher QALYs (mean 0.585 more QALYs per patient lifetime; SD 0.290).

This result remained robust across a variety of sensitivity analyses, varying cost inputs, and treatment effects. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, the average net monetary benefit from the addition of cilostazol was $42,743 per patient over their lifetime.

In conclusion, based on the best available data, the addition of cilostazol to aspirin or clopidogrel for secondary prevention following noncardioembolic stroke results in significantly reduced health care costs and a gain in lifetime QALYs.

### Cost-effectiveness of cilostazol added to aspirin or clopidogrel for secondary prevention after noncardioembolic stroke [^113vjRBu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

A Markov model decision tree was used to compare the estimated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of patients with noncardioembolic stroke treated with monotherapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) to those treated with dual therapy (cilostazol added to aspirin or clopidogrel). The monotherapy strategy included a mixture of patients treated with aspirin or clopidogrel, with the base case set at 41% aspirin as in the CSPS.com (Cilostazol Stroke Prevention Study for Antiplatelet Combination) study, with other proportions examined in a sensitivity analysis. Half-cycle corrections were applied for all analyses, with a cycle length of one year, a US payer/Medicare perspective, and a discount rate of 3%, as per convention for cost-effectiveness analysis in the United States, applied to both costs and benefits. Analyses were conducted using Amua (Amua_0.3.0, Boston, MA). The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request; all data used for modeling were obtained from the literature, so no institutional review board approval was sought for this project.

We used a Monte Carlo simulation to model cohorts of 10,000 patients. Cohorts were followed until all patients died, either from competing risks or due to ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Four health states were defined for patients in the cohorts: (1) neurologically intact, defined as a score of 0 on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS); (2) mild disability (score of 1–2 on the mRS); (3) moderate to severe disability (score of 3–5 on the mRS); and (4) deceased.

### Infarct on brain imaging, subsequent ischemic stroke, and clopidogrel-aspirin efficacy: A post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^114oNc5Z]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

In the Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (POINT) trial, acute treatment with clopidogrel-aspirin was associated with a significantly reduced risk of recurrent stroke. There may be specific patient groups who are more likely to benefit from this treatment.

The objective of the study was to investigate whether the association of clopidogrel-aspirin with stroke recurrence in patients with minor stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) is modified by the presence of an infarct on imaging attributed to the index event (index imaging) among patients enrolled in the POINT Trial.

In the POINT randomized clinical trial, patients with high-risk TIA and minor ischemic stroke were enrolled at 269 sites in 10 countries across North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand from May 28, 2010, to December 19, 2017. In this post hoc analysis, patients were divided into two groups based on whether they had an acute infarct on index imaging. All POINT trial participants with available information regarding the presence or absence of an acute infarct on index imaging were eligible for this study. Univariable Cox regression models evaluated associations between the presence of an infarct on index imaging and subsequent ischemic stroke. They also evaluated whether the presence of an infarct on index imaging modified the association of clopidogrel-aspirin with subsequent ischemic stroke risk. Data were analyzed from July 2020 to May 2021.

- **Exposures**: Presence or absence of acute infarct on index imaging.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the occurrence of subsequent ischemic stroke.

### Ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in minor stroke or transient ischemic attack with intracranial artery stenosis: A post hoc analysis of CHANCE-2 [^1127pixL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The efficacy primary outcome was a new ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke within 90 days. Secondary efficacy outcomes included new ischemic stroke within 90 days; new ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke within 30 days; a vascular event, which was a composite of stroke, TIA, myocardial infarction, and vascular death; disabling stroke with a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≥ 2 within 90 days; and ordinal severity of stroke or TIA within 90 days. The severity was measured by a 6‐level scale, including subsequent stroke or TIA events and the mRS score at 3 months, as follows: fatal stroke (stroke with subsequent score on the mRS of 6), severe stroke (stroke with the subsequent score on the mRS of 4 or 5), moderate stroke (stroke with subsequent score on the mRS of 2 or 3), mild stroke (stroke with subsequent score on the mRS of 0 or 1), TIA, and no stroke or TIA.

The primary safety outcome was severe or moderate bleeding, defined according to the GUSTO (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries) criteria, at 90 days. Secondary safety outcomes included any bleeding, mild bleeding, and death through 90 days of follow‐up. Members of an independent clinical‐event adjudication committee who were unaware of the trial group assignments confirmed all reported efficacy and safety outcomes based on available medical records, including imaging.

### Clopidogrel and aspirin in acute ischemic stroke and high-risk TIA [^115izYWJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Combination antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin may reduce the rate of recurrent stroke during the first three months following a minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). A trial of combination antiplatelet therapy in a Chinese population has shown a reduction in the risk of recurrent stroke. We tested this combination in an international population.

- **Methods**: In a randomized trial, we assigned patients with minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA to receive either clopidogrel at a loading dose of 600 mg on day one, followed by 75 mg per day, plus aspirin (at a dose of 50 to 325 mg per day) or the same range of doses of aspirin alone. The dose of aspirin in each group was selected by the site investigator. The primary efficacy outcome in a time-to-event analysis was the risk of a composite of major ischemic events, which was defined as ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or death from an ischemic vascular event, at 90 days.

- **Results**: A total of 4,881 patients were enrolled at 269 international sites. The trial was halted after 84% of the anticipated number of patients had been enrolled because the data and safety monitoring board determined that the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin was associated with both a lower risk of major ischemic events and a higher risk of major hemorrhage than aspirin alone at 90 days. Major ischemic events occurred in 121 of 2,432 patients (5.0%) receiving clopidogrel plus aspirin and in 160 of 2,449 patients (6.5%) receiving aspirin plus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.59 to [CI continues]).

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^116hHnUc]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Two reviewers independently screened the title, abstract, and full text levels of potentially eligible studies. A third team member reviewed all final decisions, and disagreements were resolved through discussion. This process also applied to risk of bias ratings and the extraction of key variables, such as the number of events. When reports omitted data deemed important, we contacted the authors for clarification and additional information.

Two reviewers independently extracted data using a predesigned data extraction form. They collected information on the characteristics of the enrolled patient population, descriptions of the intervention and control, and descriptions and event rates of patient-important outcomes. To determine the timeframe of any apparent benefit, we reviewed incidence curves presented in the primary studies.

To address the risk of bias, we utilized a modified version of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials. We assessed the generation of random sequences, the concealment of allocation sequences, and the blinding of participants, healthcare providers, data collectors, and outcome assessors or adjudicators. We also evaluated incomplete outcome data (missing or lost to follow-up) and judged a low risk of bias if the rate of missing data was lower than 10%. Additionally, other potential sources of bias, such as early trial discontinuation, were considered.

We rated the overall risk of bias for each study as the highest risk of bias for any criterion and evaluated it on an outcome-by-outcome basis, noting any differences across outcomes.

### Antiplatelet therapy in ischemic stroke: variability in clinical trials and its impact on choosing the appropriate therapy [^116fJhvB]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is an integral component of effective secondary prevention after non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke. Numerous clinical trials have tested the efficacy and safety of different antiplatelet regimens, including aspirin monotherapy, clopidogrel monotherapy, the combination of aspirin plus clopidogrel, and the combination of aspirin plus dipyridamole, in patients with a history of arterial ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). Although competing head-to-head comparisons between aspirin plus dipyridamole and clopidogrel were not previously available, various professional societies have outlined evidence-based recommendations for antiplatelet therapy in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA.

Based on these guidelines, many experts in the field implicitly assumed that aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole was the most effective antiplatelet treatment for stroke patients. However, these assumptions were called into question upon publication of the results from the Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes (PRoFESS) trial. The results of PRoFESS thus highlight the pitfalls of making conclusions about the relative efficacy of therapies in the absence of head-to-head comparisons.

This article presents an overview of the factors that differ between clinical trials and "real-world" patient populations, as well as factors that differ among clinical trials themselves. The article also addresses the potential impact these differences may have on clinical trial results and subsequent clinical decision-making.

### Early time course of major bleeding on antiplatelet therapy after TIA or ischemic stroke [^116ZL2Zu]. Neurology (2018). High credibility.

We analyzed individual patient data from six randomized clinical trials: Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischaemic Events (CAPRIE), Second European Stroke Prevention Study (ESPS-2), Management of Atherothrombosis With Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients (MATCH), Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance (CHARISMA), European/Australasian Stroke Prevention in Reversible Ischaemia Trial (ESPRIT), and Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes (PRoFESS). These trials investigated the efficacy of antiplatelet agents in patients with a TIA or ischemic stroke. Details of the individual patient data meta-analysis have been described previously.

A total of 48,023 patients with cerebral ischemia were included in the trials between 1989 and 2006. Aspirin was studied in four trials (CAPRIE, ESPS-2, CHARISMA, and ESPRIT), clopidogrel in three (CAPRIE, MATCH, and PRoFESS), aspirin in combination with (extended-release) dipyridamole in three (ESPS-2, ESPRIT, and PRoFESS), and aspirin in combination with clopidogrel in two (MATCH and CHARISMA). The ESPS-2 trial had four arms and randomized patients to aspirin, aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole, extended-release dipyridamole only, or placebo. Median follow-up ranged from 1.4 to 3.5 years.

We excluded patients with a possible cardioembolic origin of their stroke, specifically those with a history of atrial fibrillation.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1178FGGA]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

- **Strengths and limitations of this study**: Strengths of this review include a comprehensive search for randomized, placebo-controlled trials; explicit eligibility criteria with a focus on populations most likely to benefit from dual antiplatelet therapy; assessment of risk of bias; provision of important data not included in the published reports, provided by the authors of the two large studies; use of the GRADE approach to determine our certainty in the evidence; and an innovative approach to creating a single incidence curve that informs the optimal duration for continuing clopidogrel from the two large studies. The consistent results across studies and the clear benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy on reducing stroke risk without evidence of important adverse effects are likely to provide clear guidance for patients with high-risk TIA and minor ischaemic stroke and for the clinicians responsible for their care.

Our study has some limitations. The loading dose and treatment onset time differed among the three studies: CHANCE and FASTER used a smaller loading dose of clopidogrel compared with POINT (300 mg vs. 600 mg). This could leave clinicians with uncertainty as to which loading dose to choose. Our review does not address other populations of potential interest, including those who have experienced low-risk TIA and those with moderate to severe ischaemic stroke.

No trial compared clopidogrel with dual antiplatelet therapy and the addition of aspirin. It is possible that different categories of ischaemic stroke subtypes — small vessel disease, large vessel stenosis — were not fully explored.

### Cilostazol for secondary prevention of stroke and cognitive decline: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111mPWLZ]. Stroke (2020). Low credibility.

Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor, is used in Asia-Pacific countries for stroke prevention but is rarely used elsewhere. In addition to its weak antiplatelet effects, it stabilizes the endothelium, aids myelin repair, and facilitates astrocyte-neuron energy transfer in laboratory models, which may be beneficial in preventing the progression of small vessel disease.

- **Methods**: A systematic review and meta-analysis of unconfounded randomized controlled trials of cilostazol was conducted to evaluate its effectiveness in preventing stroke, cognitive decline, or the progression of radiological small vessel disease lesions. Two reviewers searched for papers between January 1, 2019, and July 16, 2019, and extracted relevant data. Peto odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for re-ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, death, and adverse symptoms, with sensitivity analyses. The review is registered under CRD42018084742.

- **Results**: We included 20 randomized controlled trials (n = 10505), with 18 focusing on ischemic stroke (total n = 10449) and 2 on cognitive impairment (n = 56). Most studies were conducted in Asia-Pacific countries. Cilostazol was found to decrease the incidence of re-ischemic stroke (17 trials, n = 10225, OR = 0.68 [95% CI, 0.57–0.81]; P < 0.05) over six months, in comparison to short-term trials, without an increased risk of hemorrhage.

### Rationale and design of a randomized, double-blind trial comparing the effects of a 3-month clopidogrel-aspirin regimen versus aspirin alone for the treatment of high-risk patients with acute nondisabling cerebrovascular event [^1156Kg4C]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Acute nondisabling cerebrovascular events are common and often portend a disabling stroke. Aspirin is the only antiplatelet agent to have been studied in patients presenting acutely with a cerebrovascular event, but the effect is modest and is reduced by a small increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. Treatment with the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin might be beneficial when taken soon following a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke. The CHANCE trial is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial to test an aggressive antiplatelet regimen in acute minor stroke or TIA.

- **Design**: The study will randomize 5,100 Chinese patients with acute TIA or minor stroke to receive a 3-month regimen of clopidogrel initiated with a loading dose of 300 mg followed by 75 mg/d, combined with aspirin 75 mg/d during the first 21 days, or a 3-month regimen of aspirin 75 mg/d alone. The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of patients with any stroke (ischemic or hemorrhage) at 3 months. Study visits will be performed on the day of randomization, at day 21, and at day 90.

- **Summary**: CHANCE will determine whether clopidogrel combined with aspirin can prevent more strokes after acute minor stroke or TIA compared with aspirin alone, with an acceptable risk profile.

### Comparison between aspirin and clopidogrel in secondary stroke prevention based on real-world data [^117EfEWD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapies on all‐cause death: Before the PSM, a total of 1,416 patients, 967 in the aspirin group and 449 in the clopidogrel group, died during the 12‐month follow‐up period. The difference in the HR of death was significant between groups, favoring aspirin (clopidogrel to aspirin HR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.91–2.39, P < 0.001). This difference remains significant after adjustments based on PSM with the Cox proportional hazards regression model.

The 12‐month mortality in the clopidogrel group (5.62%) was 1.3‐fold higher than in the aspirin group (4.69%) even after data adjustments reducing potential biases associated with 17 common confounding factors (HR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.07–1.58, P = 0.008). The mortality rates during the first 90 days were not different between groups, but significantly higher mortality in the clopidogrel group compared with the aspirin group was observed during the 4 to 12 months (adjusted clopidogrel to aspirin HR = 1.36, P = 0.026). The higher mortality rate in the clopidogrel group could not be ascribed to a restroke rate, which was not different between groups.

### Cilostazol mono and combination treatments in ischemic stroke: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^112yDS45]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the efficacy and safety of cilostazol as a mono or combination treatment (plus aspirin or clopidogrel) compared to conventional single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT, mainly aspirin) for secondary stroke prevention.

- **Methods**: Randomized controlled trial studies were searched across multiple comprehensive databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane) for review. The primary outcome was reStroke, comprising ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Secondary outcomes included ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, and composite outcomes. We performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of the identified reports, including two recently published randomized controlled trials. In addition, a network meta-analysis was performed to compare the relative effects of mono versus combination cilostazol treatments.

- **Results**: Ten studies were included in this review, five of which were assigned to the cilostazol mono group (n = 5429) and the other five to the combination group (n = 2456). The relative risks of reStroke, ischemic stroke, and composite outcomes with cilostazol mono as well as combination treatments were significantly lower than with SAPT, without any significant heterogeneity. An indirect comparison of these three outcomes revealed the cilostazol combination approach to be superior. The cilostazol mono treatment diminished hemorrhagic stroke more significantly than SAPT, and the cilostazol combination did not increase hemorrhagic stroke compared to SAPT.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^111NF3pH]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to antiplatelet therapy, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend initiating early dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel), ideally within 12–24 hours of symptom onset and at least within 7 days of onset. This therapy should be continued for 21–90 days, followed by single antiplatelet therapy, to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with a recent minor (NIHSS score ≤ 3) non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA (ABCD² score ≥ 4).

### Cost-effectiveness of cilostazol added to aspirin or clopidogrel for secondary prevention after noncardioembolic stroke [^113n7eL4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

The objective of our study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cilostazol added to aspirin or clopidogrel for secondary stroke prevention. In both our base-case model and across most sensitivity analyses, the addition of cilostazol to aspirin or clopidogrel was both cost-saving and led to a gain in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). In the base model, cilostazol resulted in an average cost savings of $12,848 and a gain of 0.6 QALYs per patient. The pronounced cost saving of cilostazol results from its relatively low annual cost ($109 per patient per year) compared with the cost of hospitalization for recurrent stroke and the long-term health care costs associated with neurological disability from recurrent stroke.

Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that cilostazol would have remained cost-effective even if the assumptions of our input parameters were incorrect. For example, cilostazol remained cost-effective in a model where all patients were disabled at baseline (30% of patients with a modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of 1–2 and 70% with an mRS score of 3–5). In reality, the proportion of disabled patients is much lower; 40% of participants in the POINT study and 75% of stroke survivors in an international prospective cohort study had an mRS score > 0. This indicates that cilostazol would be cost-effective when used in almost all secondary prevention situations because cost savings of cilostazol are smallest among patients with disability. Our results are also robust against a wide range of effects on hemorrhage. In our base model, we assumed similar bleeding risks with and without cilostazol.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage (RESTART): A randomised, open-label trial [^114hMiPE]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

In summary, RESTART excluded all but a very modest increase in the risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage with antiplatelet therapy, which seemed too small to exceed the established benefits of antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of major vascular events. Antiplatelet therapy might have reduced the recurrence of intracerebral haemorrhage. These findings provide reassurance about the use of antiplatelet therapy for similar patients in clinical practice. Ongoing randomised trials, their meta-analysis with RESTART, and an adequately powered definitive randomised trial should be conducted to strengthen the evidence.

### Beyond RCTs: Short-term dual antiplatelet therapy in secondary prevention of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack [^116RkCmG]. European Stroke Journal (2024). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in the real world, where treatment use is broader than in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Previous RCTs have proven the efficacy of short-term DAPT in the secondary prevention of minor ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA).

The READAPT study (REAl-life study on short-term Dual Antiplatelet treatment in Patients with ischemic stroke or Transient ischemic attack) (NCT05476081) was an observational, multicenter, real-world study with a 90-day follow-up. We included patients aged 18 and older who received short-term DAPT soon after an ischemic stroke or TIA. While no stringent NIHSS and ABCD2 score cut-offs were applied, adherence to guidelines was recommended. The primary effectiveness outcome was the occurrence of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or death due to vascular causes. The primary safety outcome was moderate-to-severe bleeding. Secondary outcomes included the type of ischemic and hemorrhagic events, disability, cause of death, and compliance with treatment.

A total of 1920 patients were included in the study. Of these, 69.9% started DAPT after an ischemic stroke, and only 8.9% strictly followed the entry criteria or procedures of RCTs. The primary effectiveness outcome occurred in 3.9% of cases, and the primary safety outcome occurred in 0.6% of cases. Overall, there were 3.3% cerebrovascular ischemic recurrences, 0.2% intracerebral hemorrhages, 2.7% instances of bleeding, and 0.2% of patients died due to vascular causes. Patients with an NIHSS score of 5 or less and those without acute lesions at neuroimaging had significantly higher primary effectiveness outcomes than their counterparts.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke caused by intracerebral hemorrhage: Extended follow-up of the RESTART randomized clinical trial [^113rYudL]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

After final, extended follow-up of the only completed randomized clinical trial of antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), no statistically significant increase in the risk of recurrent ICH was found upon restarting antiplatelet therapy. This finding provides physicians with some reassurance about the use of antiplatelet therapy after an ICH when indicated for secondary prevention of major vascular events.

### Clopidogrel with aspirin in acute minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHANCE) trial: One-year outcomes [^113F5Uq6]. Circulation (2015). High credibility.

The Clopidogrel in High-risk Patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial showed that the combined treatment of clopidogrel and aspirin decreases the 90-day risk of stroke without increasing hemorrhage compared to aspirin alone. However, it provided insufficient data to establish whether the benefit persisted beyond the trial's termination. We report the 1-year follow-up outcomes of this trial.

- **Methods and results**: The trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 114 centers in China. We randomly assigned 5,170 patients within 24 hours after onset of minor stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack to clopidogrel-aspirin therapy (loading dose of 300 mg of clopidogrel on day 1, followed by 75 mg of clopidogrel per day for 90 days, plus 75 mg of aspirin per day for the first 21 days) or to the aspirin-alone group (75 mg/d for 90 days). The primary outcome was stroke event (ischemic or hemorrhagic) during 1-year follow-up. Differences in outcomes between groups were assessed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Stroke occurred in 275 (10.6%) patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin group, compared with 362 (14.0%) patients in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.65–0.93; P = 0.006). Moderate or severe hemorrhage occurred in 7 (0.3%) patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin group and in 9 (0.4%) patients in the aspirin group (P = 0.44).

- **Conclusions**: The early benefit of clopidogrel-aspirin treatment in reducing the risk of subsequent stroke persisted.

### Cilostazol for secondary prevention of stroke and cognitive decline: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111EeV9s]. Stroke (2020). Low credibility.

Cilostazol's apparent greater benefit late after stroke could reflect several possible mechanisms. The weaker antiplatelet effects, and hence inferior stroke prevention compared with aspirin or clopidogrel early after transient ischemic attack/stroke (when stronger antiplatelet activity may be more beneficial), are supported by the neutral effect of cilostazol on ischemic stroke recurrence compared with aspirin or clopidogrel. Increasing benefit of cilostazol late after stroke was also demonstrated in CASISP, which found no difference in recurrence between cilostazol and aspirin within 6 months of stroke, but observed increasing benefit of cilostazol versus aspirin thereafter.

The increased benefit of cilostazol later after stroke may reflect that its mechanisms of action are more relevant to lacunar stroke, where recurrence occurs late, supported by increased benefit in trials including more patients with lacunar stroke. Potential benefits for lacunar stroke include endothelial stabilization, improved myelin repair, and better astrocyte-to-neuronal energy supply, all of which may take some time to accrue. The lower cerebral and systemic hemorrhage risks would also confer benefit over other antiplatelet drugs, which typically have higher bleeding risk the longer they are given. This was a reason for early stopping of the SPS3 trial (dual versus single antiplatelet drugs) for lacunar stroke, as seen in the present meta-analysis even in the presence of other antiplatelet drugs.

### Net clinical benefit of adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation for whom vitamin K antagonists are unsuitable [^113xke3X]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy reduces stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but increases hemorrhage.

- **Objective**: To quantify the net benefit of adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy, accounting for differences in clinical significance between ischemic and hemorrhagic events.

- **Design**: Observational cohort study to assign the relative weighting of events and post hoc analysis of randomized trial data to assess the net benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy in the ACTIVE (Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events) clinical trials.

- **Setting**: Global randomized clinical trial.

- **Patients**: 10,041 patients with AF, 7,554 of whom were not candidates for warfarin therapy.

- **Measurements**: Ischemic events (ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction) and hemorrhagic events (hemorrhagic stroke or subdural or extracranial bleeding) were weighted by the hazard ratio for death (or death or disability) after an event relative to death (or death or disability) after ischemic stroke. The net clinical benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy in the ACTIVE A trial participants was defined as the sum of weighted event incidence with dual antiplatelet therapy subtracted from the sum of weighted event incidence on control treatment, expressed as ischemic stroke equivalents prevented per 100 patient-years.

- **Results**: Adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy prevented 0.57 ischemic stroke equivalent (95% CI, -0.12 to 1.24) per 100 patient-years of treatment when weighted by hazard for death after ischemia or hemorrhage and 0.67 ischemic stroke equivalent.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage (RESTART): a randomised, open-label trial [^1174w5Cg]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Adults with stroke due to spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage often have a history of occlusive vascular disease, such as myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke. Consequently, at least a third of adults in high-income countries are taking oral antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) drugs at the onset of intracerebral haemorrhage. Generally, antithrombotic drugs are immediately discontinued because of the risk of early haematoma growth. Discontinuation of these drugs is often permanent due to the perceived risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage. However, the risk of occlusive vascular events might be higher, suggesting that the resumption of antithrombotic therapy could be beneficial overall.

Results of randomised trials have found a favourable balance of the benefits and risks of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy for secondary prevention of occlusive vascular disease for various conditions, although these trials excluded people with a history of major bleeding. Therefore, no published randomised trials are available to determine whether long-term antithrombotic therapy is safe or beneficial for survivors of intracerebral haemorrhage overall, or in subgroups at higher risk of bleeding, such as individuals with lobar intracerebral haemorrhage.

Use of antiplatelet therapy for about two days did not result in adverse effects for patients who had been enrolled in randomised trials of aspirin, without knowing their stroke was due to intracerebral haemorrhage. In the longer term (months to years), findings from a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies suggest potential benefits.

### Treatment effect of clopidogrel plus aspirin within 12 hours of acute minor stroke or transient ischemic attack [^111vrsx6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The primary endpoint of efficacy for this subanalysis was a new symptomatic ischemic stroke event occurring within the first 90 days. The symptomatic ischemic stroke events were divided into two types:

- **Reischemic stroke**: (a) Sudden onset of a new focal neurologic deficit, with clinical or imaging evidence of infarction lasting ≥ 24 hours and not attributable to a nonischemic cause (i.e. not associated with brain infection, trauma, tumor, seizure, severe metabolic disease, or degenerative neurologic disease). (b) A new focal neurologic deficit lasting 24 hours, not attributable to a nonischemic cause, and accompanied by new ischemic changes from the initial infarct on baseline magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography of the brain. For example, initial mild hemiparesis (NIHSS 2) evolving to hemiplegia (NIHSS 6) was considered stroke progression rather than a new stroke unless imaging clearly demonstrated a distinct second event remote from the presenting event.

The secondary endpoint of efficacy was a new clinical vascular event, which could include ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death.

### Antiplatelet treatment for prevention of cerebrovascular events in patients with vascular diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116ptg4j]. Stroke (2014). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of different antiplatelet regimes for the prevention of stroke in patients at high risk were investigated in a systematic review and meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Web of Science. Twenty-two studies comprising 173,371 patients were included.

- **Results**: In the overall population, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel, compared to aspirin monotherapy, reduced the relative risk of total stroke by 20% (risk ratio [RR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.73–0.88; P < 0.0001; I(2) = 28%) and of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack by 23% (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.69–0.85; P < 0.0001; I(2) = 18%) without increasing the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. In the secondary prevention cohort, DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel also reduced the relative risk of total stroke by 24% as compared with aspirin alone (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68–0.86; P < 0.0001; I(2) = 0%). DAPT with prasugrel or ticagrelor and aspirin versus DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin was not associated with a risk reduction of stroke.

- **Conclusions**: DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin, compared with aspirin, effectively reduces the risk of total and ischemic stroke in the overall cohort consisting of patients with cardiovascular disease without an increase in intracranial hemorrhage. It also decreases the risk of total stroke in patients with a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. Our meta-analysis suggests that DAPT including low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg) and clopidogrel (75 mg) is effective.

### Comparison of ticagrelor vs clopidogrel in addition to aspirin in patients with minor ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack: A network meta-analysis [^113TKGf4]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel and aspirin is effective in preventing restrokes following a minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). However, emerging evidence suggests the use of ticagrelor and aspirin, and the two DAPT regimens have not been directly compared. This study aims to compare ticagrelor and aspirin with clopidogrel and aspirin in patients with acute minor ischemic stroke or TIA for the prevention of restrokes or death.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception until February 2021.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials that enrolled adults with acute minor ischemic stroke or TIA and provided the mentioned interventions within 72 hours of symptom onset, with a minimum follow-up of 30 days, were selected.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: PRISMA guidelines for network meta-analyses were followed. Two reviewers independently extracted data and appraised the risk of bias. Fixed-effects models were fit using a Bayesian approach to network meta-analysis. Between-group comparisons were estimated using hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% credible intervals (95% CrIs). Surface under the cumulative rank curve plots were produced.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was a composite of restroke or death up to 90 days. Secondary outcomes included major bleeding, mortality, adverse events, and functional disability. A sensitivity analysis was performed at 30 days for the primary outcome.

- **Results**: A total of 4014 citations were screened, and 5 randomized clinical trials were included. Data from 22,009 patients were analyzed.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage (RESTART): a randomised, open-label trial [^117LYxvA]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

The primary outcome was fatal or non-fatal, radiographically or pathologically proven, symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage assessed in all participants, except one who withdrew before the first follow-up. The secondary outcomes included a composite of all major haemorrhagic events and a composite of all major occlusive vascular events. Major haemorrhagic events encompassed symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhages, other forms of spontaneous or traumatic intracranial haemorrhages, and major extracranial haemorrhages at any site requiring transfusion, endoscopic treatment, surgery, or causing death within 30 days.

Major occlusive vascular events comprised ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric ischaemia, peripheral arterial occlusion, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and carotid, coronary, or peripheral arterial revascularisation procedures. The composite secondary outcome of all major haemorrhagic or occlusive vascular events combined these two composite outcomes. In the protocol, a composite secondary outcome of all major vascular events was specified, as defined by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration: non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke (ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or uncertain cause), or death from a vascular cause.

Two consultant neurologists at the trial coordinating centre were internal assessors of reports for every outcome event. They were masked to treatment allocation and the use of antithrombotic therapy, using all available source documentation.

### Clopidogrel (Plavix) [^113wnj3Z]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2011). Low credibility.

Clopidogrel is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, indicated for the prevention of ischemic stroke and in-stent thrombosis. However, it has several drawbacks, including an increased risk of hemorrhage, a clinical effect that is slow in onset and irreversible, genetically determined variability in its clinical potency, and interactions with other commonly administered drugs.

### Comparison between aspirin and clopidogrel in secondary stroke prevention based on real-world data [^114odn7X]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

**Survival probability in ischemic stroke patients receiving aspirin or clopidogrel**: Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to estimate the survival curves for the risk of reStroke (A) during 12 months in ischemic stroke patients in the aspirin group and clopidogrel group. During the 12-month study period, 223 patients (3.46%) in the aspirin group and 244 patients (3.79%) in the clopidogrel group experienced reStroke, respectively. The differences between the two study groups in reStroke were not significant (HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.89–1.43, P = 0.311). However, the survival curves showed a significant difference in the cumulative risk of death within 12 months after the prior stroke and the initiation of antiplatelet therapeutics (B). More ischemic stroke patients in the clopidogrel group (N = 362, 5.62%) died during the 12-month follow-up period compared with those in the aspirin group (N = 302, 4.69%). The propensity-adjusted cumulative risk of death in the aspirin group was significantly different from that in the clopidogrel group (HR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.07–1.58, P = 0.008). CI indicates confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1158CrVH]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Our primary analyses were based on the numbers of events in each intervention and control group. We used DerSimonian and Laird random effects models in RevMan 5.3 to conduct the meta-analyses. Study weights were generated using the inverse of the variance.

We present results as relative risks and associated 95% confidence intervals. The χ² test for heterogeneity and the I² statistic were used to assess heterogeneity between studies.

As the POINT study enrolled a diverse, multinational population who underwent contemporary stroke management, we applied the relative risks to the baseline risks from this trial to calculate absolute effects (e.g. 6.4% risk for reStroke).

As authors used different terms to categorise symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage, symptomatic subdural haemorrhage, and symptomatic subarachnoid haemorrhage, we consider the functional consequences of these events sufficiently similar to include in a composite variable of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. Considering that death from intracranial or extracranial bleeding, or from ischaemic stroke, are equally important, and that non-fatal haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke have a similar distribution of functional outcomes, we considered our key outcomes to be all-cause mortality, non-fatal stroke, and non-fatal serious bleeding.

Studies did not report outcomes exactly as we defined them. For instance, studies reported all-cause mortality and all ischaemic stroke (including fatal and non-fatal), effectively double counting ischaemic stroke mortality that contributes to both all-cause mortality and stroke outcomes.

### Aspirin and clopidogrel compared with clopidogrel alone after recent ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack in high-risk patients (MATCH): Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^117U7hfQ]. Lancet (2004). High credibility.

Clopidogrel was superior to aspirin in patients with previous manifestations of atherothrombotic disease in the CAPRIE study, and its benefit was amplified in some high-risk subgroups of patients. We aimed to assess whether the addition of aspirin to clopidogrel could provide a greater benefit than clopidogrel alone in the prevention of vascular events, albeit with potentially higher bleeding risk.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to compare aspirin (75 mg/day) with placebo in 7,599 high-risk patients who had experienced a recent ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack and had at least one additional vascular risk factor. These patients were already receiving clopidogrel 75 mg/day. The treatment and follow-up duration was 18 months. The primary endpoint was a composite of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, vascular death, or rehospitalisation for acute ischaemia (including rehospitalisation for transient ischaemic attack, angina pectoris, or worsening of peripheral arterial disease). Analysis was performed by intention to treat, using the log-rank test and a Cox's proportional-hazards model.

- **Findings**: In the group receiving aspirin and clopidogrel, 596 (15.7%) patients reached the primary endpoint compared with 636 (16.7%) in the clopidogrel alone group, indicating a relative risk reduction of 6.4% (95% CI -4.6 to 16.3) and an absolute risk reduction of 1% (-0.6 to 2.7). Life-threatening bleedings were more frequent in the group receiving both aspirin and clopidogrel than in the clopidogrel alone group (96 [2.6%] vs. 49 [1.3%]; absolute risk increase 1.3% [95% CI 0.6 to 1.9]). Major bleedings were similarly increased in the group receiving dual therapy.

### The efficacy and safety of aspirin plus dipyridamole versus aspirin in secondary prevention following TIA or stroke: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114eThvK]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2013). Low credibility.

Stroke is becoming a common disease worldwide and has an increased rate of recurrence yearly following a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. Aspirin, dipyridamole, clopidogrel, and aspirin plus dipyridamole combination therapy have been recommended for the secondary prevention of stroke in Americans.

- **Design**: We performed meta-analyses to assess the effectiveness and safety of combination therapy with aspirin and dipyridamole (A+D) versus aspirin (A) alone in secondary prevention after TIA or stroke of presumed arterial origin within one week and six months.

- **Data sources**: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library.

- **Selection of studies**: Eligible studies were completed randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of aspirin plus dipyridamole versus aspirin in patients with previous TIA or stroke.

- **Results**: Five trials involving the use of aspirin and dipyridamole were included, with 4318 allocated to A+D and 4304 to A alone. Meta-analysis of trials showed a significant protective effect in reducing or preventing recurrence of stroke (P = 0.01) and ischemic event (P = 0.003). The statistics showed no significant difference in vascular event, death from all causes, and myocardial infarction (P > 0.05). Similarities were observed in all bleeding events, with major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage being significant (P > 0.05) between the two groups.

- **Conclusions**: Aspirin plus dipyridamole combination therapy was beneficial in reducing the recurrence of stroke and did not increase the bleeding event.

### Efficacy of clopidogrel for prevention of stroke based on allele status in the POINT trial [^113q21ER]. Stroke (2020). Low credibility.

Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet drug that is metabolized to its active form by the CYP2C19 enzyme. The CHANCE trial (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events) found a significant interaction between loss-of-function allele status for the CYP2C19 gene and the effect of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel on the rate of early restroke following acute transient ischemic attack/minor stroke. The POINT (Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke Trial), similar in design to CHANCE but performed largely in North America and Europe, demonstrated a reduction in early restroke with dual antiplatelet therapy compared with aspirin alone. This substudy was done to evaluate a potential interaction between loss-of-function CYP2C19 alleles and outcome by treatment group in POINT.

- **Methods**: Of the 269 sites in 10 countries that enrolled patients in POINT, 134 sites participated in this substudy. DNA samples were genotyped for CYP2C19 *2, *3, and *17 alleles and classified as being carriers or noncarriers of loss-of-function alleles. Major ischemia consisted of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or ischemic vascular death.

- **Results**: Nine hundred thirty-two patients provided analyzable DNA. The rates of major ischemia were 6.7% for the aspirin group versus 2.3% for the dual antiplatelet therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.09–1.21]; P = 0.09) among carriers of the loss-of-function allele. The rates of major ischemia were 5.6% for the aspirin group versus 3.7% for the dual therapy group among noncarriers.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138itBT]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

Minor ischaemic strokes or transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) put patients at risk of subsequent cardiovascular events, including devastating major strokes. Clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that patients who experience minor ischaemic strokes or TIAs benefit from antiplatelet therapy. Consequently, guidelines for the management of acute ischaemic stroke and TIA recommend antiplatelet therapy — typically providing strong recommendations for the use of a single agent, most commonly aspirin. One guideline provides a weak recommendation for clopidogrel and aspirin therapy, initiated within 24 hours of a patient presenting with minor stroke or TIA, and continuing for 21 days.

Several trials have tested the effectiveness and safety of clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin alone to prevent recurrent events in patients experiencing non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or TIA in both the acute and chronic phases. The Clopidogrel in High-risk Patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial reported that adding clopidogrel to aspirin starting within 24 hours of a minor stroke or TIA and continuing for 21 days reduced stroke risk without increasing the risk of moderate or severe haemorrhage at three and 12 months.

Despite findings from the CHANCE trial, many guideline recommendations persisted in recommending single rather than dual agent clopidogrel and aspirin for the initial treatment of minor ischaemic stroke or TIA. Rationales provided by guideline authors for not recommending routine dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with these conditions were not explicitly detailed in the text provided.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy using cilostazol for secondary prevention in patients with high-risk ischaemic stroke in Japan: a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^113KKVrF]. The Lancet Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Although dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel reduces early recurrence of ischaemic stroke, it becomes ineffective with long-term use, and the risk of bleeding increases. Given that cilostazol prevents stroke recurrence without increasing the incidence of serious bleeding compared with aspirin, we aimed to establish whether dual antiplatelet therapy involving cilostazol is safe and appropriate for long-term use.

- **Methods**: In a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial across 292 hospitals in Japan, patients with high-risk non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke identified on MRI were randomly assigned to two groups in a 1:1 ratio. The groups received either monotherapy with oral aspirin (81 or 100 mg, once per day) or clopidogrel (50 or 75 mg, once per day) alone, or a combination of cilostazol (100 mg, twice per day) with aspirin or clopidogrel. Randomisation was done centrally, using block randomisation with a block size of six per each participating hospital, through a web-based registration system by EPS Corporation. Patients required at least 50% stenosis of a major intracranial or extracranial artery or two or more vascular risk factors. Trial medication continued for a minimum of half a year, up to a maximum of 3.5 years.

The primary efficacy outcome was the rate of first recurrence of symptomatic ischaemic stroke. Safety outcomes included severe or life-threatening bleeding; any adverse events; serious adverse events; and any bleeding events. Efficacy analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.

### Outcomes associated with clopidogrel-aspirin use in minor stroke or transient ischemic attack: A pooled analysis of clopidogrel in high-risk patients with acute non-disabling cerebrovascular events (CHANCE) and platelet-oriented inhibition in new TIA and minor ischemic stroke (POINT) trials [^1179fZ8D]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin is effective for secondary prevention after minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Uncertainties remained about the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy for minor stroke or TIA.

- **Objective**: To obtain precise estimates of efficacy and risk of dual antiplatelet therapy after minor ischemic stroke or TIA.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This analysis pooled individual patient-level data from two large-scale randomized clinical trials that evaluated clopidogrel-aspirin as a treatment to prevent stroke following a minor stroke or high-risk TIA. The Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Non-Disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial enrolled patients at 114 sites in China from October 1, 2009, to July 30, 2012. The Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (POINT) trial enrolled patients at 269 international sites from May 28, 2010, to December 19, 2017. Both were followed up for 90 days. Data analysis occurred from November 2018 to May 2019.

- **Interventions**: In the two trials, patients with minor stroke or high-risk TIA were randomized to clopidogrel-aspirin or aspirin alone within 12 hours (POINT) or 24 hours (CHANCE) of symptom onset.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary efficacy outcome was a major ischemic event (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or death from ischemic vascular causes). The primary safety outcome was major hemorrhage.

The study enrolled 5170 patients (CHANCE) and 4881 patients (POINT). Analysis included individual-level data from both trials to assess the outcomes.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of multiple antiplatelet therapies for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack: A network meta-analysis [^1123M8Ch]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2019). High credibility.

Antiplatelet therapies for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a highly active research topic, identifying five critical drugs through visual analysis. We aimed to compare and rank multiple antiplatelet therapies using a network meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: Relevant medical databases were searched. Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which examined any comparisons involving mono- or dual antiplatelet therapies, based on aspirin, clopidogrel, dipyridamole, ticlopidine, cilostazol, and placebo for patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA, were included. Fourteen outcomes were assessed. The primary outcomes were stroke recurrence, composite events (stroke recurrence, myocardial infarction, and vascular death), and intracranial hemorrhage. The study was registered under PROSPERO number CRD42017069728.

- **Results**: Forty-five RCTs with 173,131 patients were included in the network meta-analysis, which involved eight antiplatelet therapies. Cilostazol and clopidogrel were statistically more efficacious than aspirin (odds ratio (OR) = 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.47–0.88; OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.62–0.95) and dipyridamole (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.44–0.93; OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.58–0.99) in reducing stroke recurrence, and they showed significant benefits in reducing composite events compared to aspirin (OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.45–0.89; OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.83–0.97). No significant difference was found between cilostazol and clopidogrel in intracranial hemorrhage. Weighted regression suggested cilostazol was hierarchically the optimum treatment considering both efficacy and safety.

### Clopidogrel versus aspirin for secondary prophylaxis of vascular events: A cost-effectiveness analysis [^115oiUEk]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Clopidogrel is more effective than aspirin in preventing vascular events, but concerns about its cost-effectiveness have limited its use. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel and aspirin as secondary prevention in patients with a prior myocardial infarction, a prior stroke, or peripheral arterial disease.

- **Methods**: We constructed Markov models assuming a societal perspective and based analyses on the lifetime treatment of a 63-year-old patient. Event probabilities were derived from the Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events (CAPRIE) trial as the base case. Outcome measures included costs, life expectancy in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and events averted.

- **Results**: In patients with peripheral arterial disease, clopidogrel increased life expectancy by 0.55 QALYs at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $25,100 per QALY, compared with aspirin. In poststroke patients, clopidogrel increased life expectancy by 0.17 QALYs at a cost of $31,200 per QALY. Aspirin was both less expensive and more effective than clopidogrel in post-myocardial infarction patients. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, our evaluation for patients with peripheral vascular disease was robust. Evaluations of stroke and myocardial infarction patients were sensitive predominantly to the cost and efficacy of clopidogrel, with aspirin therapy being more effective and less expensive in 153 of 1000 simulations (15.3%) in poststroke patients and clopidogrel being more effective in 119 of 1000 simulations (11%).

### Integrated care for optimizing the management of stroke and associated heart disease: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology Council on Stroke [^113bSFPw]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

The Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischaemic Stroke (POINT) trial evaluated the clopidogrel-aspirin combination versus aspirin alone in a heterogeneous population of patients with minor stroke (NIHSS < 3) and high-risk TIA (Transient Ischaemic Attack) with an ABCD2 score ≥ 4. In the POINT trial, patients were given a 600-mg loading dose of clopidogrel followed by 75 mg daily from day 2 to day 90, plus aspirin, versus aspirin alone. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in the primary outcome of ischemic stroke (IS), myocardial infarction (MI), and ischemic vascular death in the combination group, but this was associated with a significantly increased risk of major hemorrhage. In the POINT trial, the presence of a clopidogrel slow metabolizer genetic variant was not associated with a significant reduction in efficacy; however, there was a trend toward lower efficacy in these patients, although this did not reach significance due to the small sample size.

Following the results of these two trials, the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is now recommended for patients with recent minor (NIHSS score ≤ 3) noncardioembolic IS or high-risk TIA (ABCD2 score ≥ 4). It should be started early (ideally within 12–24 hours of symptom onset and at least within 7 days of onset) and continued for 21–90 days, followed by single antiplatelet treatment.

A recent trial, The Acute Stroke or Transient Ischaemic Attack Treated with Ticagrelor and ASA for Prevention of Stroke and Death trial (THALES), compared treatment with ticagrelor plus aspirin to aspirin monotherapy for 30 days in patients with mild to moderate stroke (NIHSS < 5) or high-risk TIA.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke caused by intracerebral hemorrhage: Extended follow-up of the RESTART randomized clinical trial [^112aW6MH]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

We recorded serious adverse events (that were neither an outcome event nor an expected complication of stroke) via investigators if they occurred before hospital discharge or via primary care practitioners' annual reports of hospital admissions. Investigators reported protocol deviations and violations to the trial coordinating center and the sponsor.

Monitoring included central statistical monitoring of trial conduct, data quality, and participant safety. This was supplemented by triggered onsite monitoring visits if required, and detailed source data verification at the trial coordinating center. We conducted checks on completeness, range, consistency, validation, and logic for all baseline and outcome data from the web-based case report forms.

- **Outcomes**: The primary outcome was fatal or nonfatal, radiologically or pathologically proven, symptomatic ICH assessed in all participants (except one participant who withdrew before the first follow-up). The secondary outcomes of major hemorrhagic events and major occlusive vascular events were prespecified. In the protocol, we had specified a composite secondary outcome of all major vascular events defined by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration: nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic, or uncertain cause), or death from a vascular cause. The process of outcome adjudication was described in the main report.

### Stroke: A new CHANCE for combination antiplatelet therapy [^115Sahni]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2013). High credibility.

Patients with transient ischaemic attack or minor ischaemic stroke have a high risk of early recurrence. A new study in Chinese patients suggests that this risk is reduced following treatment with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone. However, whether the findings can be extrapolated to other populations remains unclear.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage (RESTART): a randomised, open-label trial [^117Ce6sf]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

The RESTART trial had some limitations. We intended to recruit 720 participants and follow them up for 2 years but ended up recruiting only 537 people, which is 75% of our target. Investigators managed to recruit only one in twelve eligible patients; the remainder were not randomized because 28% of patients were too unwell when approached, 26% of physicians were certain about whether or not to use antiplatelet therapy, 9% of patients declined, 7% of patients were started on oral anticoagulation, and 30% were not recruited for other reasons. Due to slow recruitment, we conducted a stepped wedge cluster-randomized study within this trial at 72 of the sites to investigate whether stroke audit data extracts could boost recruitment; however, this strategy was not successful.

As in many other randomized trials of intracerebral haemorrhage, most participants were male. This might be due to their propensity to be invited or to consent, rather than differences in the incidence or outcome of intracerebral haemorrhage compared with women. Although we did not mask the assigned treatment to participants and physicians, the outcomes were objective and adjudicated masked to treatment allocation, which minimizes bias. Antiplatelet regimens used were mostly monotherapy, so the effects of dual antiplatelet therapy remain uncertain. Adherence to the allocated treatment declined over time but was more than 80% even after 4 years of follow-up. Although the sample size was smaller than intended and multiple statistical comparisons were done, we prespecified our primary outcome and main hypothesis and regarded analyses.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^113bmhte]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, specifically in relation to antiplatelet therapy, the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend initiating aspirin 50–325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg, or the combination of aspirin 25 mg and extended-release dipyridamole 200 mg BID for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke in patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA.

### Is the benefit of antithrombotics and statins worth the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage? It depends [^115GPQAA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Antithrombotics, such as antiplatelets and anticoagulants, and statins are often prescribed for primary or secondary vascular prevention. From a clinical perspective, practitioners often weigh the risk of bleeding, traditionally associated with antithrombotics, against their potential benefits. These benefit/risk considerations have driven randomized clinical trials investigating the role of aspirin in primary or secondary vascular prevention among specific populations at risk.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is perhaps one of the most feared side effects of antithrombotic use due to its high risk of mortality and morbidity. Although the initial publication of results from the SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels) trial suggested that the risk of ICH associated with statins among patients with noncardioembolic stroke was a concern, subsequent analyses from the SPARCL trial and other population‐based and hospital studies reassuringly showed that statins do not increase the risk of ICH.

### Aspirin versus clopidogrel monotherapy for the secondary prevention of recurrent cerebrovascular attack following previous ischemic stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111vaGga]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and stroke are distinct diseases that share many common aspects. Aspirin is recommended as an initial treatment for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke in patients with T2DM. However, clopidogrel, an oral antiplatelet drug, might be a suitable alternative in cases of aspirin intolerance. In this analysis, we aimed to systematically compare aspirin versus clopidogrel monotherapy for the secondary prevention of cerebrovascular attack following previous ischemic stroke in patients with T2DM.

- **Methods**: Online medical databases including Web of Science, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, and EMBASE were searched for published articles that satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this study. Restroke, fatal stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, and mortality were considered the main endpoints in these patients with T2DM. RevMan 5.3 software was used to statistically analyze the data representing each subgroup. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to represent the results following analysis.

- **Results**: A total of 9218 participants with T2DM who were previously affected by ischemic stroke were included in this analysis, whereby 4917 were assigned to aspirin and 4301 to clopidogrel. This analysis showed that there was no significant difference in restroke rate (RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.61–1.02; P = 0.07) observed with aspirin versus clopidogrel in these patients with T2DM. The risk of fatal stroke (RR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.39–1.98; P = 0.76), cerebral hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, and mortality was also analyzed.

### Comparison between aspirin and clopidogrel in secondary stroke prevention based on real-world data [^1117evet]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack carry a substantially higher risk of developing recurrent stroke and death than those without a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. Results from prospective clinical trials and subsequent systematic reviews have established well‐accepted guidelines indicating that antiplatelet agents are effective for secondary stroke prevention at both acute and chronic stages. Aspirin is the most widely prescribed antiplatelet agent, serving as the mainstay for secondary stroke prevention. However, several studies have compared the efficacy and safety of aspirin with other antiplatelet agents.

Clopidogrel is another guideline‐recommended antiplatelet agent and has been shown to be superior to aspirin in preventing composite vascular events and reducing hemorrhagic complications in a randomized controlled trial, CAPRIE (Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischaemic Events). However, whether clopidogrel is superior to aspirin in stroke prevention remains unclear, and current guidelines do not recommend using clopidogrel instead of aspirin as the first‐line antiplatelet agent for secondary stroke prevention. Additionally, clopidogrel was proven to be as effective as aspirin plus dipyridamole in secondary stroke prevention, with the additional advantage of fewer hemorrhagic complications in another randomized controlled trial, the PRoFESS (Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes) trial.

### Cost-effectiveness of cilostazol added to aspirin or clopidogrel for secondary prevention after noncardioembolic stroke [^114F8YVj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

The mainstay of long-term medical management for patients with noncardioembolic stroke is antiplatelet therapy along with vascular risk factor reduction. In North America, aspirin and clopidogrel are the most commonly prescribed antiplatelets for long-term secondary stroke prevention. Cilostazol, a selective phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor, is used in combination with aspirin or clopidogrel in some Asian countries for stroke prevention but is rarely used for this purpose outside of Asia. A recent meta-analysis found that cilostazol added to aspirin or clopidogrel for long-term secondary prevention was associated with lower risk of ischemic stroke without an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Cilostazol is believed to act through pleiotropic effects, including decreased cyclic AMP activation, which reduces platelet aggregation.

While multiple trials have studied the clinical effectiveness of cilostazol, research into its cost-effectiveness has been limited. Given its low cost, cilostazol has the potential to be a cost-effective treatment for secondary stroke prevention. A Japanese study from 2006 showed that cilostazol was cost-effective when used instead of aspirin for secondary stroke prevention, at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ¥1.8 million per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), which equals approximately $16,000 per QALY. In this study, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of cilostazol added to aspirin or clopidogrel for secondary stroke prevention in patients with noncardioembolic stroke from a US payer/Medicare perspective.

### Effects of clopidogrel added to aspirin in patients with recent lacunar stroke [^115Pac7T]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Lacunar infarcts are a frequent type of stroke caused mainly by cerebral small-vessel disease. The effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention has not yet been defined.

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind, multicenter trial involving 3,020 patients with recent symptomatic lacunar infarcts identified by magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 75 mg of clopidogrel or a placebo daily; patients in both groups received 325 mg of aspirin daily. The primary outcome was any recurrent stroke, including ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage.

- **Results**: The participants had a mean age of 63 years, and 63% were men. After a mean follow-up of 3.4 years, the risk of recurrent stroke was not significantly reduced with aspirin and clopidogrel (dual antiplatelet therapy) (125 strokes; rate, 2.5% per year) compared with aspirin alone (138 strokes, 2.7% per year) (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.16), nor was the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.09) or disabling or fatal stroke (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.64). The risk of major hemorrhage was almost doubled with dual antiplatelet therapy (105 hemorrhages, 2.1% per year) compared with aspirin alone (56, 1.1% per year) (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.41 to 2.71; P < 0.001). Among classifiable recurrent ischemic strokes, 71% (133 of 187) were lacunar strokes. All-cause mortality increased among patients assigned to receive dual antiplatelet therapy (77 deaths in the group receiving aspirin alone).
