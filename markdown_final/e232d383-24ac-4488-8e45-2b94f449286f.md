## Question

How much time does the IV vitamin K takes to reflect a change in INR

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long it takes for intravenous vitamin K to change the INR after administration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanism and why there is a delay. Then, I should verify the earliest measurable effect and when a clinically meaningful reduction typically occurs. Next, I will review how dose, route, and patient factors modify the time course. After that, I should compare IV to oral and subcutaneous routes. Finally, I will integrate guideline-based recommendations for urgent reversal scenarios and summarize a practical timeline with caveats and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism and why there is a lag. Vitamin K1 restores hepatic γ-carboxylation of factors II, VII, IX, and X, enabling their synthesis, but the anticoagulant effect of warfarin persists until new, functional factors accumulate. Because factor VII has a short half-life, INR can begin to fall once factor VII activity recovers, even though factor II recovery lags and determines sustained correction, which explains the time course we observe [^116a9jAH] [^114MZB6T].

> Now, I should verify the earliest measurable effect. Wait, let me double-check the onset. Multiple sources indicate that with IV vitamin K, INR reduction begins within about 2 hours, with a clinically meaningful reduction by roughly 4 to 6 hours. This is faster than oral administration, which typically requires 18 to 24 hours for substantial correction, reflecting more rapid bioavailability and hepatic utilization with the IV route [^113oBCYg] [^116eWgBY] [^116hZ4ZC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about complete correction. I need to check when normalization generally occurs. In patients with normal hepatic function and an appropriate IV dose, correction toward a normal INR is usually achieved within about 24 hours; this is supported by guideline summaries and clinical studies, and it aligns with the biology of factor II recovery over that window [^113oBCYg] [^114ufm2f].

> Next, I should review modifiers of the time course. Let me consider dose, route, and patient factors. Higher IV doses produce larger and faster INR reductions than lower doses, and IV is consistently faster than oral or subcutaneous routes; subcutaneous administration is notably less effective and slower, and should generally be avoided for reversal. Liver disease slows and blunts the response because hepatic synthesis is impaired, and higher baseline INR may require more time and larger correction; critically ill patients may also have attenuated responses necessitating repeated dosing and careful monitoring [^113oBCYg] [^111rpkVU] [^113w3ULy] [^113KLuJR].

> I will now examine comparative data to ensure I'm not overstating oral performance. Randomized data show oral vitamin K outperforms subcutaneous for early INR correction, but IV remains the fastest route. For example, in RCTs of patients with INR 4.5–10, oral vitamin K achieved therapeutic INRs more frequently than subcutaneous by the next day, while IV vitamin K achieved earlier reductions than oral in other studies, reinforcing the route-dependent kinetics [^111rpkVU] [^116a9jAH].

> But wait, what if the clinical scenario is urgent bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage? I should confirm guideline positions. For life-threatening bleeding or ICH, vitamin K monotherapy is inadequate because it does not provide immediate hemostasis; guidelines recommend IV vitamin K 5–10 mg combined with rapid factor repletion using 4-factor PCC (or FFP if PCC is unavailable) to achieve INR correction within minutes to an hour, with vitamin K providing durable reversal thereafter; vitamin K alone can take up to 24 hours to reach INR less than 1.4, which is too slow for acute bleeding control [^11187bA2] [^1116wi3b] [^115Pxpq2] [^111c3vJA].

> Let me synthesize a practical timeline and double-check it against the evidence. Initial effect: about 2 hours after IV vitamin K. Clinically meaningful reduction: 4–6 hours. Substantial correction or near-normalization: typically within 24 hours in patients with intact hepatic function. In urgent bleeding, pair IV vitamin K with 4-factor PCC to achieve rapid INR correction and prevent rebound, then monitor INR serially to guide any additional vitamin K dosing if INR remains elevated at 24–48 hours [^113oBCYg] [^116eWgBY] [^11187bA2] [^111HmSfc].

> I should confirm safety and administration details so we don't create avoidable risk. IV vitamin K should be diluted and infused slowly, typically 5–10 mg in 25–50 mL normal saline over 15–30 minutes, to mitigate rare anaphylactoid reactions; repeated high-dose vitamin K can delay re-warfarinization for days, so redosing should be guided by INR trends rather than given reflexively [^116eWgBY] [^116dDj6w].

> In summary, after IV vitamin K, expect the earliest INR reduction around 2 hours, a clinically useful decrease by 4–6 hours, and substantial or near-complete correction by 24 hours in most patients with normal liver function. In urgent bleeding, always combine with 4-factor PCC for immediate reversal while vitamin K sustains correction, and tailor expectations in cirrhosis or critical illness where responses are slower and less predictable [^113oBCYg] [^116eWgBY] [^11187bA2] [^113w3ULy].

---

IV vitamin K begins to lower INR within 2–4 hours [^113oBCYg], with **meaningful reduction by 4–6 hours** and **full effect by 24 hours** in patients with normal hepatic function [^114ufm2f]. In liver disease, onset is slower and the effect is blunted; repeated dosing may be needed [^113w3ULy]. For urgent reversal, combine vitamin K with PCC or FFP for rapid correction [^11187bA2] [^113uGGnj], and monitor INR every 6–8 hours to guide further dosing [^117QQqiN].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism and time course of INR correction

Vitamin K is a cofactor for γ-carboxylation of factors II, VII, IX, and X; warfarin inhibits this pathway, and vitamin K restores it, enabling synthesis of active clotting factors. The time to INR correction reflects the **half-lives of these factors**: factor VII (6–8 hours), IX (24 hours), X (48–72 hours), and II (60–100 hours) [^113oBCYg].

---

## Clinical evidence on time to INR correction

| **Clinical scenario** | **Route and dose of vitamin k** | **Time to meaningful INR reduction** | **Time to full INR correction** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Warfarin reversal (normal hepatic function) | IV 1–10 mg | 2–4 hours | 24 hours [^113oBCYg] |
| Warfarin reversal (cirrhosis) | IV 10 mg daily × 3 days | Minimal effect over 3 days | Limited response [^113w3ULy] [^116dgGmE] |
| Urgent reversal (major bleeding) | IV 5–10 mg + PCC/FFP | Immediate with PCC/FFP; sustained with vitamin K | 24 hours [^11187bA2] [^113oBCYg] |

---

## Factors influencing the time to INR correction

Several factors influence the **rate and extent of INR correction** with IV vitamin K:

- **Hepatic function**: Impaired synthesis delays correction; cirrhosis blunts response [^113w3ULy] [^116dgGmE].
- **Baseline INR**: Higher INR may require more time and higher doses [^113D9vHg].
- **Vitamin K dose**: Higher IV doses (5–10 mg) achieve faster correction than lower doses [^113oBCYg] [^116hZ4ZC].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, nutrition, and comorbidities affect response [^113KLuJR].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Non-urgent reversal**: IV vitamin K 1–5 mg for INR > 5 without bleeding; monitor INR in 6–12 hours [^notfound].
- **Urgent reversal**: IV vitamin K 5–10 mg plus PCC or FFP for major bleeding; vitamin K provides sustained correction [^11187bA2] [^113uGGnj].
- **Liver disease**: Use vitamin K cautiously; repeated dosing may be needed [^113w3ULy].

---

## Clinical implications and monitoring strategies

- **Monitoring**: Check INR every 6–8 hours after IV vitamin K until stable, then daily [^117QQqiN].
- **Adjunctive therapy**: Use PCC or FFP for rapid correction in bleeding or urgent procedures [^11187bA2] [^116eWgBY].
- **Safety**: IV vitamin K is generally safe; rare anaphylactoid reactions can occur [^113fu98Q].

---

IV vitamin K begins to lower INR within 2–4 hours, with **meaningful reduction by 4–6 hours** and **full effect by 24 hours** in patients with normal hepatic function. In liver disease, onset is slower and the effect is blunted; repeated dosing may be needed. For urgent reversal, combine vitamin K with PCC or FFP for rapid correction, and monitor INR every 6–8 hours to guide further dosing.

### Vitamin K for reversal of excessive vitamin K antagonist anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115n2bb9]. Blood Advances (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients receiving vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) with an international normalized ratio (INR) between 4.5 and 10 are at increased risk of bleeding. We systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of administering vitamin K in patients receiving VKA therapy with INR between 4.5 and 10 and without bleeding. Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials in April 2018. Search strategy included terms vitamin K administration and VKA-related terms. Reference lists of relevant studies were reviewed, and experts in the field were contacted for relevant papers. Two investigators independently screened and collected data. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated, and certainty of the evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Six studies (1074 participants) were included in the review and meta-analyses. Pooled estimates indicate a nonsignificant increased risk of mortality (RR = 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62–2.47), bleeding (RR = 2.24; 95% CI, 0.81–7.27), and thromboembolism (RR = 1.29; 95% CI, 0.35–4.78) for vitamin K administration, with moderate certainty of the evidence resulting from serious imprecision as CIs included potential for benefit and harm. Patients receiving vitamin K had a nonsignificant increase in the likelihood of reaching goal INR (1.95; 95% CI, 0.88–4.33), with very low certainty of the evidence resulting from serious risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. Our findings indicate that patients on VKA therapy who have an INR between 4.5 and 10.0 without bleeding are not likely to benefit from vitamin K administration in addition to temporary VKA cessation.

### Guideline-concordant administration of prothrombin complex concentrate and vitamin K is associated with decreased mortality in patients with severe bleeding under vitamin K antagonist treatment (EPAHK study) [^117F4SVd]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Guideline-concordant treatment doses for normalization of coagulation and a fixed time frame within which reversal is considered useful are probably the two conditions required to improve prognosis. To achieve a post reversion INR ≤ 1.5, most pharmaceutical companies recommend a PCC dose related to admission INR value. However, INR is not a linear representation of the coagulation and a dose-response curve has not been demonstrated in the literature. Moreover, in the absence of bedside INR monitoring, waiting for an admission INR value from the laboratory in bleeding patients may result in increased blood losses and coagulation factor consumption. Based on a previous small cohort study of VKA-treated patients with ICH suggesting that a single-regimen dose of PCC (administered as an intravenous bolus) is effective in achieving a post-reversal INR ≤ 1.5, French guidelines recommend, in order to save time when admission INR is not available, the administration of a single-regimen dose of 25 IU/kg factor IX equivalent PCC (that is, 1 mL/kg with available four-factor PCCs) in combination with 10 mg of vitamin K. Use of the recommended single-regimen dose has not yet become routine practice, as shown by the fact that only 205 patients (25%) received a dose of 25 IU/kg in our study. Guidelines also strongly recommend measuring the INR after reversal to control the degree of reversal and further normalize the coagulation 30 minutes after the first administration if the PCC dose was insufficient. Unfortunately, post-reversal INR was obtained within less than one hour in only 7% of our patients, underscoring the need for improved guideline adherence. In our study, bedside INR monitoring was never used. Adoption of this technique might help increase the rate of post-reversal INR measurement within one hour after treatment administration.

### Vitamin K for improved anticoagulation control in patients receiving warfarin [^111CPwot]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Effective use of warfarin involves keeping the international normalised ratio (INR) within a relatively narrow therapeutic range. However, patients respond widely to their dose of warfarin. Overcoagulation can lead to an increased risk of excessive bleeding, while undercoagulation can lead to increased clot formation. There is some evidence that patients with a variable response to warfarin may benefit from a concomitant low dose of vitamin K.

Objectives

To assess the effects of concomitant supplementation of low-dose oral vitamin K for anticoagulation control in patients being initiated on or taking a maintenance dose of warfarin.

Search Methods

To identify previous reviews, we searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE via The Cochrane Library, Wiley) (Issue 2, 2011). To identify primary studies, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via The Cochrane Library, Wiley) (Issue 2, 2014), Ovid MEDLINE (R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations database and Ovid MEDLINE (R) (OvidSP) (1946 to 25 February 2014), Embase (OvidSP) (1974 to week 8 of 2014), Science Citation Index Expanded™ & Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (Web of Science™) (1945 to 27 February 2014), and the NHS Economics Evaluations Database (NHS EED) (via The Cochrane Library, Wiley) (Issue 2, 2014). We did not apply any language or date restrictions. We used additional methods to identify grey literature and ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing the addition of vitamin K versus placebo in patients initiating warfarin or already taking warfarin.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected and extracted data from included studies. When disagreement arose, a third author helped reached a consensus. We also assessed risk of bias.

Main Results

We identified two studies with a total of 100 participants for inclusion in the review. We found the overall risk of bias to be unclear in a number of domains. Neither study reported the time taken to the ﬁrst INR in range. Only one study (70 participants) reported the mean time in therapeutic range as a percentage. This study found that in the group of participants deemed to have poor INR control, the addition of 150 micrograms (mcg) oral vitamin K significantly improved anticoagulation control in those with unexplained instability of response to warfarin. The second study (30 participants) reported the effect of 175 mcg oral vitamin K versus placebo on participants with high variability in their INR levels. The study concluded that vitamin K supplementation did not significantly improve the stability of anticoagulation for participants on chronic anticoagulation therapy. However, the study was only available in abstract form, and communication with the lead author confirmed that there were no further publications. Therefore, we interpreted this conclusion with caution. Neither study reported any thromboembolic events, haemorrhage, or death from the addition of vitamin K supplementation.

Authors' Conclusions

Two included studies in this review compared whether the addition of a low dose (150 to 175 mcg) of vitamin K given to participants with a high-variability response to warfarin improved their INR control. One study demonstrated a significant improvement, while another smaller study (published in abstract only) suggested no overall benefit. Currently, there are insufficient data to suggest an overall benefit. Larger, higher quality trials are needed to examine if low-dose vitamin K improves INR control in those starting or already taking warfarin.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) initiation — parenteral overlap and discontinuation: When rapid anticoagulant effect is required, a rapidly acting parenteral anticoagulant should be started together with the VKA and discontinued after at least 5 days of concomitant therapy and once the INR has been in the therapeutic range for at least two measurements approximately 24 h apart. If there is no urgent need for an immediate anticoagulant effect, warfarin administration can be commenced without the concurrent use of a rapid-acting anticoagulant.

### Reversing vitamin K antagonists: making the old new again [^117C6G3c]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are commonly used for the prevention and treatment of thrombotic disorders. The response to VKAs is highly variable due to their specific interaction with the vitamin K cycle, and hence interference with hepatic synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Monitoring the anticoagulant effect of VKAs by assessing the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is essential because complications are closely related to the intensity of anticoagulation. Treatment with VKAs contains a substantial risk of bleeding with a high case fatality rate. Reversal of VKAs is required in case of bleeding or a supratherapeutic INR, but also prior to high-risk surgery or interventions. Choice of methods to reverse VKAs depends on whether or not the patient is bleeding or is in need of an urgent procedure, and has to be based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the VKA. Reversal strategies include withholding the VKA, administration of vitamin K 1, and substitution of vitamin K-dependent procoagulant factors, and need to be combined with measures according to general bleeding management.

### Guideline for reversal of antithrombotics in intracranial hemorrhage: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society and Society of Critical Care Medicine [^111HmSfc]. Neurocritical Care (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for VKA reversal — cessation and vitamin K: We recommend discontinuing vitamin K antagonists when intracranial hemorrhage is present or suspected, and we recommend urgent reversal of vitamin K antagonists in patients with intracranial hemorrhage, with considerations that we suggest against VKA reversal in patients where there is a high suspicion of intracranial hemorrhage due to cerebral venous thrombosis and we recommend assessing risks and benefits when considering VKA reversal in intracranial hemorrhage patients with concurrent symptomatic or life-threatening thrombosis, ischemia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, or DIC. We recommend administration of Vitamin K to ensure durable reversal of INR following VKA-associated intracranial hemorrhage; Vitamin K should be dosed as soon as possible or concurrently with other reversal agents, and we suggest one dose of Vitamin K 10 mg IV with subsequent treatment guided by follow-up INR. If repeat INR is still elevated ≥ 1.4 within the first 24–48 h after reversal agent administration, we suggest redosing with vitamin K 10 mg IV.

### Assessment of the efficacy of a novel tailored vitamin K dosing regimen in lowering the international normalised ratio in over-anticoagulated patients: a randomised clinical trial [^115YLxsj]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Current guidelines advocate using fixed-doses of oral vitamin K to reverse excessive anticoagulation in warfarinised patients who are either asymptomatic or have minor bleeds. Over-anticoagulated patients present with a wide range of International Normalised Ratio (INR) values and response to fixed doses of vitamin K varies. Consequently a significant proportion of patients remain outside their target INR after vitamin K administration, making them prone to either haemorrhage or thromboembolism. We compared the performance of a novel tailored vitamin K dosing regimen to that of a fixed-dose regimen with the primary measure being the proportion of over-anticoagulated patients returning to their target INR within 24 h. One hundred and eighty-one patients with an index INR > 6.0 (asymptomatic or with minor bleeding) were randomly allocated to receive oral administration of either a tailored dose (based upon index INR and body surface area) or a fixed-dose (1 or 2 mg) of vitamin K. A greater proportion of patients treated with the tailored dose returned to within target INR range compared to the fixed-dose regimen (68.9% vs. 52.8%; P = 0.026), whilst a smaller proportion of patients remained above target INR range (12.2% vs. 34.0%; P < 0.001). Individualised vitamin K dosing is more accurate than fixed-dose regimen in lowering INR to within target range in excessively anticoagulated patients.

### Reversal of asymptomatic over-anticoagulation by orally administered vitamin K [^116Ugv7U]. British Journal of Haematology (2006). Low credibility.

Over-anticoagulation with warfarin is common. There is good reason to reverse significantly high international normalised ratios (INRs), however, in practice, there is wide variation in the means to achieve this. Randomised controlled trials have provided evidence for using low dose orally administered phytomenadione for the reversal of asymptomatic over-anticoagulation. We devised an oral regimen using the intravenous preparation of phytomenadione (vitamin K1). Patients with an asymptomatic INR between 8.0 and 11.9 (n = 166) received 2.5 mg and those with an INR of 12.0–20.0 (n = 36) or > 20 (n = 21) received 5 mg. Median INRs for the three groups of patients on day 1 (approximately 14 h) after vitamin K administration were 3.5, 3.0 and 2.9 respectively. In the patients given 2.5 mg, 77% had INRs between 2.0 and 4.9 on day 1. In the patients given 5 mg, 52% of those presenting with INRs of 12.0–20.0 returned between 2.0 and 4.9 1 d after administration of vitamin K. In the INR > 20 group 44% returned with an INR between 2.0 and 4.9. Warfarin was reintroduced once the INR was < 5 and the majority of patients remained stable for the following 14 d. This regimen for non-urgent correction is therefore effective and returns patients to a safe INR level without over-reversing anticoagulation.

### Vitamin K dosing to reverse warfarin based on INR, route of administration, and home warfarin dose in the acute / critical care setting [^113D9vHg]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin K is commonly used for reversal of anticoagulation of warfarin. However, the optimal dose and route of vitamin K that does not increase the duration of bridging therapy is unknown.

Objective

To determine factors influencing the extent and rate of INR reversal with vitamin K in the acute/critical care setting.

Methods

This was a chart review of 400 patients who received vitamin K for reversal of warfarin effects between February 2008 and November 2010. Data collected included international normalized ratios (INRs) 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours prior to vitamin K administration; intravenous or oral vitamin K dose; and whether or not fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was administered.

Results

Intravenous vitamin K reduced INR more rapidly than oral vitamin K (5.09, 1.91, 1.54, and 1.41 vs 5.67, 2.90, 2.14, and 1.58) at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 hours, respectively. The dose of vitamin K (p < 0.001), route of administration (p < 0.001), and baseline INR (p < 0.001) influenced subsequent INR values. The INR reduction was similar for intravenous vitamin K doses 2 mg or greater. Home warfarin dose did not affect INR responses to intravenous (p = 0.27) or oral vitamin K (p = 0.98). FFP did not influence INR values at 48 hours. Although longer anticoagulation bridge therapy seemed to be associated with higher vitamin K doses, the incidence (p = 0.63) and duration (p = 0.61) were not significant.

Conclusions

Vitamin K dose, route, and initial INR influence subsequent INR values. INR reduction is similar for intravenous vitamin K doses of 2 mg or greater. Preadministration of FFP does not alter INR values at 48 hours or more after vitamin K administration.

### Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^116ceJ2x]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter about treatment for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see "Grades of Recommendation" chapter). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend anticoagulant therapy with subcutaneous (SC) low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), monitored IV, or SC unfractionated heparin (UFH), unmonitored weight-based SC UFH, or SC fondaparinux (all Grade 1A). For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C). For patients with confirmed PE, we recommend early evaluation of the risks to benefits of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1C); for those with hemodynamic compromise, we recommend short-course thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B); and for those with nonmassive PE, we recommend against the use of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B). In acute DVT or PE, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux for at least 5 days rather than a shorter period (Grade 1C); and initiation of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) together with LMWH, UFH, or fondaparinux on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of these heparin preparations when the international normalized ratio (INR) is ≥ 2.0 for at least 24 h (Grade 1A). For patients with DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with unprovoked DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 3 months (Grade 1A), and that all patients are then evaluated for the risks to benefits of indefinite therapy (Grade 1C). We recommend indefinite anticoagulant therapy for patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE and a low risk of bleeding when this is consistent with the patient's preference (Grade 1A), and for most patients with a second unprovoked DVT (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend at least 3 months of treatment with LMWH for patients with VTE and cancer (Grade 1A), followed by treatment with LMWH or VKA as long as the cancer is active (Grade 1C). For prevention of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) after proximal DVT, we recommend use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For DVT of the upper extremity, we recommend similar treatment as for DVT of the leg (Grade 1C). Selected patients with lower-extremity (Grade 2B) and upper-extremity (Grade 2C). DVT may be considered for thrombus removal, generally using catheter-based thrombolytic techniques. For extensive superficial vein thrombosis, we recommend treatment with prophylactic or intermediate doses of LMWH or intermediate doses of UFH for 4 weeks (Grade 1B).

VKA-associated major bleeding — management recommendations: For patients with VKA-associated major bleeding, we suggest rapid reversal of anticoagulation with four-factor PCC rather than with plasma (Grade 2C). We suggest the additional use of vitamin K 5 to 10 mg administered by slow IV injection rather than reversal with coagulation factors alone (Grade 2C).

### Efficacy of warfarin reversal in orthopedic trauma surgery patients [^115K4QxH]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

We determine the efficacy of active reversal of warfarin anticoagulation with intravenous vitamin K compared to withholding warfarin in patients requiring urgent orthopedic trauma surgery.

Design

This was a prospective cohort with immediate prehypothesis consecutive retrospective comparative case series conducted at a level 1 university hospital trauma unit.

Patients

Forty-eight consecutive patients between 1998 and 2004 in a study composed of a prospective cohort were compared with a retrospective consecutive case series of warfarinized orthopedic trauma patients requiring urgent surgery. The prospective arm directly followed the historic case series from which the hypothesis was generated.

Intervention

Vitamin K administration.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcome was time to surgery. Secondary outcomes were problems with active reversal, length of time for warfarin stabilization after surgery, and complications.

Results

The mean time to surgery in warfarinized patients not given vitamin K was 111.9 hours; in the intervention group, it was 67.4 hours, giving a mean difference of 44.5 hours (P = 0.01). Vitamin K reduced the international normalized ratio (INR) to less than 2.0 in 74% of patients within 24 hours. There were no complications of vitamin K administration. A dose of vitamin K costs approximately 1/1000 of a hospital bed day cost. A loading dose of warfarin on the second postoperative day took approximately 1 day longer to reach an INR of greater than 2.0 in the intervention patients than in those who had not been given vitamin K.

Conclusions

Warfarin reversal with vitamin K was successful and facilitated earlier surgery in all patients; the first dose was effective in approximately three quarters of patients. It is cost-effective, with no side effects caused in this study.

Treatment of anticoagulant-related bleeding during vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy — In emergency situations, vitamin K 10 mg IV instead of given orally is recommended because of its more rapid onset, although IV injection of vitamin K is reported to cause anaphylaxis in three of 100,000 patients, resulting in advice to infuse slowly. In one RCT of patients with INR 6 to 10 without bleeding, IV injection more rapidly brought the INR back to therapeutic range (11 of 24 patients vs 0 of 23 patients at 6 h), but by 24 h the mean INR in both groups was similar. In a second RCT of patients with INR 6 to 10, vitamin K 0.5 mg IV led to faster resolution than vitamin K 3 mg SC, with an INR < 5 in 95% vs 45% of patients and a mean INR of 3.7 vs 5.4 at 24 h, and accordingly SC injection is not recommended. A small case series of 17 patients comparing fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and three-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), with all patients receiving vitamin K, found the mean INR decreased from 2.83 to 1.22 within 4.8 h in patients receiving PCC vs from 2.97 to 1.74 within 7.3 h for those receiving FFP (P < .001).

### Fixed-versus variable-dose prothrombin complex concentrate for the emergent reversal of vitamin K antagonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114M6Qn7]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Use of Standardized Initial Fixed Dose

In summary, these findings suggest that a fixed dose of 4-PCC can be administered more rapidly than a variable dose, may be more effective at achieving clinical hemostasis, and is likely similarly effective at normalizing the INR to less than 2. While it is not clear precisely why a fixed-dose regimen may be superior to a variable-dose regimen in terms of clinical hemostasis, mortality, and TEEs, a potential reason is the improved speed with which a fixed dose can be administered. Eliminating the need for weight-based calculations and patient-specific medication preparation means that a fixed dose of 4-PCC can be given faster and therefore reverse the underlying VKA more rapidly. Further analysis of specific fixed-dose subgroups suggests that a dose of at least 2000 IU may yield optimal results. Based on these data, it is possible that a protocol using a fixed-dose of 2000 IU could therefore provide rapid and effective VKA reversal. Additional 4-PCC could then be given in a variable-dose fashion for specific subgroups, such as patients presenting with ICH or an INR greater than 4, or those weighing greater than or equal to 80 kg.

Limitations

This study has several limitations that must be considered. First, there were few RCTs included in this meta-analysis and the majority of included trials were retrospective in nature. We separated our analyses by study type (cohort vs. RCT) to address any potential bias from pooling observational and RCT studies. Second, there was variability in the primary outcomes from these studies. This included goal INRs, which we addressed by using composite goal INRs. It also included clinical hemostasis, which was variably defined across studies. Third, some outcomes were only reported by a few studies, limiting patient numbers in subgroup analyses. Finally, despite the low publication bias among the included studies, several of our analyses revealed moderate to high heterogeneity. In a total of 19 primary meta-analyses (Supplementary Table 3,), 10 had an I² value above 50%, which signifies moderate heterogeneity. Furthermore, 14 had an I² greater than 21%, the median measure of heterogeneity in the Cochrane library. Nevertheless, it is important to note that all these limitations are considered in the GRADE recommendations, which assess the quality of evidence with a mixed quality of evidence.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) maintenance — international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring frequency for consistently stable results: Stable INRs are defined as "at least 3 months of consistent results with no need to adjust VKA dosing". Practice varies, with "stable patients usually" tested "every 4 weeks" in North America, whereas "INR recall intervals of up to 90 days are routine" in the United Kingdom. Evidence includes three RCTs of recall intervals exceeding the 4-week standard; one compared 6- to 4-week intervals, another allowed intervals "of up to 12 weeks", and a third compared "4- to 12-week" intervals, with "none of the studies" showing differences in thromboembolism, bleeding, or INR control. Accordingly, the recommendation states: "For patients taking VKA therapy with consistently stable INRs, we suggest an INR testing frequency of up to 12 weeks rather than every 4 weeks (Grade 2B)".

Vitamin K (phytonadione) — for vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-related intraparenchymal hemorrhage, there are 'no high-quality studies evaluating the efficacy of Vitamin K monotherapy for improving mortality rates or functional outcomes', and while small trials in other populations 'demonstrate the utility of Vitamin K in correcting the INR', its 'reduction of the INR to < 1.4 may take up to 24 h'. Consequently, 'vitamin K monotherapy is not adequate for preventing hemorrhage growth', with one study finding 'a 50% incidence' of growth on vitamin K alone versus '33% or 19%' when combined with FFP or PCC, and another reporting '5 of 6' on monotherapy had hematoma expansion. Given its durable effect, Vitamin K 'is therefore recommended in conjunction with other reversal agents', and 'Intravenous administration of Vitamin K is more effective at INR reversal than the same dose of vitamin K administered subcutaneously'.

### INR and vitamin K-dependent factor levels after vitamin K antagonist reversal with 4F-PCC or plasma [^114MZB6T]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

PCC administration has previously been shown to have greater efficacy than plasma in correcting all VKDF levels. Accordingly, our data have shown an increase of 61% in FII levels in patients receiving 4F-PCC (from 25.7% baseline to 86.7% after treatment with 4F-PCC) compared with only an 18.1% increase in FII levels in those receiving plasma (from 28.1% baseline to 46.2% after treatment with plasma), suggesting that each unit of plasma increases FII levels by ∼5%. In a study of patients requiring VKA reversal, administration of ∼4 units of plasma resulted in a decrease of median INR from 8.95 to 2.3, whereas the activity levels of factors II, VII, IX, and X increased from 3% to 10% to 17% to 20%. Similar results were observed in a second study in which a median of 3 units of plasma resulted in an increase in the activity levels of factors II, V, and VII (from 25%-48% to 37%-58%; a median increase of 10% to 12% in activity levels). Taking these findings together, each unit of plasma increased factor activity levels by ∼3% to 5%, leading to a situation in which INR values may be considered to be corrected (because of early increases in FVII activity compared with FII or FX, mainly because of intravenous vitamin K administered together with PCC or plasma), although the risk of bleeding remains high. Therefore, complete normalization of the hemostatic defect cannot be assumed to have occurred with plasma administration alone. It is important to note that our data reflect 2 studies that used a weight-based dosing approach for plasma (10, 12, and 15 mL/kg based on INR), which is not routinely done in clinical practice, and thus, often underdosed.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^117BC8Le]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Reversal of OACs

The effects of warfarin on coagulation extend over the drug's half-life of several days; hence, simply stopping warfarin will not rapidly reverse the anticoagulated state. Emergency management of patients treated with warfarin is discussed in depth in many clinical guidelines that advise on interventions according to INR status, the need for invasive procedures and bleeding risk or severity; these are reviewed in table 3. Vitamin K 1 (phytonadione), administered orally or intravenously, can be used to accelerate warfarin reversal to some extent by counteracting its effects on vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor synthesis. The effect of vitamin K 1 on reversal of VKA-based anticoagulation is not immediate but will progress over 18–24 h or more as the liver synthesises sufficient quantities of vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins (factors II, VII, IX and X) to re-establish effective clotting, a process that takes even longer in the presence of liver disease or other metabolic or nutritional problems.

### Bench-to-bedside review: optimising emergency reversal of vitamin K antagonists in severe haemorrhage-from theory to practice [^116wCwSp]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Critical care physicians are increasingly facing patients receiving oral anticoagulation for either cessation of major haemorrhage or to reverse the effects of vitamin K antagonists ahead of emergency surgery. Rapid reversal of anticoagulation is particularly essential in cases of life-threatening bleeding. In these situations, guidelines recommend the concomitant administration of prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) and oral or intravenous vitamin K for the fastest normalisation of the international normalised ratio (INR). Despite their universal recommendation, PCCs remain underused by many physicians who prefer to opt for fresh frozen plasma despite its limitations in anticoagulant reversal, including time to reverse INR and high risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury. In contrast, the lower volume required to normalise INR with PCCs and the room temperature storage facilitate faster preparation and administration time, thus increasing the speed at which haemorrhages can be treated. PCCs therefore allow faster, more reliable and complete reversal of vitamin K anticoagulation, especially when administered immediately following confirmation of haemorrhage. In the emergency setting, probabilistic dosing may be considered.

### INR and vitamin K-dependent factor levels after vitamin K antagonist reversal with 4F-PCC or plasma [^112xtDaW]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This retrospective analysis of data from 2 prospective phase 3b randomized controlled trials demonstrated that 4F-PCC achieves not only rapid correction of INR values but also rapid restoration of hemostatic levels of VKDF, even when the postinfusion INR is still elevated at > 1.5 compared with plasma. Also, significantly higher number of patients were able to undergo urgent surgery within 3 hours with 4F-PCC compared with plasma.

Our results are consistent with those of previously published studies, including those from a systematic review and meta-analysis that concluded that PCCs are more likely to achieve INR correction within a shorter time. In a study among patients with intracranial hemorrhage and requiring VKA reversal, the time to reach INR < 1.3 after plasma administration was 32 hours. Even when targeting INR < 1.4, patients treated with plasma exhibited significant delays in INR correction at an average of 29 hours and for INR ≤ 1.5, an average of 25 hours.

### Treatment of warfarin-associated coagulopathy: a physician survey [^111gsmvc]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

(1) To determine physician preferences in the management of warfarin-induced excessive anticoagulation (AC); and (2) to assess compliance with the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines for the reversal of excessive AC.

Design

Cross-sectional physician survey.

Participants

Members of the Canadian Society of Internal Medicine practicing in Ontario, Canada.

Measurements and Results

Physicians were asked to provide management preferences in six clinical scenarios describing warfarin-induced excessive AC. The scenarios represent various combinations of international normalized ratio (INR) value, treatment setting, and presence and severity of bleeding. In scenarios with INRs < 5.2 without bleeding, conservative approaches complying with the ACCP guidelines, such as withholding warfarin or reducing its dose, were most common. In scenarios with high INRs (ie, > 7.1) and/or bleeding, the selection of vitamin K in any form ranged between 71% and 82%. However, compliance with the ACCP-recommended doses and the routes of vitamin K administration ranged from 1 to 10%. In five of the six scenarios, subcutaneous injection, a route not recommended by the ACCP, was the most common method of vitamin K delivery.

Conclusions

Physician preferences for the reversal of warfarin-induced excessive AC were highly variable and, in most cases, did not follow the recommendations of the ACCP consensus guidelines. Furthermore, the widespread reported use of subcutaneous vitamin K is concerning because this route of vitamin K administration has been demonstrated to be less effective than IV administration of vitamin K. These findings highlight the need for randomized controlled trials to compare the efficacy of different routes of administration of vitamin K for warfarin-associated coagulopathy.

### Clinical performance measures for neurocritical care: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^112mVCRE]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Coagulopathy reversal in intracerebral hemorrhage — performance measure defines the percentage of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and an INR > 1.4 due to warfarin treatment who receive replacement of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors within 90 minutes of emergency department (ED) arrival and who also receive intravenous (IV) vitamin K. The numerator is patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and an INR > 1.4 due to warfarin treatment who receive replacement of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors within 90 minutes of ED presentation and who also receive IV vitamin K. The denominator includes intracerebral hemorrhage patients with a known time of onset or time last seen well within the previous 12 hours, an INR > 1.4 and known or presumed current warfarin use, and excludes < 18 years of age, documented contraindication to treatment with an anticoagulant reversal agent, documented Comfort Measures Only status prior to coagulopathy reversal decision, length of stay > 120 days, enrolled in a clinical trial that would impact the use of anticoagulant reversal agents, use of anticoagulants other than warfarin, elevated INR not due to warfarin (e.g. liver disease), and patient transferred from another ED where replacement of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors was initiated. The period of assessment is the initial 90 minutes after ED arrival.

### The 2023 WSES guidelines on the management of trauma in elderly and frail patients [^116hZ4ZC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

However, it is recommended as an adjunct treatment in these patients at the dosage of 5–10 mg administered intravenously. In cases of bleeding, vitamin K administration helps replete stores of clotting factors II, IV, IX, and X, thereby increasing the speed of reversal and reducing the INR over 4 h to 6 h for IV infusion and up to 24 h for oral administration. When emergent reversal is required, IV vitamin K should be given with PCC or FFP to prevent rebound because FFP's half-life is 4 h to 6 h whereas the half-life of PCC is dependent on the clotting factors present, ranging from 4 h for factor VII to 60 h for factor II.

A rare and unpredictable but important side effect of intravenous vitamin K is an anaphylactic reaction, in some cases resulting in cardiac arrest, with an incidence of 3 per 100,000 doses via a non-immunoglobulin E (IgE) mechanism, possibly due to the solubiliser in the vitamin K solution. "Overcorrection" of warfarin reversal with additional PCC and vitamin K1 can lead to harm. More than 10 mg vitamin K1 can prevent re-warfarinisation for days and over use of PCC (administration of further PCC when INR is in the normal range) may create a prothrombotic state, which could lead to further thrombosis.

Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) is a hemostatic agent that increases thrombin generation by activating factor X at the site of vascular injury. It should not be used as a single agent to reversal because it is usually not capable of restoring hemostasis. Limited evidence exists regarding the use of rFVIIa for reversal of VKA-related hemorrhage. The actual recommendation is not to use rFVIIa for warfarin reversal unless no other option is available, or in case of failure with previous treatments. Data from a literature review show that the use of rFVIIa as a prothrombotic agent could result in an increased risk of thromboembolic events, especially in elderly patients and when used for off-label indications such as the reversal of anticoagulant agents.

Key Question 4.3

Which reversal protocol is indicated in patients in treatment with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)?

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^116dDj6w]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

FFP contains the missing coagulation factors diluted among all the other constituents of plasma. However, large volumes of FFP are required to replace the missing factors, thus reversal is often not achieved and there are risks of transfusion-associated circulatory overload and TRALI. Indeed a review of 19 studies that included 2878 patients showed that PCC provides more rapid and complete factor replacement for PCC versus FFP, and thromboembolic complications were less frequent in PCC recipients (2.5%) than FFP recipients (6.4%). However, similar poor clinical outcomes were seen in both groups.

Four-factor PCC is administered intravenously in a dose of 25–50 U/kg simultaneously with vitamin K and there are algorithms to calculate the most appropriate dose based on body weight and INR level. A stepwise dosage is recommended, e.g. 25 U/kg if INR is 2–4.0, 35 U/kg if INR is 4–6.0 and 50 U/kg if INR is > 6.0. With difficult i.v. access, intraosseous infusion of PCC has been used with no apparent detrimental effects. After reversal, INR should be monitored regularly over the next week, as a minority of patients take over a week to clear warfarin from their blood and require additional vitamin K. A rare and unpredictable, but important, side effect of i.v. vitamin K is an anaphylactic reaction, which can result in cardiac arrest, with an incidence of 3 per 100,000 doses via a non-immunoglobulin E (IgE) mechanism, possibly due to the solubiliser in the vitamin K solution.

We recommend a 5–10 mg dose of vitamin K because less may not fully correct the INR and conversely more than 10 mg vitamin K 1 can prevent re-warfarinisation for days and may create a prothrombotic state, which could lead to further thromboembolism.

The use of PCC is associated with an increased risk of venous and arterial thrombosis during the recovery period, due to pre-existing risk and possibly the use of PCC itself. In addition, higher incidences of thromboembolic events have been reported in trauma patients with the use of three-factor PCC compared with four-factor PCC. Therefore, in patients who have received PCC, thromboprophylaxis must be considered as early as possible after bleeding has been controlled.

Bleeding risk and management context with elevated international normalized ratio (INR) on warfarin: "The risk of bleeding increases significantly when the INR exceeds 4.5". In patients with mechanical heart valves, adverse events increased from "two per 100 patient-years at INR 2.5 to 4.9, to 4.8 per 100 patient-years for INR 5 to 5.5, then to 7.5 per 100 patient-years for INR ≥ 6.5", and intracerebral bleeding doubled "for every 0.5-s increment in prothrombin time". When supratherapeutic INR occurs without bleeding, strategies include withholding VKA, adjusting VKA dose, or giving vitamin K, and a 2006 meta-analysis found vitamin K "was more likely to reverse overanticoagulation (INR > 4) at 24 h compared with simply withholding VKA".

Vitamin K antagonist maintenance — INR monitoring and isolated out-of-range results are addressed as follows: For patients taking VKA therapy with consistently stable INRs, we suggest an INR testing frequency of up to 12 weeks rather than every 4 weeks (Grade 2B). For patients taking VKAs with previously stable therapeutic INRs who present with a single out-of-range INR of ≤ 0.5 below or above therapeutic, we suggest continuing the current dose and testing the INR within 1 to 2 weeks (Grade 2C). For patients with stable therapeutic INRs presenting with a single subtherapeutic INR value, we suggest against routinely administering bridging with heparin (Grade 2C). For patients taking VKAs, we suggest against routine use of vitamin K supplementation (Grade 2C).

### Vitamin K versus warfarin interruption alone in patients without bleeding and an international normalized ratio > 10 [^111kHxkR]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Reversal of an international normalized ratio (INR) > 10 with vitamin K is recommended in patients experiencing bleeding; however, information on outcomes with reversal using vitamin K in non-bleeding patients is lacking.

Objective

To compare clinical and safety outcomes between non-bleeding patients receiving warfarin with an INR > 10 who did and did not receive a prescription for vitamin K.

Patients/Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in an integrated health-care delivery system. Adult patients receiving warfarin therapy who experienced an INR > 10 without bleeding between 01/01/2006 and 06/30/2018 were included. Patients were assessed for an outpatient dispensing or in-office administration of vitamin K on the day of or the day after an INR > 10 and then clinically relevant bleeding, thromboembolism, all-cause mortality, and time to INR < 4 within the next 30 days.

Results

A total of 809 patients was included with 332 and 477 who were and were not dispensed vitamin K, respectively. Overall, mean patient age was 71.7 years, 60.1% were female and the mean INR was 10.4 at presentation. There were no differences between groups in 30-day rates of bleeding or thromboembolism (both P > .05). Patients dispensed vitamin K had a higher likelihood of mortality (15.1% versus 10.1%, P = 0.032, adjusted odds ratio = 1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 2.57). Overall, time to an INR < 4 was similar between groups.

Conclusion

Vitamin K administration was not associated with improved clinical outcomes in asymptomatic patients with an INR > 10.

### Reversal strategies for vitamin K antagonists in acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^117LvzYw]. Annals of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Around 20% of all intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients are on vitamin K antagonists (VKA), with the incidence of VKA‐ICH increasing as the population grows older. 1 The 3‐month case fatality of the condition is high at 50%. 2, 3, 4 One‐third of ICH patients develop significant early hematoma expansion, 5 and this risk is doubled in VKA‐ICH. 6 Vitamin K takes several hours to initiate sufficient endogenous clotting factor production, so urgent treatments to rapidly replace vitamin K–dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) are widely used, with the aim of limiting further bleeding. Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), recombinant factor VIIa, or combinations of these are used, with practice varying between different centers and countries. 7 Although there is a clear rationale for the use of these agents, none has been conclusively shown to improve outcome after VKA‐ICH.

Evidence from patients with major VKA‐associated bleeding (predominantly gastrointestinal hemorrhage) demonstrates that relative to FFP, PCC normalizes the international normalized ratio (INR) more quickly, reduces the need for red blood cell transfusion, and does not lead to an increase in adverse events. 8, 9 Although PCC is more expensive, it has practical advantages including more rapid administration, smaller infusion volume, and no need for ABO blood type match. This has led to PCC being recommended as a reasonable alternative to FFP in the USA 10 and the first‐line treatment in the United Kingdom. 11 The 2014 European consensus‐based ICH guidelines do not provide a recommendation, citing lack of evidence. 12 Furthermore, different preparations of PCC have different concentrations of the vitamin K–dependent clotting factors, classified as 3‐factor or 4‐factor depending on the concentration of factor VII (FVII). Three‐factor PCCs are widely used in some countries, but may be less effective in correcting the INR than 4‐factor PCC. 13

Although national and international guidelines recommend clotting factor replacement agents for the treatment of VKA‐ICH, there is currently no definite evidence of benefit and no international consensus. Our aim was to utilize the existing international variation in practice to test for an association between the choice of VKA reversal strategy and survival, adjusted for key prognostic factors, in a large population of patients with VKA‐ICH pooled from 16 registries in Europe, North and South America, and Australia.

Key messages

- In the VKA effect reversal, a mean dose of 25 IU/kg PCC appears to be efficacious to achieve a target INR of 1.5.

- Target INR achievement and bleeding control are strong predictors for survival, regardless of hemorrhage site.

- In real-life conditions, management of severe bleeding should be improved with respect to PCC dosing and concomitant vitamin K administration.

- INR monitoring was not in line with French guidelines. The delay between PCC infusion and first INR monitoring should be shortened.

- Bleeding control and target INR achievement were independent predictors of survival.

### Warfarin sodium (Coumadin) [^1169zF6V]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

2.4 Monitoring to Achieve Optimal Anticoagulation

COUMADIN is a narrow therapeutic range (index) drug, and its action may be affected by factors such as other drugs and dietary vitamin K. Therefore, anticoagulation must be carefully monitored during COUMADIN therapy. Determine the INR daily after the administration of the initial dose until INR results stabilize in the therapeutic range. After stabilization, maintain dosing within the therapeutic range by performing periodic INRs. The frequency of performing INR should be based on the clinical situation but generally acceptable intervals for INR determinations are 1 to 4 weeks. Perform additional INR tests when other warfarin products are interchanged with COUMADIN, as well as whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued, or taken irregularly. Heparin, a common concomitant drug, increases the INR [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Determinations of whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for monitoring of COUMADIN therapy.

2.5 Missed Dose

The anticoagulant effect of COUMADIN persists beyond 24 hours. If a patient misses a dose of COUMADIN at the intended time of day, the patient should take the dose as soon as possible on the same day. The patient should not double the dose the next day to make up for a missed dose.

2.6 Intravenous Route of Administration

The intravenous dose of COUMADIN is the same as the oral dose. After reconstitution, COUMADIN for injection should be administered as a slow bolus injection into a peripheral vein over 1 to 2 minutes. COUMADIN for injection is not recommended for intramuscular administration.

Reconstitute the vial with 2.7 mL of Sterile Water for Injection. The resulting yield is 2.5 mL of a 2 mg per mL solution (5 mg total). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if particulate matter or discoloration is noted.

After reconstitution, COUMADIN for injection is stable for 4 hours at room temperature. It does not contain any antimicrobial preservative and, thus, care must be taken to assure the sterility of the prepared solution. The vial is for single use only, and any unused solution should be discarded.

Postinfusion INR values

In total, 159 of 185 (85.9%) patients treated with 4F-PCC had an INR ≤ 1.5 at the first time point, assessed at the end of infusion (mean, 32 minutes; range, 1–151 minutes) compared with only 72 of 184 (39.1%) patients treated with plasma (mean, 54 minutes; range, 1–1250 minutes) (Figure 1 A). Inclusive of infusion times, the INR corrected within 55 minutes after administering 4F-PCC and 209 minutes after administering plasma in these patients.

Postinfusion INR rates. (A) Cumulative frequency distribution of INR values at 30 minutes after infusion and (B) Median INR values after treatment with 4F-PCC or plasma (surgical population).

For the population that underwent surgeries, the mean infusion time for 4F-PCC was 20.9 minutes (range, 7–85 minutes), and the mean infusion volume was 90 mL (range, 48–200 mL). Treatment with 4F-PCC rapidly corrected the INR, from a median baseline value of 2.9 (IQR, 2.3–3.8) to a median of 1.3 (IQR, 1.2–1.6) recorded 30 minutes after the end of the infusion (Figure 1 B). Patients treated with plasma received a mean infusion volume of 819 mL (range, 430–1500 mL) for a mean infusion time of 140.7 minutes (range, 28–590 minutes). Plasma corrected the INR more slowly and incompletely than 4F-PCC (Figure 1 B), from a median baseline value of 2.9 (IQR, 2.5–4.1) to a median value of 1.7 (IQR, 1.5–2.1) recorded 30 minutes after the end of the infusion.

This article concerning the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). It describes the antithrombotic effect of the VKAs, the monitoring of anticoagulation intensity, and the clinical applications of VKA therapy and provides specific management recommendations. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh the risks, burdens, and costs. Grade 2 recommendations suggest that the individual patient's values may lead to different choices. (For a full understanding of the grading, see the "Grades of Recommendation" chapter by Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133:123S-131S.) Among the key recommendations in this article are the following: for dosing of VKAs, we recommend the initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy, with doses between 5 mg and 10 mg for the first 1 or 2 days for most individuals, with subsequent dosing based on the international normalized ratio (INR) response (Grade 1B); we suggest against pharmacogenetic-based dosing until randomized data indicate that it is beneficial (Grade 2C); and in elderly and other patient subgroups who are debilitated or malnourished, we recommend a starting dose of ≤ 5 mg (Grade 1C). The article also includes several specific recommendations for the management of patients with nontherapeutic INRs, with INRs above the therapeutic range, and with bleeding whether the INR is therapeutic or elevated. For the use of vitamin K to reverse a mildly elevated INR, we recommend oral rather than subcutaneous administration (Grade 1A). For patients with life-threatening bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage, we recommend the use of prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant factor VIIa to immediately reverse the INR (Grade 1C). For most patients who have a lupus inhibitor, we recommend a therapeutic target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 1A]. We recommend that physicians who manage oral anticoagulation therapy do so in a systematic and coordinated fashion, incorporating patient education, systematic INR testing, tracking, follow-up, and good patient communication of results and dose adjustments [Grade 1B]. In patients who are suitably selected and trained, patient self-testing or patient self-management of dosing are effective alternative treatment models that result in improved quality of anticoagulation management, with greater time in the therapeutic range and fewer adverse events. Patient self-monitoring or self-management, however, is a choice made by patients and physicians that depends on many factors. We suggest that such therapeutic management be implemented where suitable (Grade 2B).

### Evaluation of response to high-dose intravenous vitamin K administration [^116dgGmE]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Essential to the coagulation pathway, vitamin K (phytonadione) is used to correct clotting factor deficiencies and for reversal of warfarin-induced bleeding. In practice, high-dose intravenous (IV) vitamin K is often used, despite limited evidence supporting repeated dosing.

Objective

This study sought to characterize differences in responders and nonresponders to high-dose vitamin K to guide dosing strategies.

Methods

This was a case-control study of hospitalized adults who received vitamin K 10 mg IV daily for 3 days. Cases were represented by patients who responded to the first dose of IV vitamin K and controls were nonresponders. The primary outcome was change in international normalized ratio (INR) over time with subsequent vitamin K doses. Secondary outcomes included factors associated with response to vitamin K and incidence of safety events. The Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board approved this study.

Results

There were 497 patients included, and 182 were responders. Most patients had underlying cirrhosis (91.5%). In responders, the INR decreased from 1.89 at baseline (95% CI = [1.74–2.04]) to 1.40 on day 3 (95% CI = [1.30–1.50]). In nonresponders, the INR decreased from 1.97 (95% CI = [1.83–2.13]) to 1.85 ([1.72–1.99]). Factors associated with response included lower body weight, absence of cirrhosis, and lower bilirubin. There was a low incidence of safety events observed.

Conclusions

In this study of mainly patients with cirrhosis, the overall adjusted decrease in INR over 3 days was 0.3, which may have minimal clinical impact. Additional studies are needed to identify populations who may benefit from repeated daily doses of high-dose IV vitamin K.

### A comparison of the efficacy and rate of response to oral and intravenous vitamin K in reversal of over-anticoagulation with warfarin [^116a9jAH]. British Journal of Haematology (2001). Low credibility.

The role of oral Vitamin K administration in the reversal of anticoagulation is not yet clear because of a paucity of data on the early effects of treatment, apparent differences in efficacy between preparations and a lack of data comparing oral with intravenous administration. We have compared the effects on the International Normalized Ratio (INR) and activities of the Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX and X at 4 h and 24 h after administration of three oral Vitamin K preparations and of intravenous Vitamin K in 64 anticoagulated patients who required non-urgent partial correction of anticoagulation. Our data confirm that correction of anticoagulation is more rapid after intravenous administration of Vitamin K than after oral administration of similar or larger doses. At 24 h, satisfactory correction of INR can be achieved using low-dose Vitamin K given by either the intravenous or oral route. Our data, and that from previous studies, suggest that there may be differences in efficacy between orally administered products. Administration of Vitamin K by either route was accompanied by changes in the activities of the Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors that reflected their respective biological half-lives. In the 24 h after treatment, the relationship between the INR and the individual Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors was similar to that described previously in stable anticoagulated patients. We conclude that the reversal of anticoagulation with warfarin is achieved more rapidly by intravenous administration of Vitamin K. Satisfactory, but slower, reversal of anticoagulation can be effected using oral Vitamin K, but there may be differences in efficacy between the products tested in our study.

### Reversal of oral anticoagulation in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^114oDMEg]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Agents to be used for reversal treatment have been investigated more thoroughly in general populations with VKA-associated major hemorrhages or acute surgical indications. One randomized phase IIIb, multicenter, open-label, non-inferiority trial, in 202 patients with VKA-associated hemorrhage (only 24 ICH-patients), showed that abnormal coagulation was more rapidly reversed by vitamin K and 4-factor PCC (containing coagulation factors II, VII, IX, X) applied using staggered dosing (INR 2–4: 25 IU/kg BW, INR 4–6: 35 IU/kg BW, INR > 6: 50 IU/kg BW) compared to fresh frozen plasma (FFP dosing, INR 2–4: 10 ml/kg, INR 4–6: 12 ml/kg, INR > 6: 15 ml/kg), i.e. INR ≤ 1.3, achieved by PCC + vitamin K in 62.2% versus FFP + vitamin K in 9.6%. In another phase 3 study (n = 181), patients with an INR ≥ 2.0 and acute indication for surgery using the same dosing approach were randomized to receive either 4-factor PCC at or FFP each combined with vitamin K. In the PCC group, surgery could be started earlier after infusion in the PPC group (median 3.6 h with interquartile range (IQR) 1.9–10.8) compared to the FFP group (median 8.5 IQR, 2.8–18.7; p = 0.01) and the primary outcome of effective hemostasis was achieved more frequently with PCC (PCC 90% versus FF 75%; p = 0.01). Both trials did show no signals regarding an unfavorable safety profile of PCC. In patients with ICH, the randomized controlled INCH trial included patients with VKA-associated ICH and INR levels greater or equal to 2 on hospital admission to compare 4-factor PCC (30 IU/kg BW) versus FFP (20 ml/kg BW) both combined with intravenous vitamin K (10 mg). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an INR ≤ 1.2 within 3 h, and the trial was prematurely stopped after enrolment of 54 patients as HE rates significantly differed between treatments. A significantly larger proportion of PCC-treated patients (67%) compared with FFP (9%) reached the target INR of ≤ 1.2 after 3 h (adj. odds ratio 30.6, 95% CI 4.7–197.9; p = 0.0003). After 24 h, patients in the FFP treatment group had greater increase in ICH volume (absolute ICH volume difference 16.4 mL, 95% CI 2.9–29.9, p = 0.02) and had a fivefold increased risk for HE, defined as a ICH volume increase of greater 33% from initial to follow-up imaging (odds ratio 4.5, 95% CI 1.3–20.4, p = 0.02). Although there was a strong trend towards reduced 90-day mortality (PCC, 19% versus FFP, 35%), it did not reach statistical significance likely related to the small sample size. Importantly, reversal in VKA-associated ICH should be accompanied by simultaneous administration of slow (15–30 min) intravenous infusion of 10 mg vitamin K (25 mL normal saline) to restore intrinsic hepatic carboxylation of clotting factors and to achieve prolonged hemostasis. Taken together, there is convincing evidence to recommend immediate reversal in VKA-associated ICH to INR levels < 1.3 as fast as possible and to favor 4-factor PCC over plasma to influence HE rates and clinical outcomes.

Significance of nontherapeutic INRs — causes and clinical risk — includes that fluctuations may result from inaccuracy in testing, vitamin K intake or absorption/metabolism changes, other drug effects, or noncompliance, and that adverse event rates rise sharply as INR moves outside target range; in a retrospective analysis of 3,000 atrial fibrillation patients, the poorest control group (48% of time in range) had twice the rates of stroke, myocardial infarction, major bleeding, and death compared with the best control group (83% of time in range); although excessively elevated INRs, particularly > 5.0, increase bleeding risk, registry data suggest short-term major bleeding risk is low for a single INR between 5.0 and 9.0, and in a matched cohort of 2,597 warfarin patients a single significant supratherapeutic INR had low 3 months thromboembolism risk (0.4%), with similar rates reported in 294 mechanical heart valve patients.

Until recently, four-factor PCC has not been available in the USA; therefore, three-factor PCC had been used 'off-label' to reverse warfarin. Although a perceived disadvantage of three-factor PCC is the lack of factor VII, proposed advantages compared with four-factor PCC include a lower cost and potentially lower risk of thromboembolic complications. The two formulations of PCC have not, however, been compared to date in a clinical trial. The observational experience with these agents, either alone or in retrospective comparison, is mixed, with some studies suggesting greater efficacy associated with four-factor PCC and others suggesting no difference in efficacy between the two formulations. However, there is a recurring observation among many of these studies that three-factor PCC, which does not provide factor VII replenishment, is less effective at normalizing INR > 4. This may be explained by the fact that only 10–20% level of factor VII activity is required for coagulation, and an INR > 4 reflects factor VII activity under 5–10%. Therefore, three-factor PCC may be sufficient for factor replacement when there is sufficient native factor VII activity (> 10% or INR < 4). Should a patient's baseline INR be > 4, it would be reasonable to administer plasma in addition to three-factor PCC to provide exogenous replacement of factor VII.

Vitamin K: Vitamin K is an important adjunct to warfarin reversal. While factor replacement with either FFP or PCC provides immediate exogenous factor replacement, vitamin K supplementation results in native factor synthesis which will sustain the normalization of coagulation. As the half-lives of factors VII and IX are relatively short compared with the half-life of warfarin, the administration of vitamin K prevents recurrence of coagulopathy following the initial factor replacement and diminishes the need for ongoing exogenous factor replacement. When rapid reversal of warfarin is indicated, intravenous vitamin K is recommended over oral or subcutaneous injection, as it has the fastest onset and results in a lower INR 4–6 hours after infusion. There is a risk of an anaphylactoid reaction with intravenous administration that is related predominately to the rate of administration. A total of 5–10 mg of vitamin K should be diluted in 50 mL of intravenous fluid and given over 20 min. Patients should be monitored during administration.

4 Recent evidence for anticoagulant reversal

To identify any gaps between the available guidelines and currently available clinical evidence, we conducted a search to identify key clinical studies and reviews/metanalyses, focusing on efficacy/safety of non-specific and specific anticoagulation reversal agents for VKAs and DOACs. Key data for all articles are provided in Supplementary Table 1. There is recent evidence that 4F-PCCs effectively reduce INR in patients with VKA-associated bleeding, with TEE rates ranging from 1.8 to 6.5% data from a meta-analysis of PCC use in VKA-associated ICH support these findings. 4F-PCC was shown to reduce INR more effectively compared with 3F-PCC alone, but not compared with 3F-PCC + rFVIIa; however, 4F-PCC has also been associated with a significantly lower rate of TEEs compared with 3F-PCC + rFVIIa. In contrast, one recent retrospective study of emergency department data reported an increased rate of TEEs in patients on warfarin who received 4F-PCC compared with FFP. aPCC appears to be similarly effective to 4F-PCC, and more effective than FFP, in reversing INR in patients with hemorrhage and traumatic ICH, respectively, with no significant different in TEE rate between treatments. One meta-analysis assessed the use of vitamin K for VKA reversal in patients with elevated INR (4.5–10) but no bleeding, concluding that vitamin K administration was not significantly associated with achieving the goal of timely INR reduction in this population.

Vitamin K intake and supplementation during vitamin K antagonist therapy — effects on international normalized ratio (INR) stability are detailed: After low-dose vitamin K, the INR initially decreased and reestablishing a therapeutic INR with increased warfarin dosing took from 2 to 35 days; in a randomized, blinded trial of 70 unstable patients over a 6-month period, vitamin K 150 μg/d reduced INR SD (−0.24 ± 0.14 vs −0.11 ± 0.18; P < .001) and increased time within target INR range (28% ± 20% vs 15% ± 20%; P < .01) vs placebo; in phenprocoumon-treated patients randomized to 100 μg/d vitamin K vs placebo (100 vs 100), vitamin K improved stability with a relative risk for maximal stability of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1–2.7); variable INR was defined as a minimum of three warfarin dose changes or three INRs outside of the therapeutic range in the preceding 6 months.

### Vitamin K: a potential missing link in critical illness-a scoping review [^113KLuJR]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Type of administration

Optimal vitamin K supplementation dosage and timing must be established due to varying synthesis rates of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Repeated intravenous doses of 10 mg of vitamin K were given to ICU patients, with the most significant change after two consecutive doses. A comprehensive review suggests supplementation of at least 1 mg orally daily or 10 mg intravenously weekly in ICU patients but also emphasizes the need for further research. In over-anticoagulation cases, intravenous and oral vitamin K can correct the INR within 24 h. A 10 mg intravenous vitamin K1 dose after 24 h reduced uncarboxylated extrahepatic Gla proteins but did not normalize them. Similarly, in critically ill children with prolonged antibiotic use, no change in vitamin K deficiency was observed after a single weight-dependent dose (0.5 mg/kg, maximum 10 mg) of vitamin K. Additionally, older ICU patients may require higher and prolonged doses of vitamin K. Observational studies propose vitamin K2's superior cardiovascular protection over K1. However, therapeutic trials have also demonstrated similar effects with vitamin K1. Recent animal research has demonstrated that vitamin K2 is a potential therapeutic option for acute lung injury. It may alleviate acute lung injury by regulating inflammation, apoptosis, ferroptosis, and elastin degradation. This may be due to the longer half-life of vitamin K2.

Vitamin K in the non-bleeding critically ill patient

While commonly used to correct elevated INR preoperatively, vitamin K is not routinely recommended for non-bleeding critically ill patients. In some cases, intravenous vitamin K supplementation is administered to patients with prolonged prothrombin complex (PT-INR) time, even without using vitamin antagonists or non-liver failure. Intravenous supplementation of vitamin K1 can shorten PT time and increase vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor activity and thrombin formation. In normal physiological conditions, vitamin K supplementation primarily targets the enhancement of extrahepatic carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent proteins. VKOR activity is three times higher in vascular smooth muscle cells than in hepatocytes, possibly because vitamin K is transported to the liver very efficiently. This may elucidate the limited impact of vitamin K supplementation on PT-INR values observed in ICU patients and explain the presence of non-carboxylated forms of MGP and OC in non-supplemented adults.

### Guideline-concordant administration of prothrombin complex concentrate and vitamin K is associated with decreased mortality in patients with severe bleeding under vitamin K antagonist treatment (EPAHK study) [^1127bqjG]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

In developed countries, up to 2% of the general population receives chronic oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKA). The rate of severe bleeding complications is above 3.8% per person-year and the associated mortality rate ranges between 10 to 60%, especially in case of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), in the first week following the onset of the hemorrhage. In case of severe hemorrhage, the two main predictors of poor prognosis are over anticoagulation, that is, an international normalized ratio (INR) above the therapeutic range, and late VKA reversal (over eight hours after presentation).

For several decades the evidence supporting appropriate clinical use of VKA antidotes has remained scarce. In a recent randomized clinical trial, Sarode et al. demonstrated the superiority of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) versus fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to normalize coagulation within one hour (62.2 versus 9.6%; P < 0.05). The role of vitamin K in association with PCC, in maintaining the normalized coagulation over six hours has been emphasized. The importance of rapid hemorrhage control has led international guidelines to recommend the use of PCC rather than FFP. For complete VKA reversal, all guidelines recommend an infusion of PCC (at least 20 IU/kg factor IX equivalent) related to admission INR value in combination with at least 5 mg of vitamin K to rapidly achieve a post-reversal INR ≤ 1.5 and maintain a normal coagulation profile over six hours. So as to save time, French guidelines suggest, on the basis of a previous study, the possibility of administering a probabilistic single-regimen dose of 25 IU/kg of PCC and 10 mg of vitamin K as soon as a severe hemorrhage is diagnosed. In all situations, post-reversal INR must be measured 30 minutes after the infusion to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment and make any necessary adjustments thereafter, and measured six hours later to control the efficacy of vitamin K. French guidelines were published in 2008 and have become a standard of care for the management of these patients in France. Treatment time frames were not specified in the international guidelines and the effect of early reversal on mortality has not been studied. At a time when new oral anticoagulant agents without specific antidotes are emerging as promising alternatives to VKAs, it appears important to better define the prognosis benefit of anticoagulant reversal in the management of patients on oral anticoagulants with severe hemorrhage.

### End of study transition from study drug to open-label vitamin K antagonist therapy: the ROCKET AF experience [^1175Fr29]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2013). Low credibility.

Background

To evaluate the previously reported excess of thromboembolic events during the 30 days after the end of study (EOS) visit when participants transitioned from blinded therapy to open-label vitamin K antagonist.

Methods and Results

At the EOS visit, open-label vitamin K antagonist was recommended, and the international normalized ratio (INR) was not to be measured until 3 days later to preserve blinding. We analyzed transition strategies, clinical outcomes, and INR values. Event rates are per 100 patient-years. A total of 9248 (65%) participants were taking study drug at EOS, and, between days 3 and 30, an excess of stroke and systemic embolic events were observed in participants assigned to rivaroxaban (rivaroxaban 22 events, event rate 6.42; warfarin 6 events, event rate 1.73; hazard ratio, 3.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.51–9.16; P = 0.0044). No INR values were reported for ≈5% of participants transitioned to warfarin. By 30 days after EOS, 83% of the warfarin group and 52% of the rivaroxaban group had ≥ 1 therapeutic INR value. Median time to first therapeutic INR was 3 days in the warfarin group and 13 days in the rivaroxaban group.

Conclusions

The excess of events at EOS was likely because of a period of inadequate anticoagulation in rivaroxaban participants switched to vitamin K antagonist therapy. If transition from rivaroxaban to vitamin K antagonist is needed, timely monitoring and careful dosing should be used to ensure consistent and adequate anticoagulation.

### Clinical performance measures for neurocritical care: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^117Lnhsw]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Coagulopathy reversal in intracerebral hemorrhage — rationale states that in intracerebral hemorrhage, coagulopathy due to vitamin K antagonists (VKA; principally warfarin) is a significant risk factor for hematoma expansion and poorer outcomes, and that these risks can be mitigated by the timely correction of the elevated INR and anticoagulant effect using prothrombin complex concentrates or fresh frozen plasma. Acceptable intravenous Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors to meet this measure are prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) which is preferred, although fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is also acceptable, and while some data suggest that PCC is superior to FFP, the level of evidence is considered insufficient to mandate its use. Intravenous Vitamin K must be given to meet this measure, but it is not sufficient as monotherapy for warfarin-induced coagulopathy, and a specific time frame for vitamin K administration is not delineated. Recombinant factor VIIa is not guideline-recommended and is not acceptable to meet this measure.

### Improved oral anticoagulation after a dietary vitamin k-guided strategy: a randomized controlled trial [^113XNSma]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary vitamin K is thought to be an important factor that interferes with anticoagulation stability, but the clinical applicability of this interaction has not been evaluated adequately in prospective studies.

Methods and Results

In a randomized controlled trial that enrolled outpatients with a recent international normalized ratio (INR) outside the therapeutic target, we compared 2 strategies to optimize long-term oral anticoagulation: (1) a conventional approach based on changes in anticoagulant prescription and (2) a dietary vitamin K-guided strategy based on simple modifications of the amount of vitamin K-rich foods ingested per week. The primary efficacy end point was the percentage of patients who achieved a prespecified INR target at 90 days after randomization. Study population (n = 132) predominantly included men with mechanical heart prostheses (58%) or atrial fibrillation (35%). Over time, patients allocated to the vitamin K-guided strategy reached the prespecified INR more frequently so that after 90 days of follow-up, 74% were on target compared with 58% of patients managed conventionally (P = 0.04). Patients allocated to the dietary vitamin K-guided strategy had the same magnitude and direction of INR variation as those observed with the conventional approach in the short term (15 days) for both underanticaogulated and overanticoagulated patients. Minor bleeding or use of parenteral vitamin K were also marginally less frequent in patients managed according to the dietary intervention (1 [1.5%] versus 7 [11%]; P = 0.06).

Conclusions

A vitamin K-guided management strategy to adjust long-term oral anticoagulation is feasible and safe and may result in an increased chance of reaching target levels of INR.

### Oral anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116aPtzG]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy — international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring frequency is outlined for inpatient and outpatient care, with randomized and observational data on testing intervals: In hospitalized patients, INR monitoring is usually performed daily until the therapeutic range has been achieved and maintained for at least 2 consecutive days, and in outpatients starting VKA therapy, initial monitoring may be reduced to once every few days until a stable dose response has been achieved. When the INR response is stable, the frequency of testing can be reduced to intervals as long as every 4 to 6 weeks (or possibly longer in particularly stable patients). In a randomized comparison of monitoring intervals in stable mechanical valve patients, there were no differences of time in, above, or below range between 6‑week and 4‑week groups, with actual monitoring intervals of 24.9 days vs 22.5 days (P < .0003). In a retrospective cohort of > 4,000 patients with chronic AF and > 250,000 INRs, time in range increased as the interval decreased from every 5 weeks or more to every 3 weeks (41% to 45%, P < .0005), and investigators suggested that patients should be monitored at time intervals no longer than every 3 weeks; however, the strength of this recommendation is reduced by the very poor TTR reported in both arms of the study.

### The pharmacology and management of the vitamin K antagonists: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^115mGq71]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This article concerning the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. The article describes the antithrombotic effect of VKAs, the monitoring of anticoagulation intensity, the clinical applications of VKA therapy, and the optimal therapeutic range of VKAs, and provides specific management recommendations. Grade 1 recommendations are strong, and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh the risks, burdens, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient's values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this article are the following: for dosing of VKAs, we suggest the initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy with doses between 5 and 10 mg for the first 1 or 2 days for most individuals, with subsequent dosing based on the international normalized ratio (INR) response (Grade 2B). In the elderly and in other patient subgroups with an elevated bleeding risk, we suggest a starting dose at ≤ 5 mg (Grade 2C). We recommend basing subsequent doses after the initial two or three doses on the results of INR monitoring (Grade 1C). The article also includes several specific recommendations for the management of patients with INRs above the therapeutic range and for patients requiring invasive procedures. For example, in patients with mild to moderately elevated INRs without major bleeding, we suggest that when vitamin K is to be given it be administered orally rather than subcutaneously (Grade 1A). For the management of patients with a low risk of thromboembolism, we suggest stopping warfarin therapy approximately 4 days before they undergo surgery (Grade 2C). For patients with a high risk of thromboembolism, we suggest stopping warfarin therapy approximately 4 days before surgery, to allow the INR to return to normal, and beginning therapy with full-dose unfractionated heparin or full-dose low-molecular-weight heparin as the INR falls (Grade 2C). In patients undergoing dental procedures, we suggest the use of tranexamic acid mouthwash (Grade 2B) or epsilon amino caproic acid mouthwash without interrupting anticoagulant therapy (Grade 2B) if there is a concern for local bleeding. For most patients who have a lupus inhibitor, we suggest a therapeutic target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 2B]. In patients with recurrent thromboembolic events with a therapeutic INR or other additional risk factors, we suggest a target INR of 3.0 (range, 2.5 to 3.5) [Grade 2C]. As models of anticoagulation monitoring and management, we recommend that clinicians incorporate patient education, systematic INR testing, tracking, and follow-up, and good communication with patients concerning results and dosing decisions (Grade 1C+).

Vitamin K — onset is more than 12 hours and impact on prothrombin time is typically minor; a 10-mg oral tablet or 10-mg IV should be given, and IV dosing carries risk of anaphylaxis; absent an improvement in INR after a 10-mg dose, repeated administration is unlikely to have therapeutic benefit; there are a paucity of data to guide identification of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis who may benefit, as well as optimal dosing and route of administration.

### Management of excessive anticoagulant effect due to vitamin K antagonists [^114Nf4wu]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2008). Low credibility.

Unexpectedly elevated INR values are commonly encountered in clinical practice. In the absence of bleeding, such values may be treated with either simple warfarin withdrawal or the administration of low doses of oral vitamin K. Oral vitamin K will more rapidly return the INR to the therapeutic reference interval; however, its impact on bleeding is unknown. If the INR is in excess of 10, most experts would recommend the administration of vitamin K and, in the case of active bleeding, additional administration of coagulation factors either in the form of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC). Coagulation factor replacement is required given the need to urgently correct the INR; however, vitamin K should not be forgotten since it is required to antagonize the effect of warfarin, preventing "rebound" anticoagulation after transfused coagulation factors are consumed. This paper will review the evidence supporting various treatment modalities and will provide suggestions for treatment. Future advances in this area will likely focus on evaluations of the relative merits of FFP and PCCs.

Phytonadione (vitamin K1) for warfarin-associated coagulopathy — route, time course, and safety: Low doses of phytonadione can be administered orally with temporary warfarin interruption in patients not requiring urgent reversal, and when given this way approximately 1.4 days are required for an INR between 6 and 10 to decline to < 4.0; when administered intravenously, low doses produce similar INR reductions at 24 h, while subcutaneous administration appears less effective than low-dose oral phytonadione. For bleeding patients at higher doses, intravenously administered phytonadione works more rapidly, with reduction of the INR beginning within 2 h and correction to within the normal range generally achieved within 24 h if hepatic function is normal and if a sufficiently large dose is given; at 24 h, 5 mg oral and 1 mg IV vitamin K produce similar effects on the INR. IV phytonadione may cause anaphylactoid reactions with a true frequency about three per 10,000 doses administered, and to minimize risk vitamin K should be mixed in a minimum of 50 mL of intravenous fluid and administered, using an infusion pump, over a minimum of 20 min.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) reversal by interruption — expected INR decline: Interruption of VKAs may be sufficient in patients who need an elective invasive procedure or in asymptomatic patients with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and a low risk for bleeding, and it takes approximately 2.5 days for an INR between 6.0 and 10.0 to decline to < 4.0; with acenocoumarol, the decline is probably no more than 1 day for most patients, phenprocoumon will probably result in a much slower decline, and fluindione is similar to warfarin so a similar decline should be expected.

### Guideline for reversal of antithrombotics in intracranial hemorrhage: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society and Society of Critical Care Medicine [^117QQqiN]. Neurocritical Care (2016). Medium credibility.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) reversal — We recommend repeating INR testing soon after PCC administration (15–60 min), and serially every 6–8 h for the next 24–48 h, with subsequent treatment guided by follow-up INR and awareness that repeat PCC dosing may increase thrombotic complications and risk of DIC. If the repeat INR is still elevated ≥ 1.4 within the first 24–48 h after initial PCC dosing, we suggest further correction with FFP. We recommend against administration of rFVIIa for the reversal of VKA. If PCCs are not available or contraindicated, alternative treatment is recommended over no treatment and treatment choice may be guided by available therapies and patient-specific factors. Treatment with FFP and Vitamin K is recommended over no treatment, and we suggest initial or further treatment of anticoagulation reversal using FFP (rather than no treatment), along with one dose of vitamin K 10 mg IV.

### Warfarin reversal in anticoagulant-associated intracerebral hemorrhage [^112isUZo]. Neurocritical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Anticoagulant-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disease, causing death in half of patients and permanent disability in the majority of survivors. The finding that patients often continue bleeding after hospital presentation offers the possibility that emergency warfarin reversal may improve outcomes. As no clinical trials have demonstrated the superiority of any one treatment strategy, various treatment options are available. Intravenous vitamin K is the definitive therapy; however, as monotherapy it can require many hours to take effect. Therefore, it is often considered an adjunct agent. Coagulation factors can be repleted with fresh frozen plasma (FFP), which is widely available and relatively low cost, but can require substantial time to deliver in real-world settings. A number of coagulation factor products collectively termed prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) are widely available that can rapidly provide many or all the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Recombinant activated factor VII is used in many centers for this purpose, as it is thought to provide a procoagulant effect that may compensate for the lack of the other critical factors. Until clinical trials demonstrate the superiority of any one means of warfarin reversal, a number of expert guidelines from national organizations are available to help local providers guide therapy. At our institution, we have focused on improving the rapid and reliable delivery of a combination of intravenous vitamin K and FFP, with continued re-dosing until the desired INR lowering is achieved.

### Short-term warfarin reversal for elective surgery – using low-dose intravenous vitamin K: safe, reliable and convenient* [^113brdJW]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Peri-procedural management of warfarin reflects an intricate balance between the restoration of haemostasis and appropriate thromboprophylaxis. This prospective single-arm study assessed the safety and efficacy of a convenient schedule, incorporating low-dose intravenous vitamin K (vitK(IV)) for short-term warfarin reversal prior to elective surgery, as well as vitK-dependent factor levels (vitK-Factors) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) pre- and post-vitK(IV). One seventy eight patients on long-term warfarin received 3mg vitK(IV) 12–18h pre-procedure with no adverse reactions. 167/178 (94%) achieved an INR ≤ 1.5 post-vitK(IV) on the day of surgery, while all achieved INR ≤ 1.7. Four patients had procedure-associated major bleeding, but importantly had achieved a pre-procedure INR < 1.5 and vitK-Factors > 0.30iu/ml. No patient suffered a symptomatic thromboembolism during the 6-week follow-up. Median days to re-establish a therapeutic INR were 4 (range 2–11). VitK(IV) near normalized all vitK-Factors, with a uniform pattern of depletion and repletion in association with an increase and decrease in INR, respectively; and from the data, INR < 1.5 correlated with vitK-Factors > 0.30iu/ml. Low-dose vitK(IV) for short-term warfarin reversal was reliable and safe, and successfully lowered the INR to an acceptable level for planned surgery, with no excess of bleeding, thromboembolism, delayed discharge, or resistance to warfarin. The protocol was simple and convenient for both the patients and the healthcare institution.

Vitamin K for vitamin K antagonist (VKA) reversal — route, dose, and safety are described as follows: reversal is expedited with the intravenous route, and administration of Vitamin K as a single, large dose (10 mg IV) is preferred over divided dosing. Anaphylactoid reactions are more common with intravenous administration; however, the incidence is only 3 per 10,000 doses, and reducing the infusion rate may reduce the risk, although this is controversial.

Study Protocol

On Day 1, patients received an IV infusion of 4F‐PCC or plasma, dosed according to baseline INR and body weight as shown in Table S1 (see Data Supplement S1, available as supporting information in the online version of this paper). All patients were also to receive vitamin K, which was administered according to American College of Chest Physicians guidelines (2008) 12 or local practice if different (2–10 mg). Vitamin K administration was not standardized in the protocol due to variations in local practice and guidelines.

Data Analysis

Safety Analysis

Adverse events. AEs defined as symptoms that developed or worsened following exposure to the study product, were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 12.0). Further details of the AE definition can be found in the Supplementary Methods in Data Supplement S1. AEs were categorized as either "serious" or "nonserious". We used the standard definition of serious AEs (SAEs) (Supplementary Methods, Data Supplement S1). Study investigators reported AEs up to day 10 (visit window days 7–11) and SAEs up to day 45 (visit window days 43–51). AEs were identified as possible thromboembolic events using the following standardized MedDRA queries (SMQs): embolic and thromboembolic events, arterial; embolic and thromboembolic events, venous; and embolic and thromboembolic events, vessel type unspecified and mixed arterial and venous. Data on fluid overload and similar cardiac events were collected utilizing the following SMQs: fluid overload, pulmonary edema, cardiac failure congestive, cardiac failure, and cardiac failure chronic.

### Parenteral anticoagulants: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116n4iiB]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Direct thrombin inhibitor monitoring and transition to vitamin K antagonists note that although the aPTT is used to monitor therapy with direct thrombin inhibitors, this test is not ideal, and the ecarin clotting time yields a more linear dose-response but is not widely available and has not been standardized. All of the direct thrombin inhibitors increase the international normalized ratio (INR), and when given in therapeutic doses, argatroban has the greatest effect on the INR, which complicates transition from argatroban to vitamin K antagonists; to overcome this problem, the INR can be measured after stopping the argatroban infusion for several hours. Because holding argatroban may expose patients to a risk of thrombosis, another option is to monitor the vitamin K antagonist with a chromogenic factor X assay, and in this setting, factor X levels < 45% have been associated with INR values > 2 when the effect of argatroban has been eliminated. Monitoring factor X levels may be safer than aiming for an INR ≥ 4 when vitamin K antagonists are given in conjunction with argatroban.

### A review of guidelines on anticoagulation reversal across different clinical scenarios-is there a general consensus? [^116aoit1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

3.2.1.1. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).

The European Stroke Organisation guideline recommends PCC at 30 IU/kg (along with vitamin K) for VKA reversal in ICH without distinguishing between 3- and 4-factor products. The Neurocritical Care Society and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (NCS/SCCM), recommend discontinuation of VKAs and administration of vitamin K at a dose of 10 mg intravenously (IV) in cases of ICH. Furthermore, these guidelines indicate the limited utility of FFP-based strategies in ICH due to the prolonged time to INR reversal, and acknowledge the low cost of FFP and its use in circumstances where PCCs are contraindicated (e.g. allergies or known adverse reaction to PCCs or their components). Treatment with FFP and vitamin K is recommended only if no other treatments are available. FFP should be administered at 10–20 mL/kg IV in combination with one dose of vitamin K 10 mg IV. The NCS/SCCM guidelines recommend 4F-PCC over 3F-PCC, with co-administration of vitamin K generally advised to ensure durable INR reversal. Initial reversal with PCCs alone rather than use in combination with FFP or recombinant Factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is also recommended. The dose of PCC should be weight-based and vary according to admission INR and type of PCC used.

Due to low-quality evidence and its association with thrombosis, rFVIIa is currently not recommended for VKA reversal in patients presenting with ICH (Table 2). Furthermore, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines state that although rFVIIa administration rapidly reduces INR, it may not restore thrombin generation effectively as it does not replenish all of the vitamin-K dependent factors.

### Elevated international normalized ratio from vitamin K supplement discontinuation [^112FojEL]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of a critically elevated international normalized ratio (INR) following discontinuation of a vitamin K supplement in a patient receiving warfarin.

Case Summary

A 64-year-old man with atrial fibrillation received warfarin for primary stroke prevention. He was initiated on low-dose vitamin K supplementation therapy secondary to a high level of INR variability. The patient was stabilized on this therapy for approximately 9 months with a mean INR of 2.02 and a warfarin dose ranging from 6.5 to 7.5 mg/week. At a visit with his primary care physician, the patient's INR was subtherapeutic at 1.5. He had not been taking his vitamin K supplement for nearly a week, but had not missed any doses of warfarin. The vitamin K supplement was discontinued and his warfarin dose was increased by 14.3%. Nearly 2 weeks later the patient presented with a critically elevated INR of 8.5, but no acute bleeding. No other factors affecting the INR could be determined. After a dose of 2.5 mg of vitamin K was administered and warfarin was withheld for 2 days, the patient's INR returned to 2.9. Low-dose vitamin K supplementation and warfarin at a lower dose of 7 mg/week were restarted. His INR remained relatively stable, with no ensuing critical INR changes or other sequelae.

Discussion

Vitamin K supplement removal was believed to be a major contributor to the critically elevated INR. While the warfarin dose had been increased according to the clinic protocol (14.3% for an INR of 1.5), the timing of the INR elevation following supplement removal follows pharmacodynamic expectations of clotting factor synthesis. This case is labeled a category D error.

Conclusions

Discontinuation of vitamin K supplementation therapy might result in elevation of INR.

### Oral vitamin K lowers the international normalized ratio more rapidly than subcutaneous vitamin K in the treatment of warfarin-associated coagulopathy. A randomized, controlled trial [^111rpkVU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Excessive anticoagulation due to warfarin use is associated with hemorrhage. Subcutaneously administered vitamin K has not been evaluated for the treatment of warfarin-associated coagulopathy, yet it is widely used.

Objective

To show that oral vitamin K is more effective than subcutaneous vitamin K in the treatment of warfarin-associated coagulopathy.

Design

Randomized, controlled trial.

Setting

Two teaching hospitals.

Patients

Patients with an international normalized ratio (INR) between 4.5 and 10.0.

Intervention

Warfarin therapy was withheld, and 1 mg of vitamin K was given orally or subcutaneously.

Measurements

The primary outcome measure was the INR on the day after administration of vitamin K. Secondary outcome measures were hemorrhage and thrombosis during a 1-month follow-up period.

Results

15 of 26 patients receiving oral vitamin K and 6 of 25 patients receiving subcutaneous vitamin K had therapeutic INRs on the day after study drug administration (P = 0.015; odds ratio, 4.32 [95% CI, 1.13 to 17.44]).

Conclusion

Oral vitamin K lowers INR more rapidly than subcutaneous vitamin K in asymptomatic patients who have supratherapeutic INR values while receiving warfarin.

### INR response to low-dose vitamin K in warfarin patients [^113ASnFW]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Literature suggests that 2 mg of vitamin K intravenously (IV) provides a similar effect as 10 mg to reverse warfarin. Doses < 5 mg haven't been studied in depth.

Objective

The objective was to determine the international normalized ratio (INR) reduction effect of ultra low-dose (ULD) IV vitamin K.

Methods

This retrospective, observational cohort study compared IV vitamin K doses of 0.25–0.5 mg (ULD) versus 1–2 mg (standard low dose [SLD]). The primary outcome assessed ΔINR at 36 hours; secondary outcomes assessed ΔINR at 12 hours and 30-day venous thromboembolism (VTE) and mortality rates.

Results

Of 88 patients identified (median baseline INR [IQR], 5.1 [3.1, 7.3] vs 4.5 [2.8, 8.2], ULD vs SLD, respectively), 59 had an INR at 12 hours. The ULD had fewer 12-hour INR values < 2, with no statistical difference in the ΔINR at 12 hours between the ULD and SLD cohorts (median ΔINR, 2.2 [1.1, 3.4] vs 2.2 [1.1, 6.3]; P = 0.54; median INR, 2.3 vs 1.8). A total of 41 patients had both a 12- and 36-hour INR. No significant difference in the ΔINR between the 12- and 36-hour values occurred (median ΔINR, 0.52 [0.2, 0.91] vs ΔINR, 0.46 [0.18, 0.55]; P = 0.61), suggesting no rebound or excessive reversal and no difference in 30-day rates of VTE (P > 0.99) or death (P = 0.38).

Conclusion and Relevance

ULD IV vitamin K reversed INR similarly to doses of 1–2 mg without rebound. A ULD strategy may be considered in patients requiring more cautious reversal.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^116eWgBY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (warfarin) reversal — Several options exist for reversal of VKAs, including administration of vitamin K, PCCs, and plasma; vitamin K can be given orally, subcutaneously, or intravenously, and slow intravenous administration (in 25 to 50 mL normal saline over 15 to 30 minutes) effects a more predictable and rapid reduction in the INR (4 to 6 hours) compared with oral (18 to 24 hours), although the administration of vitamin K does not result in immediate correction of coagulopathy and for a major bleed warranting reversal must be accompanied by a repletion strategy (if 4F-PCC is unavailable, PCCs or plasma may be used). PCCs contain purified vitamin K-dependent clotting factors; nonactivated 3-factor PCCs contain FII, FIX, and FX with negligible FVII, protein C, and S, whereas nonactivated 4F-PCCs contain FII, FVII, FIX, FX, and proteins C and S, and only 4F-PCCs are licensed for rapid VKA reversal. For VKA reversal, 4F-PCCs are dosed on the basis of INR and body weight (INR 2 to < 4 at 25 U/kg, INR 4 to 6 at 35 U/kg, and INR > 6 at 50 U/kg; max dose 5,000 units capped at 100 kg body weight), and per unit volume 4F-PCCs contain approximately 25 times (25 U/mL) the concentration of vitamin K-dependent factors as compared with plasma (1 U/mL); therefore, PCC can be given in a much smaller volume at a much faster infusion rate (8×) compared with plasma and is preferred.

### Low-dose oral vitamin K is safe and effective for outpatient management of patients with an INR > 10 [^115uunTR]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Low-dose oral vitamin K effectively returns an international normalized ratio (INR) between 4.5 and 10.0 to an INR of 2.0–3.0 within 24 h in about 70% of patients. However, the efficacy of oral vitamin K for the treatment of higher INR values has only been studied in one small randomized trial. Treatment of markedly prolonged INR values with low-dose oral vitamin K is attractive because it has the potential to greatly simplify the management of such patients.

Methods

In our tertiary care anticoagulation clinic patients with an INR of more than 10 were managed as outpatients with simple warfarin withdrawal and, where feasible, low-dose (2 mg) oral vitamin K. Only patients with additional complications such as bleeding or unexplained symptoms were admitted to hospital.

Results

Eighty-five patients had 89 episodes of an INR value of more than 10.0. Fourteen patients were admitted to the hospital for management. In the other 75 episodes patients were managed as outpatients by warfarin withdrawal. In 24 episodes patients did not receive vitamin K. In 51 episodes patients were also given oral vitamin K. None of the patients given oral vitamin K experienced bleeding requiring medical intervention (95% confidence interval (CI) 0–6%). In contrast there were three clinically important bleeding episodes amongst the patients managed with simple warfarin withdrawal (95% CI 0–34%). Patients given vitamin K were also more likely to have an INR < 5 by day 3 than those managed by withdrawal of warfarin alone. Two patients admitted to hospital and given intravenous vitamin K at higher doses became temporarily refractory to anticoagulation while there were no such complications in those treated with low-dose oral vitamin K.

Conclusion

Low-dose (2 mg) oral vitamin K, coupled with temporary warfarin discontinuation, appears to be a safe and effective treatment for severe warfarin associated coagulopathy in non-bleeding patients.

Vitamin K antagonist reversal — We recommend repeating INR testing soon after PCC administration (15–60 min), and serially every 6–8 hours for the next 24–48 hours, with consideration that repeat PCC dosing may lead to increased thrombotic complications and risk of DIC; if the repeat INR is still elevated greater than or equal to 1.4 within the first 24–48 hours after initial PCC dosing, we suggest further correction with FFP; we recommend against administration of rFVIIa for the reversal of VKA; if PCCs are not available or contraindicated, alternative treatment is recommended over no treatment, with treatment with FFP and vitamin K recommended over no treatment and we suggest dosing FFP at 10–15 mL/kg IV along with one dose of vitamin K 10 mg IV.

### Guideline on the management of bleeding in patients on antithrombotic agents [^1135Nc6p]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for bleeding in patients on antithrombotics, more specifically with respect to supratherapeutic INR without bleeding, BSH 2013 guidelines recommend to administer 1–5 mg of oral vitamin K in asymptomatic patients with an INR > 8.0. Obtain a follow-up INR the following day in case an additional dose of vitamin K is required.

### International normalized ratio versus plasma levels of coagulation factors in patients on vitamin K antagonist therapy [^113BG1iE]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Context

The key question when managing patients on warfarin therapy who present with life-threatening bleeding is how to use the international normalized ratio (INR) to best direct corrective therapy. The corollary question for the clinical laboratory is at what level will the INR reflect a critical value that requires notifying the clinician.

Objective

To determine the levels of vitamin K-dependent factors over a range of INR values.

Design

Evaluation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor levels on plasma remnants from patients in whom a prothrombin time and INR was ordered to monitor warfarin therapy. There were a total of 83 specimens evaluated with an INR range from 1.0 to 8.26.

Results

The mean activity levels of all 4 factors remained near or above 50% when the INR was less than 1.5. The average factor X level was 23% when the INR range was 1.6 to 2.5, but levels of factors II, VII, and IX did not drop below the hemostatic range until the INR was greater than 2.5. At an INR of 3.6 or more, the activity levels of all 4 factors were less than 30% in more than 90% of the specimens.

Conclusion

Levels of factors II, VII, IX, and X declined with increasing INR but not at the same rate and not to the same level at a given INR. However, most of the values were below the hemostatic value once the INR was 3.6 or more, the level that was also considered critical for physician notification.

### Fixed-versus variable-dose prothrombin complex concentrate for the emergent reversal of vitamin K antagonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1166nR5p]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

VKA Reversal for ICH

ICH in the setting of VKA use is associated with a high mortality. Subgroup analysis based on indication for VKA reversal (ICH or non-ICH) revealed few significant differences between fixed- and variable-dose regimens in the ICH subgroup. There is moderate-certainty evidence suggesting that using a fixed-dose regimen in ICH leads to a reduction in 4-PCC administration time ("order-to-needle" time) compared with a variable-dose, with an equivalent rate of achieving the goal INR less than 2 and a nearly identical proportion of patients achieving clinical hemostasis. However, there is low-certainty evidence indicating that the fixed-dose approach falls short in achieving the goal INR less than 1.5 (80% vs. 89%). A fixed-dose strategy may also contribute to a reduction TEEs (moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence regarding mortality differences between fixed- and variable-dose regimens in ICH patients is uncertain.

Defining 4-PCC Outcome Endpoints

The optimal INR goal in the setting of VKA-related hemorrhage remains unknown. The primary INR endpoints for previously published studies of 4-PCC in the treatment of VKA-related hemorrhage have therefore varied. Several studies chose an arbitrary INR, ranging from 1.3 up to 2.0. In contrast, only five studies incorporated clinical hemostasis as an outcome, either with or without a specific INR goal. All of these were cohort studies, three of which evaluated clinical homeostatic efficacy as a primary endpoint instead of a specific INR. In the overall analysis and across all subgroups, the fixed-dose regimen demonstrated superior clinical hemostasis compared with the variable-dose, except for ICH subgroup, where there was minimal difference (76.8% vs. 77.4%). Importantly, the fixed-dose regimen exhibited superior safety outcomes, suggesting that achieving clinical hemostasis or an INR less than 2 may be sufficient in most cases. Future studies are needed to better define optimal goals for VKA reversal using 4-PCC.
