## Question

can you summarise this research?

https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201628

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a summary of the research from the provided URL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about verifying the exact article identity and scope. Then, I should extract the key clinical domains and structure the summary logically. Next, I will verify the strength of evidence and cite appropriately. Finally, I will synthesize practical takeaways and note limitations or uncertainties that affect clinical translation.

> Let me first confirm the article identity and scope. Wait, let me verify the URL and content match. The link corresponds to a Nature Reviews Disease Primers article on Ménière's disease, not Parkinson's disease, so I should correct that assumption upfront and proceed with the correct topic. The primer covers pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, quality of life, and prevention, and it emphasizes that endolymphatic hydrops is a characteristic pathologic finding, though symptoms can precede overt hydrops in some patients, which is an important nuance for diagnosis and staging [^3fb72409].

> I will now examine the core clinical syndrome and pathophysiology. Ménière's disease presents with episodic vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness, with endolymphatic hydrops as the underlying mechanism causing ganglion cell injury. Hold on, I should verify the timing of symptoms relative to hydrops; the primer notes that symptoms can appear after considerable endolymph accumulation, but some patients develop symptoms earlier, which helps explain variability in disease expression and the need for longitudinal assessment in suspected cases [^3fb72409].

> Next, I should review diagnostic criteria and the role of ancillary testing. Diagnosis remains clinical, based on characteristic symptom clusters, but I need to check which functional tests meaningfully support it. Audiometry, vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials, caloric testing, electrocochleography, and head impulse testing can complement clinical assessment, while MRI has been optimized to visualize endolymphatic hydrops and is transitioning from research to clinical use, which can be decisive in equivocal cases. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; MRI is helpful but not universally required, and clinical judgment still governs diagnosis in most patients [^3fb72409].

> Now, I will consider management principles and staging. First-line care is conservative, focusing on risk-factor modification and lifestyle measures, with escalation to intratympanic gentamicin or endolymphatic sac decompression if vertigo remains refractory. I should double-check the strength of evidence; the primer notes that therapeutic options are based on empirical evidence rather than high-certainty randomized trials, which underscores the need to individualize decisions and counsel patients about uncertain benefit. Let me reconsider the sequence: conservative therapy is prioritized, and ablative or surgical options are reserved for persistent, disabling vertigo despite optimized medical therapy [^3fb72409].

> I need to ensure I address quality of life and prevention. The primer highlights that vertigo attacks and chronic symptoms substantially impair quality of life, and prevention centers on trigger avoidance, salt restriction, and stress management, with patient education to recognize prodromal symptoms and intervene early. But wait, what if patients have atypical features or bilateral disease? In those scenarios, multidisciplinary care and longitudinal follow-up are prudent to monitor disease progression and treatment response [^3fb72409].

> Let me synthesize the key takeaways. Ménière's disease is a clinically defined inner-ear disorder with endolymphatic hydrops as the pathophysiologic hallmark, characterized by episodic vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. Diagnosis is clinical but can be supported by vestibular testing and MRI evidence of hydrops, and management is staged from conservative measures to intratympanic gentamicin or surgery for refractory vertigo, with the caveat that much of the therapeutic evidence is empirical rather than trial-based. I should confirm that patients are counseled about the chronic, fluctuating course and the importance of adherence to lifestyle modifications and follow-up to optimize outcomes [^3fb72409].

The Nature Reviews Disease Primers article on Ménière's disease [^3fb72409] provides a comprehensive overview of a chronic inner ear disorder characterized by **episodic vertigo**, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness, with **endolymphatic hydrops** as the underlying pathophysiology. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by audiometry and vestibular testing, with MRI increasingly used to visualize hydrops. Management is **stepwise**: conservative measures first, then intratympanic gentamicin or surgery if refractory. The disease significantly impairs quality of life, and ongoing research aims to clarify mechanisms and improve therapies.

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria

Ménière's disease presents with **four hallmark symptoms**:

- **Episodic vertigo**: Recurrent attacks lasting minutes to hours, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting.
- **Fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss**: Typically low-frequency, progressing over time.
- **Tinnitus**: Often described as roaring or buzzing, fluctuating with attacks.
- **Aural fullness**: Sensation of pressure or fullness in the affected ear.

Diagnosis is primarily **clinical**, guided by the **Barany Society criteria**, which require:

- Two or more spontaneous vertigo attacks lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours.
- Documented fluctuating low-frequency hearing loss on audiometry.
- Either tinnitus or aural fullness.
- Exclusion of other causes.

---

## Pathophysiology

The core mechanism is **endolymphatic hydrops**, an excess of endolymphatic fluid in the inner ear that distorts vestibular and cochlear structures, causing vertigo and hearing symptoms. The exact cause remains unclear, but proposed contributors include:

- **Genetic predisposition**: Family history increases risk.
- **Autoimmune inflammation**: Immune-mediated damage to the endolymphatic system.
- **Viral infections**: Possible triggers of inflammatory responses.
- **Vascular compromise**: Reduced blood flow to the inner ear.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnostic evaluation includes:

- **Audiometry**: Document fluctuating low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss.
- **Vestibular testing**: Videonystagmography (VNG), vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP), and caloric testing assess vestibular function.
- **Imaging**: MRI is increasingly used to visualize endolymphatic hydrops and exclude other pathology.

---

## Management strategies

Management is **stepwise**, tailored to symptom severity and frequency:

| **Treatment modality** | **Indication** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Conservative therapy | First-line | - Salt restriction <br/> - Diuretics <br/> - Lifestyle modifications <br/> - Vestibular rehabilitation |
| Intratympanic gentamicin | Refractory vertigo | Ablative therapy reducing vestibular function |
| Endolymphatic sac decompression | Refractory cases | Surgical procedure to relieve endolymphatic pressure |
| Cochlear implantation | Profound hearing loss | Restoration of hearing function |

---

## Impact on quality of life

Ménière's disease significantly impairs **quality of life**, causing:

- **Physical disability**: Frequent vertigo attacks limit daily activities.
- **Psychological distress**: Anxiety, depression, and social isolation are common.
- **Cognitive impact**: Concentration and memory difficulties due to chronic symptoms.

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research focuses on:

- **Pathophysiology**: Clarifying mechanisms of endolymphatic hydrops and symptom variability.
- **Biomarkers**: Identifying objective markers for early diagnosis and monitoring.
- **Therapeutics**: Developing disease-modifying therapies and improving surgical outcomes.

---

Ménière's disease is a chronic inner ear disorder with a **multifactorial pathophysiology** and significant quality-of-life impact. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by audiometry and vestibular testing, with MRI increasingly used to visualize hydrops. Management is stepwise, from conservative measures to intratympanic gentamicin or surgery, and ongoing research aims to improve understanding and treatment.

### Parkinson's disease subtypes: lost in translation? [^7252aecb]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Like many neurodegenerative disorders, Parkinson's disease (PD) is clinically highly heterogeneous. A number of studies have proposed and defined subtypes of PD based on clinical features that tend to cluster together. These subtypes present an opportunity to refine studies of aetiology, course and treatment responsiveness in PD, as clinical variability must represent underlying biological or pathophysiological differences between individuals. In this paper, we review what subtypes have been identified in PD and the validation they have undergone. We then discuss what the subtypes could tell us about the disease and how they have been incorporated into studies of aetiology, progression and treatment. Finally, with the knowledge that they have been incorporated very little into PD clinical research, we make recommendations for how subtypes should be used and make some practical recommendations to address this lack of knowledge translation.

### Arguing against the proposed definition changes of PD [^6218a783]. Movement Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

As members of the Lewy Body Dementia Association Scientific Advisory Council, we aim to address some of the issues raised in the article titled "Time to Redefine PD? Introductory Statement of the MDS Task Force on the Definition of Parkinson's Disease". In particular, we suggest that the 1-year rule distinguishing Parkinson's disease dementia from dementia with Lewy bodies is worth maintaining because it serves an important purpose in clinical practice and clinical and basic science research and when helping the lay community understand the complexity of these different clinical phenotypes. Furthermore, we believe that adding an additional diagnostic label, "PD (dementia with Lewy bodies subtype)", will confuse rather than clarify the distinction between dementia with Lewy bodies and PD or PD dementia, and will not improve management or expedite therapeutic development. We present arguments supporting our contentions. © 2016 The Authors. Movement Disorders published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Changing the research criteria for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: obstacles and opportunities [^27a35b34]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Recent findings question our present understanding of Parkinson's disease and suggest that new research criteria for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease are needed, similar to those recently defined in Alzheimer's disease. However, our ability to redefine Parkinson's disease is hampered by its complexity and heterogeneity in genetics, phenotypes, and underlying molecular mechanisms; the absence of biochemical markers or ability to image Parkinson's disease-specific histopathological changes; the long prodromal period during which non-motor manifestations might precede classic motor manifestations; and uncertainty about the status of disorders diagnosed clinically as Parkinson's disease but without Lewy pathology. Although it is too early to confidently redefine Parkinson's disease, the time has come to establish a research framework that could lead to new diagnostic criteria. We propose the establishment of three tiers encompassing clinical features, pathological findings, and genetics or molecular mechanisms. Specific advances in each tier, bridged by neuroimaging and biochemical data, will eventually lead to a redefinition of Parkinson's disease.

### Time to redefine PD? Introductory statement of the MDS task force on the definition of Parkinson's disease [^d093d527]. Movement Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

How then might future diagnostic criteria look? In developing criteria, some key aspects must be considered:

Clear definition of the motor syndrome: If the motor syndrome remains central to diagnosis, parkinsonism itself must be clearly defined. Several large-scale studies have documented mild parkinsonian syndromes in 25% to 50% of elderly persons without clinical features of PD–or α-Syn deposition; these must be distinguished from PD. Moreover, thresholds must be delineated to define parkinsonism "conversion" from prodromal stages.
Clinical expert as benchmark: 75% to 95% of patients diagnosed by experts during life have PD confirmed on autopsy, and more recent studies usually find better accuracy. Of note, experienced clinicians may diagnose PD with even greater accuracy than formal diagnostic criteria, perhaps because clinicians interpret exclusion criteria in context. If clinical expert opinion is the gold-standard diagnostic technique in life, then diagnostic criteria should attempt to codify the diagnostic process of an expert clinician. Criteria should systematize this process, so that it can be reproducible between clinicians (essential in research studies) and applied by clinicians with less expertise.
Diversity of criteria types: Imitating the diagnostic process of an experienced clinician involves incorporating numerous factors. First, clinicians assess both negative features that argue against PD and positive features that argue for PD. Second, not all features are of equal weight. Some negative features are so specific that they are incompatible with PD. Other features suggest a possible alternate cause, but are insufficient by themselves to preclude diagnosis. Third, rather than following a "recipe" to make diagnoses, experienced clinicians allow for flexibility in application of exclusion criteria, particularly if there are clear extenuating circumstances or complex situations that alter the significance of a criterion.
Time: Diagnostic accuracy increases with time; early in disease progression, response to treatment is less defined, and hallmarks of other neurodegenerative diseases may not have emerged. Also, some "atypical" features are incompatible with diagnosis early in disease, but may be a late feature in otherwise typical PD.
Grades of certainty: Overemphasis on avoiding false-positive diagnoses means missing many patients with true disease, whereas overemphasis on detecting all PD patients leads to false-positive diagnoses. The importance of false negatives versus false positives varies according to the purpose for which criteria are applied. For example, in a randomized, clinical trial, ensuring high specificity of PD diagnosis is key, and incorrect exclusion of true PD cases is arguably less critical (although excessive exclusion creates generalizability bias). By contrast, for natural history studies and epidemiologic research, diagnostic specificity and generalizability are both critical; one must balance false positives and false negatives.
Ancillary testing: Currently, PD diagnoses are generally made clinically, without requiring additional diagnostic tests. Any criteria should be applicable across a broad range of settings, and demanding specific ancillary diagnostic testing reduces generalizability and utility of the criteria. However, in certain contexts, ancillary diagnostic testing is used, particularly in resolving uncertain cases. Moreover, as knowledge advances, diagnostic biochemical markers, neuroimaging, or means to document α-Syn deposition may become clinically available.

### Meniere's disease | Nature reviews disease primers… [^3fb72409]. https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201628 (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract Meniere's disease is a disorder of the inner ear that causes vertigo attacks, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus and aural fullness. The aetiology of MD is multifactorial. A characteristic sign of MD is endolymphatic hydrops, a disorder in which excessive endolymph accumulates in the inner ear and causes damage to the ganglion cells. In most patients, the clinical symptoms of MD present after considerable accumulation of endolymph has occurred. However, some patients develop symptoms in the early stages of EH. The reason for the variability in the symptomatology is unknown and the relationship between EH and the clinical symptoms of MD requires further study. The diagnosis of MD is based on clinical symptoms but can be complemented with functional inner ear tests, including audiometry, vestibular-evoked myogenic potential testing, caloric testing, electrocochleography or head impulse tests. MRI has been optimized to directly visualize EH in the cochlea, vestibule and semicircular canals, and its use is shifting from the research setting to the clinic. The management of MD is mainly aimed at the relief of acute attacks of vertigo and the prevention of recurrent attacks. Therapeutic options are based on empirical evidence and include the management of risk factors and a conservative approach as the first line of treatment. When medical treatment is unable to suppress vertigo attacks, intratympanic gentamicin therapy or endolymphatic sac decompression surgery is usually considered. This Primer covers the pathophysiology, symptomatology, diagnosis, management, quality of life and prevention of MD. Access through your institution Buy or

Patient and public involvement

No patients or members of the public were invited to participate in determining the research question and outcomes, collecting and analysing the data, interpreting the results, or writing the manuscript. We invited two people with Parkinson's disease (one with de novo Parkinson's disease and one with advanced Parkinson's disease) and one care giver to assist in revising the plain English summary of the manuscript (supplementary methods section 1.9), as well as to read the full manuscript and provide their suggestions. The manuscript has been revised to optimise its readability, thereby facilitating the comprehension of its core content by the public. Furthermore, we will invite people with Parkinson's disease, their families, care givers, and other individuals involved in social welfare through outpatient recruitment and online channels to participate in the dissemination of our research. The invited individuals will be engaged in preparing comprehensible publicity materials (including a simple introduction, pictures, and multimedia content) and spreading information to the general public, policy makers, and scientists, as well as healthcare professionals through both social media platforms and traditional media outlets.

### Systematic review and consensus conceptual model of meaningful symptoms and functional impacts in early Parkinson's disease [^795490eb]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Search strategy

For the literature review, any source with a study-defined "early PD" population was included to avoid missing potential sources during the search process. Four databases were searched as shown in Supplementary Table 3. Search Strategy 1 identified sources published within 10 years that referenced early PD and symptoms or impacts anywhere in the title or abstract (search date: May 2023). Strategy 2 identified sources that used early PD and common terms for qualitative research anywhere in the title or abstract without time limits. Strategy 3 focused on reference lists of relevant review articles to identify additional sources. Strategy 4 used expert consultation to identify key sources > 10 years old or unpublished relevant datasets not captured in the first two search strategies.

As shown in Fig. 4, 2006 sources were returned, with 1301 duplicates. Abstracts were screened for 705 sources. Of these 554 were excluded and 151 were selected for full text review. Eighty-eight sources remained after eliminating studies without reportable data on symptoms or impacts within any early PD population. Of these, only 56 studies used samples that were strictly < 3 years since diagnosis based on mean and SD. A complete audit trail of sources screened and included/excluded is provided in Supplementary References.

Flowchart for identification and screening of sources included in conceptual model.

Approach to data analysis

All sources that met review inclusion criteria were systematically analyzed, and findings were weighted and aggregated to enable assessment of the total quality of evidence supporting each concept in early PD, as described below. Data extraction for concepts was performed on all studies of early PD as defined by study authors (N = 89; range 0–6 years since diagnosis), however, data regarding frequencies of concepts was limited to PD < 3 years since diagnosis (N = 56). This was done to maximize identification of potential concepts with reported frequencies specific to early PD.

### Research priorities on the role of α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis [^15109a4b]. Movement Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Various forms of Parkinson's disease, including its common sporadic form, are characterized by prominent α‐synuclein (αSyn) aggregation in affected brain regions. However, the role of αSyn in the pathogenesis and evolution of the disease remains unclear, despite vast research efforts of more than a quarter century. A better understanding of the role of αSyn, either primary or secondary, is critical for developing disease‐modifying therapies. Previous attempts to hone this research have been challenged by experimental limitations, but recent technological advances may facilitate progress. The Scientific Issues Committee of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) charged a panel of experts in the field to discuss current scientific priorities and identify research strategies with potential for a breakthrough. © 2024 The Author(s).

### Different pieces of the same puzzle: a multifaceted perspective on the complex biological basis of Parkinson's disease [^c19f686e]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the first description of Parkinson's disease (PD) in Western Medicine over two centuries ago, significant progress has been made to better understand, diagnose and treat the disease. Yet, despite this progress and years of research in the PD field, our understanding of its biological basis remains incomplete. Over the years, several different theories on the pathobiology of PD have emerged and evolved, with the general consensus being that the disease is complex with multiple factors (many still unknown) contributing to disease manifestation and progression.

The aim of this article was to explore some of these theories by asking PD clinician and laboratory scientists from around the globe to answer the question " What do you consider to be the starting point and the process that leads to the development of PD, and why ?". They could also comment on where future research efforts should be directed. Contributors were selected based on geographic spread, gender equity and diversity of their research interests. Overall, we had 12 contributions from six continents (Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America). While authors sharing similar viewpoints were clustered together, their written and unedited views are presented here as a collection of their responses to the question.

### Patient with parkinson disease and care partner perceptions of key domains affecting health-related quality of life: systematic review [^6c4b059c]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Eligibility Criteria

We searched for reports investigating self-reported PD symptoms affecting the HRQOL of PwP and CP according to the following criteria:

Inclusion Criteria

Type of publication: peer-reviewed original studies (articles, dissertations, and theses).
Year and language: We did not apply a year or language restrictions during the search process and selected all studies published until June 29, 2022. However, during the full-text analysis, we included only studies published in English.
Study Design: Quantitative: We included studies implementing nonrandomized and descriptive approaches, using any clinical outcome measure for data collection of PD symptoms and using patient-reported outcomes (PRO) to collect the effect of an individual's HRQOL. For example, we included studies using the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society–Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Parts I to IV to assess the severity of PD motor and nonmotor symptoms and the Parkinson Disease Questionnaire (PDQ)–39 or the Parkinson Impact Scale, both PRO, to assess the effect on HRQOL of the PwP or CP. Qualitative: We included studies implementing, but not limited to, phenomenology, grounded theory, and descriptive approaches (e.g. in-depth interviews, focus groups, and hybrid thematic analysis [inductive and deductive]). Mixed methods: We included studies of any approach (convergent or sequential exploratory design).
Topic of the studies: We did not apply restrictions on the topic of the study and selected all studies investigating the HRQOL outcome of perceived motor and/or nonmotor symptoms in PwP and CP. We adopted the definition of HRQOL proposed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which describes HRQOL as "an individual's or group's perceived physical and mental health over time". In this sense, we included studies using the 9 HRQOL COA in PD recommended by the MDS.

Exclusion Criteria

We excluded study protocols, conference proceedings, editorials, and editors' letters. We searched the primary studies for identified reviews and included those that met the eligibility criteria. For dissertations and theses, we searched for published articles related to that study, prioritizing the inclusion of peer-reviewed articles. In this sense, if an article was included, then the dissertation/thesis (the article's primary source) was excluded to avoid data duplication.

### Different pieces of the same puzzle: a multifaceted perspective on the complex biological basis of Parkinson's disease [^a35455cf]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

The biological basis of the neurodegenerative movement disorder, Parkinson's disease (PD), is still unclear despite it being 'discovered' over 200 years ago in Western Medicine. Based on current PD knowledge, there are widely varying theories as to its pathobiology. The aim of this article was to explore some of these different theories by summarizing the viewpoints of laboratory and clinician scientists in the PD field, on the biological basis of the disease. To achieve this aim, we posed this question to thirteen "PD experts" from six continents (for global representation) and collated their personal opinions into this article. The views were varied, ranging from toxin exposure as a PD trigger, to LRRK2 as a potential root cause, to toxic alpha-synuclein being the most important etiological contributor. Notably, there was also growing recognition that the definition of PD as a single disease should be reconsidered, perhaps each with its own unique pathobiology and treatment regimen.

### The significance of defining preclinical or prodromal Parkinson's disease [^affdb9c4]. Movement Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

A body of clinical and pathologic evidence supports the concept that there a pre-Parkinson state exists prior to the time when Parkinson's disease (PD) can be formally diagnosed. The ability to define a the preclinical or prodromal PD state has many important implications. First, understanding the timing and sequence of pathologic change that occurs in PD could provide important clues as to the etiology and pathogenesis of PD, and provide insight into cell vulnerability factors. Second, defining a population of patients with preclinical PD would provide a potentially important group of subjects for clinical trials attempting to define disease-modifying therapies. And, finally, being able to determine that a person has PD at an earlier time point than is currently possible would permit the introduction of a putative disease-modifying therapy at a time when it could have more profound and long-lasting effects. This paper reviews the clinical significance of defining preclinical PD.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial disorder with complex etiology. The largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) to-date included 37,688 cases, 18,618 proxy cases (unaffected first-degree relatives), and 1.4 million controls from European ancestry, and identified 90 independent risk signals across 78 genomic regions; 38 of which were novel signals. Despite these advances, PD GWAS are currently limited by scale, a focus on European populations, and limited integration with clinical phenotype data.

A power calculation based on the 2019 GWAS data indicates that inclusion of an additional ~99,000 cases would enable variants of smaller effect size that contribute to polygenic risk (p -value cut off: 1.35 × 10⁻³) to reach genome-wide significance. Therefore, expanding PD GWAS to at least this size will result in identification of additional risk loci and improve genetic prediction of PD occurrence. The heritability of PD can be estimated using twin studies or statistical genetic methods and is thought to lie between 22% and 40% in European populations. Known genome wide significant loci currently explain ~16% of the heritability of PD. The use of polygenic risk score analysis (including loci that do not reach genome wide significance) indicates that there are likely to be a substantial number of loci contributing to PD risk that have not yet been defined. Our power analysis indicates that 99,000 PD cases will be needed to define loci with 80% power, a minor allele frequency of 0.21 and similar effects to the current state-of-the-art analysis. The variability of phenotypes observed in PD are likely to have a genetic basis –. Knowledge of associations between genotype and clinical outcomes will enable clinicians to provide patients with a more accurate prognosis. Understanding the gene-to-phenotype pathways responsible for specific PD features would provide an opportunity to develop treatments targeting phenotype-specific disease pathways, resulting in more efficient and personalized treatment with fewer side effects. We aim to capture the diversity of PD outcomes, including Parkinson's itself but also related conditions such as prodromal Parkinson's, dementia with Lewy bodies and other Parkinson's plus syndromes, and to perform large-scale analyses of clinical-genetic data with sufficient power for gene discovery. This will comprise regression and time-to-event analysis for the phenotype of interest (e.g. dementia, dyskinesias, motor progression). It is likely that this will be limited to around 25% of samples included in this study with in depth longitudinal data, and further large scale longitudinal cohorts will be needed to explore the biology of progression and diverse phenotypes. The focus of PD GWAS on individuals of European ancestry has left gaps in our knowledge of PD-associated genetic variants in underrepresented populations and limited our ability to resolve GWAS loci. To advance understanding of the genetic determinants of Parkinsonism on a global scale, we need to ensure representation of diverse ancestries with sample sizes sufficient to detect ancestry-specific signals. We aim to include at least 15,000 participants of African, South Asian, and East Asian ancestry, respectively.

### Diet-wide analyses for risk of colorectal cancer: prospective study of 12, 251 incident cases among 542, 778 women in the UK-nature communications… [^a2a3ad5a]. nature.com (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract Uncertainty remains regarding the role of diet in colorectal cancer development. We examined associations of 97 dietary factors with colorectal cancer risk in 542, 778 Million Women Study participants, and conducted a targeted genetic analysis in the ColoRectal Transdisciplinary Study, Colon Cancer Family Registry, and Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium. Figure 1 and Supplementary Data 1 show the RRs for colorectal cancer in relation to intakes of the 97 dietary factors, of which 17 were associated with risk of colorectal cancer. The pairwise correlations for the 17 FDR-significant dietary factors are displayed in Table 2.

Dairy-related foods and nutrients had the strongest pairwise correlations. We also observed strong and moderately-strong pairwise correlations between fibre-related foods and nutrients. Table 3 presents associations of the 17 FDR-significant dietary factors with risk of colorectal cancer, further adjusted for calcium, dairy milk, fruit, and wholegrains. After adjustment for calcium, the inverse associations for dairy milk, phosphorus, riboflavin, magnesium, potassium, yogurt, folate, breakfast cereal and total sugars were no longer evident. Sensitivity analyses In sensitivity analyses restricted to women who self-reported excellent or good health at baseline, and to risk of colorectal cancer in the period 5 or more years after baseline, the findings were broadly similar.

We also found no significant heterogeneity in the observed associations for the FDR-significant dietary factors by cancer sub-site, except for alcohol, which appeared to be less detrimental in the proximal colon and most harmful in the rectum. MR using lactase polymorphism SNP We observed an inverse association of genetically predicted milk consumption and risk of colorectal cancer that was larger than the inverse association with reported dairy milk intake and colorectal cancer: RR per 200 g/day = 0. 60,
0. 46−0. 74; colon cancer: RR per 200 g/day = 0. 60,
0. 43−0. 77; and rectal cancer: RR per 200 g/day = 0. 49,
0. 31−0.
67. In subsequent studies, a diet-wide analysis in the EPIC study found 7% and 5% lower risks for the same increments 5, a study in the Nurses' Health Study II found a.

In this diet-wide prospective study on diet and colorectal cancer, we comprehensively investigated nearly 100 dietary factors in the same cohort, thereby reducing exposure selection bias, ensuring standardisation of confounding adjustment, and increasing the specificity of our findings.
51. We took a rigorous approach to explore the possibility of reverse causation by excluding women who reported changing their diet in the past 5 years due to illness from all the analyses, and in separate analyses by further restricting to women who self-reported good or excellent health at baseline, and by excluding the first 5 years of follow-up. We also assessed the potential role of confounding by assessing the impact of incremental adjustment for key confounders, and by conducting sensitivity analyses restricted to never smokers. The reproducibility and performance of the dietary assessment method used at baseline was assessed by comparison with records from 7-day food diaries 52.

### Global, regional, and national burden of Parkinson's disease, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^c693fcc7]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

This study confirms that Parkinson's disease is about 1·4 times more frequent in men than women, and this ratio did not change substantially over the study period. Environmental (eg, occupational) exposures to which men are more frequently exposed might contribute to this pattern. The prevalence of Parkinson's disease increased with age. Underascertainment at older ages owing to underdiagnosis, comorbidities, or institutional care might explain the decrease seen in the oldest age groups after the peak between 85 years and 89 years.

The current estimates for the global burden of Parkinson's disease are generated from imperfect data and models that are refined in each iteration of the GBD study. Estimates from GBD studies can vary from year to year as revised estimates are generated on the basis of refined methods and inclusion of more and higher-quality studies that are less likely to underestimate the true burden of the disease. Nonetheless, high-quality epidemiological studies (especially on incidence and disease severity) are still rare for large portions of the world, especially in low-income regions, where such studies are needed to understand trends and guide efforts to reduce the disease burden. Methodological differences for determining prevalence and study shortcomings might result in estimates that vary considerably and underestimate the true burden of Parkinson's disease. This under-reporting is well known for Parkinson's disease in studies based on death certificates, whereas population-based door-to-door studies are considered a better approach because they are able to capture undiagnosed cases. However, disease frequency estimates from population-based studies might be affected by selection bias resulting from non-response, particularly if individuals affected by the disease under investigation are less likely to participate. Non-response is an important issue as participation rates in epidemiological studies have considerably decreased over the past 30 years. Another limitation is that because we lack strong predictors for the occurrence of Parkinson's disease, some of the variation between countries is probably due to measurement error that we have been unable to correct. Because we rely on prevalence data to derive our cause of death estimates, any residual measurement error in the prevalence estimates is transposed onto the death estimates for Parkinson's disease. Although the the bias in mortality is an unwanted property, it is less than would have been the case if we had based our estimates on the observed rates of death with Parkinson's disease as the underlying cause from vital registration data. The large variation in death rates over time within the same countries and the even larger variation between countries are implausible and probably explained by changing death coding practices.

### Clinical insight on "Association between stress hyperglycemia ratio and Parkinson's disease across different glucose metabolism statuses – A prospective study from UK biobank" [^61253567]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

I'm responding promptly to the published, thoughtful article entitled "Association Between Stress Hyperglycemia Ratio and Parkinson's Disease Across Different Glucose Metabolism Statuses — A Prospective Study From UK Biobank". The key findings emerging from the study make a significant contribution by highlighting the Stress Hyperglycemia Ratio (SHR) as a potential increasing risk of Parkinson's disease in the context of sex and diabetic status.

While the study presents noteworthy findings, we underscore a few limitations and overlooked factors that, if taken into account, could make the study's findings even more meaningful and credible.

First of all, while the authors suggest that individuals with diabetes and prediabetes may show a decreased likelihood of developing Parkinson's disease, possibly due to an adaptive metabolic mechanism, their study does not consider the influence of antidiabetic medications. Certain antidiabetic drugs, such as SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP‐1 receptor agonists, have neuroprotective effects and the potential to reduce PD risk. In contrast, sulfonylureas and metformin have been implicated in increased PD risk. The unaccounted variability of this pharmacological heterogeneity may introduce bias.

Diet influences glycemic regulation and may independently affect Parkinson's disease risk, which is another lack of consideration in their interpretability. Markedly, adherence to Western dietary patterns, characterized by high intake of processed foods, sugar, and saturated fats, has been associated with up to a sevenfold increased risk of Parkinson's disease. Without accounting for nutritional factors, it is unclear whether SHR alone drives the association or diet‐related metabolic stress contributes.

Although the study briefly acknowledges genetic predisposition as a nonmodifiable factor, it does not evaluate the presence of established Parkinson's‐related mutations, such as LRRK2, GBA, or SNCA, as over 20 gene mutations have been associated with PD; nor does it incorporate screening. Without it, it remains uncertain to rule out the possibility of developing Parkinson's, either related to the SHR‐related mechanism or due to an underlying genetic mutation.

### Temporal trends in the prevalence of Parkinson's disease from 1980 to 2023: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bb35d4e6]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2024). High credibility.

Background

Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, exhibiting an upward trend in prevalence. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of Parkinson's disease, temporal trends between 1980 and 2023, and variations in prevalence by location, age, sex, survey period, sociodemographic index (SDI), human development index (HDI), and study characteristics (sample size, diagnostic criteria, and data source).

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and Global Health for observational studies that reported Parkinson's disease prevalence in the general population from database inception to Nov 1, 2023. We included studies if they were original observational investigations, had participants from the general population or community-based datasets, and provided numerical data on the prevalence of Parkinson's disease either with 95% CIs or with sufficient information to calculate 95% CIs. Studies were excluded if they were conducted in a specific population, had a sample size smaller than 1000, or were review articles, case reports, protocols, meeting abstracts, letters, comments, short communications, posters, and reports. The publication characteristics (first author and publication year), study location (countries, WHO regions, SDI, and HDI), survey period, study design, diagnostic criteria, data source, participant information, and prevalence data were extracted from articles using a standard form. Two authors independently evaluated eligibility, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion with the third author. We used random effect models to pool estimates with 95% CIs. Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to assess the temporal trend in prevalence of Parkinson's disease. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022364417.

Findings

83 studies from 37 countries were eligible for analysis, with 56 studies providing all-age prevalence, 53 studies reporting age-specific prevalence, and 26 studies providing both all-age and age-specific prevalence. Global pooled prevalence of Parkinson's disease was 1·51 cases per 1000 (95% CI 1·19–1·88), which was higher in males (1·54 cases per 1000 [1·17–1·96]) than in females (1·49 cases per 1000 [1·12–1·92], p = 0·030). During different survey periods, the prevalence of Parkinson's disease was 0·90 cases per 1000 (0·48–1·44; 1980–89), 1·38 cases per 1000 (1·17–1·61; 1990–99), 1·18 cases per 1000 (0·77–1·67; 2000–09), and 3·81 cases per 1000 (2·67–5·14; 2010–23). The EAPC of Parkinson's disease prevalence was significantly higher in the period of 2004–23 (EAPC 16·32% [95% CI 6·07–26·58], p = 0·0040) than in the period of 1980–2003 (5·30% [0·82–9·79], p = 0·022). Statistically significant disparities in prevalence were observed across six WHO regions. Prevalence increased with HDI or SDI. Considerable variations were observed in the pooled prevalence of Parkinson's disease based on different sample sizes or diagnostic criteria. Prevalence also increased with age, reaching 9·34 cases per 1000 (7·26–11·67) among individuals older than 60 years.

Interpretation

The global prevalence of Parkinson's disease has been increasing since the 1980s, with a more pronounced rise in the past two decades. The prevalence of Parkinson's disease is higher in countries with higher HDI or SDI. It is necessary to conduct more high-quality epidemiological studies on Parkinson's disease, especially in low SDI countries.

### A consensus statement on establishing causality, therapeutic applications and the use of preclinical models in microbiome research… [^8957978f]. nature.com (2025). Medium credibility.

We adopted a structured approach encompassing a literature review, expert workshops and the Delphi questionnaire to gather insights from a diverse range of stakeholders. Experts were requested to evaluate the strengths, limitations, and suitability of these models in addressing the causal relationship between the gut microbiome and disease pathogenesis. The resulting consensus statements and recommendations provide valuable insights for selecting preclinical models in future studies of gut microbiome-related diseases. Key points A Delphi survey identified key gaps and priorities in microbiome research, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and standardized methodologies. Advancing biomarker discovery remains a priority, with the need for robust validation pipelines and consideration of microbial functional outputs in clinical applications.

Preclinical models, including germ-free animals, organoids and ex vivo systems, are essential tools to understand the functional role of host–microbiome interactions, but require improved standardization and translational relevance and the implementation of bacterial isolates of relevance to humans. The inclusion of diverse animal models in the Delphi survey underscores their complementary strengths and limitations, allowing a comprehensive understanding of host–microbiome interactions and the identification of therapeutic targets for microbiome-related diseases. Delphi surveys offer a structured and iterative approach to gather insights from a panel of typically 30–50 leading experts, facilitating the synthesis of collective knowledge and the resolution of contentious issues 41.

They are particularly used in the field of medicine to overcome limitations associated with individual opinions through a transparent and reproducible framework with clearly defined criteria involving multiple rounds of anonymous feedback and consensus-seeking 38, which promotes open dialogue and encourages participants to reconsider their viewpoints in light of collective feedback 42,
43. This iterative process allows refinement and clarification of key concepts and ensures that consensus emerges from a thorough and effective discussion 34, 35. 1). Specifically, we explore two key themes: establishing causality and validating microbiome-based therapies for clinical use. Additionally, we outline formal recommendations derived from the comprehensive Delphi survey aimed at improving both the understanding and application of microbiome science in clinical settings.

For example, to enhance evidence for diseases such as IBD, obesity, T2DM and liver diseases, we advocate for prioritizing longitudinal studies and expanding research into autism. Summary of various microbiome model types alongside the outcomes of the Delphi survey. Model types include in vitro models, in vivo models, human microbiota-associated models, and organoid and organ-on-a-chip models. The annotations provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each model type as identified through the Delphi survey. Note that, although in vitro models were intentionally excluded from the survey to focus on in vivo models, they are included in this summary for the sake of comprehensiveness. The development of the Delphi questionnaire followed a comprehensive review of prior literature, consultation with experts and iterative refinement.

### Alpha-synuclein research: defining strategic moves in the battle against Parkinson's disease [^f933392b]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

With the advent of the genetic era in Parkinson's disease (PD) research in 1997, α-synuclein was identified as an important player in a complex neurodegenerative disease that affects > 10 million people worldwide. PD has been estimated to have an economic impact of $51.9 billion in the US alone. Since the initial association with PD, hundreds of researchers have contributed to elucidating the functions of α-synuclein in normal and pathological states, and these remain critical areas for continued research. With this position paper the authors strive to achieve two goals: first, to succinctly summarize the critical features that define α-synuclein's varied roles, as they are known today; and second, to identify the most pressing knowledge gaps and delineate a multipronged strategy for future research with the goal of enabling therapies to stop or slow disease progression in PD.

### Epidemiology of Parkinson's disease [^6289e903]. The Lancet: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

The causes of Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, are still largely unknown. Current thinking is that major gene mutations cause only a small proportion of all cases and that in most cases, non-genetic factors play a part, probably in interaction with susceptibility genes. Numerous epidemiological studies have been done to identify such non-genetic risk factors, but most were small and methodologically limited. Larger, well-designed prospective cohort studies have only recently reached a stage at which they have enough incident patients and person-years of follow-up to investigate possible risk factors and their interactions. In this article, we review what is known about the prevalence, incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of PD from epidemiological studies.

1.4 Data Extraction

Of the included articles, the following data were extracted by two team members: outcomes, intervention details, first author, publication year, study population, characteristics of the intervention (eg, daily dose), number of patients assigned to the intervention, characteristics of the control intervention, number of patients assigned to the control group, outcome measurements, timing of outcome assessment, type of analysis (eg, intention‐to‐treat), how the results were reported (eg, mean change, number of patients experiencing an event), and the outcomes themselves. The outcome characteristics varied among the different studies and an attempt was made to extract data regarding all available outcomes in the individual articles. These could include differences between groups, changes from baseline for groups, or the number of patients experiencing an event in each group, together with the reported characteristics of the outcome such as mean values, median values, confidence interval (CI), and P ‐value.

1.5 Risk of Bias Assessment

For each suitable outcome in each included article, two team members assessed the risk of bias, first separately and then collaboratively, in terms of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and any potential other biases. Each of these eight items was categorized as either low risk, high risk, or an unclear risk of bias.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of molecular tumor board data on clinical effectiveness and evaluation gaps… [^29f0ea9c]. nature.com (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract Molecular Tumor Boards are pivotal in personalized cancer care. This systematic review and meta-analysis included 34 studies out of 576 articles involving 12, 176 patients across 26 major cancer entities. Of these, 20. 8% received MTB-recommended therapies, with 178 outcome measures reported, achieving a median overall survival of
13. 5 months, progression-free survival of 4. 5 months, and an objective response rate of 5–57%. A systematic review of clinical outcomes of MTBs by Larson et al. 13 identified 14 studies done until early 2020, pointing out the need for better quality data and recommended standardization of approaches and outcomes. The review focused on clinical outcome measures with partial, complete, and overall response rates among patients referred to MTBs but did not try to quantify the overall effect of the recommended treatments on the patients.

An essential prerequisite to accessing reliable outcome data of MTBs is to ensure the capture of high-quality, real-world data of the course of treated patients 9, which is not readily available in most published reports describing MTB procedures and diagnostic results. With this background, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with the primary objective of assessing the effectiveness of MTB recommendations for cancer treatment strategies in terms of improvement of clinical outcomes among cancer patients. The secondary objectives were to describe all outcome measures reported and to identify gaps in the assessment of the effectiveness of MTBs. Results Study characteristics The search identified 576 articles and 340 articles were screened after removing duplicates to identify 34 MTB studies. Primary data on patient outcomes for 12. 176 patients referred to the MTB and
2. 532 patients who received MTB-recommended therapy.

More than half of the studies were retrospective cohort or register based studies, while the others were either data from clinical trials or prospective cohorts. The median duration of patient follow-up was 11 months ranging between 7 and 36 months. Individual data for all patients receiving MTB-recommended treatment was provided in 26 studies, however, only 12 provided outcome data for all patients and 9 only for a subset of patients. Overall, 186 outcome measures were reported with 42 related to PFS, 21 to OS, 23 to DCR, and 20 to ORR among 26, 22, 23 and 20 studies, respectively. All outcome measures are listed in Table 2 and Supplementary Table 2. The ORR ranged from 5% to 57% and DCR from 29% to 84%, with a median partial response rate of 18% and complete response rate of 1%. The PFS at 6 months reported in 3 studies were 2%, 28% and 79% respectively.

Figure 2 shows the CR-, PR-, and SD-rates along with the respective cancer types, sample size and the starting year of the data collection. The pooled estimates of the CR-, PR-, and SD-rates were 1%, 19%, and 25% respectively. The pooled estimates of ORR and DCR were 21% and 45% as shown in Fig.

### Systematic review and consensus conceptual model of meaningful symptoms and functional impacts in early Parkinson's disease [^0adf822f]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Pooling of same sample studies

Same sample studies were defined as separate publications that reported findings from the same (identical) participant sample (Supplementary Data). Findings were pooled from same-sample studies to ensure equal weighting of concepts during meta-synthesis. For pooling, redundant findings (e.g. demographics — diagnosis of depression) were reported once, while all unique findings were retained. Thus, a total of 38 unique study samples were included in the final model.

Aggregation of data for early PD < 3 years since diagnosis

Data aggregation was performed at the level of unique samples (N = 38), rather than at the level of individual studies so that each unique sample was represented only once in the final meta-synthesis. Only samples with data for PD < 3 years since diagnosis were included at this stage, based on the final model inclusion criteria. Data and frequencies for the full early PD sample (N = 89, 0–6 years since diagnosis) vs. PD < 3 years since diagnosis can be viewed in Supplementary Data.

The following metrics were calculated for each symptom and impact in early PD < 3 years since diagnosis:
Number and percentage of unique samples that measured a concept (within and across Tiers);
Average prevalence of concept (within and across Tiers 1B, 2, & 3 — calculated as the sum of frequencies in all studies reporting prevalence/total number of studies reporting prevalence);
Number and percentage of unique samples disconfirming presence of concept (within and across all Tiers); and
Frequency which concept was reported as being actively bothersome (Tier 1 A; calculated as the sum of frequencies in studies reporting bothersomeness/total number of studies reporting bothersomeness).

Assessment of quality of evidence and synthesis of findings

Next, evidence synthesis and assessment of quality was performed using GRADE-CERQual –. GRADE-CERQual is a standardized approach to assessment of confidence in the quality of evidence from qualitative studies and is endorsed by the World Health Organization and numerous government agencies for the development guidelines to shape public policy and research –. CERQual evaluates four primary areas: (1) methodological limitations, (2) coherence of findings, (3) adequacy of the data, and (4) relevance of the findings. Operationalized criteria for this are presented in Table 13. Methodological limitations were addressed via the Tiered approach, in which findings were weighted by methodology.

### Time to redefine PD? Introductory statement of the MDS task force on the definition of Parkinson's disease [^480f3080]. Movement Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

With advances in knowledge disease, boundaries may change. Occasionally, these changes are of such a magnitude that they require redefinition of the disease. In recognition of the profound changes in our understanding of Parkinson's disease (PD), the International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society (MDS) commissioned a task force to consider a redefinition of PD. This review is a discussion article, intended as the introductory statement of the task force. Several critical issues were identified that challenge current PD definitions. First, new findings challenge the central role of the classical pathologic criteria as the arbiter of diagnosis, notably genetic cases without synuclein deposition, the high prevalence of incidental Lewy body (LB) deposition, and the nonmotor prodrome of PD. It remains unclear, however, whether these challenges merit a change in the pathologic gold standard, especially considering the limitations of alternate gold standards. Second, the increasing recognition of dementia in PD challenges the distinction between diffuse LB disease and PD. Consideration might be given to removing dementia as an exclusion criterion for PD diagnosis. Third, there is increasing recognition of disease heterogeneity, suggesting that PD subtypes should be formally identified; however, current subtype classifications may not be sufficiently robust to warrant formal delineation. Fourth, the recognition of a nonmotor prodrome of PD requires that new diagnostic criteria for early-stage and prodromal PD should be created; here, essential features of these criteria are proposed. Finally, there is a need to create new MDS diagnostic criteria that take these changes in disease definition into consideration.

### Projections for prevalence of Parkinson's disease and its driving factors in 195 countries and territories to 2050: modelling study of global burden of disease study 2021 [^40cce72e]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Overview

On the basis of Global Burden of Disease 2021, we estimated the age, sex, and year specific prevalence of Parkinson's disease in 195 countries and territories from 2022 to 2050. We calculated the average annual percentage change to examine temporal trends in forecasted prevalence of Parkinson's disease. We did decomposition analysis to assess the relative contributions of population growth, population ageing, and changes in prevalence to changes in Parkinson's disease cases between 2021 and 2050. We used exposure levels and the prevalence ratio to estimate the population attributable fractions and potential impact fractions for modifiable factors of Parkinson's disease. This study adhered to the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER), ensuring transparent reporting of health estimates (supplementary table S1).

Data sources and definitions

The case definition of Parkinson's disease in Global Burden of Disease 2021 was the presence of at least two of the four primary symptoms: rest tremor, bradykinesia, limb and trunk stiffness, and postural instability. Alternative diagnostic criteria such as the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria and the Movement Disorder Society clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease, as well as ICD9 and ICD10 (international classification of disease, 9th and 10th revision) codes (ICD9: 332–332.0; ICD10: F02.3, G20-G20.9), diagnosis of Parkinson's disease by a medical professional, and prescription of Parkinson's disease specific medications were also accepted. We used Global Burden of Disease 2021 to obtain the age, sex, year, and location specific prevalence data for Parkinson's disease from 1990 to 2021. We used Global Burden of Disease 2019 to obtain prevalence data for exposure factors such as current smoking and used the data for calculating Socio-demographic Index, including total fertility under 25 years old, mean education for individuals aged ≥ 15, and lag distributed income per capita. The prevalence of physical activity came from the WHO Global Health Observatory. We calculated the prevalence ratio for Parkinson's disease associated with physical activity on the basis of seven eligible studies included in the meta-analysis published in 2024. We derived the prevalence ratio for Parkinson's disease associated with smoking from our updated meta-analysis, building on the previous meta-analysis published in 2012 (supplementary methods section 1.1). The forecasted population data by age, sex, year, and location came from Global Burden of Disease 2017.

### Integrated molecular landscape of Parkinson's disease [^26830ce2]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease is caused by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Although a number of independent molecular pathways and processes have been associated with familial Parkinson's disease, a common mechanism underlying especially sporadic Parkinson's disease is still largely unknown. In order to gain further insight into the etiology of Parkinson's disease, we here conducted genetic network and literature analyses to integrate the top-ranked findings from thirteen published genome-wide association studies of Parkinson's disease (involving 13.094 cases and 47.148 controls) and other genes implicated in (familial) Parkinson's disease, into a molecular interaction landscape. The molecular Parkinson's disease landscape harbors four main biological processes-oxidative stress response, endosomal-lysosomal functioning, endoplasmic reticulum stress response, and immune response activation-that interact with each other and regulate dopaminergic neuron function and death, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Interestingly, lipids and lipoproteins are functionally involved in and influenced by all these processes, and affect dopaminergic neuron-specific signaling cascades. Furthermore, we validate the Parkinson's disease -lipid relationship by genome-wide association studies data-based polygenic risk score analyses that indicate a shared genetic risk between lipid/lipoprotein traits and Parkinson's disease. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the molecular pathways underlying the etiology of (sporadic) Parkinson's disease and highlight a key role for lipids and lipoproteins in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, providing important clues for the development of disease-modifying treatments of Parkinson's disease.

### Concerns raised by publication of antonini et al., "Outcome of parkinson disease patients affected by COVID-19" [^581e0407]. Movement Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

As a clinical research scientist and epidemiologist living with Parkinson's Disease (PD) for more than a decade, it is not unusual to be asked to help translate new research papers and their implications for people living with PD. With stay‐home orders ongoing for nearly 2 months in my NYC home, the coronavirus pandemic is a daily focus. Claims about increased risk of complications for people with PD are speculative, in the absence of data. Thus, I was delighted to finally see some data in the newly accepted report by Antonini et al titled "Outcome of Parkinson Disease Patients Affected by Covid‐10"

Would it confirm the statement in a live webcast in mid‐March by a prominent US PD organization that "PD is a high risk group", even though most public health reports 1, 2 do not include PD among comorbid conditions associated with serious outcome? It is widely acknowledged that aspiration pneumonia is the leading cause of death in patients with PD. Nevertheless, it is not clear that factors causing people with PD to have elevated risk of aspiration pneumonia similarly cause elevated risk of COVID‐19 pneumonia.

The new report describes the outcome among only 10 people with PD, 2 nursing home residents with advanced disease from the catchment of the Parkinson and Movement Disorders Unit in Padua, Italy, and 8 identified by the Parkinson's Foundation Centre of Excellence at King's College Hospital in London, UK. How these patients were identified from the movement disorders centers is unclear. Was systematic screening conducted?

The bottom line from tallying observations on 10 individuals living with advanced PD and suffering from COVID‐19 infection was that 4 of the 10 died. Based on a 40% rate, the authors concluded that "(m)any national and charity guidelines do not list PD or specifically older subjects on advanced therapies as a susceptible group and this information needs to be amended in light of this new data".

### An update on the diagnosis and treatment of parkinson disease [^01d0cdb4]. CMAJ (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Parkinson's disease:

- **Definition**: PD is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, cognitive and autonomic dysfunction, as well as mood and impulse control disorders.
- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of PD is unknown; however, a combination of genetic and environmental factors have been implicated. Advancing age (> 65 years), male gender, genetics (LRRK2, glucocerebrosidase, and Parkin mutation), industrial exposure, heavy metals (manganese, copper, and lead), pesticides (rotenone, paraquat), and obstructive sleep apnea increase the risk of PD.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of PD in the US is estimated at 9.5–10.3 cases per 100,000 person-years, while its prevalence is estimated at 81 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: In patients with PD, premature selective loss of dopamine neurons and accumulation of Lewy bodies causes the classical motor manifestations of parkinsonism (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability), as well as autonomic dysfunction, cognitive dysfunction, and mood and impulse control disorders.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Patients with PD have 2.56-fold increased risk of mortality than similar age-matched individuals.

### Anhedonia in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review of the literature [^fdac2df6]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Anhedonia, defined as lowered ability to experience physical or social pleasure, is a key symptom of several psychiatric illnesses. In this systematic review, we aimed to evaluate the role of anhedonia in Parkinson's Disease and its relationships with other clinical characteristics, dopamine dysfunction, and antiparkinsonian therapy. The database was selected using PubMed Services. Relevant journals were hand-searched, and the bibliographies of all the important articles were scrutinized to find additional publications. Fifteen studies assessed the topic of anhedonia in Parkinson's disease from 1984 to 2009 and mainly described it as a core symptom of depression in patients with Parkinson's disease. Some studies investigated the relationship between anhedonia and neuropsychological symptoms and found correlations with frontal lobe functions. Reports on the relationship between anhedonia and illness severity or motor symptoms are rather inconclusive. No definitive conclusions can be drawn because few studies have been published on this topic. Nevertheless, some evidence suggests that in Parkinson's disease anhedonia is a secondary phenomenon linked to depression, apathy severity, and frontal lobe dysregulation and that it could respond to antiparkinsonian treatment. Future studies of larger samples of patients are strongly required to definitively clarify the relationship between anhedonia and other clinical features, such as depression, anxiety, apathy, cognition, and motor status. Furthermore, more reliable tools and validated diagnostic criteria are necessary to assess anhedonia in patients with Parkinson's disease.

### Dopaminergic therapy for motor symptoms in early parkinson disease practice guideline summary: a report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^ebbd2d1a]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Practice recommendations for initiation of pharmacologic treatment for motor symptoms in early Parkinson disease (PD) are contextualized by the statement that there are no disease-modifying drugs and therapy is symptomatic only, and by observational data on treatment timing. The document states, "There are no current disease-modifying pharmacologic treatments for PD; current PD pharmacologic therapy is symptomatic only". When symptoms are not causing disability, "most individuals with PD and clinicians are comfortable with a "wait and see" approach, although this requires careful monitoring and advising patients not to tolerate disability or put them in a situation of living unnecessarily". In the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset, among those expected to remain untreated for at least 6 months, 283 (67%) individuals with idiopathic PD started treatment within 2 years of study onset, with an average time of 0.78 (SD 0.5) years after study entry. The panel also "developed rationale statements that precede each recommendation" and specifies that "Four types of premises can be used to support recommendations: (1) evidence-based conclusions from the systematic review, (2) generally accepted principles of care, (3) strong evidence from related conditions, and (4) reasonable inferences from other premises. Recommendations must always be supported by at least one premise".

### Diagnostic procedures for Parkinson's disease dementia: recommendations from the movement disorder society task force [^f2068008]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

A preceding article described the clinical features of Parkinson's disease dementia (PD-D) and proposed clinical diagnostic criteria for "probable" and "possible" PD-D. The main focus of this article is to operationalize the diagnosis of PD-D and to propose practical guidelines based on a two level process depending upon the clinical scenario and the expertise of the evaluator involved in the assessment. Level I is aimed primarily at the clinician with no particular expertise in neuropsychological methods, but who requires a simple, pragmatic set of tests that are not excessively time-consuming. Level I can be used alone or in concert with Level II, which is more suitable when there is the need to specify the pattern and the severity on the dementia of PD-D for clinical monitoring, research studies or pharmacological trials. Level II tests can also be proposed when the diagnosis of PD-D remains uncertain or equivocal at the end of a Level I evaluation. Given the lack of evidence-based standards for some tests when applied in this clinical context, we have tried to make practical and unambiguous recommendations, based upon the available literature and the collective experience of the Task Force. We accept, however, that further validation of certain tests and modifications in the recommended cut off values will be required through future studies.

### Projections for prevalence of Parkinson's disease and its driving factors in 195 countries and territories to 2050: modelling study of global burden of disease study 2021 [^3d04b3ed]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To predict the global, regional, and national prevalence of Parkinson's disease by age, sex, year, and Socio-demographic Index to 2050 and quantify the factors driving changes in Parkinson's disease cases.

Design

Modelling study.

Data Source

Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.

Main Outcome Measures

Prevalent number, all age prevalence and age standardised prevalence of Parkinson's disease in 2050, and average annual percentage change of prevalence from 2021 to 2050; contribution of population ageing, population growth, and changes in prevalence to the growth in Parkinson's disease cases; population attributable fractions for modifiable factors.

Results

25.2 (95% uncertainty interval 21.7 to 30.1) million people were projected to be living with Parkinson's disease worldwide in 2050, representing a 112% (95% uncertainty interval 71% to 152%) increase from 2021. Population ageing (89%) was predicted to be the primary contributor to the growth in cases from 2021 to 2050, followed by population growth (20%) and changes in prevalence (3%). The prevalence of Parkinson's disease was forecasted to be 267 (230 to 320) cases per 100000 in 2050, indicating a significant increase of 76% (56% to 125%) from 2021, whereas the age standardised prevalence was predicted to be 216 (168 to 281) per 100000, with an increase of 55% (50% to 60%) from 2021. Countries in the middle fifth of Socio-demographic Index were projected to have the highest percentage increase in the all age prevalence (144%, 87% to 183%) and age standardised prevalence (91%, 82% to 101%) of Parkinson's disease between 2021 and 2050. Among Global Burden of Disease regions, East Asia (10.9 (9.0 to 13.3) million) was projected to have the highest number of Parkinson's disease cases in 2050, with western Sub-Saharan Africa (292%, 266% to 362%) experiencing the most significant increase from 2021. The ≥ 80 years age group was projected to have the greatest increase in the number of Parkinson's disease cases (196%, 143% to 235%) from 2021 to 2050. The male-to-female ratios of age standardised prevalence of Parkinson's disease were projected to increase from 1.46 in 2021 to 1.64 in 2050 globally.

Conclusions

By 2050 Parkinson's disease will have become a greater public health challenge for patients, their families, care givers, communities, and society. The upward trend is expected to be more pronounced among countries with middle Socio-demographic Index, in the Global Burden of Disease East Asia region, and among men. This projection could serve as an aid in promoting health research, informing policy decisions, and allocating resources.

### An antibody cocktail targeting two different CD73 epitopes enhances enzyme inhibition and tumor control… [^10e18aaa]. nature.com (2024). Medium credibility.

The purinergic signaling pathway is one of such pathways being actively explored 2. The purinergic signaling pathway involves the participation of extracellular ATP, ADP, and adenosine as the main signaling molecules for evolutionary conserved cell communication
3. Two ectonucleotidases, NTPDase1/CD39, and ecto-5'-nucleotidase/CD73, play central roles in this pathway. Briefly, CD39 enzymatically converts extracellular ATP and ADP into AMP in a stepwise manner, while CD73 catalyzes the hydrolysis of AMP to adenosine 4. The generation and accumulation of adenosine are believed to exert an immunosuppressive effect by impairing the cytotoxic antitumor immune response and counteracting the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies 5,
6. In addition to this, the CD73-adenosine axis has also been implicated in chemoresistance, tumor growth, metastasis, and tumor angiogenesis 7, 8, 9.

Furthermore, elevated expression of CD73 has been correlated with unfavorable clinicopathologic characteristics and shorter patient survival time
10. Consistent with these findings, genetic and protein expression analyses have revealed up-regulation of CD73 in various human carcinomas, including breast, colon, pancreas, and lung 11. Given its pivotal role in cancer development, the purinergic signaling pathway has emerged as a promising target for cancer immunotherapy 12,
13. Although antagonism to many key components of the purinergic signaling pathway including CD39, CD73, and downstream adenosine receptors have been explored, it is antagonism of CD73 through small-molecular inhibitors and blocking antibodies that have received the most attentions 12. CD73 exists in the form of a homodimer and consists of a glycosylated N-terminal domain and a glycosylated C-terminal domain, connected by a highly flexible α-helical linker.

Upon binding to AMP via the C-terminal domain, CD73 undergoes a conformational change, adopting a closed active state where the N-terminal domain and zinc cofactors align with the AMP to initiate the catalytic process, ultimately leading to the production of adenosine. Subsequently, the N-terminal domain undergoes a significant lateral rotation, opening the substrate-binding site to release the product upon completion of the catalytic reaction 3. Furthermore, by combining cryo-electron microscopy, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, mutagenesis techniques, and molecular simulations, we elucidate the structure of a ternary complex wherein a CD73 dimer is bound by the Fabs of HB0038 and HB0039, offering molecular insights into the enhanced efficacy of this cocktail. To assess the impact of HB0045, a CD4 + and CD8 + T cell proliferation assay was conducted in the presence of ATP.

CD8 + and CD4 + T cells exhibited around 5 divisions when stimulated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. However, the presence of ATP significantly inhibited T-cell proliferation due to the conversion of ATP to adenosine by CD39 and CD73-expressing cells in PBMCs. By comparing the exchange kinetics between free CD73 and CD73 complexed with HB0038, we identified two regions within the N-terminal domain of soluble CD73 and one region within the C-terminal domain of soluble CD73. These regions displayed reduced deuterium uptake upon binding to HB0038. In contrast, only one region within the N-terminal domain of soluble CD73 exhibited decreased deuterium uptake upon binding to HB0039 Fab (Supplementary Fig.

### Viewpoint and practical recommendations from a movement disorder specialist panel on objective measurement in the clinical management of Parkinson's disease [^6b2fdec3]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Motor aspects of Parkinson's disease, such as fluctuations and dyskinesia, can be reliably evaluated using a variety of "wearable" technologies, but practical guidance on objective measurement (OM) and the optimum use of these devices is lacking. Therefore, as a first step, a panel of movement disorder specialists met to provide guidance on how OM could be assessed and incorporated into clinical guidelines. A key aspect of the incorporation of OM into the management of Parkinson's disease (PD) is defining cutoff values that separate "controlled" from "uncontrolled" symptoms that can be modified by therapy and that relate to an outcome that is relevant to the person with PD (such as quality of life). Defining cutoffs by consensus, which can be subsequently tested and refined, is the first step to optimizing OM in the management of PD. OM should be used by all clinicians that treat people with PD but the least experienced may find the most value, but this requires guidance from experts to allow non-experts to apply guidelines. While evidence is gained for devices that produce OM, expert opinion is needed to supplement the evidence base.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of Parkinson's disease in lower to upper-middle-income countries [^6ffcf9b7]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Selection and data collection process

Results were exported to Rayyan software to manage references and remove duplicates. Two reviewers (GMP and NMS) independently screened unique records. A third reviewer (DTS) evaluated and resolved the data divergences. After finalizing the selection of included articles, five reviewers (DTS, DCF, GAM, GMP, and NMS) were assigned to extract data from each report independently.

A structured data collection process was implemented using forms created for this review (Supplemental Fig. 1). The data extracted from each eligible study included the following characteristics: author and affiliation, country/city/province where the study was conducted, sample or population size, number of PD cases, crude and/or standardized prevalence or incidence (reported as cases per 100,000 persons), study design, mean age of participants, duration of the study, and the diagnostic criteria or protocol used to establish PD cases. If available, secondary prevalence measures such as sociodemographic data (sex, age) and living area (urban or rural) were also extracted. In cases where multiple studies were conducted in the same country, the data were summarized as a range of cases per region, while unique data were presented individually for each study measure.

Additional sociodemographic data from each study's country was obtained using data from the World Bank. Countries were categorized geographically into different regions, including Latin America & Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, East Asia & Pacific, Middle East & North Africa, and Europe & Central Asia. For each study, representative estimates of the country's life GDP per capita were calculated by averaging the last five available measures preceding the year of the study's publication. This retrospective averaging approach aimed to provide a more accurate reflection of the social conditions of the country during the period in which the study was conducted. Life expectancy at birth was obtained from the last available measure next to the study's publication date.

Quality assessment

The quality of each included study was evaluated using a quality assessment instrument created from recommendations for evaluating prevalence studies. This tool is based on eight criteria that measure the accuracy of the clinical assessment, the integrity of the statistical analysis, and the sample's representativeness for the target demographic. A score ranging from 0 to 8 was generated for each study, assigning 1 point for each positive or not applicable criterion.

### Systematic review and consensus conceptual model of meaningful symptoms and functional impacts in early Parkinson's disease [^a4cb4236]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Sample characteristics

A total of 88 studies in early PD were utilized for the concept identification phase. Of these, 56 sources were in PD < 3 years since diagnosis. After pooling for same sample studies within this latter subset, a total of 38 unique samples were identified and used to derive frequencies for the final model. All qualitative studies (Tier 1; 6 unique samples from 7 studies) were from the UK, USA, and Canada with predominantly white participants (93–100%). Three reported bothersomeness; four reported prevalence; one reported both. Sample sizes in qualitative studies ranged from 20 to 134 with one very large sample study of 8536 participants (Fox Insight/PD PROP). Tier 2 (N = 13) and Tier 3 (N = 19) quantitative sources included studies from UK, USA, Canada, Italy, Korea, Serbia, Thailand, Germany, India, China, Singapore, and the Netherlands. Distribution of race/ethnicity was generally not reported. Samples sizes for quantitative studies ranged from 54 to 921 participants. The mean age range for all studies in all Tiers was 57–68 years. Gender distribution ranged from 40–74% male, most commonly around 60%. In 13 of 38 unique samples (34%), participants were taking PD medications (range 4–100%; mean LEDD 50–544 mg/day). However, medication use was not specified in 18% (7/38). Hoehn & Yahr score (H&Y) was reported by 27/38 samples, with mean H&Y < 2 for all, but only 12/27 (44%) with H&Y ≤ 2 when factoring +2 SD. MDS-UPDRS III (motor) was reported in 25/38 studies and ranged from 9.2–27.0, which is consistent with early PD. Detailed characteristics for each study included in the review are presented in the Supplementary Data.

### Projections for prevalence of Parkinson's disease and its driving factors in 195 countries and territories to 2050: modelling study of global burden of disease study 2021 [^7f5c058c]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Population attributable fractions and potential impact fractions of modifiable factors

In this study, two modifiable factors for Parkinson's disease were eligible according to the World Cancer Research Fund evidence grading criteria applied by Global Burden of Disease 2021: smoking and physical activity. We used population attributable fractions to quantify the proportion of Parkinson's disease cases that would be changed if exposure to a given factor was entirely eliminated. We assumed that the association between modifiable factors and Parkinson's disease was constant worldwide. We estimated the total number of Parkinson's disease cases attributable to each modifiable factor by multiplying the population attributable fraction estimates by the number of Parkinson's disease cases. Moreover, to evaluate the potential impact of a partial increase or decrease in modifiable factors on the proportion of Parkinson's disease cases, we modelled the potential impact fractions resulting from a proportionate increase or decrease (20%) in prevalence of each factor. The detailed methods are described in supplementary methods sections 1.7 and 1.8.

Compilation of results

We projected the prevalence of Parkinson's disease for both sexes, 16 age groups, and 195 countries and territories from 2022 to 2050. Additionally, we assigned countries to a fifth of Socio-demographic Index according to their estimated values on these indicators in 2021. The unit used in this study was per 100 000 population for both the all age and the age standardised prevalence of Parkinson's disease. For the age standardised prevalence, we used a standard population calculated as the non-weighted average across all countries of the percentage of the population in each five year age group from 2010 to 2035. Uncertainty was propagated through all calculations by sampling 1000 draws at each step of the calculations, which enabled us to carry through uncertainty from multiple sources, including input data, corrections of measurement error, and estimates of residual non-sampling error. We determined the 95% uncertainty intervals for Parkinson's disease prevalence as the 2.5th and 97.5th centiles of the posterior distributions. Otherwise, we calculated 95% confidence intervals for the data pertaining to average annual percentage change, population attributable fractions, and potential impact fractions.

### Pramipexole dihydrochloride (Mirapex) [^9e852df9]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Parkinson's Disease

Mirapex® (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets are indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease.

The effectiveness of MIRAPEX tablets was demonstrated in randomized, controlled trials in patients with early Parkinson's disease who were not receiving concomitant levodopa therapy as well as in patients with advanced disease on concomitant levodopa (see CLINICAL STUDIES).

Restless Legs Syndrome

MIRAPEX tablets are indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe primary Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS).

Key diagnostic criteria for RLS are: an urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant leg sensations; symptoms begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity such as lying or sitting; symptoms are partially or totally relieved by movement such as walking or stretching at least as long as the activity continues; and symptoms are worse or occur only in the evening or night. Difficulty falling asleep may frequently be associated with symptoms of RLS.

### SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines sensitize tumours to immune checkpoint blockade… [^67e847d1]. nature.com (2025). Medium credibility.

This survival advantage was similar for patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC and stage. P values and HR adj were calculated using two-sided Cox proportional hazards regression, including all variables that were significantly associated with survival on univariable analysis. Of the patients who received mRNA vaccines, 21 received BNT162b2 and 22 received mRNA-1273; 6 received a priming dose only, 8 received a booster only, 16 received both a prime and a boost dose, and 13 received 2 booster doses during our period of interest; 14 received 1 dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination within 100 days, and 29 received 2 doses. neutralizing antibodies after in vivo administration to animals.

mRNA was encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles and met the specification range delineated for clinical preparations of BNT162b2 based on encapsulation efficiency, size distribution, polydispersity and charge 18, the latter of which we found could be disproportionately affected by buffer conditions leading to a net positive charge. Significance was determined using two-way analysis of variance /mixed-effect analysis with Geisser–Greenhouse correction and two-tailed unpaired t- tests. n indicates the number of biologically independent samples. For the box plots, the whiskers extend to the highest and lowest values, the box limits show the first and third quartiles and the centre line shows the median value. For a – d, data are mean ± s. e. m. Source Data We next sought to understand the mechanism by which RNA-LNPs targeting the spike protein mediate these antitumour effects.

To do this, we used an early treatment model of B16F0 with or without cytokine-blocking antibodies. In this model, RNA-LNPs and PD-L1 blockade each provided numerical but statistically insignificant survival benefits. However, combination therapy with RNA-LNPs and PD-L1 blockade strongly inhibited tumour growth. Although we previously demonstrated a role for IFNα in the response to mRNA vaccines, recent evidence suggests a dominant role for IL-1 signalling in responses to the specific RNA-LNPs targeting the COVID-19 spike protein 15. As expected, replacing N 1 -methyl-pseudouridine with uridine in pp65 mRNA resulted in further synergy with ICI. However, replacing N 1 -methyl-pseudouridine with uridine in spike mRNA provided only numerical improvement in antitumour response, suggesting that innate immune sensing is a multifactorial process that may be influenced by specific mRNA constructs.

To understand this further, we first ruled out a role for dsRNA in our vaccines by measuring the level of dsRNA contamination in our manufactured ssRNA product. We found the dsRNA/ssRNA ratio in our mRNA to be 0. 011%. We then repeated our tumour growth curve incorporating an additional dsRNA-removal protocol 20. With this step, we successfully removed all detectable dsRNA contamination. Importantly, we found no change in antitumour efficacy with the complete elimination of dsRNA using this method. Finally, we found no abrogation of type I IFN after RNA-LNP administration in mice lacking RIG-I, a critical sensor of dsRNA and activator of type I IFN response. Together, these data suggest that dsRNA is not a major cause of the antitumour effects in our preclinical models.

### Neuroprotective effects of chlorella vulgaris loaded niosomes via SIRT1 activation in aluminum chloride-induced Alzheimer's model… [^cadcc348]. nature.com (2025). Medium credibility.

This research aimed to investigate the protective effectiveness of CV-loaded niosome as a drug delivery system, in comparison to free form, against AlCl3-induced Alzheimer's-like neurodegeneration in rats with special emphasis on SIRT1/miRNA-134/GSK3β axis. A niosomal formulation of Span 60, and cholesterol was chosen as an optimum formulation. Administration of CV or CV-LN dramatically improves the impaired oxidative markers, behavioral deficits, cholinergic and serotonergic dysfunctions, by significantly inhibiting monoamine oxidase, acetylcholinesterase activities and increasing serotonin level in brain of AlCl 3 -exposed rats. In parallel, CV or CV-LN triggers the activation of Sirtuin-1 which downregulates miRNA-134, leading to increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and improved neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. Histopathological evaluations also supported the above findings.

CV-LN formulations exhibited greater neuroprotective efficacy in a rat model, possibly due to better brain delivery and bioavailability. Eventually, CV and particularly CV-LN may hold promise as potential therapeutic candidates for further investigation in the context of neurodegenerative disorders and AD, possibly through modulation of SIRT1/miRNA-134/GSK3β axis. This study represents the first attempt, to our knowledge, to apply a nano formulated version of Chlorella vulgaris as a drug delivery approach against neurodegeneration, offering a novel strategy to enhance bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy in neurodegenerative disease models. Materials and methods Chemicals. After drying, the thin film was hydrated for two hours at 60 °C using 10 mL of phosphate buffer with a pH of 7. 4 and 10 mg of CV algae.

To separate the entrapped and un-entrapped drugs, the produced formulation was sonicated for 30 min and then centrifuged using a cooling centrifuge set at 15, 000 rpm and 4 °C for 1 h. The collected niosome pellets were again suspended in the phosphate buffer, and the resulting formulation was kept for further study at 4 °C. Novel Object Recognition aims to evaluate the short-term memory. According to the protocol selected by Bevins and Besheer 21, Leger et al. 22, and Lim et al. 23, rats naturally engage with new items more than they do with old ones, a phenomenon known as recognition memory, which is the basis for the novel object recognition test, for evaluating the learning and memory deficiencies in rats and mice. NOR was assessed using the discriminating index, and discriminating Ratio. The specificity was then confirmed using a melting curve analysis.

The delta-delta Ct was used to measure each gene expression's relative quantification, with U6 serving as the housekeeping gene for miRNA-134 and β-actin used for normalization of other mRNA genes 29. No experiment included template controls for any of the genes. Every sample underwent two analyses 30. The delta-delta Ct calculation is used to determine the relative quantification of each target gene. We calculated the RQ for each gene using 2^(−ΔΔCt) 31. Statistical analysis The findings were statistically analyzed using SPSS. After the one-way analysis of variance test, the Tukey's post hoc test was used to compare the experimental groups. The results were presented as the mean with standard error of the mean and were statistically significant at the P < 0. 05 level. The changes in both spatial and non-spatial short-term memory, as well as in memory indices, were depicted in Table 2.

### Systematic review of incidence studies of Parkinson's disease [^9da9fae4]. Movement Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Incidence studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) are important for both health-care planning and epidemiological research. This report reviews the methods and results of previous incidence studies of PD and makes recommendations for future studies. Original articles that described the incidence of PD were located using several strategies. The methods were summarised, and the results of studies with similar methodologies were compared on a standardised population. Twenty-five incidence studies were included. Each used different methods to identify incident patients, although most screened both primary care and hospital records. Only eight studies were prospective, and only two of these had any follow-up. The diagnostic criteria for PD varied (11 studies used two or more cardinal motor features, four used the UK Brain Bank criteria), as did the exclusion criteria and the definition of an incident case. In 16 studies, attempts were made to confirm the diagnosis by examination of patients by a specialist as part of the study. None of the studies used identical methods, but five were sufficiently similar to merit comparison. Four of these gave a similar incidence (16–19/100000/year), but one from Italy had a much lower incidence (8.4/100000), the reason for which was unclear. Five studies found significantly greater incidence in men. This review highlights the difficulties in performing good quality incidence studies of PD. Further incidence studies using standardised methods are required. A set of minimal scientific criteria has been devised to improve the quality and consistency of future studies.

### Dopaminergic therapy for motor symptoms in early parkinson disease practice guideline summary: a report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^a0bd003a]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

UPDRS part III motor score — In early Parkinson disease comparisons of levodopa versus dopamine agonists (DAs), negative values in the raw mean difference favored levodopa, and the minimal clinically important difference was 3 points; changes of 3 points or less were considered unimportant. The trend over time demonstrates that levodopa provides greater benefit for motor symptoms than DAs for up to 5 years of follow-up, while data beyond 5 years are scarce and of low quality. With longer follow-up, interpretation is complicated because 90% of patients at 6 years and 100% at 10 years originally randomized to DAs were taking supplemental levodopa.

### Validating the accuracy of Parkinson's disease clinical diagnosis: a UK brain bank case-control study [^dec052e1]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The most common isolated neuropathological findings for false positives from our large cohort of alive clinically diagnosed PD subjects were DLB (19.4%), MSA (9.2%), and AD (7.6%). However, copathology was common among false positives with dual pathology represented in 37.2% and triple pathology in 9.2% of cases.

The most common clinical isolated misdiagnosis during life for post‐mortem diagnosed PD patients, ie, false negatives (Group 2), was AD (18.5%), followed by other dementias (11.2%), PSP (6.6%), VE (5.9%), and MSA (4.6%, split in MSA‐P 3.3%, MSA‐C 0.6%, and no better specified MSA 0.7%).

Also in this group, the combination of more diagnoses during life was quite common with dual clinical diagnosis in 9.2% and triple clinical diagnosis in 2.6% of cases. These findings point toward AD and other dementias as a confounding alive diagnosis, in which cognitive problem focus the attention more than the movement ones, and in addition confirm the well‐known difficulty for correct clinical‐based discrimination between PD dementia and DLB.

As confirmed by our results, a comprehensive model for the diagnosis of PD should take also copathology into account: the presence of multiple pathologies is now recognized as the rule rather than the exception in the neurodegeneration field. Based on our cohort of alive‐diagnosed PD subjects, 73 out of the 196 misdiagnosed patients had a combination of 2 pathological diagnoses and 18 a combination of even 3. Dissecting copathology, we found that the most represented combinations of dual mixed pathologies were VE + AD and MND + PSP. Accordingly, data from 3 community‐based longitudinal cohorts of 1,430 older adults showed that the average PD patient has a median of 3 pathologies and in some cases up to 9 and that the weighted pathology score does not account for the rate of progression when comparing those with versus without clinical PD. In another retrospective study of 1,647 autopsied individuals, up to 7 different pathologies occurred in 161 combinations, matching pathology and diagnosis of only between 19% and 45%.

### The gut microbiome in neurological disorders [^072e88db]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Research into the role of the gut microbiome in modulating brain function has rapidly increased over the past 10 years, albeit chiefly in animal models. Increasing clinical and preclinical evidence implicates the microbiome as a possible key susceptibility factor for neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. Cross-sectional clinical studies are bolstering the concept of altered microbial composition contributing to the pathophysiology of such diseases. However, the field is nascent, and interpretation of such data is often difficult given that the composition of the microbiome is influenced by various factors such as diet and exercise. Longitudinal studies and randomised controlled trials in humans are needed to find out if targeting the microbiome can yield novel therapeutic strategies. Systems biology approaches will also be important in integrating such data with genomic and metabolomic datasets from clinical cohorts with neurological disease to help guide individual treatment selection.

### Extracellular vesicle sorting of α-synuclein is regulated by sumoylation [^f4709901]. Acta Neuropathologica (2015). Low credibility.

Extracellular α-Synuclein has been implicated in interneuronal propagation of disease pathology in Parkinson's Disease. How α-Synuclein is released into the extracellular space is still unclear. Here, we show that α-Synuclein is present in extracellular vesicles in the central nervous system. We find that sorting of α-Synuclein in extracellular vesicles is regulated by sumoylation and that sumoylation acts as a sorting factor for targeting of both, cytosolic and transmembrane proteins, to extracellular vesicles. We provide evidence that the SUMO-dependent sorting utilizes the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) by interaction with phosphoinositols. Ubiquitination of cargo proteins is so far the only known determinant for ESCRT-dependent sorting into the extracellular vesicle pathway. Our study reveals a function of SUMO protein modification as a Ubiquitin-independent ESCRT sorting signal, regulating the extracellular vesicle release of α-Synuclein. We deciphered in detail the molecular mechanism which directs α-Synuclein into extracellular vesicles which is of highest relevance for the understanding of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis and progression at the molecular level. We furthermore propose that sumo-dependent sorting constitutes a mechanism with more general implications for cell biology.

### Association between age at onset of multimorbidity and incidence of dementia: 30 year follow-up in whitehall II prospective cohort study [^8f80cab3]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

To examine the association of severity of multimorbidity and dementia, we re-categorised the multimorbidity measure as zero or one, two, and three or more chronic conditions. We examined the association of this measure at age 55, 60, 65, and 70 in separate models, first as a time invariant variable with subsequent dementia and then overall with this measure modelled as a time varying measure.

In exploratory analyses, we examined dyads of chronic conditions for their association with incidence of dementia over the follow-up in separate models, adjusted for covariates as in the main analyses and the presence of any disease other than those considered in the dyad. In additional analyses, we excluded Parkinson's disease from the list of chronic conditions and reran the multimorbidity analyses using 12 chronic conditions to ensure that the results were not driven by possible Parkinson's dementia.

In secondary analyses, we used the methods described above with mortality as the outcome. We used two sided P values with the threshold for statistical significance at α = 0.05. Methods used in the analysis of incident dementia are summarised in supplementary table A. We used R version 4.0.3 (R Core Team) for all analyses.

Patient and public involvement

Participants of the Whitehall II study were not involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, or implementation of the study. No participants were asked for advice on interpretation or writing up of results. We recognise that public involvement has great value and contributes to improving the quality of research, but we unfortunately did not have the necessary funding to involve patients. The Whitehall study investigators are thinking of new solutions to better involve the public in the future. However, we sought suggestions from a patient reviewer during the revision process of the article, and these helped to improve the clarity of the paper. Finally, all results are disseminated to study participants via newsletters and a website, which has a participant portal and to a larger audience via media outreach.

### A systematic review of lessons learned from PET molecular imaging research in atypical parkinsonism [^c87cd12d]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To systematically review the previous studies and current status of positron emission tomography (PET) molecular imaging research in atypical parkinsonism.

Methods

MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus electronic databases were searched for articles published until 29th March 2016 and included brain PET studies in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). Only articles published in English and in peer-reviewed journals were included in this review. Case-reports, reviews, and non-human studies were excluded.

Results

Seventy-seven PET studies investigating the dopaminergic system, glucose metabolism, microglial activation, hyperphosphorilated tau, opioid receptors, the cholinergic system, and GABA A receptors in PSP, MSA, and CBS patients were included in this review. Disease-specific patterns of reduced glucose metabolism have shown higher accuracy than dopaminergic imaging techniques to distinguish between parkinsonian syndromes. Microglial activation has been found in all forms of atypical parkinsonism and reflects the known distribution of neuropathologic changes in these disorders. Opioid receptors are decreased in the striatum of PSP and MSA patients. Subcortical cholinergic dysfunction was more severe in MSA and PSP than Parkinson's disease patients although no significant changes in cortical cholinergic receptors were seen in PSP with cognitive impairment. GABA A receptors were decreased in metabolically affected cortical and subcortical regions in PSP patients.

Conclusions

PET molecular imaging has provided valuable insight for understanding the mechanisms underlying atypical parkinsonism. Changes at a molecular level occur early in the course of these neurodegenerative diseases and PET imaging provides the means to aid differential diagnosis, monitor disease progression, identify of novel targets for pharmacotherapy, and monitor response to new treatments.

### Ropinirole [^9b761705]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Parkinson's Disease

The effectiveness of ropinirole hydrochloride in the treatment of Parkinson's disease was evaluated in a multinational drug development program consisting of 11 randomized, controlled trials. Four trials were conducted in patients with early Parkinson's disease and no concomitant L-dopa and seven trials were conducted in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease with concomitant L-dopa.

Three placebo-controlled trials provide evidence of effectiveness of ropinirole hydrochloride in the management of patients with Parkinson's disease who were and were not receiving concomitant L-dopa. Two of these three trials enrolled patients with early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) and one enrolled patients receiving L-dopa.

In these trials a variety of measures were used to assess the effects of treatment (e.g., the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS], Clinical Global Impression [CGI] scores, patient diaries recording time "on" and "off", tolerability of L-dopa dose reductions).

In both trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa), the motor component (Part III) of the UPDRS was the primary outcome assessment. The UPDRS is a multi-item rating scale intended to evaluate mentation (Part I), activities of daily living (Part II), motor performance (Part III), and complications of therapy (Part IV). Part III of the UPDRS contains 14 items designed to assess the severity of the cardinal motor findings in patients with Parkinson's disease (e.g., tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability) scored for different body regions and has a maximum (worst) score of 108. In the trial of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (with L-dopa), both reduction in percent awake time spent "off" and the ability to reduce the daily use of L-dopa were assessed as a combined endpoint and individually.

Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Advanced Parkinson's Disease: Table 5 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in advanced Parkinson's disease that were reported by ≥ 1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity.

The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-events incidence rate in the population studied.

### Apomorphine hydrochloride (apomorphine hydrocloride) [^b21cf4fa]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The effectiveness of apomorphine hydrocloride in the acute symptomatic treatment of the recurring episodes of hypomobility, "off" episodes ("end-of-dose wearing off" and unpredictable "on/off" episodes), in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease was established in three randomized, controlled trials of apomorphine hydrocloride given subcutaneously (Studies 1, 2, and 3). At baseline in these trials, the mean duration of Parkinson's disease was approximately 11 years. Whereas all patients were using concomitant L-dopa at baseline, 86% of patients were using a concomitant oral dopaminergic agonist, 31% were using a concomitant catechol-ortho-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor, and 10% were using a concomitant monoamine B oxidase inhibitor. Study 1 was conducted in patients who did not have prior exposure to apomorphine hydrocloride (i.e., apomorphine hydrocloride naïve) and Studies 2 and 3 were conducted in patients with at least 3 months of apomorphine hydrocloride use immediately prior to study enrollment. Almost all patients without prior exposure to apomorphine hydrocloride began taking an antiemetic (trimethobenzamide) three days prior to starting apomorphine hydrocloride and 50% of patients were able to discontinue the concomitant antiemetic, on average 2 months after initiating apomorphine hydrocloride.

The change from baseline in Part III (Motor Examination) of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) served as the primary outcome assessment measure in each study. Part III of the UPDRS contains 14 items designed to assess the severity of the cardinal motor findings (e.g., tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability, etc.) in patients with Parkinson's disease.

5.4 Symptomatic Hypotension

Dopaminergic agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, resulting in postural/orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. Parkinson's disease patients, in addition, appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge. For these reasons, both Parkinson's and Restless Legs Syndrome patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily (1) require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of postural hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and (2) should be informed of this risk.

An increased risk for decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed when supine, standing, and changing from supine to standing position in patients treated with NEUPRO. In patients taking the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose, orthostatic (change from supine to standing) decreases in systolic blood pressure (at least 20 mm Hg or greater) was 16% for NEUPRO and 14% for placebo in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease, 32% for NEUPRO and 27% for placebo in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, and 13% for NEUPRO and 11% for placebo in patients with Restless Legs Syndrome.

More severe decreases in systolic blood pressure (40 mm Hg or greater) and in diastolic blood pressure (20 mm Hg or greater) also occurred more frequently (NEUPRO incidence at least 2% greater than placebo) in patients with early- and advanced-stage Parkinson's disease during measurements when supine, standing, or changing from supine to standing position. Patients experienced dose-related decreases in blood pressure at different times throughout the trial including the final visit.

An analysis using a variety of adverse reaction terms suggestive of orthostatic hypotension, including dizziness/postural dizziness and others, showed an increased risk for all patients treated with NEUPRO. For the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose, the incidence of adverse reactions suggestive of hypotension/orthostatic hypotension was 29% for NEUPRO and 11% for placebo in early-stage Parkinson's disease, 27% for NEUPRO and 23% for placebo in advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, and 8% for NEUPRO and 7% for placebo in Restless Legs Syndrome.

This increased risk for symptomatic hypotension and decreases in blood pressure was observed in a setting in which patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension at baseline had been excluded from this study. The increased risk for significant decreases in blood pressure or orthostatic hypotension occurred especially in the dose escalation/titration period.

The effectiveness of APOKYN in the acute symptomatic treatment of the recurring episodes of hypomobility, "off" episodes ("end-of-dose wearing off" and unpredictable "on/off" episodes), in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease was established in three randomized, controlled trials of APOKYN given subcutaneously (Studies 1, 2, and 3). At baseline in these trials, the mean duration of Parkinson's disease was approximately 11 years. Whereas all patients were using concomitant L-dopa at baseline, 86% of patients were using a concomitant oral dopaminergic agonist, 31% were using a concomitant catechol-ortho-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor, and 10% were using a concomitant monoamine B oxidase inhibitor.

### Tolcapone (Tasmar) [^290b2462]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Fluctuating Patients:

In two 3-month trials, patients with documented episodes of wearing-off phenomena, despite optimum levodopa therapy, were randomized to receive placebo, tolcapone 100 mg tid or 200 mg tid. The formal double-blind portion of the trial was 3 months long, and the primary outcome was a comparison between treatments in the change from baseline in the amount of time spent "On" (a period of relatively good functioning) and "Off" (a period of relatively poor functioning). Patients recorded periodically, throughout the duration of the trial, the time spent in each of these states.

In addition to the primary outcome, patients were also assessed using sub-parts of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), a frequently used multi-item rating scale intended to evaluate mentation (Part I), activities of daily living (Part II), motor function (Part III), complications of therapy (Part IV), and disease staging (Parts V and VI); an Investigator's Global Assessment of Change (IGA), a subjective scale designed to assess global functioning in 5 areas of Parkinson's disease; the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), a multi-item scale in 12 domains designed to assess the patient's functioning in multiple areas; and the change in daily levodopa/carbidopa dose.

In one of the studies, 202 patients were randomized in 11 centers in the United States and Canada. In this trial, all patients were receiving concomitant levodopa and carbidopa. In the second trial, 177 patients were randomized in 24 centers in Europe. In this trial, all patients were receiving concomitant levodopa and benserazide.

The following tables display the results of these 2 trials:

Effects on "Off" time and levodopa dose did not differ by age or sex.

Non-fluctuating Patients:

In this study, 298 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease on stable doses of levodopa/carbidopa who were not experiencing wearing-off phenomena were randomized to placebo, tolcapone 100 mg tid, or tolcapone 200 mg tid for 6 months at 20 centers in the United States and Canada. The primary measure of effectiveness was the Activities of Daily Living portion (Subscale II) of the UPDRS. In addition, the change in daily levodopa dose, other subscales of the UPDRS, and the SIP were assessed as secondary measures. The results are displayed in the following table:

### Challenges in applying the results of clinical trials to clinical practice [^37258208]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

The relevance of clinical trial results to clinical practice hinges on 2 critical questions: Will the results be replicated in one's practice, and Are the results clinically important? The answers to the following 5 questions may help one determine how relevant a study result is to clinical practice. First, have steps been taken to minimize bias (eg, masking, randomization)? Second, is the result likely due to the treatment (vs confounding factors)? Third, is the result unlikely to be due to chance? Fourth, is the study population representative of your patients? Fifth, is the totality of the evidence consistent across studies? To determine if a study result is likely to be clinically important, consider a 3-step approach. In step 1, decide, a priori, what a clinically meaningful difference between 2 treatments would be to define regions of beneficial, harmful, and trivial outcomes. In step 2, determine whether the CIs around the average outcome include the range of beneficial outcomes and lie outside the range of harmful outcomes. In step 3, determine the proportion of patients achieving a clinically meaningful benefit. If the CIs mostly include the range of beneficial outcomes and lie outside the range of clinically harmful outcomes and if a substantial proportion of patients achieve a clinically meaningful benefit, then the intervention is probably clinically important. Application of clinical trial results to clinical practice requires critical analysis of the extant literature as well as good clinical judgment.

### Tremor and parkinsonism in chromosomopathies – A systematic review [^f45a19b9]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

The landscape of genetic forms of Parkinson's diseases (PD) has grown exponentially in recent years. Today, around 10% of PD cases are estimated to be of genetic etiology. However, the link between parkinsonism or tremor and chromosome disorders, both numerical and structural, has been neglected. We reviewed the occurrence and characteristics of parkinsonism and tremor syndromes in patients with chromosomic disorders. We searched PubMed for articles published until December 2018, using the non-MESH terms "Chromosomopathy", "karyotype", "chromosome", "aneuploidy", "deletion", "inversion", "insertion", "duplication", and "Parkinson", "Parkinsonism", "Tremor", and "Parkinsonian disorder". We restricted the search to human studies and selected articles for further analysis after abstract review. Tremor syndromes in which patients had another possible clinical reason for syndromes were excluded, as well as tremor syndromes associated with point mutations, imprinting syndromes, and patients presenting with other hyperkinetic disorders. Fifty-four articles were reviewed. Aneuploidies of sex chromosomes were the most common chromosomopathy. These patients more commonly exhibited postural and kinetic tremor, often meeting the description of essential tremor. In structural chromosomopathies, the most frequent association was PD and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, but we found case reports and case series of several additional deletion and duplication syndromes. © 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

5.10 Application Site Reactions

Application site reactions (ASRs) occurred at a greater frequency in the NEUPRO-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response studies with NEUPRO. For the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose, the incidence of application site reactions was 32% for NEUPRO and 19% for placebo in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease, 36% for NEUPRO and 13% for placebo in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, and 43% for NEUPRO and 4% for placebo in patients with Restless Legs Syndrome. ASRs exhibited a dose-dependent relationship for all doses for patients with early- and advanced-stage Parkinson's disease and Restless Legs Syndrome. ASRs were also of sufficient severity to cause study discontinuation for patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease (NEUPRO 3% vs. placebo 0%), advanced-stage Parkinson's disease (NEUPRO 2% vs. placebo 0%), and Restless Legs Syndrome (NEUPRO 12% vs. placebo 0%) who were treated with the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose.

The signs and symptoms of these reactions generally were localized erythema, edema, or pruritus limited to the patch area and usually did not lead to dose reduction. Generalized skin reactions (e.g., allergic rash, including erythematous, macular-papular rash, or pruritus) have been reported at lower rates than ASRs during the development of NEUPRO.

In a clinical study designed to investigate the cumulative skin irritation of NEUPRO, daily rotation of NEUPRO application sites has been shown to reduce the incidence of ASRs in comparison to repetitive application to the same site. In a clinical study investigating the skin sensitizing potential of NEUPRO in 221 healthy subjects, no case of contact sensitization was observed. Localized sensitization reactions were observed in a study with healthy subjects by continuously rotating a 0.5 mg/24 hours transdermal system, after induction of maximal irritational stress was achieved by repetitive transdermal system application to the same site.

If a patient reports a persistent application site reaction (of more than a few days), reports an increase in severity, or reports a skin reaction spreading outside the application site, an assessment of the risk and benefits for the individual patient should be conducted. If a generalized skin reaction associated with the use of NEUPRO is observed, NEUPRO should be discontinued.

### The minimum clinically important difference: which direction to take [^6f23be78]. European Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Over the past decades in modern medicine, there has been a shift from statistical significance to clinical relevance when it comes to interpreting results from clinical trials. A concept that is increasingly being used as a surrogate for clinical relevance and effect size calculation is the minimum clinically important difference. In this paper, an overview is presented of the most important aspects of theconcept used in research trials and a discussion of what this means for the neurological patient in clinical trials and daily practice is given. Is thethe best outcome measure cut‐off to be implemented?

Could anything have been done differently to reach the correct diagnosis sooner? (Missed diagnostic opportunity studies)

Missed diagnostic opportunities are pre-diagnosis healthcare contacts where post-hoc judgement indicates that alternative decisions or actions could have led to more timely diagnosis. The majority of missed diagnostic opportunities are expected to occur within the diagnostic window and relate to patients with suboptimal diagnostic pathways and prolonged diagnostic intervals. However, there is little empirical research currently demonstrating this.

A current challenge is the unresolved balance between identifying missed diagnostic opportunities both accurately and objectively. One method of identifying missed diagnostic opportunities is manual clinical review, but this requires resources that limit scalability beyond clinical audit projects.

A second method is to define markers of missed diagnostic opportunities in EHR data. Such phenotypic rules – also termed 'e-triggers' - typically incorporate the documented occurrence of an event, combined with a time period during which a subsequent action ought to have followed. This allows estimation of the prevalence of a specific missed diagnostic opportunity, but requires prior knowledge of relevant markers.

A third approach is to consider any contacts within the diagnostic window where relevant symptoms have occurred - above those expected coincidentally - as missed diagnostic opportunities. This gives a proxy marker for missed opportunities and still requires manual clinical review to determine whether any individual instance was truly a missed diagnostic opportunity.

Identifying missed diagnostic opportunities can provide both patient- and population- level insight into diagnostic quality and safety incidents that are taking place and their frequency. This could allow for fast and targeted action to improve the diagnostic process. However, any approach incorporating a clinical review component may be subject to hindsight bias – that is, the clinician's awareness of the patient's outcome may affect their judgement of whether a missed diagnostic opportunity occurred.

### Clinical consensus methodology [^b3ed17fb]. ACOG (2021). High credibility.

ACOG clinical consensus methodology — evidence review for clinical consensus describes how literature is searched, screened, prioritized, and mapped to support recommendations. Just before publication submission, a final supplemental literature search is performed, and study inclusion and exclusion criteria are developed by the authoring team members, committee leadership, and the methodologist; titles and abstracts are screened by staff with priority given to high-quality systematic reviews, published evidence-based guidelines by clinical or public health organizations, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and observational studies. Authors complete full-text review based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria with standardized reasons for article exclusion, and the development process does not involve a risk of bias analysis or grading of the evidence. After identifying a final list of relevant studies and guidelines, ACOG staff develop summary evidence maps that provide a concise display organized by the hierarchy of evidence (systematic reviews, RCTs, observational studies, case studies, and narrative reviews), summarize guidelines from professional societies and other relevant stakeholders, and are used by the writing team and committee when developing full recommendation statements and descriptions of supportive evidence.

Key learning points on equity across ancestries emphasize that at this time, there is no PRS that has been shown to deliver equally informative and accurate results to individuals across genetic ancestries; the extent to which differences are clinically and ethically meaningful should be decided through inclusive community partnerships and context experts, and decisions may consider the availability, or lack thereof, of alternative risk tools, because this has the potential to exacerbate existing health disparities.

We also performed the first‐of‐its‐kind single‐population transcriptomic analysis comparing the genetic signature of tangle‐bearing neurons between DS with and without dementia. This study provided evidence for a different genetic signature between these groups suggesting a possible biomarker strategy. In a separate set of experiments, DSBC investigators showed early and prominent tau binding in the frontal cortex of persons with DS‐AD compared to EOAD or LOAD in the general population using two different tau positron emission tomography (PET) tracers.DSBC investigators analyzed the development of different cellular phenotypes in the cerebellum, frontal cortex, and hippocampus in pre‐ and postnatal DS cases. Members of the consortium published several biomarker papers, and articles in Nature Neurology Reviews. The findings obtained with the support of the DSBC have been presented at several conferences and workshops (e.g. International Conference for T21 Research Society, https://www.t21rs.org). Overall, the development of the DSBC has resulted in numerous DS publications and grant funding and has provided the impetus for increased international collaborations in this underinvestigated area of research.
