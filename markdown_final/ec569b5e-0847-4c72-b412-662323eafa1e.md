## Question

29 y/o female, 6 months postpartum, presents for her annual physical exam. She reports experiencing low energy over the past several months. She denies sleep disturbances, depressive symptoms, or mood changes. The patient expresses concern about possible anemia, citing a history of low iron levels. Additionally, she reports persistent onychomycosis affecting her toenails, which has not improved with OTC topical treatments. She is requesting further evaluation and treatment options for both her fatigue and toenail condition.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for further evaluation and treatment options for a 29-year-old, 6-month postpartum woman with several months of fatigue, a history of low iron, and persistent toenail onychomycosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely etiologies of fatigue in a postpartum, reproductive-age woman, with iron deficiency top of mind. Then, I should verify the optimal diagnostic workup, including ferritin thresholds and hemoglobin cutoffs. Next, I will consider evidence-based treatment options for iron deficiency, including when intravenous iron might be appropriate, accounting for postpartum and potential lactation. After that, I need to confirm the diagnosis and management of onychomycosis, including laboratory confirmation and the relative efficacy of systemic antifungals. Finally, I will integrate safety considerations and follow-up planning to ensure a coherent care plan supported by data [^111vsMJh] [^111CSb5S] [^115RD9ae].

> Let me first confirm the dominant clinical hypothesis for fatigue in this context. In reproductive-age women, iron deficiency — often due to menstrual blood loss and the cumulative demands of pregnancy — is the leading cause, and symptoms can include fatigue even without frank anemia, which aligns with her history of "low iron" and postpartum status at 6 months, when iron stores may still be depleted if not fully repleted after delivery [^111vsMJh].

> Wait, I should not jump to conclusions without quantifying bleeding and contraceptive context. I need to check whether her menses have returned and whether bleeding is heavy or prolonged, because heavy menstrual bleeding is the most common cause of iron deficiency in nonpregnant reproductive-age women; in addition, if she is using depot medroxyprogesterone (depo-subQ Provera 104), irregular and sometimes heavy bleeding is common in the first months and could exacerbate iron loss, so I should ask specifically about timing and pattern since initiation or resumption postpartum [^111vsMJh] [^1163EfMz].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup. I will now examine CBC with indices, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and reticulocyte hemoglobin if available, because ferritin is the most specific single test for iron deficiency and low ferritin is diagnostic; I should double-check thresholds, noting that cost-effectiveness modeling favors a ferritin cutoff of 25 μg/L for reproductive-age women, while defining anemia still hinges on population-based hemoglobin thresholds and clinical context, which I must interpret alongside MCV and inflammatory markers when needed [^117DAZ26] [^117QGSNP] [^111vsMJh].

> Hold on, let me verify guideline scope so I don't misapply recommendations. I initially thought about USPSTF statements on screening and supplementation in pregnancy, but wait, those 2024 recommendations specifically judge the evidence insufficient for routine screening or supplementation to improve maternal-infant outcomes during pregnancy; that does not directly address postpartum women, so in this postpartum case I should use clinical judgment guided by symptoms, risk factors, and lab results rather than assuming a population screening recommendation applies here [^116sxWaM] [^1161mpbm] [^116yqCLm].

> For treatment, let me think about stepwise options. I should confirm tolerance for oral iron first, since it is typically first-line, but if she has significant symptoms, intolerance, malabsorption, or needs faster repletion, intravenous iron is reasonable; importantly, randomized data show IV iron improves iron indices and fatigue scores in nonanemic iron-deficient women, and in late pregnancy ferric carboxymaltose reduces anemia rates and postpartum iron deficiency compared with oral iron, though I need to ensure product-specific safety in the postpartum period and verify breastfeeding status before selecting an IV formulation [^111raZcN] [^116Uwwva] [^1163zkCT].

> I should confirm that I'm not overlooking alternative or concurrent causes of fatigue. Let me consider gastrointestinal blood loss, impaired absorption, and chronic inflammatory conditions like IBD, CKD, or HF, as well as medication contributors such as NSAIDs or PPIs, because these are established contributors to iron deficiency in adults; although she denies mood symptoms, I should still screen for postpartum depression and sleep disruption, while tailoring additional testing based on history and examination findings [^111vsMJh].

> Turning to the nail problem, I need to check the diagnosis objectively. Prior to systemic therapy for onychomycosis, I should obtain nail clippings for KOH preparation and fungal culture (or histology) to confirm dermatophyte infection, because FDA labeling for itraconazole specifically recommends laboratory confirmation before initiating treatment, and this step prevents unnecessary exposure to systemic antifungals in nonfungal dystrophies [^115RD9ae].

> For pharmacotherapy, let me review efficacy evidence. Oral terbinafine for 12 weeks is the reference standard for toenail onychomycosis, with randomized trials showing approximately 70% mycologic cure at 48 weeks and clinically meaningful composite outcomes, while itraconazole is also FDA-indicated for onychomycosis and has established pulse regimens for fingernails, with continuous therapy used for toenails; I should verify lactation safety before prescribing systemic agents, given potential drug transfer into breast milk and the need to balance maternal benefit with infant exposure [^111CSb5S] [^115RD9ae] [^112beuJu].

> Let me integrate this into a practical plan and double-check each step against the evidence. I will obtain CBC, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and related indices to confirm iron deficiency and severity; if ferritin is below approximately 25 μg/L or if iron-deficiency anemia is present, I will initiate iron repletion, starting with oral iron if tolerated and considering IV iron for intolerance, malabsorption, or rapid repletion needs, using data that support improved iron indices and fatigue with IV therapy while confirming postpartum and breastfeeding safety of the chosen product; in parallel, I will quantify menstrual bleeding and review contraception to address ongoing iron loss; finally, I will confirm onychomycosis with KOH and culture and, if positive, discuss oral terbinafine as first-line for toenails, verifying lactation considerations before prescribing and arranging follow-up to assess response and lab parameters, adjusting therapy as needed based on results and tolerability [^111vsMJh] [^117DAZ26] [^111raZcN] [^115RD9ae] [^111CSb5S].

---

The patient's fatigue is most likely due to **iron deficiency** given her postpartum status and history of low iron, even without anemia [^111vsMJh]. For onychomycosis, **oral terbinafine** is first-line for toenail disease [^111CSb5S], with itraconazole as an alternative [^115RD9ae]; topical agents are generally ineffective for toenails. Recommended evaluation includes CBC, ferritin, TSH, and metabolic panel; treat iron deficiency with oral ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily with vitamin C, reassess in 4–6 weeks, and consider IV iron if intolerant or unresponsive. Confirm onychomycosis with KOH/culture [^115RD9ae], monitor LFTs during systemic therapy, and counsel on recurrence prevention.

## Evaluation of fatigue

### Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis for **postpartum fatigue** includes:

- **Iron deficiency anemia**: Common postpartum due to blood loss and increased iron demands [^111vsMJh].

- **Thyroid dysfunction**: Postpartum thyroiditis or hypothyroidism.

- **Vitamin deficiencies**: B12, folate, vitamin D.

- **Chronic infections**: EBV, CMV, hepatitis.

- **Chronic fatigue syndrome**: Less likely without sleep or mood disturbances.

Given her history and postpartum status, **iron deficiency** is the most likely etiology [^111vsMJh].

---

### Recommended laboratory evaluation

The **initial laboratory evaluation** should include:

| **Test** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| CBC with differential | Assess hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, RDW, WBC, platelets |
| Iron studies (ferritin, serum iron, TIBC, transferrin saturation) | Confirm iron deficiency [^117QGSNP] |
| Thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4) | Screen for thyroid dysfunction |
| Vitamin B12 and folate levels | Evaluate for deficiencies |
| Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) | Assess liver, renal function, electrolytes |
| CRP or ESR | Screen for inflammation/infection |

---

### Interpretation of results

**Iron deficiency anemia** is characterized by low hemoglobin and MCV, low ferritin and transferrin saturation, and high TIBC. **Iron deficiency without anemia** presents with normal hemoglobin but low ferritin and low transferrin saturation. **Thyroid dysfunction** is reflected by abnormal TSH and free T4.

---

## Management of iron deficiency anemia

### Oral iron supplementation

- **First-line therapy**: Ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily with vitamin C to enhance absorption.

- **Monitoring**: Recheck hemoglobin and ferritin in 4–6 weeks.

- **Duration**: Continue until ferritin > 50 ng/mL and hemoglobin normalizes.

---

### Intravenous iron therapy

**Intravenous iron** is indicated if oral iron is not tolerated, absorption is impaired, or deficiency is severe; options include ferric carboxymaltose or iron sucrose.

---

## Evaluation and management of onychomycosis

### Diagnostic confirmation

Confirm onychomycosis with **KOH preparation and fungal culture**, which also identify the causative organism [^115RD9ae].

---

### Treatment options

#### Topical therapy

Topical therapy has **limited efficacy** and is generally ineffective for toenail onychomycosis; efinaconazole or tavaborole may be used in mild cases or when oral therapy is contraindicated.

---

#### Systemic therapy

- **First-line therapy**: Oral terbinafine 250 mg daily for 12 weeks [^111CSb5S].

- **Alternative therapy**: Itraconazole 200 mg daily for 12 weeks or pulse dosing [^115RD9ae] [^112beuJu].

- **Monitoring**: Baseline and periodic LFTs during therapy.

---

### Adjunctive measures

Adjunctive measures include **keeping nails short, dry, and clean**; foot hygiene — for example, using antifungal powders and avoiding shared footwear — can reduce reinfection. Recurrence prevention relies on regular monitoring and consistent hygiene.

---

## Patient counseling and follow-up

### Counseling points

Counsel on **iron deficiency** by reviewing causes, symptoms, and the importance of treatment adherence [^111vsMJh]. Discuss onychomycosis expectations — prolonged therapy, recurrence risk, and hygiene measures — and emphasize medication adherence and the need for monitoring [^111CSb5S].

---

### Follow-up plan

For iron deficiency, **recheck labs in 4–6 weeks** and adjust therapy accordingly. For onychomycosis, monitor liver function tests, assess clinical response, and address recurrence as needed.

---

The patient's fatigue is most likely due to **iron deficiency** [^111vsMJh], and onychomycosis requires **systemic therapy** [^111CSb5S]. A structured evaluation and management plan will address both conditions effectively.

### Sporanox [^115RD9ae]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Sporanox® (itraconazole) capsules are indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in both immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients: blastomycosis, both pulmonary and extrapulmonary; histoplasmosis, including chronic cavitary pulmonary disease and disseminated, non-meningeal histoplasmosis; and aspergillosis, both pulmonary and extrapulmonary, particularly in patients who are intolerant or refractory to amphotericin B therapy.

Specimens for fungal cultures, along with other relevant laboratory studies such as wet mounts, histopathology, and serology, should be obtained before initiating therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may begin before the results of these cultures and studies are known, though once results are available, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

Additionally, Sporanox® capsules are indicated for treating the following fungal infections in non-immunocompromised patients: onychomycosis of the toenail, with or without fingernail involvement, due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium), and onychomycosis of the fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium).

Prior to initiating treatment, appropriate nail specimens for laboratory testing (such as KOH preparation, fungal culture, or nail biopsy) should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of onychomycosis.

- **Blastomycosis**: Analyses were conducted on data from two open-label, non-concurrently controlled studies to evaluate its effectiveness.

### Iron deficiency in adults: A review [^111vsMJh]. JAMA (2025). Low credibility.

Absolute iron deficiency, defined as low iron stores with or without anemia, affects approximately 2 billion people worldwide and 14% of adults in the U.S. Iron-deficiency anemia, characterized by low hemoglobin due to low iron stores, affects approximately 1.2 billion people globally, including 10 million in the U.S.

Absolute iron deficiency progresses from low iron stores to iron-deficiency anemia. Individuals with nonanemic iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anemia may be asymptomatic or experience fatigue, irritability, depression, difficulty concentrating, restless legs syndrome (32%-40%), pica (40%-50%), dyspnea, lightheadedness, exercise intolerance, and worsening heart failure (HF). Symptom prevalences vary depending on age, comorbidities (e.g. chronic kidney disease [CKD], HF), and the severity and rate of development of iron deficiency.

The most common causes of iron deficiency include bleeding (menstrual, gastrointestinal), impaired iron absorption (atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, bariatric surgical procedures), inadequate dietary iron intake, and pregnancy. In high-income countries, approximately 38% of nonpregnant, reproductive-age women have iron deficiency without anemia, and about 13% have iron-deficiency anemia. During the third trimester of pregnancy, iron deficiency affects up to 84% of pregnant women, based on data from high-income countries.

Additional risk factors include the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD [13%-90%]), and other chronic inflammatory conditions such as CKD (24%-85%) and HF (37%-61%).

### Terbinafine hydrochloride [^111CSb5S]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of terbinafine tablets in treating onychomycosis is illustrated by the response of subjects with toenail and/or fingernail infections who participated in three US/Canadian placebo-controlled clinical trials.

- **First toenail trial**: Results assessed at week 48 (12 weeks of treatment followed by 36 weeks of follow-up) demonstrated a mycological cure, defined as the simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 70% of subjects. Fifty-nine percent of subjects experienced effective treatment, characterized by a mycological cure plus either 0% nail involvement or more than 5 mm of new unaffected nail growth. Additionally, 38% of subjects demonstrated both a mycological cure and clinical cure (0% nail involvement).

- **Second toenail trial**: Conducted on cases of dermatophytic onychomycosis where nondermatophytes were also cultured, similar efficacy against dermatophytes was demonstrated. The pathogenic role of the nondermatophytes in the presence of dermatophytic onychomycosis remains unestablished, and the clinical significance of this association is unknown.

- **Fingernail trial**: Results assessed at week 24 (6 weeks of treatment with an 18-week follow-up) demonstrated mycological cure in 79% of subjects, effective treatment in 75% of subjects, and both mycological and clinical cure in 59% of subjects.

The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months for the first toenail trial and 4 months for the fingernail trial.

### Screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: Updated evidence report and systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force [^116sxWaM]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, particularly concerning pregnant patients, the USPSTF 2024 guidelines recommend that current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in pregnant females to prevent adverse maternal and infant health outcomes.

### Cost-effectiveness of ferritin screening thresholds for iron deficiency in reproductive-age women [^117DAZ26]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of both an annual ferritin-based screening strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency (ID) versus no screening, and that of a more physiologically relevant higher ferritin threshold from a US healthcare system perspective. Our results across dual base-case, sensitivity, and scenario analyses indicate that ID screening with a ferritin cut-off of 25 μg/L is a cost-effective intervention that improves quality-adjusted life expectancy in reproductive-age women compared to screening at 15 μg/L (WHO diagnostic standard) or no screening, regardless of the route of iron supplementation. We posit that the low incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) found across our analyses are driven primarily by the relatively low cost of both ID screening and treatment, the specificity of ferritin-based testing for ID, alongside the benefit to health-related quality-of-life from correction of ID for reproductive-age women. This benefit is mediated by a greater proportion of women being accurately diagnosed and treated for ID at a higher ferritin threshold. It remains robust with a marginal increase in utility from ID treatment and with a maximum cost of additional diagnostic work-up for ID that is far below what reproductive-age women experience.

Our model results extend the existing literature in several ways. First, we add to the large body of evidence and calls from clinicians across specialties for regular ferritin-based screening of ID, despite the lack of such guidance from either the US Preventative Service Task Force (USPSTF) or Centers for Disease Control. This urgent need is underscored by…

The 2024 guidelines from the USPSTF address the prevention and management of iron deficiency anemia, particularly in pregnant patients. It is recommended that there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine supplementation for iron deficiency and IDA in pregnant females to prevent adverse maternal and infant health outcomes.

### Rapid reviews methods series: assessing the appropriateness of conducting a rapid review [^116VnqFN]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

- **Conceptual factors**: Why is a rapid review (RR) needed, and what are the potential risks to the populations being studied if the evidence is incomplete? When considering the need for an RR, examining the event or situation driving the request is crucial. RRs have demonstrated utility in informing urgent health issues, such as rapidly spreading infectious diseases, where immediate access to evidence is crucial for decision-making. However, conducting an RR comes with risks if the evidence base is incomplete, potentially leading to suboptimal decision-making. Balancing the need for timely evidence synthesis and ensuring completeness is vital to minimize potential negative impacts on target populations.

- **Novelty of events**: Is there a need for an RR based on a 'novel' event? RRs may be beneficial for reviewing evidence in cases of new events, such as introducing treatment interventions, detecting new virus strains, considering new distinct outcomes, or introducing new technologies. Depending on the degree of novelty, one should assess whether to rapidly review what could be a limited or premature literature base or to conduct a full systematic review (SR).

- **Decision-making uncertainty**: Is there significant uncertainty for decision-makers as to the best position to take? RRs can be valuable when facing uncertainty and time constraints in decision-making. Decision-makers may need clarification about the best course of action.

### Percocet [^114Xd5Yt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Safe reduction or discontinuation of oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets and oral solution is critical. Do not abruptly discontinue Percocet in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in these patients has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. It is also associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which can be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may resort to treating their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.

When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking Percocet, several factors should be considered. These include the total daily dose of opioid (including Percocet) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the patient's physical and psychological attributes. It is important to provide ongoing care and establish an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan to ensure patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. If opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient or refer them for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder.

### Identification and management of preoperative anaemia in adults: A British Society for Haematology guideline update [^113amRvu]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

For patients undergoing surgery, particularly in the context of iron deficiency anemia, the British Society for Haematology (BSH) 2024 guidelines recommend considering the referral of patients with unexplained anemia without iron deficiency. This is guided by the severity of anemia, defined as hemoglobin levels below 120 g/L for males and below 100 g/L for females, or by locally agreed criteria. It is important to recognize that the risk of a serious cause or haemoglobinopathy correlates with the severity of the anemia.

### Strategies for improving vaccine communication and uptake [^111jLvej]. Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Vaccines have led to a significant decrease in rates of vaccine-preventable diseases and have made a considerable impact on the health of children. However, some parents express concerns about vaccine safety and the necessity of vaccines. The concerns of parents range from hesitancy about some immunizations to refusal of all vaccines. This clinical report provides information about the scope and impact of the problem, the facts surrounding common vaccination concerns, and the latest evidence regarding effective communication techniques for the vaccine conversation.

Readers can expect to understand concepts and underlying determinants of vaccine uptake and vaccine hesitancy. Additionally, they will gain insights into the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and the costs of preventable medical care. Finally, the report helps recognize and address specific concerns (e.g. vaccine safety) with caregivers when hesitancy is present.

### Increlex [^113DpYfs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hypoglycemia**: Severe hypoglycemia leading to hypoglycemic seizures has been observed with INCRELEX treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Because INCRELEX has insulin-like hypoglycemic effects, it should be administered shortly before or after (± 20 minutes) a meal or snack. Glucose monitoring and INCRELEX dose titration are recommended until a well-tolerated dose is established [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] and subsequently as medically indicated. Special attention should be paid to small children because their oral intake may not be consistent. Patients should avoid engaging in any high-risk activities (e.g. driving, exercise, etc) within 2 to 3 hours after dosing, particularly during the initiation of INCRELEX treatment until tolerability and a stable dose have been established [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. INCRELEX should not be administered when the meal or snack is omitted. The dose of INCRELEX should never be increased to make up for one or more omitted doses.

- **Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis**: Allergic reactions to INCRELEX have been reported post-marketing. These range from localized (injection site) reactions to systemic reactions, including anaphylaxis requiring hospitalization. Parents and patients should be informed that such reactions are possible, and if a systemic allergic reaction occurs, treatment should be interrupted and prompt medical attention should be sought [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.3)].

### Exjade [^114NrWet]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Six hundred twenty-seven (627) patients with MDS were enrolled across five uncontrolled trials. Two hundred thirty-nine (239) of these patients participated in trials that limited enrollment to patients with IPSS Low or Intermediate 1 risk MDS, while the remaining 388 patients were enrolled in trials that did not specify MDS risk stratification but required a life expectancy of greater than one year.

The planned duration of treatment in these trials ranged from one year for 365 patients to five years for 47 patients. These trials evaluated the effects of Exjade therapy on parameters of iron overload, including LIC (125 patients) and serum ferritin (627 patients). The percentage of patients completing the planned duration of treatment was 51% in the largest one-year study, 52% in the three-year study, and 22% in the five-year study.

- **Major causes for treatment discontinuation**: Withdrawal of consent, adverse reactions, and death.

Over one year of follow-up across these pooled studies, the mean change in serum ferritin was -332.8 (± 2615.59) mcg/L (n = 593), and the mean change in LIC was -5.9 (± 8.32) mg Fe/g dw (n = 68). Results of these pooled studies in 627 patients with MDS suggest a progressive decrease in serum ferritin and LIC beyond one year in those patients who are able to continue Exjade.

### Methoxsalen [^115D1R25]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Caution: Methoxsalen capsules, USP represent a new dose form of methoxsalen. This new dosage form exhibits significantly greater bioavailability and earlier photosensitization onset time than previous methoxsalen dosage forms. Each patient should be evaluated by determining the minimum phototoxic dose (MPD) and phototoxic peak time after drug administration prior to onset of photochemotherapy with this dosage form. Human bioavailability studies have indicated the following drug dosage and administration directions are to be used as a guideline only.

- **Psoriasis therapy**:

1. **Drug dosage - Initial therapy**: Methoxsalen capsules should be taken 1–1/2 to 2 hours before UVA exposure with some low-fat food or milk according to the following table. Geriatric patients should generally be started at the low end of the dose recommended according to body weight and closely monitored during PUVA therapy. Although clinical experience has not identified differences in response between elderly and younger patients, the use of methoxsalen in older individuals may be affected by the presence of pre-existing medical conditions.

2. **Initial exposure**: The initial UVA exposure energy level and corresponding time of exposure is determined by the patient's skin characteristics for sun burning and tanning as follows: if the MPD is done, start at 1/2 MPD.

Additional drug dosage directions are as follows:

- **Weight change**: In the event that the weight of a patient changes during treatment such that he/she falls into an adjacent weight range/dose category, adjustments should be made accordingly.

### High prevalence of undiagnosed iron deficiency in endometriosis patients: A cross-sectional study [^115s13gR]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) contribute a significant disease burden worldwide. Globally, there were over 1.2 billion cases of IDA in 2016. Symptoms of ID include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, irritability, decreased stamina, dyspnea, sleep disturbances, poor concentration, and depression. Interestingly, there is a striking similarity between these symptoms and those associated with endometriosis.

Endometriosis is a common condition characterized by pain and infertility. It is known to have a profound negative impact on quality of life. Fatigue is a well-characterized and common symptom of endometriosis. The prevalence of fatigue in the endometriosis population is significantly higher compared to the general female population. The similarity in symptoms reported by patients with endometriosis and ID raises the question of whether symptoms such as fatigue, depression, and sleep disturbance in patients with endometriosis are related to the disease itself, or whether there is a contribution from another underlying mechanism, such as ID/IDA.

Our primary objective was to evaluate the prevalence of undiagnosed ID in patients with endometriosis. Secondary objectives included evaluating the prevalence of IDA in patients with endometriosis and evaluating symptoms of ID and endometriosis in this population using validated patient-reported outcome tools.

### Harms, risks and opportunities of uncertainty: It is not as toxic as we think [^111mcbLN]. Seminars in Perinatology (2025). Low credibility.

Uncertainty is ubiquitous in neonatal medicine, often reflecting incomplete knowledge of diagnoses, prognosis, and optimal treatments. It profoundly influences decision-making and the relationships between parents and clinicians. Despite its pervasiveness, uncertainty is often perceived as toxic, conflictive, and something to be eliminated or minimized. However, when acknowledged and accepted, it can become a source of hope and a foundation for trust between parents and clinicians.

This article explores the existing literature on uncertainty in antenatal decision-making organized around three themes.

- **Harms**: We highlight the challenges uncertainty poses for both parents and clinicians, including its potential to create conflict, feelings of loss, regret, and bias.
- **Opportunities**: We emphasize the importance for clinicians to understand and embrace uncertainty to support parents, facilitate honest and balanced communication, and build trusting relationships.
- **Recommendations**: We acknowledge the need for more research on effective strategies to help productively navigate uncertainty and propose an approach to supporting parents by positively leveraging the inherent uncertainty in antenatal medical decision-making.

### Pomalyst [^111NX8Qc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In the trials conducted for multiple myeloma (MM), data from two separate studies were evaluated.

- **Trial 1**: Data were collected from 219 patients (safety population), where 112 patients received treatment with POMALYST + low-dose dexamethasone (Dex) and 107 patients received POMALYST alone. The median number of treatment cycles was 5. Sixty-seven percent of patients required a dose interruption of either drug due to adverse reactions, and 42% experienced a dose reduction for the same reason. The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 11%.

- **Trial 2**: This study involved 450 patients (safety population). Of these, 300 patients received POMALYST + low-dose Dex, whereas 150 patients were administered high-dose dexamethasone (high-dose Dex). For the POMALYST + low-dose Dex arm, the median number of treatment cycles was 5. It was found that 67% of patients experienced a dose interruption of POMALYST, with the median time to the first dose interruption being 4.1 weeks. Moreover, 27% of patients required a dose reduction, with the median time to the first dose reduction being 4.5 weeks. Discontinuation of POMALYST due to adverse reactions occurred in 8% of patients.

The adverse reactions reported in Trials 1 and 2 are summarized in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia from age 6 months to 65 years: estimates from international data sources [^117QGSNP]. The Lancet Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, we defined statistical thresholds on the basis of the fifth centile of the distribution of haemoglobin values in a healthy reference population, rather than functional thresholds that indicate the risk of symptoms or disease; future studies could endeavour to develop functional thresholds. Studies that measured other iron indices, such as transferrin saturation, reticulocyte haemoglobin, soluble transferrin receptor, and hepcidin in clinically healthy populations, might have provided a more holistic picture of iron status.

Scarce data were available on heavy menstrual bleeding, although this common syndrome would likely influence haemoglobin through its effects on ferritin concentration, which we measured in every case. Vitamin B12 and folate measurements were not consistently included in these datasets. Because we sought to use datasets in which clinical data were available and applied conservative exclusion criteria, this approach precluded the use of cross-sectional datasets from many low-income settings where clinical information was scarce. Undetected subclinical or reClinical illnesses causing inflammation could have suppressed haemoglobin concentrations, potentially leading to an underestimation of thresholds. We were able to use datasets from North and South America, Europe, Australia, South and East Asia, but not sub-Saharan Africa. Most participants were excluded from the healthy reference population because of clinical or biological factors that could affect their haemoglobin concentrations.

### High prevalence of undiagnosed iron deficiency in endometriosis patients: A cross-sectional study [^115tUY2N]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). High credibility.

The present study provides insight into the high prevalence of iron deficiency (ID), which remains undiagnosed in over half of patients with endometriosis presenting to a gynecologist. The impact of ID on symptoms and quality of life in endometriosis patients warrants further investigation, though we found that ID is associated with fatigue, a common symptom experienced by endometriosis patients. Similarly, Ramin‐Wright et al. showed that fatigue was experienced by over half of patients diagnosed with endometriosis (50.7% vs. 22.4%, p < 0.001). In a survey of over 26,000 women with a self‐reported diagnosis of endometriosis utilizing validated questionnaires, over 53% reported fatigue, which resulted in significant productivity impairments. Future research should focus on assessing the effectiveness of iron therapy (oral and/or intravenous) in improving symptoms, specifically fatigue, and overall well‐being in this population.

- **Strengths and weaknesses of the study**: The strengths of this study include its multi‐center study design and relatively large sample size that was consecutively recruited. By excluding patients with any suggestion of a known diagnosis of ID/IDA, we were able to ascertain a realistic prevalence of undiagnosed ID in our population. However, our findings must be interpreted in the context of the cross‐sectional study design, which precludes the use of matched controls, the assessment of causal effects, and potentially limits the generalizability to all populations. Nonetheless, the cosmopolitan make‐up of our city is reflected in the diversity of ethnicities seen in the study.

### Effect of intravenous iron therapy on exercise performance, fatigue scores and mood states in iron-deficient recreationally active females of reproductive age: a double-blind, randomised control trial (IRONWOMAN Trial) [^111raZcN]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Non-anaemic iron deficiency (IDNA) is highly prevalent in exercising females. Although iron therapy can be used to correct this issue, its impact on exercise performance is equivocal. Our aim was to assess the efficacy of intravenous iron therapy on exercise performance, fatigue, mood states, and quality of life in recreationally active IDNA females of reproductive age.

- **Methods**: Twenty-six recreationally active IDNA females were randomized to either an intravenous iron treatment (IRON) group or placebo (PLA). Prior to, 4 days, and 4 weeks following intervention, participants completed a variety of assessments to determine changes in exercise performance, hemoglobin mass, blood iron status, hematology, fatigue levels, mood states, and quality of life.

- **Results**: Intravenous iron therapy significantly improved serum ferritin, serum iron, and transferrin saturation (p < 0.05), with a highly variable individual response. No differences were observed between groups' peak oxygen consumption (V̇O2Peak), lactate threshold, or hemoglobin mass. Running economy improved in IRON from baseline to 4 weeks (p < 0.05), which was also different from PLA at 4 weeks (p < 0.05). Fatigue scores improved in IRON but not PLA after 4 weeks (p < 0.05). Mood states and quality of life remained unchanged in both groups over the trial.

- **Conclusion**: In recreationally active IDNA females, intravenous iron therapy corrects iron status and improves both exercise economy and fatigue scores after 4 weeks.

### Depo-subQ Provera [^1163EfMz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Depression**: Depression was reported in 3% of patients treated with depo-subQ Provera 104 and included other mood disorders as observed in clinical trials. Patients with a history of depression or those undergoing treatment for depression may face an increased risk of depression recurrence or exacerbation, as well as associated mood disorders while receiving depo-subQ Provera 104. Therefore, it is advised that these patients be monitored for symptoms of depression and mood changes.

- **Injection site reactions**: In five clinical studies of depo-subQ Provera 104 involving 2,325 women (with 282 treated for up to 6 months, 1,780 treated for up to 1 year, and 263 treated for up to 2 years), 5% reported injection site reactions such as pain, tenderness, nodule or lump, lipodystrophy, and discoloration. Additionally, 1% experienced persistent atrophy, indentation, or dimpling. These injection site reactions have also been documented in post-marketing experience.

- **Bleeding irregularities**: Most women using depo-subQ Provera 104 experienced changes in menstrual bleeding patterns, which included amenorrhea, irregular unpredictable spotting or bleeding, prolonged spotting or bleeding, or heavy bleeding. With longer-term use, more women experienced amenorrhea, which is consistent with the expected endometrial thinning effects. In three contraception trials, 39% of 2,053 women treated with depo-subQ Provera 104 experienced amenorrhea by Month 6, and 57% experienced amenorrhea by Month 12.

### Sporanox [^112beuJu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Analyses were conducted on data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N = 73 total; 37 given SPORANOX® Capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the fingernails received a 1-week course (pulse) of 200 mg of SPORANOX® Capsules b.i.d., followed by a 3-week period without SPORANOX®. This was followed by a second 1-week pulse of 200 mg of SPORANOX® Capsules b.i.d. Results demonstrated mycologic cure in 61% of patients. Fifty-six percent (56%) of patients were considered an overall success, and 47% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure. The mean time to overall success was approximately 5 months. None of the patients who achieved overall success relapsed.

### Ibandronate sodium [^114u7oh6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Indications and usage**: Ibandronate sodium injection is a bisphosphonate indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

- **Limitations of use**: Optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use.

- **Treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis**: Ibandronate sodium injection increases bone mineral density (BMD) and reduces the incidence of vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [see Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Important limitations of use**: The safety and effectiveness of ibandronate sodium injection for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of one-year duration. The optimal duration of use has not been determined. All patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated periodically. Patients at low risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

### Prolia [^111kq532]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures**: Atypical low energy or low trauma fractures of the shaft have been reported in patients receiving Prolia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with antiresorptive agents. Atypical femoral fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral, and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g. prednisone) at the time of fracture. During Prolia treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. Any patient who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of Prolia therapy should be considered, pending a benefit-risk assessment, on an individual basis.

- **Multiple vertebral fractures (MVF) following discontinuation of Prolia treatment**

### Acceptability of the dapivirine vaginal ring and oral Truvada among African users in late-stage of pregnancy [^115YntBB]. AIDS and Behavior (2024). Low credibility.

Another key finding from these data was the importance of clinical and counseling staff addressing preemptive and actual worries related to study product use, and further disaggregating experiences or side effects attributed to products that might regularly occur within pregnancy. Participants were concerned about being able to walk with a ring in situ, and some feared the active agent causing congenital anomalies or developmental disabilities. Others were concerned about challenges related to the physicality of the ring blocking the birth canal, or the baby getting tangled.

Participants also spoke of the ring contributing to excessive discharge and feeling heavy. The frequency of these comments and reports suggests that even those who did not voice concerns may still wonder about or have them. Study pamphlets and counseling messages could preemptively address frequent fears, such as messages like: "The ring will not block, choke, entangle or harm the baby during delivery", or more simply: "The ring will not affect the baby's safety during delivery".

Counseling and materials could additionally address the frequency with which discharge and heaviness are reported in pregnancy and the increases in these experiences towards the later stages of pregnancy. Further, feelings of heaviness might be particularly exacerbated in subsequent pregnancies due to the laxity in the pelvic floor, not because of intravaginal ring use. Future demonstration projects and program activities with oral and vaginal PrEP available for pregnant and breastfeeding populations could benefit from these insights.

### Screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: Updated evidence report and systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force [^116yqCLm]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

The 2024 USPSTF guidelines highlight specific considerations for vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements, particularly concerning pregnant patients. They recommend that there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in pregnant females to prevent adverse maternal and infant health outcomes.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^1131U9gH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

As part of managing risks from concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, it is important to acknowledge the increased risk of adverse reactions, including overdose and death, when buprenorphine is used alongside benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants. Despite this, patients undergoing medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder should not be categorically barred from receiving treatment if they are taking these medications. Denying treatment can lead to greater risks of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder itself.

Patients should be routinely educated about the risks associated with the concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol during orientation to buprenorphine treatment. Strategies should be developed to manage the use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at the initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if it becomes a concern during treatment. This may require adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring. There is currently no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps on buprenorphine as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in patients treated with buprenorphine. However, if a patient appears sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, it may be appropriate to delay or omit the buprenorphine dose.

In most cases of concomitant use, cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred. However, in some cases, it may be appropriate to monitor the patient at a higher level of care for tapering. In other cases, gradually tapering a patient off a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, or reducing to the lowest effective dose, may be the best course of action.

### Codeine sulfate [^113Z2Rfh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Codeine sulfate tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about opioids and mitigating the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of codeine sulfate tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions, such as pain from surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries, require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with codeine sulfate tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111LDEbp]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, particularly concerning stepwise management, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend utilizing the following track as the preferred stepwise approach for managing asthma in adult and adolescent patients. As-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol is suggested as the reliever in all steps.

- **Situation: Steps 1–2**. Symptoms on 5 or fewer days per week, with normal or mildly reduced lung function: Offer as-needed-only low-dose ICS-formoterol guidance.

- **Situation: Step 3**. Symptoms on most days of the week, or waking due to asthma once or more per week, or low lung function: Offer low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy.

- **Situation: Step 4**. Daily symptoms or waking at night due to asthma once or more per week, coupled with low lung function or recent exacerbation: Offer medium-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy.

- **Situation: Step 5**. Offer add-on LAMAs; refer for phenotypic assessment; consider offering high-dose maintenance ICS-formoterol; consider offering anti-IgE, anti-IL5/5R, anti-interleukin 4-receptor, anti-thymic lymphopoietin.

- **Situation: Initial presentation with exacerbation**. Treat as for exacerbation, including a short course of oral corticosteroids if severe, and offer medium-dose maintenance-and-reliever therapy.

### Epkinly [^114113Co]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety of Epkinly was evaluated in EPCORE NHL-1, a single-arm study of patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy. These patients received Epkinly following a 2-step up dosage schedule (N = 127) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. A separate dose optimization cohort evaluated the recommended 3-step up dosage schedule for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) mitigation (N = 86). Epkinly was administered via subcutaneous injection until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities according to the following 28-day cycle schedule:

- **Cycle 1**: Epkinly 0.16 mg on Day 1, 0.8 mg on Day 8, 3 mg on Day 15, and 48 mg on Day 22.
- **Cycles 2–3**: Epkinly 48 mg on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22.
- **Cycles 4–9**: Epkinly 48 mg on Days 1 and 15.
- **Cycles 10 and beyond**: Epkinly 48 mg on Day 1.

With the exception of CRS, the safety results presented below and in tables 11 and 12 represent data from patients who received the 2-step up dosage schedule. The data presented for CRS reflects the 86 patients who received the recommended 3-step up dosage schedule. The study excluded patients with CNS involvement of lymphoma, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or solid organ transplant, ongoing active infection, any patients with known impaired T-cell immunity, creatinine clearance three times the upper limit of normal, and a cardiac ejection fraction less than 45%.

Of the 86 patients with relapsed or refractory FL who received Epkinly following the recommended 3-step up dosage schedule, the median age was 63.5 years (range: 33–90), 57% were male, and 100% had an…

### Exjade [^115w3v6Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

A total of 586 patients were randomized and treated: 296 with Exjade and 290 with deferoxamine. The mean age was 17.1 years (range, 2–53 years); 52% were female, and 88% were Caucasian. The primary efficacy population consisted of 553 patients (Exjade n = 276; deferoxamine n = 277) who had liver iron concentration (LIC) evaluated at baseline and at 12 months or discontinued due to an adverse reaction. The percentage of patients achieving the primary endpoint was 52.9% for Exjade and 66.4% for deferoxamine. The relative efficacy of Exjade to deferoxamine cannot be determined from this study.

In patients who had an LIC at baseline and at the end of the study, the mean change in LIC was -2.4 mg Fe/g dry weight in patients treated with Exjade and -2.9 mg Fe/g dry weight in patients treated with deferoxamine.

Reduction of LIC and serum ferritin was observed with Exjade doses of 20 to 30 mg per kg per day. Exjade doses below 20 mg per kg per day failed to provide consistent lowering of LIC and serum ferritin levels. Therefore, a starting dose of 20 mg per kg per day is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

### Effect of an interdisciplinary inpatient program for patients with complex regional pain syndrome in reducing disease activity-a single-center prospective cohort study [^116GXKGN]. Pain Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the benefit of inpatient treatment in reducing disease activity in patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) who have exhausted outpatient options. Furthermore, the study sought to identify patient-related outcome variables that predict a reduction in disease activity.

- **Methods**: The primary outcome was disease severity (CRPS Severity Score, range 0–16 points). Secondary outcomes included depression, anxiety, physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and the ability to participate in social roles and activities, all assessed using the PROMIS-29. Furthermore, pain catastrophizing, neuropathic pain, quality of life, pain self-efficacy, medication intake, and the patient's global impression of change were examined in accordance with international agreed recommendations, assessed at discharge, 3-month, and 6-month post-discharge. Mixed-effects models were conducted to identify baseline variables associated with CRPS severity.

- **Results**: Twenty-five patients completed the program (mean age 49.28 [SD 11.23] years, 92% females, mean symptom duration 8.5 [SD 6.5] months). Results showed a significant reduction between baseline and discharge of disease activity (CSS -2.36, p < 0.0001), pain (PROMIS-29 pain -0.88, P = 0.005), and emotional function (PROMIS-29 depression -5.05, p < 0.001; fatigue -4.63, P = 0.002). Moderate evidence for a reduction between baseline and discharge could be observed for pain interference (+2.27, P = 0.05), social participation (PROMIS-29+1.93, P = 0.05), and anxiety (PROMIS-).

### Changes in depression symptom profile with gender-affirming hormone use in transgender persons [^112vRThx]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Women show a higher prevalence of depression and different symptomatology than men, possibly influenced by sex hormones. Many transgender persons, who face a high risk of depression, use gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT), but the impact of GAHT on depressive symptom profiles is unknown.

- **Methods**: This study examined depressive symptoms in transgender persons before GAHT and after 3 and 12 months of GAHT. We used the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report to assess depressive symptoms, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to assess symptom clusters, and linear mixed models to assess changes in symptom clusters.

- **Results**: This study included 110 transmasculine (TM) and 89 transfeminine (TF) participants. EFA revealed four symptom clusters: mood, anxiety, lethargy, and somatic symptoms. Changes in total depressive symptoms significantly differed between TM and TF groups. After 3 months of GAHT, TM participants reported improvement in lethargy (-16%; 95% CI: -29%; -2%), and after 12 months, TF participants reported worsening in low mood (24%; 95% CI: 3%; 51%), but absolute score changes were modest. Neither group showed changes in anxiety or somatic symptoms.

- **Limitations**: This study had limited sample sizes at 12 months follow-up and did not include relevant biological or psychosocial covariates.

- **Discussion**: Changes in depressive symptoms after GAHT use differ in TM and TF persons. TM persons report slight improvements in lethargy, whereas TF persons report a slight increase in low mood. Starting GAHT represents a significant life event with profound implications.

### A programme evaluation of 'First Steps': A peer-conceived, developed and led self-management intervention for people following a Parkinson's diagnosis [^111jwf5z]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Low credibility.

Group allocation was according to location; participants were aware if they were offered First Steps or not. Assessments were conducted over the telephone with an assessor blind to participants' locations — a paper version was available on request and sent by a non-blind researcher. Participants' telephone numbers were entered into the designated assessment phone by an unblind researcher so that the area code was not displayed. Participants were reminded not to disclose their location at the start of each assessment call.

Demographic information was collected at entry to the study (baseline assessment). Given the pragmatic approach to site allocation and the potential for imbalance, postal codes were used to classify deprivation indices (Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government lookup tool, 2019) and location (Rural-Urban Classification for Output Areas, 2011 Office for National Statistics). Outcome data were obtained at 0 (baseline), 12, and 24 weeks after entry to the study by the same assessor blind to location. After a minimum of three missed call attempts and no reply to messages, a participant was deemed lost to follow-up.

We report outcomes on:

- **Anxiety and depression**: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), 14 items (7 anxiety and 7 depression) on a 4-point scale from 0 (absent) to 3 (extreme)

- **Daily functioning**: World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS), 12 items across 6 domains, with a total score from 0 (no disability) to 100 (full disability)

- **Physical activity**: International Physical Activity Questionnaire-short

### Cortef [^1175x1z4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Cortef tablets are indicated for a variety of conditions:

- **Endocrine disorders**: Used in cases such as primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, non-suppurative thyroiditis, and hypercalcemia associated with cancer. Hydrocortisone or cortisone are the first choices, and synthetic analogs may be used alongside mineralocorticoids where applicable. In infancy, mineralocorticoid supplementation is particularly important.

- **Rheumatic disorders**: Serves as adjunctive therapy for short-term administration to help patients manage acute episodes or exacerbations. Applicable conditions include psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (including juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, with selected cases requiring low-dose maintenance therapy), ankylosing spondylitis, acute and subacute bursitis, acute nonspecific tenosynovitis, acute gouty arthritis, post-traumatic osteoarthritis, synovitis of osteoarthritis, and epicondylitis.

- **Collagen diseases**: Used during exacerbations or as maintenance therapy in selected cases of systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic dermatomyositis (polymyositis), and acute rheumatic carditis.

- **Dermatologic diseases**: Indicated for conditions such as pemphigus, bullous dermatitis herpetiformis, severe erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), exfoliative dermatitis, mycosis fungoides, severe psoriasis, and severe seborrheic dermatitis.

- **Allergic states**: Effective for controlling severe or incapacitating allergic conditions that are intractable to adequate trials of conventional treatment. These include seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis, serum sickness, bronchial asthma, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and drug hypersensitivity.

### Altered brain functional connectivity and peripheral transcriptomic profiles in major depressive disorder with childhood maltreatment [^114DCcT1]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). High credibility.

There is a correlation between the abnormal connectivity of brain networks and immune-related gene modules, suggesting that the abnormal brain networks in MDD patients may be regulated by immune-related pathways. Consistent with our findings, previous studies have shown that dysconnectivity of a brain functional network is associated with peripheral inflammation in MDD patients. Peripheral administration of IFN-α quickly reduces the efficiency and node degree of the temporo-occipital network, which is directly linked to mood impairments. Relationships between peripheral inflammation and rsFC within an emotion regulation network and the central executive network have also been reported. Dysregulation of immune pathway transcription and changes in the IOG-centered brain network changes are potential biological mechanisms related to CM and MDD.

The findings of the present study support that immunity is not associated with MDD as a single syndrome but rather with the presence and progression of specific depressive symptoms. Previous studies have shown that immune status is specifically related to changes in sleep disturbance, tiredness or low energy, and appetite. These symptoms indicate sickness behaviors observed in physically ill individuals. Therefore, somatic symptoms of MDD may be a manifestation of a specific immunological endophenotype of MDD. This finding aligns with the evolutionary perspective that links immunity and MDD to host defense against pathogens. Our results provide transcriptomic clues into symptom-specific immune abnormalities in patients with MDD.

### Low energy availability surrogates are associated with relative energy deficiency in sport outcomes in male athletes [^114uBATb]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Health consequences of REDS:

The initial REDS model described 10 potential health consequences of low energy availability (EA). Cardiovascular health was determined with questions from the Preparticipation Physical Evaluation — Fourth Edition, and internally developed questions. Positive responses to three or more of 11 questions indicated dysfunction.

Gastrointestinal function was assessed using questions from the Low Energy Availability in Males Questionnaire (LEAM-Q, unpublished at the time of study initiation) and the Fecal Incontinence Questionnaire. Frequent stomach aches or cramps, stool leakage, constipation, bloating, excessive or infrequent stool passage, stools that were not regularly smooth and soft, or changes in stooling habits in response to training indicated abnormality.

Immunological function was considered compromised if an athlete reported increased illness frequency when training, three or more illnesses in the past year affecting athletic performance, or two or more illnesses requiring a break from training in the prior six months.

Gonadal function was assessed with questions from LEAM-Q. Dysfunction was presented if any of the following were reported: morning erections two times per week or less in the past month; decrease in number of morning erections in the past month compared with baseline; low sex drive or lack of interest in sex; or a decrease in sex drive when training volume increases.

Bone health was considered affected if the athlete reported two or more bone stress injuries (BSI); one or more BSI to the pelvis, femoral neck, sacrum, or calcaneus; or self-reported dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) Z-Score abnormalities.

### Trileptal [^11624ADi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

- **Administration information**: Counsel patients that Trileptal may be taken with or without food. For Trileptal oral suspension, advise patients to shake the bottle well and prepare the dose immediately afterward using the oral dosing syringe supplied. Inform patients that Trileptal oral suspension can be mixed in a small glass of water just prior to administration or, alternatively, may be swallowed directly from the syringe. Instruct patients to discard any unused Trileptal oral suspension after 7 weeks of first opening the bottle [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].

- **Hyponatremia**: Advise patients that Trileptal may reduce serum sodium concentrations, especially if they are taking other medications that can lower sodium. Instruct patients to report symptoms of low sodium, such as nausea, tiredness, lack of energy, confusion, and more frequent or more severe seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Anaphylactic reactions and angioedema**: Anaphylactic reactions and angioedema may occur during treatment with Trileptal. Advise patients to report immediately any signs and symptoms suggesting angioedema, such as swelling of the face, eyes, lips, tongue, or difficulty in swallowing or breathing, and to stop taking the drug until they have consulted with their physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Monoferric [^1163zkCT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There are no available data on Monoferric use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Published studies on the use of intravenous iron products in pregnant women have not reported an association with adverse developmental outcomes. However, these studies cannot establish or exclude the absence of any drug-related risk during pregnancy because they were not designed to assess the risk of major birth defects.

There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in pregnancy as well as risks to the fetus associated with maternal severe hypersensitivity reactions. Iron complexes have been reported to be teratogenic and embryocidal in non-iron depleted pregnant animals. The findings in animals may be due to iron overload and may not be applicable to patients with iron deficiency. Animal reproduction studies of ferric derisomaltose administered to rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes, including structural abnormalities and embryo-fetal mortality, at doses approximately 0.09 and 0.4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1000 mg, respectively, based on body surface area.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy can occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications.

### Efficacy and safety of roxadustat for anemia in patients receiving chemotherapy for nonmyeloid malignancies: A randomized, open-label, active-controlled phase III study [^116aJuaR]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

In this study, the Hb results obtained from the central laboratory were used for efficacy assessments. However, for those without central laboratory Hb assessments from the screening period to day 1 during the COVID-19 pandemic, values from local laboratories (PPS population: roxadustat 5/78, rHuEPO-α 8/62) were used to define baseline, and subsequent Hb values from the same local laboratory were used for efficacy analyses. A sensitivity analysis with only baseline values from the central laboratory yielded similar results to the analysis of the primary endpoint, confirming that the primary analysis results were not notably affected by the inclusion of the local laboratory data. A sensitivity analysis considering site as a random effect in the MMRM model was also consistent with the primary MMRM analyses, confirming the robustness of the noninferiority despite any regional site differences in clinical practice.

Roxadustat has several distinct advantages over rHuEPO-α, including its route of administration (oral vs. intravenous/subcutaneous injection), which may increase compliance and avoid the costs and inconvenience associated with infusion and cold chain supply. Moreover, the physiologic mechanisms underlying the effects of each are distinct. Whereas roxadustat stimulates erythropoiesis through the HIF pathway, similar to normal homeostatic responses to anemia, ESAs activate the EPO receptor using iron stores to increase RBC production and therefore requiring iron supplementation. These differences result in several potential advantages that have been consistently observed.

Regarding the medical management of Trichomonas vaginalis infection, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend considering any of the following options if adherence to multiple doses is a serious concern:

- **Single-dose treatment options**:
	- Metronidazole 2 g PO as a single dose.
	- Tinidazole 2 g PO as a single dose (except during pregnancy).
	- Secnidazole 2 g PO as a single dose (except during pregnancy).
	- Ornidazole 1.5 g PO as a single dose (except during pregnancy) if metronidazole or tinidazole is not available.

### Buprenorphine [^116EbHWj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases the risk of adverse reactions, including overdose and death. However, medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs. Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone.

As a routine part of orientation to buprenorphine treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol. Develop strategies to manage the use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at the initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required. There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in buprenorphine-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, delay or omit the buprenorphine dose if appropriate.

Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate.

### Spike-based dynamic computing with asynchronous sensing-computing neuromorphic chip [^114N2G8y]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

By mimicking the neurons and synapses of the human brain and employing spiking neural networks on neuromorphic chips, neuromorphic computing offers promising energy-efficient machine intelligence. A fundamental issue is how to utilize high-level brain dynamic mechanisms to help neuromorphic computing achieve energy advantages. This work presents an application-oriented algorithm-software-hardware co-designed neuromorphic system to address this issue.

First, we design and fabricate an asynchronous chip called "Speck", a sensing-computing neuromorphic system on chip. With the low processor resting power of 0.42mW, Speck can satisfy the hardware requirements of dynamic computing: no-input consumes no energy.

Second, we uncover the "dynamic imbalance" in spiking neural networks and develop an attention-based framework for achieving the algorithmic requirements of dynamic computing: varied inputs consume energy with large variance.

Together, we demonstrate a neuromorphic system with real-time power consumption as low as 0.70mW. This work exhibits the promising potentials of neuromorphic computing with its asynchronous event-driven, sparse, and dynamic nature.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^116wamYW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Treatment should be initiated with supervised administration, progressing to unsupervised administration as the patient's clinical stability permits. Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film is subject to diversion and abuse. When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patient's level of stability, the security of their home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take-home medication.

Patients should ideally be seen at reasonable intervals (e.g. at least weekly during the first month of treatment) based on their individual circumstances. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. Periodic assessment is necessary to determine compliance with the dosing regimen, effectiveness of the treatment plan, and overall patient progress.

Once a stable dosage has been achieved and patient assessment (e.g. urine drug screening) does not indicate illicit drug use, less frequent follow-up visits may be appropriate. A once-monthly visit schedule may be reasonable for patients on a stable dosage of medication who are making progress toward their treatment objectives. Continuation or modification of pharmacotherapy should be based on the healthcare provider's evaluation of treatment outcomes and objectives, such as:

- **Absence of medication toxicity**: Ensure no evidence of adverse effects from medication.
- **Absence of medical or behavioral adverse effects**: Verify that no negative impacts are present.
- **Responsible handling of medication**: Assess the patient's capability to manage their medication appropriately.

### Corneal aberrations are associated with low-energy meniscus injuries [^114qZseQ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Visual impairment can cause balance problems. Therefore, visual impairment caused by an increase in corneal deviations can lead to sudden and unstable loads in the lower extremities. We aimed to investigate the possible relationship between low-energy meniscal injuries and corneal structural measures.

- **Methods**: This prospective, observational study included individuals aged between 18–40 years with a normal body-mass index. The study group consisted of 54 patients with grade 2 or 3 meniscus injuries after low-energy activity. The control group consisted of 54 healthy individuals without any complaints in the knee joint. The corneal parameters of all participants were evaluated with a Scheimpflug corneal topography and specular microscopy device. Simulated keratometry (SimK), minimum central corneal thickness (MCCT), cylindrical diopter (ClyD), corneal volume (CVol), spheric aberrations (SphAbb), high-order aberration (HOA), coma values, and endothelial parameters were recorded.

- **Results**: The research and control groups were similar in terms of age, body mass index, and gender distribution. There was no significant difference between the groups in the corneal SimK and CylD parameters. However, HOA, coma, SphAbb, and cell variability (Cv) values were significantly higher in the study group, whereas MCCT, CVol, and endothelial count (Cd) values were significantly lower.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that individuals with relatively lower MCCT values tend to develop meniscal damage after low-energy activity. Hence, the loss of corneal strength in these situations could be indicative of a greater risk.

### Topamax [^114HLf1y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

- **Eye disorders**: Instruct patients taking Topamax to seek immediate medical attention if they experience blurred vision, visual disturbances, or periorbital pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

- **Oligohidrosis and hyperthermia**: Closely monitor Topamax-treated patients, especially pediatric patients, for evidence of decreased sweating and increased body temperature, especially in hot weather. Counsel patients to contact their healthcare professionals immediately if they develop a high or persistent fever or decreased sweating [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Metabolic acidosis**: Warn patients about the potential significant risk for metabolic acidosis, which may be asymptomatic and associated with adverse effects on kidneys (e.g. kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis), bones (e.g. osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and/or rickets in children), and growth (e.g. growth delay/retardation) in pediatric patients, and on the fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Suicidal behavior and ideation**: Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including Topamax, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Advise them to be alert for the emergence or worsening of signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, or behavior or thoughts about self-harm. Instruct patients to immediately report behaviors of concern.

### Captopril [^115xWo6E]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Overdosage**: Correction of hypotension would be of primary concern. Volume expansion with an intravenous infusion of normal saline is the treatment of choice for restoration of blood pressure.

- **Removal from circulation**: While captopril may be removed from the adult circulation by hemodialysis, there is inadequate data concerning the effectiveness of hemodialysis for removing it from the circulation of neonates or children. Peritoneal dialysis is not effective for removing captopril; there is no information concerning exchange transfusion for removing captopril from the general circulation.

### Ferric carboxymaltose for anemia in late pregnancy: a randomized controlled trial [^116Uwwva]. Nature Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The study, REVAMP-TT, published by Sant-Rayn Pasricha and colleagues in 2025 in the journal Nature Medicine, focuses on iron deficiency anemia. The trial question for the REVAMP-TT study was: What is the effect of ferric carboxymaltose on anemia in late pregnancy?

The study design was a multi-center, open-label randomized controlled trial. The population studied consisted of 589 female patients. The inclusion criteria were women at 27–35 weeks of gestation with anemia. Key exclusion criteria included hypersensitivity to any study drug, clinical symptoms of malaria or other infection, sickle cell or sickle hemoglobin C anemia, and a clinically unstable condition with a low hemoglobin level requiring blood transfusion or pre-eclampsia.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Ferric carboxymaltose group**: n = 297 received a single intravenous dose of 20 mg/kg, up to 1,000 mg.
	- **Standard of care group**: n = 292 received 60 mg of elemental iron twice daily for 90 days.

- **Primary outcome**: A significant decrease in anemia at 36 weeks of gestation or delivery was observed (46.7% vs. 62.7%; PR 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.87).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in mean birth weight of infants (2975.1 g vs. 2958.7 g; MD 10.9, 95% CI -65.7 to 87.5).
	- Significant decrease in iron deficiency anemia at 1 month postpartum (3.7% vs. 22.5%; PR 0.17, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.35).
	- No significant difference in venous hemoglobin at 1 month of age (12.38 g/dL vs. 12.49 g/dL; MD -0.1, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.24).

- **Safety outcomes**: No significant difference was reported.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^115Xzkmj]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus (hypertriglyceridemia), the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend addressing and treating lifestyle factors such as obesity and metabolic syndrome. Additionally, secondary factors including diabetes, chronic liver or kidney disease and/or nephrotic syndrome, and hypothyroidism should be considered. It is also important to evaluate medications that may raise triglycerides in adult patients with hypertriglyceridemia, identified by fasting triglycerides greater than 150 mg/dL or 1.7 mmol/L, or nonfasting triglycerides greater than 175 mg/dL or 2.0 mmol/L.

### Efficient continuous SF/Nseparation using low-cost and robust metal-organic frameworks composites [^117DthNx]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

While evaluating the performance of the VTSA process, key parameters include working capacity, purity, recovery, and yield.

- **Working capacity**: Where is the adsorption capacity after the AD step, and is the adsorption capacity after the VU or VU Purge step. Here, i = 1, 2 corresponds to SF₆ and N₂, respectively.

- **Purity**: Where is the molar flow rate of product steam (mol/s), and is the molar fraction of \(i \) in the product steam. Here, \(i = 1, 2 \) corresponds to \(\text{SF}_6 \) and \(\text{N}_2 \), respectively.

- **SF\(_6\) recovery**
- **N\(_2\) recovery**
- **Yield**:

For the overall energy consumption analysis for VTSA and cryogenic distillation, the electrical energy consumption was calculated using the following equations. Where is the electric energy of the compressor or pump in a cycle (kJ/mol SF₆), and is the heat capacity ratio ([C_p/C_v]). T_steam represents the temperature of steam (K), and are the outlet and inlet pressure of equipment (bar), is the molar flow rate of steam (kmol/s), and is the mechanical efficiency, selected as 0.95.

It is assumed that the bed jacket did not transfer energy with the surroundings, only with the medium, allowing the calculation of heat duty by the following equations. Where is the heat duty (kJ/kg SF₆), is the adsorption temperature (K), is the desorption temperature (K), is the working capacity for adsorbent (kJ/(kg K)), is the bed wall capacity (kJ/(kg K)), and is the isosteric heat of adsorption (kJ/mol), with i = 1, 2 being for SF₆ and N₂, respectively.

By converting to standard oil according to PRC National Standard (GB/T50441–2016), the overall energy consumption of two-stage VTSA and cryogenic distillation was calculated as follows. Where e…

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: A joint advisory from the American College of Lifestyle Medicine, the American Society for Nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and The Obesity Society [^113TH4Cy]. Obesity (2025). High credibility.

Less common side effects included dyspepsia, fatigue, headache, eructation (belching), hair loss, gastroesophageal reflux, dizziness, and gastritis. Hypoglycemia can occur in individuals with type 2 diabetes, especially when they are consuming insulin or insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas. Rare side effects include gallbladder disease, pancreatitis, acute kidney injury (typically related to hypovolemia), hypersensitivity reactions, and gastroparesis. Ophthalmic complications have been rarely reported, which could relate to direct toxicity or rapid GLP-1 correction of hyperglycemia. Rare cases of suicidality have been reported, although preliminary evaluation using the FDA Adverse Reporting System, post hoc analysis of the STEP clinical trials, and one large cohort study have not confirmed any definitive link; the FDA and European agencies are monitoring potential risk.

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Individuals using GLP-1s to treat obesity experience significant reductions in appetite and energy intake, with observed caloric reductions of 16%–39%. This large, rapid reduction can lead to insufficient intakes of essential vitamins and minerals, especially at energy intakes of less than 1200 kcal/day for females and less than 1800 kcal/day for males. Some examples of nutrients of concern include iron, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and vitamins A, D, E, K, B1, B12, and C. Signs of frank nutrient deficiency include fatigue beyond expected levels, excessive hair loss, skin flakiness or itching, muscle weakness, poor wound healing, and unusual bruising. Gastrointestinal side effects may further compromise nutrition.

### Methadone hydrochloride [^113PGxB5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Develop strategies to manage the use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at admission to methadone treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required. There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of methadone as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in methadone-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of methadone dosing, ensure that a medically-trained healthcare provider evaluates the cause of sedation, and delays or omits the methadone dose if appropriate.

Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, or decreasing to the lowest effective dose, may be appropriate.

For patients in methadone treatment, benzodiazepines are not the treatment of choice for anxiety or insomnia. Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments to address anxiety or insomnia. Ensure that other healthcare providers prescribing benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are aware of the patient's methadone treatment and coordinate care to minimize the risks associated with concomitant use.

If concomitant use is warranted, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111DJ5mc]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for asthma, particularly in pediatric patients, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend the following track as the preferred stepwise approach to the management of asthma in children aged 6–11 years. An as-needed short-acting β-agonist or low-dose ICS-formoterol is suggested as the reliever in Steps 3 and 4:

- **Step 1: Symptoms ≤ 1–2 days per week**: Offer low-dose ICS whenever a short-acting β-agonist is taken, either in separate inhalers or combined if available.

- **Step 2: Symptoms 2–5 days per week**: Offer low-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist. Consider offering ICS whenever a short-acting β-agonist is taken, either in combination or as separate inhalers, or daily leukotriene receptor antagonist as non-preferred options. Consider the probability of adherence to maintenance treatment if the reliever is a short-acting β-agonist.

- **Step 3: Symptoms on most days of the week or waking due to asthma ≥ 1 per week**: Offer low-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist, or medium-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist. Offer very low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy. Consider offering daily low-dose ICS or leukotriene receptor antagonist, plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist as non-preferred options.

- **Step 4: Symptoms daily, waking at night ≥ 1 per week, low lung function**: Offer medium-dose maintenance ICS-LABA plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist or low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy.

### Abilify [^111Qz5ud]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Schizophrenia**:

- **Adults**: The recommended starting and target dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg/day, administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Abilify has been systematically evaluated and shown to be effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day when administered as the tablet formulation. However, doses higher than 10 or 15 mg/day were not more effective than 10 or 15 mg/day. Dosage increases should generally not be made before 2 weeks, the time needed to achieve a steady-state [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

	- Maintenance of efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a trial involving patients with schizophrenia who had been symptomatically stable on other antipsychotic medications for periods of 3 months or longer. These patients were discontinued from those medications and randomized to either Abilify 15 mg/day or placebo and observed for relapse [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment.

- **Adolescents**: The recommended target dose of Abilify is 10 mg/day. Aripiprazole was studied in adolescent patients aged 13 to 17 years with schizophrenia at daily doses of 10 and 30 mg. The starting daily dose of the tablet formulation in these patients was 2 mg, which was titrated to 5 mg after 2 days and to the target dose of 10 mg after 2 additional days. Subsequent dose increases should be administered in 5 mg increments. The 30 mg/day dose was not shown to be more efficacious than the 10 mg/day dose. Abilify can be administered without regard to meals.

### Plummer-Vinson syndrome in a postpolio patient: A rare intersection of neuromuscular and nutritional sequelae [^112bLJVc]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

A woman in her 40s, with a history of childhood paralytic poliomyelitis, presented with progressive difficulty swallowing, fatigue, and unintended weight loss. Due to her limited mobility and chronic tiredness, her diet gradually became restricted, lacking iron, vitamin B12, calcium, and protein. She frequently skipped meals and avoided nutrient-dense foods. Clinical signs pointed to multinutrient deficiency, and laboratory results confirmed iron deficiency anaemia along with other deficiencies. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a postcricoid oesophageal web, consistent with Plummer-Vinson syndrome (PVS). The web was successfully dilated, and she was started on targeted nutritional therapy, including iron, B12, and calcium supplementation. Her symptoms improved significantly over the following weeks, with better swallowing, energy, and nutritional status. This case highlights a rare intersection of postpolio neuromuscular sequelae and nutritional deficiency as a contributing pathway to secondary PVS, reinforcing the need for thorough dietary assessment in patients with physical disability and dysphagia.
