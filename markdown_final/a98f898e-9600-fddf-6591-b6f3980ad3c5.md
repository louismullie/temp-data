## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of febrile neutropenia in adults with acute myeloid leukemia receiving induction or consolidation chemotherapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage of filgrastim (G-CSF) for treating febrile neutropenia in adults with acute myeloid leukemia who are receiving induction or consolidation chemotherapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact clinical scenario and whether the indication is treatment of established febrile neutropenia versus prophylaxis. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled dose and route for this specific indication. Next, I will review the pivotal trial that supports this dose and confirm the timing relative to chemotherapy. After that, I should check whether major guidelines align with or restrict this practice. Finally, I will consider practical nuances like duration, monitoring, and any exceptions such as APL or life-threatening infections, and then synthesize a concise, clinically actionable recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indication. The question is about treating febrile neutropenia after it has occurred in AML patients undergoing induction or consolidation, not primary prophylaxis, and not treatment of afebrile neutropenia, so I need to ensure I'm anchoring on the therapeutic rather than preventive use of G-CSF in this setting [^29ee06bc] [^18e86031].

> I will now examine the FDA labeling for filgrastim in AML with febrile neutropenia. The FDA prescribes filgrastim 5 mcg/kg once daily, administered either intravenously or subcutaneously, starting no earlier than 24 hours after the completion of myelosuppressive chemotherapy and continued until neutrophil recovery, which is typically defined as an ANC of at least 1,000/mm³ for 3 consecutive days or a single ANC of at least 10,000/mm³, with a maximum duration often capped around 35 days in trials [^29ee06bc] [^18e86031] [^56575418].

> Wait, let me verify the evidentiary basis for that dose. The pivotal randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in newly diagnosed AML used subcutaneous filgrastim 5 mcg/kg/day beginning 24 hours after the last chemotherapy dose and continued until neutrophil recovery or a maximum of 35 days, demonstrating a clinically meaningful reduction in severe neutropenia by about 5 days and shorter IV antibiotic use and hospitalization, without affecting remission or survival, which supports the labeled dosing strategy [^56575418] [^0b2ca1da] [^711ca1e3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about routine use. I should confirm guideline positions. NCCN advises that growth factors are not routinely recommended during induction or consolidation for AML, but may be considered in select situations such as life-threatening infections or sepsis when attempting to shorten neutropenia, and if used, they should be held for at least a week before planned marrow assessments to avoid confounding interpretation. This means the FDA-labeled dose is acceptable when clinically justified, but routine use is not endorsed [^b087349d] [^ce8d25f1].

> Let me consider practical administration details and duration. The dose is weight-based at 5 mcg/kg, IV or SC, started at least 24 hours after chemotherapy completion, and continued until neutrophil recovery as defined above. In the pivotal trial, median severe neutropenia was 14 days with filgrastim versus 19 days with placebo, and median hospitalization was 20 versus 25 days, which helps set expectations for duration even though individual recovery varies with regimen and marrow reserve [^56575418] [^0b2ca1da].

> But wait, what if the patient has APL or is on a regimen that incorporates G-CSF already. I should double-check that nuance. NCCN specifically recommends against growth factors during APL induction due to concerns about response assessment and differentiation syndrome, and some regimens like FLAG already include G-CSF, so additional G-CSF for febrile neutropenia would generally be avoided in those contexts unless there is a compelling individualized rationale [^b087349d] [^ce8d25f1].

> I need to ensure I address the bottom line clearly. The recommended filgrastim dosage for treatment of febrile neutropenia in adults with AML receiving induction or consolidation chemotherapy is 5 mcg/kg once daily, IV or SC, starting no earlier than 24 hours after chemotherapy and continued until neutrophil recovery, recognizing that this is an FDA-supported regimen used selectively in practice rather than routine prophylaxis, and decisions should be individualized based on infection severity, marrow assessment timing, and institutional policy [^29ee06bc] [^18e86031] [^56575418] [^b087349d].

---

The recommended dose of filgrastim (G-CSF) for treating febrile neutropenia in adults with AML receiving induction or consolidation chemotherapy is **5 mcg/kg IV or SC once daily** [^29ee06bc] [^18e86031], starting no earlier than 24 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy and continued until neutrophil recovery (ANC ≥ 1,000/mm³ for 3 consecutive days or ≥ 10,000/mm³ for 1 day) [^0b2ca1da] [^56575418]. This regimen is supported by FDA labeling and randomized trial data showing reduced duration of severe neutropenia, shorter IV antibiotic use, and fewer hospital days without affecting remission or survival [^0b2ca1da] [^56575418]. Use clinical judgment and monitor for adverse effects such as bone pain and leukocytosis [^c612ccc2].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

- **Dosage**: 5 mcg/kg once daily [^29ee06bc] [^18e86031].
- **Route**: Intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) administration [^29ee06bc] [^18e86031].
- **Timing**: Start no earlier than 24 hours after the last dose of myelosuppressive chemotherapy [^29ee06bc] [^18e86031].
- **Duration**: Continue until neutrophil recovery, defined as ANC ≥ 1,000/mm³ for 3 consecutive days or ≥ 10,000/mm³ for 1 day [^0b2ca1da] [^56575418].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the recommended dosage

The recommended dosage is supported by a **randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial** in newly diagnosed AML patients receiving induction or consolidation chemotherapy [^0b2ca1da] [^56575418]. Key findings include:

- **Reduced duration of severe neutropenia**: Median 14 days with filgrastim vs 19 days with placebo (p = 0.0001) [^0b2ca1da] [^56575418].
- **Shorter IV antibiotic use**: Median 15 days vs 18.5 days with placebo [^0b2ca1da] [^56575418].
- **Fewer hospital days**: Median 20 days vs 25 days with placebo [^0b2ca1da] [^56575418].
- **No impact on remission or survival**: No significant differences in complete remission, time to progression, or overall survival [^0b2ca1da] [^56575418].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Major oncology guidelines align with the FDA-labeled dosing for filgrastim in AML:

- **NCCN guidelines**: Growth factors may be considered during induction for septic patients with life-threatening infections to shorten neutropenia, but are not routinely recommended post-remission unless life-threatening infection or sepsis is present [^b087349d] [^ce8d25f1].
- **ASH guidelines**: Emphasize individualized decisions for older adults with AML, balancing benefits and harms of intensive therapy and supportive care, including growth factor use [^f234e440] [^6c4e00b1].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

Filgrastim is generally well tolerated, but clinicians should monitor for:

- **Bone pain**: Common adverse effect, manageable with analgesics [^c612ccc2].
- **Leukocytosis**: Monitor CBC regularly; discontinue if ANC > 10,000/mm³ [^notfound].
- **Splenic rupture**: Rare but serious; monitor for abdominal pain or splenomegaly [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other growth factors

Pegfilgrastim, a long-acting G-CSF, is not routinely recommended in AML due to limited evidence and potential interference with marrow interpretation; filgrastim remains the **preferred agent** when G-CSF is indicated [^b087349d] [^ce8d25f1].

---

## Special considerations

- **APL**: Growth factors are not recommended during induction due to response assessment complications and increased risk of differentiation syndrome [^b087349d] [^ce8d25f1].
- **Renal impairment**: No dose adjustment is required, but close monitoring is advised [^notfound].

---

The recommended dose of filgrastim for febrile neutropenia in adults with AML receiving induction or consolidation chemotherapy is **5 mcg/kg IV or SC once daily**, starting ≥ 24 hours after chemotherapy and continued until neutrophil recovery. This approach shortens severe neutropenia and hospitalization without affecting remission or survival, and should be individualized based on clinical context and monitoring [^0b2ca1da] [^56575418].

For less-intensive therapy vs best supportive care, very low-quality evidence suggests there may be increased febrile neutropenia and pneumonia. Low-quality evidence also suggests hospitalization may be 2 days longer, on average, with less-intensive antileukemic therapy. Patients receiving antileukemic therapy may experience more burden related to how treatment is administered, particularly with intensive therapy.

Methods

Study population

This is a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted at the University of Washington/Fred Hutchison Cancer Center. Records from 2016 to 2023 were identified via our institutional AML database and supplemented by reviewing inpatient oncology admission lists in the electronic medical record (EMR). Subjects were then screened for eligibility and episodes of FN. We included adults aged ≥ 18 years with newly diagnosed (ND), relapsed, or refractory high-grade myeloid neoplasms (≥ 10% blasts in the blood/marrow) who had received intensive chemotherapy in the preceding 8 weeks and were then discharged from the hospital during their cytopenic period. At our institution, we discharge patients immediately after the completion of induction or postremission therapy as long as they can stay within 60 minutes of our center and have a caregiver. Intensive chemotherapy was defined as a regimen including a backbone of "7 + 3", CPX-351, or cytarabine at a dose ≥ 1000 mg/m 2 per day, and could be given either as (re)induction or postremission (eg, "consolidation") therapy. Prior allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) was allowed if it was at least 3 months before the FN episode. FN was defined as a fever ≥ 38.3°C with neutrophil count < 1000 cells per μL measured within the last 48 hours.

Is colony-stimulating therapy needed?

Again, local guidelines should set out the indications for using G-CSF during treatment of neutropenia.

Uncomplicated, short-duration neutropenia should not need routine G-CSF support, even if the patient is febrile. However, many local policies advocate the treatment if the patient is clinically septic and/or hypotensive, expected to have neutropenia of long duration (as with certain chemotherapeutic regimens for haematological diseases), or has organ dysfunction. It is not good practice to wait and see if the patient struggles to recover from the neutropenic event; it is far better to identify those patients at greater risk and intervene early, even given the current absence of randomised data showing that this approach improves survival.

### Myeloid growth factor therapy for prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia in non-myeloid malignancies: appropriate doses and schedules [^95b307b3]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2007). Low credibility.

Myeloid growth factors (MGFs) are used for the prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia and maintenance of scheduled dose delivery in the treatment of patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy. To spare cost and for patient convenience, in adults MGFs are used at schedules, doses, and durations that differ from the approved prescribing information of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. These variations include rounding doses to convenient sizes, fewer days of treatment, a shorter interval between cycles, and same-day administration with chemotherapy. Some of these variations are supported by clinical trial results and practice guidelines.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for treating newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia in older adults [^f234e440]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Older adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) — postremission therapy outcomes, patient values, and panel conclusions are summarized as follows: Moderate-quality evidence reports that 1 cycle of consolidation has lower mortality (RR, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–1.03) and longer survival by a median of 3 months and time to recurrence by a median of 1 month versus no consolidation. Compared with 1 cycle of intensive inpatient consolidation, 6 months of low-dose outpatient ambulatory postremission therapy may have 0.63 times the risk of dying (95% confidence interval, 0.64–1.07) and 0.66 times the risk of recurrence (95% confidence interval, 0.44–1), and the risk of febrile neutropenia is lower with 6 cycles of low-dose outpatient ambulatory postremission therapy (RR, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.30–0.52). Not receiving consolidation therapy may have a higher risk of death (RR, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.96–3.20) and a higher risk of recurrence (RR, 2.24) than auto-HSCT. Patients valued being in complete remission (utility, 0.88, on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 is dead and 1 is totally healthy), considered relapse negative (health state and utility ranged from 0.10 to 0.50), and attributed to consolidation therapy a median health state ranging from 0.47 to 0.70. Very low-quality evidence suggests the possibility of greater harms of more postremission therapy than less postremission therapy. The panel recommends that in addition to discussions with patients regarding prolonging survival and treatment-related mortality associated with any postremission modality, decisions about postremission treatment should include the patient's expectations in relation to the intensity of postremission therapy, the patient's social circumstances, the impact on the patient's quality of life, and the availability of family support. The panel determined that there may be a benefit of postremission therapy over no additional therapy in older adults with AML who achieve remission after at least a single cycle of intensive antileukemic therapy and who are not candidates for allo-HSCT, and acknowledged that the evidence is not sufficient to make a recommendation for a specific number of cycles beyond 1 cycle.

### Neutropenic fever prophylaxis during induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia… [^d6725c55]. ASCO (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract e18531 Neutropenic Fever Prophylaxis During Induction Therapy for Acute Myeloid LeukemiaNassim Nabbout, MD, Salam Kadhem, MD, Rawaa Ebrahem, MD, Rossa Khalaf, MD, Baharat Malhotra, MD, K. James Kallail, PhD. Background: Neutropenic fever is an oncological emergency that occurs at a high rate in patients with acute myeloid leukemia undergoing induction chemotherapy. Oral antibiotics have been considered standard of care for prophylaxis for these patients once they develop neutropenia. To determine the efficacy of this approach, we conducted a retrospective review of newly diagnosed AML patients. Methods: All adult patients who underwent induction treatment for newly diagnosed AML at one Wichita, Kansas medical center between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013 were identified. The medical records were reviewed and pre-specified variables were collected. Results: Thirty-eight patients were included and their charts were reviewed.

Nineteen were males. Thirty-six patients were white. The average white blood count on day 1 of treatment was 34000 cell/mm. 3and the range was 1300
- 305, 000 cell/mm 3. The average ANC was 3700 cell/mm 3with the range of 10
- 28288 cell/mm.
3. All patients received prophylactic oral antibiotics once they became neutropenic. In all, but one patient, this regimen consisted of combination of levofloxacin, acyclovir, and fluconazole. Thirty-four patients developed neutropenic fever while they were on oral prophylactic antibiotics. Two patients developed septic shock. Four patients died during the first 21 days of induction, all due to infections, and three went to hospice. Causative organisms were identified in 11 patients. All patients were switched to intravenous vancomycin and cefepime once they became febrile. Conclusions: Eighty-nine percent of patients developed neutropenic fever despite prophylaxis with oral antibiotics.

These dismal results suggest that the current standard of care for neutropenic fever prophylaxis is ineffective and highlight the need for a different approach. Future studies should consider changing the regimens of antibiotics and/or the route of administration toward more aggressive prophylactic strategies.

### Refining the role of pegfilgrastim (a long-acting G-CSF) for prevention of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia: consensus guidance recommendations [^b92c7a5d]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Special considerations for patients with hematologic malignancies

In patients with multiple myeloma (MM) needing G-CSF, pegfilgrastim can be given in some instances, but filgrastim may have more applications given some current regimens and can be given concurrently with some treatment regimens (e.g. immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors) (consensus reached (100%); evidence level V).

There are limited studies with pegfilgrastim in patients with MM. Many patients are ≥ 65 years old with a high risk of FN and therefore require G-CSF treatment, although risk of FN is regimen dependent. MM guidelines recommend use of a G-CSF to allow optimal duration of active therapy; this should be initiated if grade 4 neutropenia (uncomplicated) or grade 3 neutropenia (with infection) occurs and continued until disease progression or toxicity is encountered. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis is recommended when the rate of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia is expected to be > 50% and with low or intermediate risk regimens when tumor- or patient-related risk factors are present and ANC is < 1000 cells/mL at the start of chemotherapy.

Weekly and fortnightly chemotherapy regimens are more frequent in treatment of MM, which may result in a greater role for filgrastim than pegfilgrastim. Risk of FN is less clear with non-chemotherapy regimens; the most appropriate choice of G-CSF with some agents (e.g. immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors) has not yet been determined.

In newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) receiving induction therapy, filgrastim could be considered. In patients receiving consolidation chemotherapy with curative intent, pegfilgrastim may be preferred to filgrastim (consensus reached (100%); evidence level II).

There are limited studies with pegfilgrastim in patients with AML and its long-term effects have not been established. Although data are emerging, there is currently no strong evidence to support its use in this patient population.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for treating newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia in older adults [^6a8e0ed2]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

ASH 2020 AML in older adults — Recommendation 4b suggests using monotherapy with 1 of these drugs over a combination of 1 of these drugs with other agents for older adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are appropriate for antileukemic therapy but not for intensive antileukemic therapy, a conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence of effects; remarks note evidence of effectiveness for low-dose cytarabine in combination with glasdegib and for hypomethylating agents in combination with venetoclax. When azacitidine monotherapy is compared with low-dose cytarabine monotherapy, patients probably have a lower risk of death over time (HR, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.63–1.04) and a lower risk of death at 2 years (risk ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.64–0.94). When low-dose cytarabine monotherapy is compared with a low-dose cytarabine combination, patients may have a lower risk of febrile neutropenia (risk ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.25–1.03). With regard to combination therapies, low-dose cytarabine–based combinations have largely not shown an important benefit compared with low-dose cytarabine monotherapy, and combinations should not be used unless there is evidence through randomized data from phase 3 trials to support their use; the combination of low-dose cytarabine and glasdegib was tested in a randomized phase 2 study with a survival advantage, and preliminary reports from the phase 3 VIALE-A study report a CR/CRi and an OS advantage to the combination. For harms, decitabine monotherapy results in a higher risk of neutropenia than low-dose cytarabine monotherapy (risk ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.16–2.27) and likely results in a higher risk of febrile neutropenia (risk ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.96–1.75); gemtuzumab ozogamicin has been approved as monotherapy in older patients with AML, but there are no randomized data comparing it to other monotherapy regimens and its efficacy is also limited for patients with adverse disease biology.

### Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors as prophylaxis against febrile neutropenia [^d1b9a197]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Myelosuppression secondary to chemotherapy remains a serious adverse effect of cancer therapy that causes high morbidity and mortality. Several current European and American guidelines recommend consideration of primary prophylaxis with colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) when the risk of febrile neutropenia is higher than 20%. The main factors associated with a high risk of febrile neutropenia include the chemotherapy regimen, tumor type, and patient-related factors such as old age and/or comorbidities. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the most relevant clinical trials and updated recommendations of the main guidelines on the role of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) in febrile neutropenia, examining whether the combination of G-CSF with chemotherapy improves overall survival. Future directions for G-CSF use are also discussed.

### Condensed versus standard schedule of high-dose cytarabine consolidation therapy with pegfilgrastim growth factor support in acute myeloid leukemia [^efcc5a1e]. Blood Cancer Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia represents a major risk factor for infection-related morbidity and mortality during AML treatment with an incidence of neutropenic fever after a consolidation therapy reported of 50 to 90%. The meta-analysis performed by Smith et al. revealed that the use of prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) after induction and consolidation chemotherapy for patients in complete remission (CR) decreases the incidence of infections and diminishes the likelihood of hospitalizations during intensive consolidation therapy. Similar results were obtained in a meta-analysis published in 2007 by Sung et al.in which 148 randomized clinical trials were evaluated including patients with solid and hematologic malignancies treated with chemotherapy or hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). In the subgroup analysis focused on AML, the risk of microbiologically documented infections (hazard ratio (HR): 0.86; confidence interval (CI): 0.77–0.96) and febrile neutropenia (HR: 0.71; CI: 0.63–0.80) were found to be lower in the group randomized to G-CSF. However, the infection-related mortality was not significantly different with and without G-CSF (P = 0.44). Different results came from a systematic review published by Gurion et al.in which 19 randomized clinical trials were examined. They found no survival benefit and no decrease in infection rates in the group of patients treated with G-CSF after chemotherapy. In consequence, the last actualization of the AML-NCCN guidelines recommended the use of G-CSF in AML only within clinical trials. Pegfilgrastim is the pegylated formulation of G-CSF that allows one-time administration compared with daily administration with filgrastim. In a randomized phase-2 trial Sierra et al. found no clinically meaningful difference between a single dose of pegfilgrastim and daily dosing of filgrastim in terms of duration of severe neutropenia after induction and consolidation therapy.

The main objectives of our study were to analyze the effect of a condensed regimen of HDAC, 3 g/m 2 administered every 12 h on days 1, 2 and 3 (HDAC-123), compared with the commonly used regimen of HDAC, 3 g/m 2 every 12 h on days 1, 3 and 5 (HDAC-135), as well as to evaluate the effect of pegfilgrastim in the consolidation therapy of younger adult patients with AML with regard to hematologic reconstitution, infectious complications, supportive care and days in hospital.

### Acute myeloid leukemia, version 3.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^b087349d]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Growth factors (G-CSF or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) use in AML and APL — induction, consolidation, and postremission guidance: Growth factors are not recommended during induction for patients with APL. In AML (non-APL), growth factors may be considered during induction for patients who are septic and who have a life-threatening infection in an attempt to shorten the duration of neutropenia, and some regimens such as FLAG incorporate G-CSF into the regimen. Because the use of growth factors may complicate the interpretation of marrow results, there is a recommendation to discontinue colony-stimulating factors at least a week before a planned marrow sample to assess remission status. There is no evidence for whether growth factors have a positive or negative impact on long-term outcome if used during consolidation. For postremission therapy, growth factors may be considered as part of supportive care but are not routinely recommended, except in life-threatening infections or when signs and symptoms of sepsis are present and the leukemia is believed to be in remission.

### Management of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia: measuring quality, cost, and value [^813faba1]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment-associated neutropenia continues to represent the most common dose-limiting toxicity of cancer chemotherapy. It often leads to fever and infection, prompting hospitalization and occasionally resulting in serious morbidity, and even mortality, despite modern broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment and supportive care. Neutropenia and its complications may also lead to chemotherapy dose reductions, treatment delays, or early treatment termination, compromising disease control and the potential for cure. NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology recommend administration of primary prophylaxis with a myeloid growth factor in patients receiving regimens associated with a high risk for febrile neutropenia, and consideration of prophylaxis in patients receiving lower-risk regimens who have other risk factors that might place them at higher risk for febrile neutropenia. Although these agents have been shown to be effective and safe in numerous randomized controlled trials, they are expensive and contribute significantly to increasing health care costs. Regulatory agencies and guideline organizations do not currently address the issue of cost. However, with the relentless increase in health care use and current efforts to reform health care, it has become increasingly important to assess both the cost and the net benefit of interventions related to an episode of care in order to compare the overall value of therapeutic options. This article defines and discusses the intersection of quality, costs, and value in the context of prophylactic myeloid growth factor use in patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy.

### Colony-stimulating factors for chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia [^c612ccc2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Febrile neutropenia is a frequent adverse event experienced by people with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy, and is a potentially life-threatening situation. The current treatment is supportive care plus antibiotics. Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), such as granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), are cytokines that stimulate and accelerate the production of one or more cell lines in the bone marrow. Clinical trials have addressed the question of whether the addition of a CSF to antibiotics could improve outcomes in individuals diagnosed with febrile neutropenia. However, the results of these trials are conflicting.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding G-CSF or GM-CSF to standard treatment (antibiotics) when treating chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in individuals diagnosed with cancer.

Search Methods

We conducted the search in March 2014 and covered the major electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and SCI. We contacted experts in hematology and oncology and also scanned the citations from the relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared CSF plus antibiotics versus antibiotics alone for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in adults and children.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We performed meta-analysis of the selected studies using Review Manager 5 software.

Main Results

Fourteen RCTs (15 comparisons) including a total of 1553 participants addressing the role of CSF plus antibiotics in febrile neutropenia were included. Overall mortality was not improved by the use of CSF plus antibiotics versus antibiotics alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 1.16) P = 0.19; 13 RCTs; 1335 participants; low quality evidence). A similar finding was seen for infection-related mortality (HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.20) P = 0.23; 10 RCTs; 897 participants; low quality evidence). Individuals who received CSF plus antibiotics were less likely to be hospitalized for more than 10 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.65 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.95) P = 0.03; 8 RCTs; 1221 participants; low quality evidence) and had more number of participants with a more faster neutrophil recovery (RR 0.52 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.81) P = 0.004; 5 RCTs; 794 participants; moderate quality evidence) than those treated with antibiotics alone. Similarly, participants receiving CSF plus antibiotics had shorter duration of neutropenia (standardized mean difference (SMD) -1.70 (95% CI -2.65 to -0.76) P = 0.0004; 9 RCTs; 1135 participants; moderate quality evidence), faster recovery from fever (SMD -0.49 (95% CI -0.90 to -0.09) P value = 0.02; 9 RCTs; 966 participants; moderate quality evidence) and shorter duration of antibiotics use (SMD -1.50 (95% CI -2.83 to -0.18) P = 0.03; 3 RCTs; 457 participants; low quality evidence) compared with participants receiving antibiotics alone. We found no significant difference in the incidence of deep venous thromboembolism (RR 1.68 (95% CI 0.72 to 3.93) P = 0.23; 4 RCTs; 389 participants; low quality evidence) in individuals treated with CSF plus antibiotics compared with those treated with antibiotics alone. We found higher incidence of bone or joint pain or flu-like symptoms (RR 1.59 (95% CI 1.04 to 2.42) P = 0.03; 6 RCTs; 622 participants; low quality evidence) in individuals treated with CSF plus antibiotics compared with those treated with antibiotics alone. Overall, the methodological quality of studies was moderate to low across different outcomes. The main reasons to downgrade the quality of evidence were inconsistency across the included studies and imprecision of results.

Authors' Conclusions

The use of a CSF plus antibiotics in individuals with chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia had no effect on overall mortality, but reduced the amount of time participants spent in hospital and improved their ability to achieve neutrophil recovery. It was not clear whether CSF plus antibiotics had an effect on infection-related mortality. Participants receiving CSFs had shorter duration of neutropenia, faster recovery from fever and shorter duration of antibiotics use.

### Identification of factors predicting low-risk febrile neutropenia admissions in adults with acute myeloid leukemia [^290f9c7e]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our study provides novel insights into how best to predict which patients with AML presenting with FN are less likely to develop a severe illness. By developing a MV model, we identified key predictors of LR admissions and demonstrated the limitations of the existing FN risk models in this population. Our findings underscore the need for tailored risk prediction tools to guide clinical decision-making and optimize the management of FN in patients with AML. Ideally, such a tool could be used to identify selected patients with AML in whom close outpatient management of FN with IV antibiotics and advanced VS monitoring tools would be safe, thus alleviating the burden of hospitalization and improving patient quality of life. However, such a tool would require almost 100% predictive accuracy given the high risk of incorrect predictions. Based on our results, much work still needs to be done to develop such a model for AML, and the current approach to hospitalization should remain the standard of care. Future research will aim to refine our LR outcome measures and further develop and validate our model in multicenter cohorts, including those treated with lower-intensity therapies, to enhance its generalizability, assess its performance in diverse clinical settings, and assess how to best integrate it into clinical practice.

14.2 Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia Receiving Induction or Consolidation Chemotherapy

The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the time to neutrophil recovery and the duration of fever, following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was established in a randomized, double-blind‚ placebo-controlled‚ multi-center trial in patients with newly diagnosed, de novo AML (Study 4).

In Study 4 the initial induction therapy consisted of intravenous daunorubicin days 1, 2, and 3; cytosine arabinoside days 1 to 7; and etoposide days 1 to 5. Patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous filgrastim (n = 259) at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/day or placebo (n = 262) from 24 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery (ANC ≥ 1,000/mm³ for 3 consecutive days or ≥ 10,000/mm³ for 1 day) or for a maximum of 35 days. The demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between arms with a median age of 54 (range 16 to 89) years; 54% males; initial white blood cell count (65% < 25,000/mm³ and 27% > 100,000/mm³); 29% unfavorable cytogenetics.

The main efficacy endpoint was median duration of severe neutropenia defined as neutrophil count < 500/mm³. Treatment with filgrastim resulted in a clinically and statistically significant reduction in median number of days of severe neutropenia, filgrastim-treated patients 14 days, placebo-treated patients 19 days (p = 0.0001: difference of 5 days (95% CI: -6.0, -4.0)).

There was a reduction in the median duration of intravenous antibiotic use, filgrastim-treated patients: 15 days versus placebo-treated patients: 18.5 days; a reduction in the median duration of hospitalization, filgrastim-treated patients: 20 days versus placebo-treated patients: 25 days.

There were no statistically significant differences between the filgrastim and the placebo groups in complete remission rate (69% - filgrastim, 68% - placebo), median time to progression of all randomized patients (165 days - filgrastim, 186 days - placebo), or median overall survival (380 days - filgrastim, 425 days - placebo).

### Outpatient management of fever and neutropenia in adults treated for malignancy: American Society of Clinical Oncology and Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline update [^498fd490]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose To provide an updated joint ASCO/Infectious Diseases Society of American (IDSA) guideline on outpatient management of fever and neutropenia in patients with cancer. Methods ASCO and IDSA convened an Update Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of relevant studies. The guideline recommendations were based on the review of evidence by the Expert Panel. Results Six new or updated meta-analyses and six new primary studies were added to the updated systematic review. Recommendation Clinical judgment is recommended when determining which patients are candidates for outpatient management, using clinical criteria or a validated tool such as the Multinational Association of Support Care in Cancer risk index. In addition, psychosocial and logistic considerations are outlined within the guideline. The panel continued to endorse consensus recommendations from the previous version of this guideline that patients with febrile neutropenia receive initial doses of empirical antibacterial therapy within 1 hour of triage and be monitored for ≥ 4 hours before discharge. An oral fluoroquinolone plus amoxicillin/clavulanate (or clindamycin, if penicillin allergic) is recommended as empirical outpatient therapy, unless fluoroquinolone prophylaxis was used before fever developed. Patients who do not defervesce after 2 to 3 days of an initial, empirical, broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen should be re-evaluated and considered as candidates for inpatient treatment.

### Stopping antibiotic therapy after 72 h in patients with febrile neutropenia following intensive chemotherapy for AML / MDS (safe study): a retrospective comparative cohort study [^dc15eaa7]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), treated with classic "3 + 7″ induction chemotherapy, always go through an episode of longstanding neutropenia of three to four weeks. In more than 80% of these patients, at least one episode of febrile neutropenia (FN) is observed. As fever might be the first sign of an overwhelming infection, all patients with FN receive empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment (EBAT). However, it is unclear for how long EBAT should be continued. The current guideline of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends to continue treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics until bone marrow recovery. The European Conference of Infections in Leukemia (ECIL-4) guidelines states that antibiotics can be discontinued after 72 h if the patient is hemodynamically stable and has been afebrile for 48 h, irrespective of neutrophil count and expected duration of neutropenia. These strategies result in long periods of broad-spectrum antibiotic use, although an infectious cause can typically be documented in 20–30% of patients with FN. To reduce side effects, antibiotic selective pressure on the human microbiota, and antimicrobial resistance development, a more rational use of antibiotics is necessary. Therefore, if safe, stopping antibiotic therapy earlier in patients without signs of a bacterial infection could provide significant benefits.

Research in context

In 2017, the How Long study was published. This randomized controlled trial strongly suggests that the early discontinuation of antibiotics given for FN is safe when the patient has become afebrile for 72 h after the start of EBAT. Compared to the standard end-of-neutropenia approach, this clinically oriented approach significantly increased the number of antibiotic-free days (i.e. the primary endpoint), without adversely affecting mortality or days of fever (i.e. the secondary endpoints). In 2009, a prospective observational study at Erasmus MC University Medical Center in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, showed that in 166 patients with AML, the use of a FN protocol which advocates the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy after 72 h when no infection is diagnosed is safe even in patients with ongoing fever. Though promising, this single center non-randomized study cannot be considered sufficient evidence to change treatment guidelines. We performed a large retrospective comparative cohort study to assess if the "3-day EBAT strategy" is safe in AML patients with FN during their first induction chemotherapy. We focused on the first remission induction chemotherapy episode in order to have a study population as homogeneous as possible.

### Early discontinuation of antibiotics for febrile neutropenia versus continuation until neutropenia resolution in people with cancer [^a8b7e1d2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

People with cancer with febrile neutropenia are at risk of severe infections and mortality and are thus treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. However, the recommended duration of antibiotic therapy differs across guidelines.

Objectives

To assess the safety of protocol-guided discontinuation of antibiotics regardless of neutrophil count, compared to continuation of antibiotics until neutropenia resolution in people with cancer with fever and neutropenia, in terms of mortality and morbidity. To assess the emergence of resistant bacteria in people with cancer treated with short courses of antibiotic therapy compared with people with cancer treated until resolution of neutropenia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 10) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS up to 1 October 2018. We searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing and unpublished trials. We reviewed the references of all identified studies for additional trials and handsearched conference proceedings of international infectious diseases and oncology and haematology conferences.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a short antibiotic therapy course in which discontinuation of antibiotics was guided by protocols regardless of the neutrophil count to a long course in which antibiotics were continued until neutropenia resolution in people with cancer with febrile neutropenia. The primary outcome was 30-day or end of follow-up all-cause mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed all studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias for all included trials. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) whenever possible. For dichotomous outcomes with zero events in both arms of the trials, we conducted meta-analysis of risk differences (RDs) as well. For continuous outcomes, we extracted means with standard deviations (SD) from the studies and computed mean difference (MD) and 95% CI. If no substantial clinical heterogeneity was found, trials were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs comprising a total of 662 distinct febrile neutropenia episodes. The studies included adults and children, and had variable design and criteria for discontinuation of antibiotics in both study arms. All included studies but two were performed before the year 2000. All studies included people with cancer with fever of unknown origin and excluded people with microbiological documented infections. We found no significant difference between the short-antibiotic therapy arm and the long-antibiotic therapy arm for all-cause mortality (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.62; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.05; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to low due to imprecision and high risk of selection bias. The number of fever days was significantly lower for people in the short-antibiotic treatment arm compared to the long-antibiotic treatment arm (mean difference -0.64, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.32; I² = 30%). In all studies, total antibiotic days were fewer in the intervention arm by three to seven days compared to the long antibiotic therapy. We found no significant differences in the rates of clinical failure (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.77; very low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for clinical failure due to variable and inconsistent definitions of clinical failure across studies, possible selection bias, and wide confidence intervals. There was no significant difference in the incidence of bacteraemia occurring after randomisation (RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.66; very low-certainty evidence), while the incidence of any documented infections was significantly higher in the short-antibiotic therapy arm (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.57). There was no significant difference in the incidence of invasive fungal infections (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.31) and development of antibiotic resistance (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.61). The data on hospital stay were too sparse to permit any meaningful conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

We could make no strong conclusions on the safety of antibiotic discontinuation before neutropenia resolution among people with cancer with febrile neutropenia based on the existing evidence and its low certainty. Results of microbiological outcomes favouring long antibiotic therapy may be misleading due to lower culture positivity rates under antibiotic therapy and not true differences in infection rates. Well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are required that address this issue in the era of rising antibiotic resistance.

NCCN recommendations for induction therapy in acute promyelocytic leukemia — general principles state that the Panel recommends treatment according to one of the regimens established from the clinical trials, and one should use a regimen consistently through all components of the protocol and not mix induction regimens from one trial with consolidation regimens from another trial. The Panel emphasizes the importance of receiving treatment from an established treatment center, and collaboration with a center with expertise has been shown to reduce induction mortality. Recommendations are broken down by risk classification using WBC count (cutoff of 10 x 10^9/L) at diagnosis and whether patients with high-risk disease have cardiac issues, and it is important that regimens containing ATRA and ATO be administered unless there is a contraindication based on extenuating patient circumstances.

14.2	Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia Receiving Induction or Consolidation Chemotherapy

The safety and efficacy of NEUPOGEN to reduce the time to neutrophil recovery and the duration of fever, following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was established in a randomized, double-blind‚ placebo-controlled‚ multi-center trial in patients with newly diagnosed, de novo AML (Study 4).

In Study 4 the initial induction therapy consisted of intravenous daunorubicin days 1, 2, and 3; cytosine arabinoside days 1 to 7; and etoposide days 1 to 5. Patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous NEUPOGEN (n = 259) at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/day or placebo (n = 262) from 24 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery (ANC ≥ 1,000/mm³ for 3 consecutive days or ≥ 10,000/mm³ for 1 day) or for a maximum of 35 days. The demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between arms with a median age of 54 (range 16 to 89) years; 54% males; initial white blood cell count (65% < 25,000/mm³ and 27% > 100,000/mm³); 29% unfavorable cytogenetics.

The main efficacy endpoint was median duration of severe neutropenia defined as neutrophil count < 500/mm³. Treatment with NEUPOGEN resulted in a clinically and statistically significant reduction in median number of days of severe neutropenia, NEUPOGEN-treated patients 14 days, placebo-treated patients 19 days (p = 0.0001: difference of 5 days (95% CI: -6.0, -4.0)). There was a reduction in the median duration of intravenous antibiotic use, NEUPOGEN-treated patients: 15 days versus placebo-treated patients: 18.5 days; a reduction in the median duration of hospitalization, NEUPOGEN-treated patients: 20 days versus placebo-treated patients: 25 days.

There were no statistically significant differences between the NEUPOGEN and the placebo groups in complete remission rate (69% - NEUPOGEN, 68% - placebo), median time to progression of all randomized patients (165 days - NEUPOGEN, 186 days - placebo), or median overall survival (380 days - NEUPOGEN, 425 days - placebo).

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Study cohort and ethical considerations

This prospective study included adult patients aged ≥ 18 years hospitalized at Angers University Hospital between March 2014 and October 2017 for acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) induction, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) induction or consolidation or high‐dose chemotherapy with autologous haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) as consolidation treatment for multiple myeloma or lymphoma. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia were not included. The same patient may be included several times during successive courses of chemotherapy. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Definitions

Neutropenia is defined as a neutrophil count ≤ 0.5 G/L. Fever is defined as a body temperature ≥ 38.3°C once or ≥ 38°C at least twice within 1 h.

Patient data were classified according to two different classifications: recommendations from the 2001 International Sepsis Definitions Conferenceaccording to the severity of the infectious event and according to the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (qSOFA) at the onset of fever. The first classification divided into three 'fever groups': 'on‐complicated FN — without sepsis' (group 1), including patients with FN and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS); 'Sepsis' (group 2); and 'Severe sepsis' (group 3) including patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Sepsis was defined as SIRS with a documented or suspected infection, severe sepsis as sepsis with at least one organ injury and septic shock as severe sepsis with ongoing arterial hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation and requiring the use of vasopressor therapy. Concerning qSOFA, the presence of at least two criteria was considered a poor prognostic factor, and patients were classified into two groups: qSOFA < 2 and qSOFA ≥ 2.

### Summary and comparison of myeloid growth factor guidelines in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy [^c18219a5]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2007). Low credibility.

Three different practice guidelines for the myeloid growth factors were recently published by major professional organizations. A comprehensive review and comparison of the guidelines using a priori structured content criteria and a previously validated quality appraisal tool are reported. The final recommendations from these guidelines are consistent for primary prophylaxis with the colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) when the risk of febrile neutropenia is in the range of 20% or greater. All 3 guidelines also recommend prophylactic use of myeloid growth factors in patients with important factors increasing individual risk of neutropenic complications. The recommendation that patients receiving regimens associated with lower risk should have CSF use guided by individual risk assessment is also consistent. Critical quality appraisal indicates that the scope, purpose, stakeholder involvement, and applicability of these guidelines differ little. The American Society of Clinical Oncology and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer guidelines place more emphasis on comprehensive literature reviews, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines are more current based on systematic annual updates. Presentation clarity also favors National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, with recommendations generally presented as both text and algorithmic diagram.

### Prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia with granulocyte colony-stimulating factors: where are we now? [^14f9f844]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Secondary malignancies

On the basis of retrospective data, it has been suggested that G-CSF/GM-CSF use might lead to a small increase in the risk of secondary malignancies. In patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) occurred in 1.77% of those who had received G-CSF or GM-CSF (n = 906) compared with 1.04% of those who had not (n = 4,604; HR 2.14, 95% CI 1.12–4.08). However, as acknowledged by the investigators, anthracyclines and cyclophosphamide may increase the risk of second malignancies in a dose-related manner; administration of G-CSF may have allowed higher chemotherapy doses to be delivered, thereby confounding the analysis. Moreover, data from other studies, including a very large observational study (n = 64,715), have not indicated an increased risk of secondary AML/MDS with G-CSF use.

A recent meta-analysis found that although intensified chemotherapy with G-CSF support slightly increased the risk of second malignancies compared with standard chemotherapy without G-CSF, this was more than offset by the survival benefits. Thus, the overall risk/benefit ratio continues to favour G-CSF use, as it facilitates chemotherapy delivery and prevents life-threatening FN.

### Early stoppage of empirical antibiotic therapy in paediatric acute leukaemia with high-risk febrile neutropenia: a randomized, open-label, phase 3, non-inferiority trial [^80eb0f51]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Febrile neutropenia is a common and potentially life-threatening complication seen in paediatric patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute leukaemia. The immunocompromised state caused by intensive chemotherapy blunts the typical inflammatory responses, making early fever often the only clinical clue of a serious underlying infection. Consequently, prompt initiation of empirical antibiotic therapy (EAT) is the cornerstone of management to reduce mortality due to febrile neutropenia.

The latest Clinical Practice Guidelines conditionally recommend cessation of EAT in patients with low-risk febrile neutropenia who are clinically stable and have been afebrile for at least 24 h, even in the absence of evidence of bone marrow recovery, provided blood cultures remain negative at 48 h. However, the guidelines currently recommend continuing EAT in afebrile patients with high-risk febrile neutropenia until bone marrow recovery. Reflecting on this recommendation, a recent survey of clinicians managing paediatric febrile neutropenia found that the majority recommend continuing EAT until marrow recovery in afebrile patients with high-risk febrile neutropenia. Although continuing EAT until bone marrow recovery is recommended based on the assumption that it may reduce the risk of untreated infections during prolonged neutropenia, conversely, there are concerns that this approach may lead to unnecessarily prolonged antibiotic use in the absence of documented infection or persistent symptoms. Prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy is associated with increased antimicrobial resistance and longer hospital stays, both of which contribute to the financial and time toxicity of cancer treatment.

Multiple randomized trials in adult patients with haematological malignancies have demonstrated that early discontinuation of EAT during febrile neutropenia is a viable strategy that increases antibiotic-free days without elevating the risk of adverse events or mortality. While previous paediatric studies have shown that early discontinuation of EAT is non-inferior to continuation until bone marrow recovery in children with low-risk febrile neutropenia, evidence in high-risk febrile neutropenia among children remains limited. A multicentre randomized trial involving children with low and high-risk febrile neutropenia, who tested positive for respiratory viral pathogens and became afebrile after 48 h of EAT, compared early antibiotic discontinuation versus continuation until bone marrow recovery. Although this study demonstrated the non-inferiority of the early discontinuation strategy, factors such as persistent viral detection after clinical recovery and asymptomatic colonization raised concerns regarding routine viral testing to guide early antibiotic discontinuation.

To address this important evidence gap, we conducted a randomized, open-label, non-inferiority trial among children with acute leukaemia with high-risk febrile neutropenia during induction to evaluate whether early discontinuation of EAT among children with sustained clinical improvement before bone marrow recovery is non-inferior to continuation of EAT until bone marrow recovery.

### Identification of factors predicting low-risk febrile neutropenia admissions in adults with acute myeloid leukemia [^2d32652f]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Febrile neutropenia (FN) is the most common complication after intensive chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The current standard approach for FN is hospital admission for IV antibiotics due to concern for high infection-related morbidity and mortality; thus FN is a major driver of hospital readmission and acute care bed utilization after therapy for AML. Whether this approach is justified in all clinical scenarios is unknown. Furthermore, in at least 15% to 30% of FN cases, the causative infectious pathogens cannot be identified despite thorough diagnostic evaluations, implicating noninfectious causes of fever in some cases, such as disease, mucosal inflammation, medications, or transfusions, which might not warrant hospital admission. Admitting all patients despite the potential for less severe episodes of FN or noninfectious causes may not be beneficial. Thus, the ability to identify these episodes of "lower-risk (LR)" FN upfront is appealing to expedite clinical decision-making and potentially avoid hospitalizations that contribute to the current inpatient bed shortage, increase the use of health care resources, and negatively impact patient quality of life.

Multiple studies have been done to create models and guidelines that aim to define a low-risk group of oncology patients with FN (Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer [MASCC] score, clinical index of stable febrile neutropenia [CISNE] score, Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines, and National Comprehensive Cancer Center guidelines). These have largely been developed and validated in solid tumors, and many exclude patients with hematologic malignancies or expected severe neutropenia. These tools have led to several randomized clinical trials in solid tumors that have provided evidence supporting the feasibility and safety of ambulatory treatment for low-risk FN. When patients with AML are included, they are often automatically categorized into higher-risk (HR) groups, thus excluding them a priori from potential low-risk categorization.

With the decline in mortality after AML therapy, improvements in our ability to provide complex care at outpatient facilities, and/or at home (eg, via home infusion services), and the availability of oral broad-spectrum antimicrobials that can replace IV medications in certain circumstances, outpatient treatment of FN in AML may now be feasible in selected, otherwise medically stable patients, if they can be identified. We, therefore, aim in this study to (1) determine whether baseline demographic, disease-related, and clinical characteristics can predict which patients with AML and FN have a lower risk of progression to severe illness, and (2) evaluate the performance of established risk models in this population.

Abstract Purpose Methods Results Recommendation Introduction 1Neutrophils are critical in providing host defense against infection, particularly bacterial and fungal infections.

### Methodology for clinical trials involving patients with cancer who have febrile neutropenia: updated guidelines of the immunocompromised host society / multinational association for supportive care in cancer, with emphasis on outpatient studies [^852bff20]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Two multinational organizations, the Immunocompromised Host Society and the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer, have produced for investigators and regulatory bodies a set of guidelines on methodology for clinical trials involving patients with febrile neutropenia. The guidelines suggest that response (i.e., success of initial empirical antibiotic therapy without any modification) be determined at 72 h and again on day 5, and the reasons for modification should be stated. Blinding and stratification are to be encouraged, as should statistical consideration of trials specifically designed for showing equivalence. Patients enrolled in outpatient studies should be selected by use of a validated risk model, and patients should be carefully monitored after discharge from the hospital. Response and safety parameters should be recorded along with readmission rates. If studies use these guidelines, comparisons between studies will be simpler and will lead to further improvements in patient therapy.

### Prevention of febrile neutropenia: use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors [^057adbd6]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Guidelines on prevention of FN

Chemotherapy dose reduction/delay is not the only strategy available for reducing FN-related morbidity and mortality. Another option is FN prevention through prophylactic treatment with G-CSF, granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factors (GM–CSF) and/or antibiotics.

Haematopoietic cell growth factors stimulate the proliferation and survival of neutrophils and their precursors, and thereby reduce the severity and duration of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and FN.

Indications for the primary prevention of FN through the use of G-CSFs for patients undergoing chemotherapy have been issued by three well-respected oncology organisations – the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. They all broadly agree that any patient with an FN risk greater than 20% should receive primary prophylaxis with G-CSF with each cycle of chemotherapy (Figure 1). In some instances, the chemotherapy regimen itself carries an FN risk that exceeds this threshold. If the FN risk associated with the regimen is 10–20%, the physician should consider whether patient factors such as age, advanced disease or comorbidities take the overall risk beyond 20%. If the chemotherapy regimen is considered to present an FN risk of less than 10%, primary prophylaxis with G-CSF should not be offered routinely – unless there is thought to be a huge risk of serious FN complications, such as death. However, it is highly likely that G-CSF primary prophylaxis is not always used routinely in clinical practice, despite these clear, evidence-based guidelines.

### Recommendations for the use of WBC growth factors: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update [^aeaf417b]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update the 2006 American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline on the use of hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors (CSFs).

Methods

The American Society of Clinical Oncology convened an Update Committee and conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews from October 2005 through September 2014. Guideline recommendations were based on the review of the evidence by the Update Committee.

Results

Changes to previous recommendations include the addition of tbo-filgrastim and filgrastim-sndz, moderation of the recommendation regarding routine use of CSFs in older patients with diffuse aggressive lymphoma, and addition of recommendations against routine dose-dense chemotherapy in lymphoma and in favor of high-dose-intensity chemotherapy in urothelial cancer. The Update Committee did not address recommendations regarding use of CSFs in acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes in adults.

Recommendations

Prophylactic use of CSFs to reduce the risk of febrile neutropenia is warranted when the risk of febrile neutropenia is approximately 20% or higher and no other equally effective and safe regimen that does not require CSFs is available. Primary prophylaxis is recommended for the prevention of febrile neutropenia in patients who are at high risk on the basis of age, medical history, disease characteristics, and myelotoxicity of the chemotherapy regimen. Dose-dense regimens that require CSFs should only be used within an appropriately designed clinical trial or if supported by convincing efficacy data. Current recommendations for the management of patients exposed to lethal doses of total-body radiotherapy, but not doses high enough to lead to certain death as a result of injury to other organs, include the prompt administration of CSFs.

### Risk of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in cancer patients receiving pegfilgrastim prophylaxis: does timing of administration matter? [^a43c139f]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neutropenia is a common side effect of myelosuppressive chemotherapy that increases the risk of infection. When neutropenic patients develop fever (i.e. febrile neutropenia (FN)), the high likelihood of infection and serious consequences often necessitate hospitalization for urgent evaluation, ongoing monitoring, and administration of intravenous (IV) antibiotics. FN, as well as severe or prolonged neutropenia, can lead to chemotherapy dose-delays, dose-reductions, and/or discontinuation, interfering with the delivery of optimal cancer treatment and possibly adversely affecting patient outcomes.

For adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumors or non-myeloid malignancies, clinical practice guidelines recommend prophylaxis with a colony-stimulating factor (CSF) when FN risk is high (> 20%) based on either chemotherapy regimen risk alone or a combination of regimen risk and patient risk factors. Among the CSFs that are commercially available in the USA, pegfilgrastim is the agent most widely used in clinical practice as, unlike the other agents that are administered daily, it requires only a single dose in each chemotherapy cycle. Because pegfilgrastim rapidly induces the proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells — which may be especially sensitive to myelotoxic agents and could adversely impact the risk of FN — prescribing information specifies that pegfilgrastim should not be administered between 14 days before and 24 h after administration of myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines on myeloid growth factor use state that "the majority of trials administered pegfilgrastim the day after chemotherapy" (based on category 1 evidence: high-level evidence, there is uniform NCCN consensus that the intervention is appropriate) and "administration of pegfilgrastim up to 3–4 days after chemotherapy is also reasonable based on trials with filgrastim". Similarly, the recently promulgated American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines indicate that pegfilgrastim should be administered on days 2–4 from chemotherapy completion, if possible.

Sphere of application of short- or long-acting agents

According to the consensus (Table 6), primary prophylaxis with G-CSF should be considered in patients with a ≥ 20% risk of chemotherapy-induced FN to reduce FN-related complications and to avoid chemotherapy dose reduction (items 32 and 33), as well as in patients with 10–20% risk of developing FN, depending on the patient's clinical characteristics (item 34). The panel also agreed that it is appropriate to use long-acting G-CSF in primary and secondary prophylaxis during chemotherapy regimens with the potential to induce neutropenia of ≤ 500 cells/μL when the treatment goal correlates with maintenance of dose intensity (item 36).

In this respect, the consensus recommendations are consistent with the ASCO, ESMO, NCCN, AIOM, Spanish Society of Medical Oncology (SEOM), and EORTC guidelines for primary prophylaxis in chemotherapy regimens, which recommend G-CSF as primary prophylaxis in patients receiving chemotherapy in the following circumstances: when the likelihood of developing FN is > 20%, when there is an intermediate risk (10–20%), but the risk of FN is increased (patient aged > 65 years, advanced disease, poor performance status, liver or kidney dysfunction, recent extensive surgery, persistent neutropenia, prior episodes of FN, poor nutritional status, widespread bone marrow involvement, multimorbidity, or frailty), or when the consequences of the neutropenic episode are foreseen to be more severe. These guidelines do not recommend G-CSF as primary prophylaxis in patients with < 10% risk of FN or as secondary prophylaxis in patients with a previous episode of FN (in a previous cycle of chemotherapy), where a dose reduction is not recommended as it may affect overall survival or disease-free survival. There are limited data on real-world outcomes of G-CSF prophylaxis in patients with < 10% risk of FN and very little information about the most vulnerable patients, their risk factors for FN or serious FN outcomes.

Neutropenia, a decrease in the absolute neutrophil count, occurs frequently in recipients of chemotherapy. Neutrophils are critical in providing host defense against infection, particularly bacterial and fungal infection. The risk of infection increases with the depth and duration of neutropenia, with the greatest risk occurring in patients who experience profound, prolonged neutropenia after chemotherapy, which is most likely to occur in the period before engraftment during hematopoietic cell transplantation and after induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia. 1Fever can be an important indicator and is often the only sign of infection, although clinicians should also be mindful that severely or profoundly neutropenic patients may present with suspected infection in an afebrile state or even may be hypothermic.

Prevention and appropriate management of neutropenic fever syndromes are important because the rate of major complications in the context of febrile neutropenia is approximately 25% to 30%, and the mortality rate is as high as 11%. 2, 3In addition, in the setting of severe sepsis or septic shock, the in-hospital mortality rate may be as high as 50%. 4 In 2013, ASCO released a guideline on antimicrobial prophylaxis for febrile neutropenia, as well as recommendations for identifying patients with fever and neutropenia who may be treated as outpatients.

### Evidence-based approach to treatment of febrile neutropenia in hematologic malignancies [^6ab95d7b]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Applying the principles of evidence-based medicine to febrile neutropenia (FN) results in a more limited set of practices than expected. Hundreds of studies over the last 4 decades have produced evidence to support the following: (1) risk stratification allows the identification of a subset of patients who may be safely managed as outpatients given the right health care environment; (2) antibacterial prophylaxis for high-risk patients who remain neutropenic for ≥ 7 days prevents infections and decreases mortality; (3) the empirical management of febrile neutropenia with a single antipseudomonal beta-lactam results in the same outcome and less toxicity than combination therapy using aminoglycosides; (4) vancomycin should not be used routinely empirically either as part of the initial regimen or for persistent fever, but rather should be added when a pathogen that requires its use is isolated; (5) empirical antifungal therapy should be added after 4 days of persistent fever in patients at high risk for invasive fungal infection (IFI); the details of the characterization as high risk and the choice of agent remain debatable; and (6) preemptive antifungal therapy in which the initiation of antifungals is postponed and triggered by the presence, in addition to fever, of other clinical findings, computed tomography (CT) results, and serological tests for fungal infection is an acceptable strategy in a subset of patients. Many practical management questions remain unaddressed.

### Management of patients with fever and neutropenia through the arc of time: a narrative review [^a4697c9e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The association between fever and neutropenia and the risk for life-threatening infections in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy has been known for 50 years. Indeed, infectious complications have been a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. This review chronicles the progress in defining and developing approaches to the management of fever and neutropenia through observational and controlled clinical trials done by single institutions, as well as by national and international collaborative groups. The resultant data have led to recommendations and guidelines from professional societies and frame the current principles of management. Recommendations include those guiding new treatment options (from monotherapy to oral antibiotic therapy) and use of prophylactic antimicrobial regimens in high-risk patients. Of note, risk factors have changed with the advent of hematopoietic cytokines (especially granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) in shortening the duration of neutropenia, as well as with the discovery of more targeted cancer treatments that do not result in cytotoxicity, although these are still the exception. Most guiding principles that were developed decades ago-about when to begin empirical treatment after a neutropenic patient becomes febrile, whether and how to modify the initial treatment regimen (especially in patients with protracted neutropenia), and how long to continue antimicrobial therapy-are still used today. This review describes how the treatment principles related to the management of fever and neutropenia have responded to changes in the patients at risk, the microbes responsible, and the tools for their treatment, while still being sustained over the arc of time.

Venetoclax-containing regimens with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) for older adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have defined dosing, safety, and response outcomes. In a phase Ib study in patients ≥ 65 years with previously untreated AML (n = 57), group A (n = 23) received venetoclax plus decitabine 20 mg/m2 daily for 5 days each 28-day cycle and group B (n = 22) received venetoclax plus azacitidine 75 mg/m2 daily for 7 days each 28-day cycle, while a group C substudy (n = 12) added the oral CYP3A inhibitor posaconazole to assess venetoclax pharmacokinetics. Daily venetoclax targets were 400 mg, 800 mg, and 1200 mg; the most common treatment-related adverse event in groups A and B was febrile neutropenia (30% and 32%, respectively), with an overall CR/CRi rate of 61% (95% CI, 47.6–74.0), and in groups A and B the CR/CRi rate was 60% (95% CI, 44.3–74.3). A follow-up evaluated either 400 mg or 800 mg venetoclax combined with decitabine or azacitidine in patients ≥ 65 years ineligible for intensive chemotherapy (n = 145; median age, 74 years).
