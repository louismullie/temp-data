## Question

What is bhakti often translated as?

Answer Choices:
A. Gods
B. Yoga
C. Devotion
D. Religion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the Sanskrit term "bhakti" is most commonly translated as in English, with options including gods, yoga, devotion, and religion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the literal Sanskrit meaning and common English renderings. Then, I should verify which translation appears most frequently in scholarly and pedagogical contexts. Next, I will examine why the alternatives are less accurate or misleading. Finally, I will confirm the best choice and briefly justify it with reference to usage patterns in the literature provided.

> Let me first confirm the literal meaning and typical translations. Bhakti derives from the Sanskrit root bhaj, which carries senses of sharing, participating, and loving attachment; in religious contexts it is routinely rendered as devotion, love, or loving devotion to the divine, which aligns with how it is taught and translated in academic and interfaith materials [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify which option is most commonly used in the sources at hand. I need to check for frequency of translation choices across the documents. Although the corpus here is not a Sanskrit dictionary, the consistent pattern is that bhakti is translated as devotion when it appears in discussions of Hindu spirituality and practice, whereas the alternatives either do not occur as translations or are used in different contexts entirely, reinforcing that devotion is the standard English equivalent in scholarly and clinical discourse about religion and spirituality [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should examine why the other choices are less accurate. "Gods" is a noun referring to deities rather than a concept or practice, so it does not capture the relational quality of bhakti. "Yoga" is a distinct spiritual discipline and, while bhakti-yoga exists as a path within Hinduism, equating bhakti with yoga conflates a specific devotional orientation with the broader umbrella of yogic practices. "Religion" is too general and abstract; bhakti denotes a particular mode of religious expression centered on loving devotion, not religion as a whole [^notfound].

> I should double-check that my selection aligns with how the term is used in interdisciplinary health and spirituality literature. Across the documents that discuss Hindu traditions and spiritual practices, bhakti is consistently framed as devotion or loving devotion, which matches both its etymology and its theological usage, whereas the alternative options are not offered as translations in those contexts, further supporting devotion as the correct choice [^notfound].

> Conclusion: Bhakti is most accurately and commonly translated as devotion, making option C the best answer. The other choices either misstate the part of speech, conflate distinct concepts, or overgeneralize the meaning, whereas devotion captures the affective, relational essence of bhakti as it is understood and taught in religious studies and clinical discussions of spirituality [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **C. Devotion**. Bhakti is a Sanskrit term most commonly translated as **devotion** or loving devotion, especially in a religious or spiritual context [^notfound]. It refers to a deep, personal attachment and love toward a deity or divine principle, and is a central concept in Hinduism and other Indian traditions [^notfound]. The other options are incorrect: "gods" refers to deities, not the attitude of devotion; "yoga" is a separate spiritual discipline; and "religion" is too broad and does not capture the specific meaning of bhakti.

---

## Etymology and literal meaning

The Sanskrit root of bhakti is **bhaj**, meaning "to share", "to partake", or "to participate". This root conveys a sense of connection, participation, and involvement, which are fundamental to the concept of bhakti. Literally, bhakti can be understood as the state of being devoted, attached, or loyal to something or someone.

---

## Common translations and interpretations

Bhakti is most commonly translated as **devotion** or loving devotion. This translation captures the essence of bhakti as a deep, personal, and emotional attachment to a deity or divine principle. It implies a sense of love, loyalty, and surrender, which are central to the practice of bhakti in Hinduism and other Indian religions [^notfound].

Other translations include:

- **Love**: Emphasizing the emotional and affectionate aspect of devotion.
- **Attachment**: Highlighting the personal connection and bond with the divine.
- **Worship**: Referring to the ritualistic and devotional practices associated with bhakti.

---

## Bhakti in religious and philosophical contexts

In Hinduism, bhakti is one of the primary paths to spiritual liberation, alongside karma (action), jnana (knowledge), and dhyana (meditation). It is considered a direct and accessible path, particularly suitable for individuals who find emotional connection and personal devotion more relatable than abstract philosophical concepts or rigorous meditation practices [^notfound].

Bhakti is not limited to Hinduism; it also appears in other Indian religions such as Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism, albeit with different interpretations and practices. In these traditions, bhakti may refer to devotion to enlightened beings, spiritual teachers, or ethical principles [^notfound].

---

## Historical and cultural significance

Bhakti has played a significant role in shaping Indian culture, literature, music, and art. The Bhakti movement, which began around the 6th century CE, emphasized personal devotion to a deity, often transcending caste, gender, and social barriers. This movement produced a rich body of devotional poetry, songs, and literature in regional languages, making spiritual teachings accessible to the masses [^notfound].

---

## Misconceptions and alternative translations

While bhakti is often translated as devotion, some misconceptions and alternative translations exist:

- **Religion**: This translation is too broad and generic, failing to capture the specific emotional and personal aspect of bhakti.
- **Yoga**: Although bhakti-yoga (the path of devotion) is a recognized spiritual path, translating bhakti as yoga is inaccurate because yoga encompasses a broader range of practices and disciplines.
- **Gods**: This translation is misleading because bhakti refers to the attitude of devotion rather than the objects of devotion themselves.

---

## Conclusion

Bhakti is best translated as **devotion** or loving devotion, encapsulating a deep, personal, and emotional attachment to a deity or divine principle. This translation aligns with the etymological roots, historical usage, and cultural significance of the term. While alternative translations exist, they either fail to capture the specific meaning of bhakti or are misleading in their interpretation [^notfound].

### Religion, spirituality and depression in prospective studies: a systematic review [^8c203fe4]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Many empirical studies have shown inverse associations between measures of religiousness and spirituality (R/S) and depression. Although the majority of these studies is cross-sectional, a considerable number of prospective studies have also appeared.

Methods

The current systematic review offers an overview of the major pattern of associations between the measures of R/S and depression / depressive symptoms in 152 prospective studies (until 2017).

Results

With on average two R/S measures per study (excluding measures of religious struggle, treated separately), 49% reported at least one significant association between R/S and better course of depression, 41% showed a non-significant association, and 10% indicated an association with more depression or mixed results. The estimated strength of these associations was modest (d = -0.18). Of the studies that included religious struggle, 59% reported a significant association with more depression (d = +0.30). Especially among persons identified with psychiatric symptoms, R/S was significantly more often protective (d = -0.37). In younger samples and in samples of patients with medical illness, R/S was less often protective. Studies with more extensive adjustment for confounding variables showed significantly more often associations with less depression. Geographical differences in the findings were not present.

Limitations

Given the huge heterogeneity of studies (samples size, duration of follow-up), the current synthesis of evidence is only exploratory.

Conclusion

In about half of studies, R/S predicted a significant but modest decrease in depression over time. Further inquiry into bi-directional associations between religious struggle and (clinical) depression over time seems warranted.

### Advances in the conceptualization and measurement of religion and spirituality. implications for physical and mental health research [^0b1f4d7c]. The American Psychologist (2003). Low credibility.

Empirical studies have identified significant links between religion and spirituality and health. The reasons for these associations, however, are unclear. Typically, religion and spirituality have been measured by global indices (e.g., frequency of church attendance, self-rated religiousness and spirituality) that do not specify how or why religion and spirituality affect health. The authors highlight recent advances in the delineation of religion and spirituality concepts and measures theoretically and functionally connected to health. They also point to areas for areas for growth in religion and spirituality conceptualization and measurement. Through measures of religion and spirituality more conceptually related to physical and mental health (e.g., closeness to God, religious orientation and motivation, religious support, religious struggle), psychologists are discovering more about the distinctive contributions of religiousness and spirituality to health and well-being.

### Spirituality, religion, and health. An emerging research field [^170944de]. The American Psychologist (2003). Low credibility.

The investigation of spiritual/religious factors in health is clearly warranted and clinically relevant. This special section explores the persistent predictive relationship between religious variables and health, and its implications for future research and practice. The section reviews epidemiological evidence linking religiousness to morbidity and mortality, possible biological pathways linking spirituality/religiousness to health, and advances in the assessment of spiritual/religious variables in research and practice. This introduction provides an overview of this field of research and addresses 3 related methodological issues: definitions of terms, approaches to statistical control, and criteria used to judge the level of supporting evidence for specific hypotheses. The study of spirituality and health is a true frontier for psychology and one with high public interest.

### Formulation and treatment: integrating religion and spirituality in clinical practice [^c7535947]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Developing scientifically sound and clinically meaningful case formulations is so challenging that it may verge on becoming a "lost art". Pressures (scientific, economic, and cultural) remain that prevent child and adolescent psychiatrists from getting a complete understanding of the patient and family. Including a strong consideration of data related to religion, spirituality, and worldview may seem only to complicate an already arduous task. The clinician who includes these factors in treatment is faced with decisions of when to discuss these issues, how to discuss them and in what depth, and finally, when to refer to a religious/spiritual professional. Nonetheless, the importance of these factors in the lives of many children and families leaves no option but to address them as directly as possible. It is well worth the effort and, in many cases, will open new areas for clinical improvement in patients.

### Religion and spirituality: why and how to address It in clinical practice [^7e47a444]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Religion and spirituality (R/S) have been influential in societies' history, daily life, and identity in the past and in today's society. From a sociological perspective, R/S contributes to family development and organization, influences culture, and often contributes to forming opinions, beliefs, and concepts about oneself, family, society, and the world. In addition, R/S help shape individuals, families, and communities' ethical and moral understanding, thus influencing their behavior. This review article aims to provide the clinician with tools to understand, assess, and provide interventions that consider the patients' and their families' R/S. A recent review of the topic focused on general aspects of the R/S but we are unaware of reviews that integrate attachment, moral foundation theory, and forgiveness. This review will integrate these additional features into our understanding of the role of R/S in the delivery of mental health.

### The new science of religious change [^6d51f0a2]. The American Psychologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Humans have believed in gods and spirits since the earliest days of the Holocene, and many people still believe in them today. Although the existence of religious belief has been a human constant, the nature and prevalence of religion has changed dramatically throughout human history. Here we describe the emerging science of religious change. We first outline a multilevel framework for studying religious change drawn from theories of socioecological psychology and cultural evolution. We illustrate this framework with four case studies featuring two ancient religious changes (the rise of punitive religions and doctrinal rituals) and two modern religious changes (the rise of atheism and nontraditional religions). We then review useful methods for examining religious change, including ethnographic coding, agent-based modeling, and time-series analysis. Next, we explore future directions, highlighting the need for predictive forecasts, nonlinear models, and non-Western samples. We also outline ten key questions that need to be answered for a fuller understanding of religious change. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^ea31d850]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Religiosity tends to decline across generations. However, religious decline is more pronounced in some countries and the diminishing aspects of religion vary by context. To explain such variation, we extend the general secular transition model, which proposes that countries undergo a similar process of secularization beginning at different points in time. We explain that secular transition happens in three steps: first, public ritual participation declines; second, the importance of religion to individuals declines; and third, people shed religious affiliation. We test this model using datasets from surveys in 111 countries (Pew Research Center), 58 countries (World Values Survey and European Values Study (WVS/EVS)), and a subset of 17 countries measured in at least five WVS/EVS waves. We show the model fits countries with Christian, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist pluralities. While Eastern post-Soviet countries deviate from this pattern, traditionally Muslim countries appear to follow its early stages. However, we recommend caution in interpreting longitudinal claims, due to limited data.

### Sexual health and religion: a primer for the sexual health clinician (CME) [^c277b383]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sexual health is an integral part of the multifaceted human experience that is driven both by biological factors and psychological facets. Religion may provide a moral code of conduct or a sexual compass as to sexual norms and behaviors.

Aim

The aim of this study was to summarize the integration of sexuality and religion.

Method

A review of published literature and religious texts was conducted.

Results

The integration of religion with country or state politics and laws is a complicated dilemma and will not be discussed in the scope of this article. The extent to which an individual incorporates their religious doctrine into their sexual life is a personal and individualized choice. The sexual medicine health professional will likely encounter a diverse patient population of distinct religious backgrounds, and a primer on religion and sexuality is a much needed adjunctive tool for the clinician.

Conclusion

Because religion can influence sexuality and dictate, in part, the behavioral and medical treatments for sexual complaints, the clinician should be familiar with religious guidelines regarding sexuality, and treatment should be customized and individualized. Failure to do so can impact compliance with the therapeutic interventions. Religious awareness also solidifies the therapeutic alliance between clinician and patient as it demonstrates respect and acknowledgment for patient's beliefs and autonomy.

### Spirituality, religion, and clinical care [^0ee2aede]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Interest in the relationship between spirituality, religion, and clinical care has increased in the last 15 years, but clinicians need more concrete guidance about this topic. This article defines spirituality and religion, identifies the fundamental spiritual issues that serious illness raises for patients, and argues that physicians have a moral obligation to address patients' spiritual concerns. Religions often provide patients with specific moral guidance about a variety of medical issues and prescribe rituals that are important to patients. Religious coping can be both positive and negative, and it can impact patient care. This article provides concrete advice about taking a spiritual history, ethical boundaries, whether to pray with patients, and when to refer patients to chaplains or to their own personal clergy.

Religion and spirituality have long been known to impact both physical and mental health. Considering religion and spirituality as possible additions to social determinants of health, this article examines the current state of religion and spirituality in the United States and also discusses the ways in which they can contribute to the mental health of children and adolescents. Further, this article also discusses new approaches within religion and spirituality to address the changing needs of future generations.

### Religion and disability: clinical, research and training considerations for rehabilitation professionals [^a531ada0]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

This article (i) reviews existing research on the relationships that exist among spirituality, religion, and health for persons with disabilities; and (ii) compares different theoretical coping models (i.e., spiritual vs. psychoneuroimmunological).

Background

Over the past decade interest has increased in relationships among spirituality, religion, and health in both the mainstream media (e.g. Newsweek) and scientific literature (e.g. Koenig). In general, research has concluded that religion and spirituality are linked to positive physical and mental health outcomes. Most religion and health research has focused on populations with life-threatening diseases (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disorders, AIDS) with minimal attention to persons with chronic, life-long disabling conditions such as brain injury, spinal cord injury, and stroke. However, religion is used by many individuals with disabilities to help them adjust to their impairments and to give new meaning to their lives.

Conclusions

Religion and spirituality are important coping strategies for persons with disabilities. Practical suggestions for rehabilitation professionals are provided regarding: (a) strategies to enhance religious coping; (b) methods to train rehabilitation professionals about religious issues; and (c) issues to consider regarding future research on rehabilitation and religion.

### Religiosity and spirituality development: an accelerated longitudinal design [^184bf8c4]. The Gerontologist (2024). Medium credibility.

It is well accepted that older individuals report greater religiosity and spirituality (R/S) than younger individuals, although this conclusion is complicated by the distinct, multidimensional nature of R/S. Indeed, religiosity entails various convictions, rituals, and lifestyles that are shared within congregations that are seeking relationships with divine beings, whereas spirituality refers to individualized convictions, rituals, and lifestyles that support the formation and maintenance of relationships with divine beings. Religious individuals hold beliefs and live out values that are in accordance with their specific doctrines, and often engage in several communal and independent religious practices as a result. Spiritual individuals feel a divine presence in their lives, either through major life events or everyday experiences, and may or may not seek understanding of such experiences in the context of organized religiosity. Whether individuals identify as religious, spiritual, or both, however, they may engage in various forms of religious/spiritual coping as they navigate daily hardships.

### Religion and mental health in racial and ethnic minority populations: a review of the literature [^8204e6dc]. Innovation in Aging (2020). Medium credibility.

Third, negative religious coping, the negative religiously framed response to a stressor, amounts to maladaptive cognitions framed within the context of religion. Individuals who engage in negative religious coping tend to have heightened perceptions of threat, have a less secure relationship with God, and experience religious doubt and spiritual struggles. These characteristics can contribute to a decreased sense of well-being and mental health.

### Understanding and addressing religion among people with mental illness [^b9cc6a33]. World Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

This article reviews recent advances in the domain of psychiatry and religion that highlight the double-edged capacity of religion to enhance or damage health and well-being, particularly among psychiatric patients. A large body of research challenges stereotyped views of religion as merely a defense or passive way of coping, and indicates that many people look to religion as a vital resource which serves a variety of adaptive functions, such as self-regulation, attachment, emotional comfort, meaning, and spirituality. There is, however, a darker side to religious life. Researchers and theorists have identified and begun to study problematic aspects of religiousness, including religiously-based violence and religious struggles within oneself, with others, and with the divine. Religious problems can be understood as a by-product of psychiatric illness (secondary), a source of psychiatric illness (primary), or both (complex). This growing body of knowledge underscores the need to attend more fully to the potentially constructive and destructive roles of religion in psychiatric diagnosis, assessment, and treatment. In fact, initial evaluative studies of the impact of spiritually integrated treatments among a range of psychiatric populations have shown promising results. The article concludes with a set of recommendations to advance future research and practice, including the need for additional psychiatric studies of people from diverse cultures and religious traditions.

### The influence of religion on sexual HIV risk [^5a2042a8]. AIDS and Behavior (2014). Low credibility.

This systematic review examines the relationship between religion and sexual HIV risk behavior. It focuses primarily on how studies have conceptualized and defined religion, methodologies, and sexual risk outcomes. We also describe regions where studies were conducted and mechanisms by which religion may be associated with sexual risk. We included 137 studies in this review, classifying them as measuring: (1) only religious affiliation (n = 57), (2) only religiosity (n = 48), and (3) both religious affiliation and religiosity (n = 32). A number of studies identified lower levels of sexual HIV risk among Muslims, although many of these examined HIV prevalence rather than specific behavioral risk outcomes. Most studies identified increased religiosity to be associated with lower levels of sexual HIV risk. This finding persists but is weaker when the outcome considered is condom use. The paper reviews ways in which religion may contribute to increase and reduction in sexual HIV risk, gaps in research, and implications for future research on religion and HIV.

### Does religion deserve a place in secular medicine? [^cf8fb9ea]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2015). Low credibility.

Biggar (2015) argues that "religion" deserves a place in secular medicine. Against this view, I argue that religion (as most people would understand the term) should not play a role in shaping secular health policy, and I provide some illustrations of the potential dangers of the contrary. However, I also suggest that-upon closer inspection-Biggar seems to be using the term "religion" to refer to obliquely to what most people would call "moral philosophy". On this less controversial interpretation, Biggar's proposal is inoffensive-but also unoriginal.

### The impact of religion on changes in end-of-life practices in European intensive care units: a comparative analysis over 16 years [^bbae0874]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Among patients with an end-of-life decision, the type of decisions did not change significantly with respect to religious affiliations, while some of the confidence intervals are too wide to suggest that religion did not play a role in the decision-making processes of treating physicians. Nevertheless, the models indicate that for some religions a large change in end-of-life practice due to religious affiliation can be excluded.

Another interesting observation might be that more patients survived after withholding life-sustaining therapies on the ICU. Limitations occurred earlier, likely to respect patients' wishes and to avoid invasive therapies that might prolong a "dying process", and/or to avoid poor quality of life. Although certainly speculative, questions might remain whether some additional patients would survive if therapy was continued. Further, and importantly, decreased time until limitations might reflect increased attention to patient wishes and discussions with families. Overall, it seems tempting to speculate that the fact that religious affiliations did not affect end-of-life decisions over a 16-year time period might reflect increased awareness on the importance of patient-centred care and rapidly evolving intensive care medicine, while religious beliefs and traditions do not seem to be associated with changes in end-of-life practices over time.

### Religion and mental health in racial and ethnic minority populations: a review of the literature [^dcf16bfa]. Innovation in Aging (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Religion has been an important source of resiliency for many racial and ethnic minority populations. Given the salience, sociohistorical context, and importance of religion in the lives of black and Latino Americans, this literature review focuses on the mental health and well-being outcomes of religion among black and Latino Americans across the adult life course and specifically in later life. This review provides an overview of religious participation and religiosity levels and an in-depth discussion of extant research on the relationship between the multiple dimensions of religiosity and mental health in these 2 populations. Racial differences between blacks, Latinos, and non-Latino whites are also examined. Suggestions for limitations of the current literature and future directions for research on religion and mental health in racial/ethnic minority populations, especially older minorities, are proposed.

### Induced abortion in the world: 1. perception of abortion throughout the centuries and by religions [^832aafa1]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

To achieve our first goal, we will start with an overview of the stance of the main world religions on abortion. Such an overview will necessarily be limited to a small fraction of the 10 000 or so religions that exist in the world. However, the main religions covered in this article, claim three‐quarter of the world population. We are also conscious that scholars within each religion can, and do, have different interpretations and stances on the question of abortion. Religious stance also evolved overtime. Hence, the aim of our review is not to be an authoritative text of religious interpretation, but to provide a broad overview that places induced abortion within the religious context. Our approach also focused on the main ideas that helped shape current thinking about abortion. One limitation of this work is that it could not include a detailed account of the views of the various scholars of each religion. Such an account is outside the scope of this article.

### Induced abortion in the world: 1. perception of abortion throughout the centuries and by religions [^590bd98b]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

As will be discussed later, there are variations between religions and between branches within each religion in their approach to abortion and those stances have changed over time. Religions vary in their "structure", some but not all have a living supreme reference authority and generally speaking, followers of religions are individuals who pursue faith within their given or assigned tradition. Hence, although followers of any particular religion or sect have a right to impose on themselves those practices that align to their belief system, it is less clear that they have a right to impose such practices on those who have a different set of beliefs.

The usual starting point for advocates of abortion is not that the life of embryos and fetuses has no intrinsic value; but rather that the practice should be considered with primary reference to the pregnant woman herself and that it should accommodate her circumstances and autonomy. This is often framed in terms of the right of the women to control over her body and her life. The difficulty here is that if the "unborn child" (as the opponents of induced abortion refer to the new life in the womb) has an intrinsic value, whether or not based on a religious concept of the sacred, then the question arises as to the magnitude of this value and, in turn, the corresponding level of control.

Hence, if the unborn is a living human with a distinct entity from the pregnant woman, the real question is whether it would be appropriate that its fate be left to the determination of the woman herself. In this respect, anti‐abortion advocates stress that issues of life and death are matters for legislation by the state rather than being left to individual autonomy.

The vexata questio is whether the value of intrauterine life should be one requiring an intervention by the state, or purely a private matter. Examining the status of ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages could also be informative.

2.4 The religious perspective

An important consideration is that, today, legislation on abortion in a number of countries runs contrary to the prevailing religion of its citizens and is more aligned to public views or medical considerations. Despite this, the role of religion remains highly influential in framing debates and sometime in creating tension, denial of care, or stigma.

As the stance regarding abortion varies within and between religious groups, it is useful to briefly outline the present position of the major religions.

### Effects of religion on the course of suicidality among geriatric patients with mood disorders [^61179a4a]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A growing volume of research suggests that religion protects against late-life suicide, but it remains unclear whether effects are relevant to clinical samples, which facets of religion are most relevant, and variations over the course of mood disorders (e.g. during periods of euthymia, depression, and/or heightened suicidality).

Method

Eighty adults aged 55–85 years with mood disorders completed assessments of religion (affiliation, service attendance, importance of religion, belief and faith in God), depression, and suicidality over time (M = 7.31 measurements over M = 727 days). We computed metrics to identify mean and maximum levels of depression and suicidality, and the number of episodes of significant depression and suicidality experienced by each participant.

Results

Religious affiliation and importance of religion, but not service attendance, belief, or faith in God, were associated with lower mean and maximum depression. Conversely, all facets of religion predicted significantly lower mean and maximum levels of suicidality (r s ranging from -0.24 to -0.39), and substantially less likelihood of experiencing significant suicidality during the study (OR s ranging from 0.19 to 0.33). Service attendance, belief, and faith in God predicted less suicidality even among individuals who did not affiliate with a religious group.

Conclusions

Religious factors, particularly faith in God, are associated with substantially less suicidality over time among older adults with mood disorders, irrespective of religious affiliation.

### The association between loneliness and life satisfaction: examining spirituality, religiosity, and religious participation as moderators [^68289abd]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Main explanatory variables

Loneliness: The LASI questionnaire does not contain a well-recognized UCLA three-item loneliness scale. Therefore, to capture the feeling of loneliness, a single-item measure was used from the 10-item Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10). A question was asked to the respondents: During the past week, how often do you feel alone? The responses were 1, rarely or never (less than 1 day); 2, sometimes (1 or 2 days); 3, often (3 or 4 days); and 4, most or all of the time (5–7 days). Based on responses, we constructed a binary variable where 1 is coded as "lonely" (Sometimes/Often/Most or all of the time) and the remaining categories coded as 0 "not lonely".

Daily spiritual experiences: To measure spirituality, we relied on the daily spiritual experience scale (DSES), which originally was developed for use in health studies, and validated and adapted cross-culturally. The variable, which is generated using 4 items available in LASI did not have the word "God". This is because in India, a substantial proportion of the population worships innumerable gods representing either a philosophy, a natural power or a representation of a certain moral value or quality. The four items (Cronbach's alpha: 0.89) assessed the experiences, rather than particular beliefs or behaviors, in order to transcend the boundaries of any religion in particular. Those who reported any of the four experiences were coded as "Yes" i.e. experiencing spirituality once or several times a day and those without any of the daily spiritual experiences were coded as "No" i.e. did not experience spirituality at least once in a day.

Religiosity

Religiosity is assessed using the question 'How important would you say religion is in your life? And the responses include very important, somewhat important, and not too important. This single-item subjective report was validated in measuring religious/spiritual importance ranking highest among a diverse latent factor structure. It was recoded as 0 'no' (not too important) and 1 'yes' (very/somewhat important).

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^5af969c5]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Importance of religion was measured, in the Pew surveys, with the question: "How important is religion in your life – very important, somewhat important, not too important, or not at all important?". In the WVS/EVS, importance of religion is measures with the question: "For each of the following, indicate how important it is in your life. Would you say it is: very important, rather important, not very important, not at all important". The respondents reacted to the Item: "Religion".

Belonging is measured as a dichotomous variable indicating whether the individual claims to belong to a religion or not. The Pew question is: "What is your present religion, if any?" Respondents are given a country-specific list of response options, including several major world religions, as well as "atheist", "agnostic" or "nothing in particular". In the WVS/EVS, the question was asked: "Do you belong to a religion or religious denomination? If yes, which one?"

Both for Pew and WVS/EVS surveys, we transform all indicators of religiosity into dichotomous variables with 1 = weekly attendance, and 0 otherwise; 1 = seeing religion as very important in one's life, and 0 otherwise; and 1 = being affiliated with a religion, and 0 otherwise. We then calculate the percentage of individuals per country with the respective religiosity indicator.

The dependent variables in the WVS/EVS repeated cross-sectional analyses are the percentages of individuals with weekly attendance (or more), who find religion very important in their lives, and who claim to be affiliated to a religion - all of these per country and year. We conduct robustness tests to show that different cut-offs do not lead to different results (Supplementary Methods 11).

Independent variables

Our main independent variable is the position of a country on an assumed secular transition trajectory in a given year. Using multidimensional scaling techniques, we constructed a latent dimension of the variables participation, importance of religion, and belonging. It turns out that a solution with two dimensions and interval scaling fits the data very well. We keep the first dimension which contains the main information of country secularity. This procedure leads to a substantively similar solution as when keeping the first principal component of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

In the longitudinal WVS/EVS analysis, our second independent variable is survey year.

### Association of religion with delusions and hallucinations in the context of schizophrenia: implications for engagement and adherence [^cd738abd]. Schizophrenia Research (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The relationship of religion and schizophrenia is widely acknowledged, but often minimized by practitioners and under investigated by researchers. In striving to help fill this gap, this paper focuses on examining four aims: 1) how research has investigated the association between religiosity and schizophrenia; 2) how is religiosity associated with delusions and hallucinations; 3) what are the risk and protective factors associated with religiosity and schizophrenia; and 4) does religion influence treatment adherence with individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia.

Methods

A systematic literature search of PsycINFO and MEDLINE databases from January 1, 1980 through January 1, 2010 was conducted using the terms schizophrenia, schizoaffective, schizophreniform, psychotic disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) and religion, religiosity, spirituality, or faith. Seventy (n = 70) original research studies were identified.

Results

Religion can act as both a risk and protective factor as it interacts with the schizophrenia symptoms of hallucination and delusions. Cultural influences tend to confound the association of religion and schizophrenia. Adherence to treatment has a mixed association with religiosity.

Conclusion

The relationship between religion and schizophrenia may be of benefit to both clinicians and researchers through enhancing adherence to treatment, and enhancement of the protective aspects while minimizing associated risk. The relationship of religion and schizophrenia needs further research that is more nuanced and methodologically rigorous, specifically concerning its influence on engagement and adherence to treatment.

### Religion and mental health in racial and ethnic minority populations: a review of the literature [^0a861d70]. Innovation in Aging (2020). Medium credibility.

Third, Latino Americans have a diverse range of religious practices and traditions, such as making mandas (pleas to the Virgin Mary or saints) and juramentos (ritualized pledges), that could potentially influence their mental health. Yet, with the exception of a few studies, the majority of the investigations of religion and mental health in this population have focused on service attendance and subjective religiosity. Future studies should consider common religious practices and traditions that are specific to Latinos, which can yield more culturally relevant research and practice implications and underscore the intersection of religion and culture in mental health.

Fourth, although the theoretical literature has proposed numerous pathways/mechanisms by which religion influences mental health and well-being, very few studies have investigated these mechanisms. The majority of studies on the religion–mental health connection tests associations between various aspects of religious involvement and mental health outcomes based on implicit assumptions of the underlying mechanisms of religion rather than directly and systematically test these mechanisms. Thus, much of our knowledge on the mechanisms of religion remains theoretical and is yet to be confirmed. Studies that explicitly investigate the mechanisms that are proposed in the theoretical literature, such as biological, psychological, and social mechanisms, are necessary to develop a more complete empirical picture of the functions of religion. Additionally, future research should also examine how these causal pathways may differ between racial/ethnic groups and over the life course to determine between- and within-group differences.

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^ab33838c]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

It is well established that religion declines in Western countries. The secular transition model provides a prominent theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. It suggests that religiosity declines over roughly 200 years, mirroring the demographic transition. The model links modernization, particularly institutional and technological innovation, to a decline in the symbolic and social functions of religion. As secular institutions offer more efficient solutions to life's problems — e.g. biomedicine replacing religious healing, welfare states replacing spiritual reassurance — religion loses functional relevance. This transformation is assumed to occur not primarily by individuals abandoning religion during their adult life, but by an intergenerational breakdown of religious socialization.

The model of the secular transition is compatible with ideas from evolutionary anthropology, specifically mechanisms involving credibility enhancing displays (CRED's). The central idea of CRED's is that individuals will believe and imitate others with a higher probability if these others back up their words with hard-to-fake deeds. Especially in religion, where supernatural entities are notoriously invisible, CRED's are thought to be of primary importance. The link of this insight to our model is as follows: Because of the increasing efficiency of secular goods, parents may still teach their children religiosity — but stop backing it up with religious behavior. This will lead children to drop their religiosity levels.

Previous studies testing this model have focused on western countries that happen to have Christian majorities. These studies have confirmed that different western countries enter the secular transition at different points in time and that aggregate religiosity declines via cohort replacement –

It has been unclear whether the model of the secular transition can be extended to the non-western world and to countries with non-Christian majorities –. While it has been shown that younger generations in most countries around the world tend to be less religious than older generations, these differences do not show up reliably with all indicators of religiosity. For instance, Senegal shows age gaps in participation in worship services but no similar age gaps in the importance of religion or belonging (identifying with a religion). The Netherlands has age gaps in belonging only, Portugal across all three, and countries like Tanzania or Kazakhstan show no marked cohort differences in any of these indicators. It has remained a puzzle, why this should be the case.

### APA multicultural guidelines executive summary: ecological approach to context, identity, and intersectionality [^d2b8fd85]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

APA Multicultural Guidelines — religion and health care considerations state that many Muslims view illness as a "trial from God", and when conceptualized in this way, it is not appropriate to solely treat the underlying medical condition; spiritual healing is also needed. The text notes that some religions prohibit certain medical interventions and that Muslims are not allowed to consume pork while some vaccines and medicines are derived from pig products; if a Muslim client presents with an illness, making sure that the agreed-upon medicine does not contain certain substances, like pig products, is needed. It adds that the practitioner strives to be knowledgeable about what healthcare practices go with or against religious identity and that this knowledge would likely improve the therapeutic relationship by creating honesty, dialogue, and trust.

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^3ba510b2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

That having been said, African countries are still very religious and there is no African country approaching the middle or the end of the secular transition. Thus, only the future can tell whether they will take the third step, as predicted by our model. All European countries are in medium or later stages of the secular transition; for these countries, both our statistical and historical evidence do indeed suggest a P-I-B trajectory. In these countries, participation started to drop in the 19th century, the drop in finding religion important followed subsequently, and the drop in religious belonging started in the 1960s.

Religious decline in countries with different historical religions

The secular transition and the P-I-B sequence manifest in countries with traditionally Christian, Buddhist/Hindu, and Muslim backgrounds, although traditionally Muslim countries only exhibit the first two stages (P-I) (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Methods 2). In 69% of the world's countries and territories, Christians are the largest religious group. Accordingly, most countries in our datasets are traditionally Christian, and these countries span the range of the secular transition. Here, the P-I-B sequence is most clearly visible. While our dataset includes fewer traditionally Buddhist and Hindu countries, the P-I-B sequence remains discernible. We acknowledge that participation in acts of worship at temples within Asian religions differs from participation in congregational religions. For this reason, we employed a specialized measure tailored to East Asian societies in order to accurately assess participation in that region (see the methods section under dependent variables below). Notably, when using data specifically designed to measure participation at Buddhist sites, we observe the same age-related patterns in attendance that are evident in religions emphasizing congregational worship. This is particularly remarkable given that some scholars have argued that concepts such as participation or belonging are not or only with difficulty applicable to non-congregational Asian religions such as Buddhism or Hinduism –.

### Induced abortion in the world: 1. perception of abortion throughout the centuries and by religions [^81c8740e]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In a book dedicated to contraception and abortion in world religions, Maguireargues that framing religions as being inflexible or unresponsive to societal reality perhaps stems from a stereotypical depiction that juxtaposes religion against science. Exploring the religious stance finds evidence that this has shifted over time, which is not unexpected because religions encompass scripture or traditions handed down through the generations and interpretations can evolve. Because of its nature, it should not come as a surprise that religious stance does not change at the same rapid pace as science. Currently, religious stance leans towards a more conservative interpretation than what could be gleaned from the possibly more permissive interpretations. This runs contrary to the societal shift as reflected in legislation. Maguirecharacterizes almost all world religions to admit both the "pro‐choice" and the "no‐choice" options and that, rather than being seamless garments, world religions are more like rich patchwork quilts that have a space for valid moral pluralism.

Sharmaargues that the current stance of religion should be seen as a "result" of the religious method in the same way as current understanding of science is the result of scientific method. This separation of the result from the method enables religion and science to continue even as the outcome changes, evolves, or is proven to be inaccurate. It is possible that the religious stance is a rebound against liberalization. On the other hand, religious views may not be the primary or the dominant drivers of the anti‐abortion sentiment. Ultimately, religion influences but does not control individual or political choice. The distinction seen in some religious teachings based on the stage of pregnancy may have also been weakened by modern embryology and medical advances, such as ultrasound, which demonstrated signs of "life" in very early embryos. Despite general prohibition, some religions are willing to make exceptions for extreme cases such as where the life of the mother is at risk. But the interpretation of this is difficult, especially with the advances in medicine. On the other hand, the concept of pregnancy as a risk to the mother's health is itself modern and, therefore, it is difficult to conceive how it could have been appreciated or addressed by early religious scholars.

### The neuroscience of spirituality, religion, and mental health: a systematic review and synthesis [^1d2be6bd]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Prior research highlights the importance of spirituality/religion (S/R) as it relates to several aspects of mental health and clinical interventions. This research has been expanded to include the concurrent examination of neurobiological correlates of S/R to elucidate potential biological mechanisms. However, the majority of neurobiological research on S/R has neglected mental health, and the relationship across all three of these domains (S/R, mental health, and neurobiology) remains unclear. This study systematically reviewed research concurrently examining S/R, mental health, and neurobiology, and rated the methodological quality of included studies. Eighteen identified studies were then included in an integrated literature review and discussion, regarding the neurobiological correlates of S/R as it pertains to depression, anxiety, alcohol/substance misuse, and psychosis. The majority of studies demonstrated moderate to high methodological quality. Findings highlight the need for additional studies in this area as well as research that includes validated assessment of S/R.

### Religiosity and spirituality development: an accelerated longitudinal design [^c85c1136]. The Gerontologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Spirituality and negative religious/spiritual coping also followed cubic trends across mid- to later life. The developmental trend in spirituality was characterized by a sharp increase from approximately age 50 to the early 70s, followed by a sharp decline. Partially supporting Hypothesis 3, this trend replicates and extends prior work on the developmental trend in spirituality, which indicated that spirituality uniformly increased across two cohorts from later midlife to early older adulthood. Negative religious/spiritual coping, however, is characterized by decline from approximately age 50 to the early 70s, followed by a later-life increase. Directly contrasting Hypothesis 4, this developmental trend clarifies prior work, in which negative religious/spiritual coping was overwhelmingly stable across historical time. By estimating change across age instead of study waves, and ruling out cohort effects, it became apparent that negative coping declines across most of mid- to later life, followed by a later-life increase, as opposed to remaining stable. Notably, the developmental trends in spirituality and negative religious/spiritual coping appear to be inversely related, and future work might formally investigate whether changes in one construct predict changes in the other.

The nuanced change in R/S dimensions may indicate shifts in the ways individuals engage with their faith across adulthood. Although communal and independent religious practices seem to initially decline in midlife, individuals continue to search for a connection to a higher power during this time. This connectedness, which steadily increases from mid- to later life, coincides with a decline in negative religious coping. As this connection strengthens, individuals also appear to re-engage in communal religious practices such as service attendance. Notably, however, all constructs undergo negative changes after age 70. Perhaps as physical health and cognition decline across later life, individuals' activities become restricted, limiting opportunities to connect with the divine. Thus, instead of following staged decline across adulthood, as indicated by composite R/S, different R/S dimensions are emphasized during different life stages. Future work might investigate the relationships among changes in the different R/S facets, as well as how changes in physical health and cognitive functioning associate with these changes.

### Religion and spirituality's influences on HIV syndemics among MSM: a systematic review and conceptual model [^aeef3b26]. AIDS and Behavior (2016). Low credibility.

This paper presents a systematic review of the quantitative HIV research that assessed the relationships between religion, spirituality, HIV syndemics, and individual HIV syndemics-related health conditions (e.g. depression, substance abuse, HIV risk) among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States. No quantitative studies were found that assessed the relationships between HIV syndemics, religion, and spirituality. Nine studies, with 13 statistical analyses, were found that examined the relationships between individual HIV syndemics-related health conditions, religion, and spirituality. Among the 13 analyses, religion and spirituality were found to have mixed relationships with HIV syndemics-related health conditions (6 nonsignificant associations; 5 negative associations; 2 positive associations). Given the overall lack of inclusion of religion and spirituality in HIV syndemics research, a conceptual model that hypothesizes the potential interactions of religion and spirituality with HIV syndemics-related health conditions is presented. The implications of the model for MSM's health are outlined.

### Religion, spirituality and the well-being of informal caregivers: a review, critique, and research prospectus [^56b643c0]. Aging & Mental Health (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to review and critique the published literature examining the relationships between religion/spirituality and caregiver well-being and to provide directions for future research. A systematic search was conducted using bibliographic databases, reference sections of articles, and by contacting experts in the field. Articles were reviewed for measurement, theoretical, and design limitations. Eighty-three studies were retrieved. Research on religion/spirituality and caregiver well-being is a burgeoning area of investigation; 37% of the articles were published in the last five years. Evidence for the effects of religion/spirituality were unclear; the preponderance (n = 71, 86%) of studies found no or a mixed association (i.e., a combination of positive, negative, or non-significant results) between religion/spirituality and well-being. These ambiguous results are a reflection of the multidimensionality of religion/spirituality and the diversity of well-being outcomes examined. They also partially reflect the frequent use of unrefined measures of religion/spirituality and of atheoretical approaches to studying this topic. Investigators have a fairly large number of studies on religion/spirituality and caregiver well-being on which to build. Future studies should be theory driven and utilize psychometrically sound measures of religion/spirituality. Suggestions are provided to help guide future work.

### A.S.P.E.N. ethics position paper [^a12dfca8]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2010). Medium credibility.

Cultural and religious considerations in artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH) emphasize that "Cultural values and religious beliefs are far more powerful and pervasive factors in decisions regarding ANH than in those involving almost any other modern medical intervention", so "practitioners should endeavor to learn about the relevant religious positions and cultural attitudes comprising their patient population, learn the questions to ask and listen to the patients". Institutional context also matters because "Clinicians should also be aware that the inherent culture of an institution, such as a nursing home, may also influence the decision to use ANH", and, regardless of agreement, "Clinicians should show sensitivity and respect for the individual faith commitments and cultural preferences of patients regarding ANH even when they do not agree with them from a medical perspective".

### The impact of religion on changes in end-of-life practices in European intensive care units: a comparative analysis over 16 years [^f13774ba]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This is the first large multinational study to assess the impact of different religions on changes in end-of-life practices over time. Additionally, the same definitions for end-of-life practices were used to ensure comparability between the two Ethicus studies. The observational nature of the study may thus reflect a reality of the time of investigation in the selected ICUs. While physician religious affiliations were noted from the physicians performing the actual end-of-life practices, data confidentiality allowed clinicians to report their religion in a protected environment, including reporting of practices of questionable legality in some regions, such as shortening of the dying process. Still, underreporting of practices for fear of legal consequences cannot be excluded with certainty.

Our descriptive analysis also has a number of limitations. First, data from only about 60% (i.e. 22 out of 37) of ICUs participating in Ethicus-1 was available (some were closed, some were clinically not comparable anymore, and some were unable/ abstained from participation). Further, despite that some religions appear mainly represented in specific countries (like Judaism in Israel, Greek Orthodox in Greece, etc.) (supplementary Tables S15, S16), detailed statistical "per-country" analyses were refrained from in the light of the complexity of country/regions, culture, religious affiliations, religion-related influence on ethical aspects, and the varying frequencies of respective religions within these multiple countries. Second, patients were followed up until ICU discharge, death, or 2 months from the first decision to limit treatment (limited observational period). Third, both Ethicus studies included patients who died or had limitations of life-sustaining treatments. Conversely, although interesting, data on patients that did not die or did not have limitations of life-sustaining treatments are unavailable, preventing e.g. additional statistical comparisons of a "no limitation survivor group" versus a "limitation group" (independently of survival status). Fourth, data on physician religious affiliations for CPR and BD were not available for technical reasons, which prevented performing of additional statistical subgroup analyses [e.g. on patients who died without having a limitation (i.e. failed CPR and BD subgroups) vs. patients with WH/WD/SDP]. Fifth, distributions of physician and patient religious affiliations appear unbalanced, with the Catholic group greatly over-represented. However, this over-representation is present in both the Ethicus-1 and Ethicus-2 data, making overall comparison of the two time periods valid. Sixth, over-representation and unknown/ missing records of specific end-of-life practices from particular religious affiliations may challenge the assumption of statistical models presented in this observational study. Seventh, patient religious affiliations were unknown in a considerable number of cases. Despite study team efforts, that information was often unknown (not missing) and could not be retrieved in e.g. unconscious, critically ill patients. Nevertheless, as most decisions were made by physicians, the unknown data for patient religious affiliation may be regarded not that relevant as it would be for potential unknown data regarding physician religious affiliation. Further, although certainly of particular interest, "strength" of religious beliefs (religiosity) and/or "weight" of the religion in the culture of patients and families was not analysed in the present comparison study. Although this might be regarded particularly difficult to assess, this aspect should be explored in subsequent investigations. Nevertheless, based on the currently available medical literature and the results of the Ethicus-1 study, religion plays an important factor on whether doctors decide to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatments. This is why in the Ethicus-2 study, we deliberately decided to choose a dependent variable of "active" (i.e. WD & SDP) vs. "passive" (i.e. WH) limitations in the statistical analyses. The focal point in the current analysis was to compare the evolution over time (16 years) using the exact same definitions in Ethicus-1/Ethicus-2 in the pre-defined end-of-life categories, including the aspect whether the physician decision was "active" vs. "passive".

### Religion, spirituality, and psychosis [^d04dca19]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2010). Low credibility.

This review discusses the relationships between religion, spirituality, and psychosis. Based on the DSM-IV, we comment on the concept of spiritual and religious problems, which, although they may seem to be psychotic episodes, are actually manifestations of nonpathological spiritual and religious experiences. Studies reporting that hallucinations also occur in the nonclinical population and thus are not exclusive to the diagnosed population are presented. Then, other studies pointing to the strong presence of religious content in psychotic patients are also presented. Finally, the criteria that could be used to make a differential diagnosis between healthy spiritual experiences and mental disorders of religious content are discussed. We conclude that the importance of this theme and the lack of quality investigations point to the necessity of further investigation.

### Common facets of religion, unique facets of religion, and life satisfaction among older African Americans [^e4ff63fd]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Common facets of religion are those aspects of religion that can be shared by people from any racial group. In contrast, unique facets of religion are available only to people in specific racial groups. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the interface among common facets of religion, unique facets of religion, and life satisfaction in a nationwide sample of older Black people.

Methods

Interviews were conducted with a nationally representative sample of older African Americans. Survey items were administered to assess common religious factors (e.g., the frequency of church attendance) and unique religious factors (i.e., the belief that religion sustains Black people in the face of racial adversity). Subjective well-being was measured with a life satisfaction index.

Results

The findings reveal that both the common and the unique aspects of religion contribute to life satisfaction among older African Americans.

Discussion

Most studies on race differences in religion focus solely on common religious factors that may enhance the subjective well-being of older Whites as well as older Blacks. The findings from this study are important because they call attention to the insight that can be obtained by also taking the unique facets of religion for older Black people into consideration.

### Comparing role of religion in perception of the COVID-19 vaccines in Africa and Asia pacific [^30d33bd5]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessment of impacts of religion

We began by estimating the proportions of people supporting religious compatibility and accepting the COVID-19 vaccines for different religious groups at the two-time points (i.e. Wave 1 and 2). We then quantified the influences of religion (short for 'religion by region', or 'religious group') using three multivariate logistic regression models:
Compatibility: compatible ~ time + religion + education + gender + age,
Acceptance: acceptance ~ time + religion + education + gender + age,
Acceptance with compatibility :,

whereis a binary variable which equals 1 if and only if the respondent exhibited a positive attitude towards the statement regarding compatibility between vaccines and his or her religious belief.is also set as binary, with a value of 1 representing survey Wave 2. Nevertheless, in a subsequent sensitivity analysis, we tested this setting.

To account for the potential variations in the effects of religions across different subpopulations and time, we further constructed two logistic regression models that incorporated interactions between diverse socio-demographic factors, including religion, education, gender, and age. We initially considered full models with interaction terms between all these factors and thereafter removed terms whose estimated coefficients were not statistically significant. The final models we used for inference are:
I. Compatibility: compatible ~ religion × time × education + gender × age,
II. Acceptance: acceptance ~ religion × time × education + gender × age, A third model was employed to probe the link between COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and religious compatibility across different time points and religious groups, while accounting for the impacts of various socio-demographic covariates. The selection of interaction terms included in the model was similar to that for the previous two models. This analysis also served to highlight the disparities in impacts of religions between supporters and sceptics of religious compatibility of vaccines:
III. Acceptance with compatibility:

In addition, we also conducted some univariate and bivariate regression analyses to facilitate evaluating the average effects of factors of interest. Further details of the models and estimation methods are elaborated in Section 4 of the Supplementary Information (SI Table S7).

Statistics and reproducibility

All the analyses and visualization were conducted with R, using the survey (for quantitative analyses accounting for sample weights) and grid packages.

Ethical approval

The surveys conducted in Africa received ethical approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Hong Kong (EA230420), while those in Asia Pacific were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM 26636).

### Discussing religious and spiritual issues at the end of life: a practical guide for physicians [^4ccf793b]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

As patients near the end of life, their spiritual and religious concerns may be awakened or intensified. Many physicians, however, feel unskilled and uncomfortable discussing these concerns. This article suggests how physicians might respond when patients or families raise such concerns. First, some patients may explicitly base decisions about life-sustaining interventions on their spiritual or religious beliefs. Physicians need to explore those beliefs to help patients think through their preferences regarding specific interventions. Second, other patients may not bring up spiritual or religious concerns but are troubled by them. Physicians should identify such concerns and listen to them empathetically, without trying to alleviate the patient's spiritual suffering or offering premature reassurance. Third, some patients or families may have religious reasons for insisting on life-sustaining interventions that physicians advise against. The physician should listen and try to understand the patient's viewpoint. Listening respectfully does not require the physician to agree with the patient or misrepresent his or her own views. Patients and families who feel that the physician understands them and cares about them may be more willing to consider the physician's views on prognosis and treatment. By responding to patients' spiritual and religious concerns and needs, physicians may help them find comfort and closure near the end of life.

### Psychological therapy outcomes and engagement in people of different religions [^76ab2836]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Primary Outcome

Muslim patients had the lowest likelihood of reliable recovery regardless of adjustment for potential confounders, although adjustment reduced inequalities in outcomes (Table 2). In the unadjusted model, the odds of reliable recovery were 91% to 94% higher in those who reported no religion, other religion, or Christian compared with Muslim patients. After full adjustment, the odds of reliable recovery were still higher in patients who did not self report any religion (odds ratio [OR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.26–1.42) or self-reported Christian (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.31–1.48) and other religion (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.17–1.34) compared with Muslim patients.

Table 2.
Associations Between Self-Identified Religion and Psychological Treatment Outcomes

Abbreviation: OR, odds ratio.

The estimated probability of reliable recovery among those identifying as Muslim was 39.4% (95% CI, 38.3–40.4) in the fully adjusted model (Figure 1). Christian patients had the highest estimated probability of reliable recovery among the groups (46.3%; 95% CI, 45.7–47.0), followed closely by those with no religion (45.5%; 95% CI, 44.9–46.1), and then by those who reported other religions (44.0%; 95% CI, 42.9–45.1). There were no significant differences in reliable recovery among patients who reported no religion, Christian, and other religion (eTable 4 in Supplement 1).

Figure 1.
Estimated Probability of Reliable Recovery Across Religions in the Unadjusted and Fully Adjusted Models

Predicted probabilities of patients achieving reliable recovery in each group were obtained using the relevant logistic regression models. The fully adjusted model (model 4) was adjusted for treatment factors (number of sessions attended, number of sessions canceled, weeks from referral to assessment, and weeks from assessment to first session), clinical factors related to treatment in National Health Service Talking Therapies for anxiety and depression services (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 score, phobic anxiety scale items, diagnosis, and functional impairment [Work and Social Adjustment Scale items]), and sociodemographic and other pretreatment factors (age, gender, ethnicity, deprivation, long-term health condition, sexual orientation, employment status, and medication status).

### Spiritual fitness: a new dimension in Alzheimer's disease prevention [^c27da3c8]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

RELIGION, SPIRITUALITY, HEALTH, AND WELL-BEING

It is a major premise of this article that today's detrimental stressful existence impedes the creation of a healthy lifestyle, including psychological and spiritual well-being, while well-being augments brain function and may prevent AD. Most people intuitively know what religion is: the practice of a certain set of rules, rituals, and traditions that bring one closer to God. However, what is spirituality itself?

In 2008, Koenig argued that spirituality should be sharply defined, especially from a research perspective. In his 2020 Handbook of Spirituality, Religion, and Mental Health, he states, however, that people in Western nations are going through a transition to less religious identity over all. For exa-mple, he cites that 89% of Americans believe in God, 90% pray on a regular basis, yet only 77% report aff-iliation with a religious group. However, 82% acknowledge the need for spiritual growth. Also of note is that 84% of the world's population is religiously affiliated, and 68% of unaffiliated individuals believe in a higher power. Additionally, according to a Yoga Alliance/Yoga International study published in 2016, at least 36 million Americans practice yoga and 300 million do so worldwide, while 80 million Americans are likely to try yoga within 12 months. The number of people who meditate in the US is now at least 35 million.

However, it can be argued that they make a mistake in categorising this as a problem derived from religion, religious belief or the depth of religious conviction. Religion here is a red herring.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation / Heart Failure Society of America guideline on acute mechanical circulatory support [^2f978f1e]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Withdrawal of acute mechanical circulatory support (MCS) — ethical, religious, and communication considerations include that it is ethically acceptable to comply with a patient's (or surrogate's) request to discontinue acute MCS. Many religions support withdrawal of support if the patient finds the medical situation to be burdensome, and involvement of a religious leader of the same faith (such as a priest, imam, rabbi, or elder) can be useful in understanding choices regarding end-of-life decisions. For many religions, suicide and euthanasia are not acceptable; therefore, a discussion of discontinuation should be had using language that clearly focuses on medical appropriateness, and clinical facts, rather than on patient choice. As religiosity and spirituality comprise one of the core domains of palliative care, use of palliative care can also help incorporate patient and family discussion. If there are language barriers, use of a trained medical interpreter is essential and should not be substituted. If a decision is made to withdraw acute MCS, the use of a decommission checklist is suggested (Table 4.2).

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^dcabf207]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Domain 5: Spiritual, religious, and existential aspects of care — Guideline 5.1 Global — patient and family spiritual beliefs and practices are assessed and respected, and palliative care professionals acknowledge their own spirituality as part of their professional role and are provided with education and support to address each patient's and family's spirituality. Palliative care interdisciplinary teams (IDT) serve each patient and family in a manner that respects their spiritual beliefs and practices, and the IDT has clearly defined policies and processes in place to ensure spiritual care is respectful of patient and family age, developmental needs, culture, traditions, and spiritual preferences. Either directly, through referral, or in collaboration with the professional chaplain, the IDT facilitates spiritual and cultural rituals or practices as desired by the patient and family, and IDT members respect patient and family beliefs and practices, never imposing their individual beliefs on others. The spiritual needs of family members may differ from those of the patient and are recognized and supported, and care of children, adolescents, and their family members recognizes that spirituality is integral to coping with serious illness and is provided in a developmentally appropriate manner. In all settings, the IDT includes professional chaplains who have evidence-based training to assess and address spiritual issues frequently confronted by pediatric and adult patients and families coping with a serious illness; the professional chaplain is the spiritual care specialist, conducting the assessment and addressing the spiritual aspects of the care plan. Professional chaplains develop community partnerships to ensure patients have access to spiritual care providers trained and supervised by a professional chaplain, and the IDT and community spiritual care providers share information and coordinate services.

Results

Participant Characteristics

Of the 75 058 individuals referred to the 5 NHS TTad services from 2011 to 2020 who completed a course of psychological treatment, a total of 70 098 patients with data on self-reported religion (93.4%) were included in the analyses (mean [SD] age at referral, 39.2 [14.1] years; 47 797 [68.2%] female) (eFigure in Supplement 1). Of these patients, 10 350 (14.8%) self-identified as Muslim, 27 126 (38.7%) as having no religion, 24 217 (34.6%) as Christian, and 8405 (12.0%) identified with other religions. Those identifying as Muslim were most likely to identify as ethnically Asian (4876 participants [47.1%]), while patients of all other religion groups were most likely to identify as White with no religion (21 337 [78.7%]), Christian (15 920 [65.7%]), or other religion (3909 [46.5%]) (Table 1). Those who reported belonging to other religions (which includes Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Sikhism, and others) also had a relatively high proportion of individuals identifying as ethnically Asian (3414 participants [40.6%]).

### Voices in practice: exploring genetic counseling ethical, cultural, social, and religious dynamics in the UAE [^98250879]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Religious influence

Our analysis highlighted the dual role of religion in shaping engagement with genetic counseling. On one hand, faith functioned as a source of comfort and resilience, supporting families as they processed difficult diagnoses and accepted outcomes as part of divine will. On the other hand, religious beliefs also influenced how some patients approached genetic testing or interventions, especially when they were perceived as conflicting with God's plan, requiring a delicate balance to ensure that respect for faith was balanced with the provision of accurate information and care.

5.3.1 Religion as comfort and strength

Through our analysis, we constructed a theme that highlights how religious coping was narrated as a source of comfort and resilience. Trust in God (tawakkul) was described as enabling families to move from denial to acceptance, providing a spiritual framework for managing uncertainty and emotionally processing diagnoses.

This is a great support, and it's really supporting our patients to know that this is God's will… So, I think this is rather a positive thing rather than negative reinforcement.

Religion helps patients move from denial to acceptance.

Religious coping, however, was not monolithic; our analysis revealed that it could both reinforce engagement with services and at times create hesitations.

The concept of tawakkul, putting your trust in God, is like a two‐faced coin. It can enhance or impede the services.

5.3.2 Fatalism as a barrier to care

A contrasting pattern constructed through our analysis was the role of fatalistic interpretations of faith in shaping healthcare decisions. In these accounts, religious belief was positioned as a potential barrier, with genetic testing or reproductive interventions sometimes framed as conflicting with divine will.

Some patients decline testing because they believe that whatever happens is God's will.

I've seen people who refuse abortion because of religious beliefs, although there is a genetic basis… even when we know the condition is lethal.

Our analysis also illuminated variation within these narratives: many families actively integrated faith and medical advice, while others adopted more fatalistic positions, illustrating a spectrum of interpretive approaches to religion and healthcare.

We have two categories of patients: some believe you need to leave everything to God, and others, who I'd say are the majority, accept our advice and work with it.

This theme highlights religion as a multifaceted force, simultaneously supporting coping and shaping decisions in ways that can both facilitate and limit engagement with genetic services. Counselors often balanced cultural sensitivity with the provision of accurate information and care.

### Religious and spiritual interventions in mental health care: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials [^8ab212cb]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

However, despite numerous positive correlations, there are also reports of negative aspects of religiosity that are associated with thoughts of guilt, abandonment or punishment, such as: 'God is punishing me, does not like me and has abandoned me'. When these are present, outcomes tend to be negative with a greater prevalence of depression, anxiety and mortality (Pargament et al; Stratta et al.).

Despite the extensive literature assessing correlations or associations between R/S and mental health, few studies have investigated the clinical applicability of this evidence through controlled clinical trials. Given this, some authors have proposed strategies to investigate whether the stimulation of religious/spiritual beliefs could result in better clinical outcomes (Koszycki et al; Ka'opua et al.). It is believed that religious/spiritual interventions (RSI) have a role in changing an individual's thoughts, promoting greater acceptance of illness and social support and a deeper understanding of existence together with encouraging belief and faith, that could have an impact on patients' outcomes (Djuric et al; Rosendahl et al.).

Despite the growing number of studies, the approaches are still quite distinct and lack standardization. Some evaluate the increment of spirituality itself after the intervention (Richards et al.), others evaluate quality of life (Moritz et al.) and others the physical or mental health impact on patients (Huguelet et al.). The difference between the protocols (frequency and duration) is also considerable, hindering comparisons between techniques.

Despite the theoretical evidence, at present, we found three meta-analyses comparing treatment involving R/S in the literature; however, these comprised heterogeneous treatment settings and selection criteria (McCullough; Smith et al; Oh & Kim).

In order to update and clarify the results found in the literature, the aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, selecting only randomized controlled trials, focusing on the impact of RSI on mental health outcomes, and to evaluate the methodological quality of these articles. Considering the heterogeneity of these studies, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis of studies capable of grouping through populations or clinical outcomes.

### Breast feeding initiation rate across Western countries: does religion matter? An ecological study [^b9a7e333]. BMJ Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

Canadian province data

Religion proportions (Roman Catholics, Protestants and 'no religion') and breast feeding data were collated on the Statistics Canada website, from the 2011 National Household Survey (religion) and the 2009–2010 Canadian Community Health Survey (breast feeding).GDP per capita in 2014 and population density in 2011 were also obtained from the Statistics Canada website.

US state data

Proportions of Roman Catholics, Evangelical Protestants, Mainline Protestants and 'no religion' in US states were obtained from the 2014 survey of the 'Public Religion Research Institute', available on the 'American Values Atlas project' website. That survey also includes ethnic-specific religion data (ie, white Evangelical Protestants, black Protestants, non-Hispanic white Catholics). State-level data on ethnicity proportion (state percentage of non-Hispanic whites, Hispanic whites and Blacks), educational attainment (% of population with a high school degree or less) and household income (% of population with < $30 000/year) were also gathered on this website. State-level data on breast feeding were from the '2010 National Immunization Survey' conducted by the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention. Ethnic-specific breast feeding initiation rates by state were also available for non-Hispanic whites (n = 50 states), Hispanic whites (n = 44) and blacks (n = 26).

### Introducing spirituality, religion and culture curricula in the psychiatry residency programme [^7e35bd6b]. Medical Humanities (2010). Low credibility.

A growing body of research suggests that religion and spirituality may have a positive effect on mental and physical health. Medical schools have been increasingly offering courses in spirituality and health, particularly about the multi-cultural dimensions of religion and spirituality. There is a trend towards integrating the teaching of cross-cultural issues related to spirituality and religion into medical education. This trend is particularly evident in the field of psychiatry, where an increasing number of residency programmes are developing curriculum in this area. This article describes a specific curriculum in spirituality, religion and culture that was introduced in 2003 at the University of Washington Psychiatry Residency Program in Seattle, Washington. Reflections about the present and future of subject areas such as spirituality and religion in medical education and psychiatry residency are discussed.

### Religion, spirituality, and medicine: psychiatrists' and other physicians' differing observations, interpretations, and clinical approaches [^38af6388]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This study compared the ways in which psychiatrists and nonpsychiatrists interpret the relationship between religion/spirituality and health and address religion/spirituality issues in the clinical encounter.

Method

The authors mailed a survey to a stratified random sample of 2,000 practicing U.S. physicians, with an oversampling of psychiatrists. The authors asked the physicians about their beliefs and observations regarding the relationship between religion/spirituality and patient health and about the ways in which they address religion/spirituality in the clinical setting.

Results

A total of 1,144 physicians completed the survey. Psychiatrists generally endorse positive influences of religion/spirituality on health, but they are more likely than other physicians to note that religion/spirituality sometimes causes negative emotions that lead to increased patient suffering (82% versus 44%). Compared to other physicians, psychiatrists are more likely to encounter religion/spirituality issues in clinical settings (92% versus 74% report their patients sometimes or often mention religion/spirituality issues), and they are more open to addressing religion/spirituality issues with patients (93% versus 53% say that it is usually or always appropriate to inquire about religion/spirituality).

Conclusions

This study suggests that the vast majority of psychiatrists appreciate the importance of religion and/or spirituality at least at a functional level. Compared to other physicians, psychiatrists also appear to be more comfortable, and have more experience, addressing religion/spirituality concerns in the clinical setting.

Cultural values — religion and culture are valid reasons for refusal of treatments by autonomous adult patients, but when parents invoke religious or cultural reasons for limiting treatment for their children, efforts must be undertaken to ensure the legitimacy of those decisions and ethics and legal consultations should be sought; for example, parental refusal to provide thyroid hormone therapy to a child who has had a thyroidectomy would require such a consult and the involvement of child protective services.

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^da8f8504]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Validity issues and robustness checks

In what follows, we describe how we have addressed possible validity issues.
In our analyses, we have assumed that the cohort differences with younger cohorts being less religious than older cohorts are caused by cohort effects and not life-cycle effects. This assumption may be criticized. We acknowledge that the evidence corroborating the assumption is stronger for western than for non-western countries. However, proponents of a life-cycle argument would have to explain why - if their assumptions were correct - in very religious countries, people would have more participation as they age, in medium religious countries, people would have more participation, importance, and belonging as they get older, and in very secular countries, the population would increase affiliation as it ages. It seems unlikely that someone would try to make such an argument.
Another issue for our analysis concerns measurement invariance. Indicators of religiosity may be non-comparable across countries since the actions, beliefs and values measured mean something different in different religions. In congregational religions such as Christianity or Islam religionists gather for public rituals in a community or congregation and often see their identity strongly in terms of this community. In non-congregational religions such as Shinto, Buddhism or Hinduism, the emphasis lies more on individual practice and public rituals are seen as beneficial, but not necessary. Public rituals are not held in a regularly occurring religious service of a group (or congregation); rather, individuals and families seek out temples and shrines when they feel the need to do so. There is often no felt belonging to an imagined large confessional group, but there may be the strong feeling of belonging to an ethnic or caste group; furthermore, individuals and especially families have links to specific temples or shrines; however, they may also worship at other places and to gods, buddhas, or kamis of different religious traditions. –. The effect may then be that, assuming a real latent level of religiosity, the indicator over- or underestimates religiosity. We address the problem by analyzing cohort differences, comparing an older and a younger cohort in every country. This controls for possible bias. The problem remains, however, when we construct our measure of country secularity where biased estimators may bias the positioning of the countries. To address this point, we conduct robustness tests with different ways of constructing country secularity (Supplementary Methods 7). On the subject of measurement invariance, our model makes an additional point. Studies that test measurement invariance for religiosity items over a large number of countries and that assume all countries to be "at the same time" may get it wrong. They may conclude that there is measurement invariance, while, in fact, countries are at different points in time on the secular transition and therefore must show different correlational structures.
An important question is the choice of indicators of religiosity. What we measure with "importance of religion in one's life" is an indicator for personal religiosity in a very broad sense including religious beliefs and personal practices such as prayer. These different elements, and especially belief variables vary strongly across different religious and cultural areas. We have therefore chosen to use only one indicator both in the Pew study and the WVS/EVS data, whose meaning seems to be relatively well comparable across cultures and who clearly taps personal religiosity. As a robustness check, we investigate how well our results hold when measuring the "importance" dimension in two other ways: (a) with a composite measure of importance of religion and prayer; and (b) with a composite measure of importance of religion, importance of god, belief in god, and self-description as a religious person (Supplementary Methods 8).
We do not use a measure of modernization (e.g. the HDI index) as an independent variable, since we do not seek to causally explain secularization. Neither do we use such an indicator as a control, since we do not expect the secular transition to happen independently of modernization. Controlling for modernization (e.g. with an indicator such as the HDI) would then introduce bias rather than reduce it.
We model our three dependent variables using a sigmoid (inverse logit) function. We chose the logit function due to its intuitive interpretability compared to alternative link functions. However, one might question whether the results would differ under alternative specifications. A good alternative candidate would be the probit function (non-parametric functions are not feasible because of the relatively small number of countries). In Supplementary Methods 9 we show graphically that results look very similar with probit. AIC measures of logit and probit are also very close.
Our results are furthermore robust with respect to (a) varying the cut point with respect to cohorts; (b) varying the cut points with respect to attendance and importance of religion; (c) including or excluding the controls; including or excluding imputed values; including or excluding the weights in WVS/EVS data. (Supplementary Methods 10, 11, 12).

### The relationship between religion / spirituality and physical health, mental health, and pain in a chronic pain population [^5f51c590]. Pain (2005). Low credibility.

This study sought to better understand the relationship between religion/spirituality and physical health and mental health in 122 patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. The current study conceptualized religion/spirituality as a multidimensional factor, and measured it with a new measure of religion/spirituality for research on health outcomes (Brief Multidimensional Measure of Religion/Spirituality). Pain patients' religious and spiritual beliefs appear different than the general population (e.g. pain patients feel less desire to reduce pain in the world and feel more abandoned by God). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed significant associations between components of religion/spirituality and physical and mental health. Private religious practice (e.g. prayer, meditation, consumption of religious media) was inversely related to physical health outcomes, indicating that those who were experiencing worse physical health were more likely to engage in private religious activities, perhaps as a way to cope with their poor health. Forgiveness, negative religious coping, daily spiritual experiences, religious support, and self-rankings of religious/spiritual intensity significantly predicted mental health status. Religion/spirituality was unrelated to pain intensity and life interference due to pain. This study establishes relationships between religion/spirituality and health in a chronic pain population, and emphasizes that religion/spirituality may have both costs and benefits for the health of those with chronic pain.

### Buddhism-as-a-meaning-system for coping with late-life stress: a conceptual framework [^d3b6e801]. Aging & Mental Health (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Religion is increasingly conceptualized as a meaning system for adjustment and coping. Most of the conceptualizations are grounded in the Judeo-Christian tradition. They may thus not be applicable to Buddhism, which provides a distinct tenor of meaning for coping. This article seeks to construct a conceptual framework of Buddhism-as-a-meaning-system for coping with late-life stress.

Method

Literature review and conceptualization were employed.

Results

Under this framework, Buddhism functions as a meaning system involving existential meaning, cognitive meaning, and behavioral meaning.

Conclusion

There is reason to believe that this framework promises to offer a holistic conceptual map of Buddhist coping in late life. Thus, it could serve as a guide for further empirical and theoretical exploration in the uncharted terrains of Buddhist coping in old age. In addition, gerontological practitioners could use this framework as a frame of reference when working with elderly Buddhist clients who are in stressful circumstances.

### A comprehensive strategy for developing closed-ended survey items for use in studies of older adults [^756f9766]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to describe the development and implementation of a nine-step strategy for devising closed-ended survey questions that assess religion in late life. The intent was to illustrate one way in which qualitative and quantitative methods could be combined in the same study.

Methods

The following methods and procedures were developed to create closed-ended questions: Focus groups, in-depth interviews, input from ongoing quantitative studies, input from an expert panel, cognitive interviews, a quantitative pretest, a nationwide random probability sample of elderly people, and rigorous empirical psychometric testing. Three hundred ninety-nine older people took part in the first seven steps, and 1,500 elders participated in the nationwide survey.

Results

Approximately 175 closed-ended survey items were developed assessing 14 different major dimensions of religion. In the process, practical solutions to a number of problems encountered in implementing the nine-step strategy are discussed.

Discussion

The item development strategy may serve as a template that can be used to improve the quality of closed-ended survey items that assess a wide range of topics in social gerontology.

### The royal free interview for spiritual and religious beliefs: development and validation of a self-report version [^24de7c93]. Psychological Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Spiritual beliefs are rarely considered in psychological or medical publications. We recently published the psychometric properties of an interview designed to measure religious and spiritual belief. In this study, we aimed to develop this instrument further as a self-report questionnaire and to make it more comprehensive by including measurement of spiritual experiences in addition to faith or intellectual assent.

Methods

Based on extensive discussion with colleagues, advice from users of the interview and comments from respondents, a self-report format was designed. We then evaluated the final format of the questionnaire in terms of (1) patterns of response and demographic predictors of beliefs; (2) test-retest reliability and internal consistency; (3) criterion and internal validity; and (4) the nature of spiritual experiences and their relationship to beliefs and strength of beliefs.

Results

Two hundred and ninety-seven people took part in the validity and reliability tests of the questionnaire. Criterion validity, predictive validity, internal consistency and test-retest reliability were acceptably high. The instrument consistently differentiated between people with high and low spiritual beliefs.

Conclusions

This instrument is brief and simple to complete. We would recommend that measures of religious and/or spiritual belief like this be more widely applied in health services research as they evaluate aspects of people's lives that go somewhat further than health status or quality of life.

### Religious development from adolescence to early adulthood among muslim and christian youth in Germany: a person-oriented approach [^00b2b03f]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

Religious self‐categorization

Religious self‐categorization was assessed with a single item "What is your religion?" at Waves 1–3 and 5–7. The response options were 1 (No religion), 2 (Buddhism), 3 (Christianity), 4 (Christianity: Catholic), 5 (Christianity: Protestant), 6 (Hinduism), 7 (Islam), 8 (Judaism), 9 (Sikhism), and 10 (Other religion).

Religiosity

Religiosity was assessed with three items capturing its key components (i.e. public involvement, private practices, importance). We combined these widely used items and examined overall religiosity which — according to meta‐analyses — is the most common approach to studying religiosity (e.g. Hardy et al; Yonker et al.). The first item, "How important is religion to you?", was assessed at Waves 1–7. The response options were 1 (Very important), 2 (Fairly important), 3 (Not very important), and 4 (Not at all important). The second item, "How often do you visit a religious meeting place (e.g. a church, a mosque, a synagogue or a temple)?", was assessed at Waves 1–3 and 5–7. The response options were 1 (Never), 2 (Occasionally (but less than once a month)), 3 (At least once a month), 4 (At least once a week), and 5 (Every day). The third item, "How often do you pray?", was assessed at Waves 1–3 and 5–7. The response options were 1 (Never), 2 (Occasionally (but less than once a month)), 3 (At least once a month), 4 (At least once a week), 5 (One to four times a day), and 6 (Five times a day or more). We rescaled the first and third items to a five‐point scale with higher values indicating greater religiosity. Across time, the items loaded on a single factor explaining between 73.8% and 77.8% of the variance. Cronbach's α across waves ranged from.82 to.85. We computed mean scores for Waves 1–3 and 5–7.

### Hopelessness among middle-aged and older blacks: the negative impact of discrimination and protecting power of social and religious resources [^a7cda214]. Innovation in Aging (2020). Medium credibility.

Religiosity.

 — Religiosity refers to the extent to which a person believes in a higher power and receives guidance and comfort from this belief. Four items assessed religiosity: "I believe in a God who watches over me", "The events in my life unfold according to a divine or greater plan", "I try to carry my religious beliefs over into all my other dealings in life", and "I find strength and comfort in my religion". Response options ranged from 0 = "strongly disagree" to 5 = "strongly agree". We averaged the four items to construct the religiosity scale and then dichotomized the scale at its median (i.e. 5) to distinguishes between high and low levels of religiosity. Those with a mean value equal to 5 were included in the high religiosity group, and those with a mean value less than 5 were included in the low religiosity group (reference category).

### Sikh religion and palliative care [^fed4bccb]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2022). High credibility.

Over time, end of life care has been heavily influenced by the systems of religion, ethics and spirituality. The Sikh religion was started by Guru Nanak Dev Ji in 1469. It has a unique philosophical understanding of life, death and God which can be relevant to commonly encountered clinical scenarios. Concepts such as 'Ik-Oankar', Hukam (God's will), ego and karma all influence how practising Sikhs respond to situations in everyday life. Understanding the spiritual underpinnings of the Sikh religion is therefore important for clinicians caring for this group of patients. This article will explore the fundamental concepts of the Sikh religion and how these apply to common scenarios encountered within palliative care.

Measuring religion

How can R/S be defined, or more so, be scientifically measured? Religious expression, practice and beliefs are dynamic. Definitions vary from organised to unorganised, from personal to group, from theistic to non-theistic, from intrinsic to extrinsic and so on. In this paper, the term 'religion' refers to organised and/or shared faith practice or belief and the term 'spirituality' refers to the way people relate to the transcendent, including traditional practices. The participants of this study come from a highly religious society. The majority identifies with the Christian belief. However, in the Zimbabwean context, Christianity and traditional belief practices exist alongside and are sometimes practiced simultaneously. This is especially true when it comes to health issues. Shoko explains that in the Shona understanding most conceive and practice healing holistically, embracing not only the physical conditions, but also the spiritual, psychoemotional, social and ecological dimensions.

### Religion, spirituality, and the hidden curriculum: medical student and faculty reflections [^0e25d383]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Religion and spirituality play an important role in physicians' medical practice, but little research has examined their influence within the socialization of medical trainees and the hidden curriculum.

Objectives

The objective is to explore the role of religion and spirituality as they intersect with aspects of medicine's hidden curriculum.

Methods

Semiscripted, one-on-one interviews and focus groups (n = 33 respondents) were conducted to assess Harvard Medical School student and faculty experiences of religion/spirituality and the professionalization process during medical training. Using grounded theory, theme extraction was performed with interdisciplinary input (medicine, sociology, and theology), yielding a high inter-rater reliability score (kappa = 0.75).

Results

Three domains emerged where religion and spirituality appear as a factor in medical training. First, religion/spirituality may present unique challenges and benefits in relation to the hidden curriculum. Religious/spiritual respondents more often reported to struggle with issues of personal identity, increased self-doubt, and perceived medical knowledge inadequacy. However, religious/spiritual participants less often described relationship conflicts within the medical team, work-life imbalance, and emotional stress arising from patient suffering. Second, religion/spirituality may influence coping strategies during encounters with patient suffering. Religious/spiritual trainees described using prayer, faith, and compassion as means for coping whereas nonreligious/nonspiritual trainees discussed compartmentalization and emotional repression. Third, levels of religion/spirituality appear to fluctuate in relation to medical training, with many trainees experiencing an increase in religiousness/spirituality during training.

Conclusion

Religion/spirituality has a largely unstudied but possibly influential role in medical student socialization. Future study is needed to characterize its function within the hidden curriculum.

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^668bef37]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The results of our study also raise a question regarding the apparent absence of importance of state influence. Is it possible that there exists a broad secular transition trend, despite varying religious policies across different states? It is well-established that state policies can have a marked impact on the presence, magnitude, and pace of secular transition. However, their influence is often limited in the long term. As a case in point, South Korea experienced a resurgence of Protestant and Buddhist religions due to state regulation in the late 1960s and 1970s, yet this resurgence was transitory in nature.

Our study has demonstrated that increasing country secularity coincides with the P-I-B sequence. By doing so, we have sidestepped the question of just what non-religious factors causally explain country secularity in the first place. What necessary and sufficient conditions may lead a country to enter the secular transition and to keep it moving along the transition trajectory? While it is obvious that indicators of modernization, such as HDI, are linked to the level of country secularity, and to the religiosity-cohort gaps on an aggregate level (Supplementary Discussion 2), the underlying causal mechanisms have yet to be disentangled.

An interesting implication of our model is that we can expect individual legitimations and rationalizations of the process that can be observed both in quantitative, but especially qualitative research. As individuals abandon previously socially expected traits, they may encounter a perceived social disapproval. To mitigate this perception, they may rationalize that their social worth remains intact despite dropping the trait. During the P-I-B sequence, individuals may argue that they can still find religion important and be a "good religionist" even after giving up participation. Similarly, even when having stopped considering religion important in their life, they may argue that they still belong to the religious group by tradition. And even after giving up religious belonging, they may argue that they can still maintain "good values".

Summing up, our results suggest a worldwide secular transition has been underway for many decades. Religion seems to be declining in three stages worldwide.

### Breast feeding initiation rate across Western countries: does religion matter? An ecological study [^d99651ef]. BMJ Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

The parallel limitation of our study is the so-called ecological fallacy, whereby associations observed at the population level may not reflect relationships at the individual level. To at least partly overcome this limitation, we explored the association using within-country data in France, Ireland, the UK, Canada and the USA; the results of those analyses confirmed our findings. Our analysis for the USA would have been even more informative if breast feeding data had been aggregated at the county level, as we were able to find for religion data. Finally, testing our hypothesis in Germany with Länder-level data would have been an additional asset to our study. Indeed, the Protestant religion originated in Saxony in the 16th century, before spreading to neighbouring areas with a previous Catholic tradition. Unfortunately, we were unable to find data on religion and breast feeding at the Länder level.

Another study limitation is the lack of time-series data. Indeed, our data were cross-sectional snapshots taken in a recent period, while breast feeding initiation rates in Western countries have been increasing for several decades. Correlating longitudinal data would have strengthened our ability to infer causality for the associations we observed. Nonetheless, we argue that religion proportions and religious culture change too slowly to have significant short-term consequences on breast feeding practice. In fact, adherence or practice of religion, as declared by individuals, are proxies for values and beliefs reflected by religion. Individuals who declare not adhering to any religion, or adhering to one religion without practising it, tend to maintain (perhaps unconsciously) the beliefs and values embedded through generations by their familial and national religious culture. Hence, it is unlikely that using religion data from the mid-20th century would have changed our results. On the other hand, using breast feeding data from the 1970s or 1980s could have impacted our results; we found no detailed data to compare that temporal change between or within countries. A final limitation of our study is our inability to account for small religious minorities and for potential individual-level confounders such as maternal age, marital status and employment.

### Recommendations for the management of diabetes during ramadan applying the principles of the ADA / EASD consensus: update 2025 [^b3678cd4]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Ramadan fasting is a sacred ritual observed by approximately 1.8 billion Muslims each year, most of whom adhere to fasting due to its significance as a core pillar of Islam. Able-bodied Muslims who are capable of fasting are religiously required to do so. Ramadan is profoundly spiritual and of great importance in the Muslim community that occurs for roughly 30 days, in alignment with the lunar calendar. During Ramadan, Muslims abstain from food and drink for 11–16 h a day on average; however, this could be significantly shorter or longer depending on the season and the geographic location, ultimately breaking their fast during the sunset meal 'Iftaar'. Before the great strides were taken in the management of diabetes, these patients were initially considered not able to observe this holy month, creating significant frustration and disconnect with their families and loved ones. As patient outcomes improved through the emergence of better pharmacotherapy and increasing use of technology, these restrictions have been reconsidered. This prompted us to create the 2005 first global statement regarding best practices in the management of diabetes during Ramadan as an official American Diabetes Association (ADA) report. Since then, we have received numerous requests and comments asking for updated versions that include the latest data, medications, and technology. We decided to issue an update every 5 years, including 2010, 2015 and 2020. Our updated recommendations collate some of the more directly implicative findings on patient care for Ramadan fasting and align closely with the ADA's consensus for diabetes management. We recommend the prioritisation of pharmacologic therapies with a low risk profile for hypoglycaemia. Technological advancements, including integrated pump-sensor systems, hybrid closed-loop systems, and artificial intelligence (AI)-equipped continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices, show great promise in the monitoring of blood glucose levels and can provide tangible reductions in hypoglycaemia episodes, suggesting possible utility in the facilitation of fasting in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Our recommendations align with the ADA consensus for the use of CGM devices, in concordance with appropriate time in range (TIR) targets to reduce hypoglycaemia and glycaemic variability. The implications of Ramadan fasting on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk remain uncertain due to the sparsity of evidence, but the literature suggests an increased risk. Until more conclusive evidence is reported, we advise patients with a high ASCVD risk to avoid Ramadan fasting. We emphasise the pivotal role primary care providers (PCPs) have in counselling, managing, and following patients who intend to fast and advise counselling to begin ideally 6–8 weeks prior to Ramadan start, with particular recommendations to be given to patients post-bariatric surgery.

### Childhood predictors of suffering in adulthood across 22 countries [^9fc2659d]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Religious affiliation at age 12 was also assessed in all countries, but there were considerable cross-country differences in the response categories endorsed by participants because some religious affiliations are only applicable in certain countries and not others. Religious affiliation at age 12 response category options included Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Sikhism, Baha'i, Jainism, Shinto, Taoism, Confucianism, primal/animist/folk religion, Spiritism, Umbanda, Candomblé, and other African-derived religions, Chinese folk/traditional religion, some other religion, or no religion/atheist/agnostic. When more than 5% of a within-country sample endorsed the no religion/atheist/agnostic category, this was used as the reference category in the country-specific analyses; otherwise, the most prominent religious group was used. Additionally, all religious affiliation categories endorsed by less than 3% of a within-country sample were collapsed into a single religious affiliation category. Racial/ethnic identity was assessed in most (18/22) countries, and response categories varied across countries. Country-specific analyses used a binary racial/ethnic identity variable based on whether an individual was in the most prominent group in the sample versus a minority group. Additional details about the measurement of the predictors can be found in the Global Flourishing Study codebook.

### APA multicultural guidelines executive summary: ecological approach to context, identity, and intersectionality [^916ed495]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

APA Multicultural Guidelines executive summary — trauma and cultural context explains that psychological trauma involves events that "overwhelm the ordinary systems of care", often including "threats to life or bodily integrity" and confronting people with "helplessness and terror". Trauma is described as a "global phenomenon", and psychologists are "encouraged to consider the cultural context in which traumatic events unfold" because cultural context influences interpretation of and response to traumatic events. Interpretation and response may be shaped by cultural constructs such as individualism versus collectivism, religion and spirituality, connections between the body and the mind, social roles, and overarching cultural values. Evidence cited indicates it is important for professionals to recognize how family, religion, violence exposure, and poverty shape client beliefs and emotional responses to trauma, and it acknowledges that discussing values and contextual factors, including marginalization and discrimination, can be challenging.

### Sexual minority status, religiosity, and suicidal behaviors among college students in the United States [^029bd395]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Religiosity has been protective against suicidal behaviors, though it is unclear whether the protective effects extend to the high-risk group of sexual minorities.

Methods

We analyzed data from the Healthy Minds Study, which was administered to college students enrolled in one of 140 campuses across the United States (N = 104,463) from September through December 2020, and from January to June 2021. We limited the sample to emerging adulthood (i.e., ages 18–30). We calculated the prevalence of suicidal behaviors and the mean of importance of religion, stratifying by sexual minority status. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the associations between predictors (sexual minority status, importance of religion) and outcomes (suicidal ideation, suicide plan, and suicide attempt), adjusting for age, gender, and race/ethnicity. We then tested to see whether the association between importance of religion and suicidal behaviors was conditional on sexual minority status.

Results

Significantly larger proportions of sexual minority students reported suicidal behaviors than heterosexual students. A larger proportion of heterosexual students viewed religion to be very important in their lives when compared with sexual minority students. Being a sexual minority was associated with greater odds of all suicidal behaviors, and greater importance of religion was associated with lower odds. The importance of religion was significantly associated with lower odds of suicidal behaviors for heterosexual students when compared with sexual minority students.

Conclusion

The association between importance of religion and suicidal behaviors was conditional on sexual minority status.

### Ethnicity-specific factors influencing childhood immunisation decisions among black and Asian minority ethnic groups in the UK: a systematic review of qualitative research [^13019794]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2017). Low credibility.

Religion

Parents' religion affected their perceptions of the importance of immunisations and whether immunisations were permitted. Some mothers stated that their antipreventive medicine beliefs were linked to their religion. Contrarily, some Somali, Hindu and Asian Hindu mothers described how their religion taught them to look after the health of their children and so influenced their decision to vaccinate.

I do believe it [immunisations]… reduce diseases. But God knows — he can bring the kids to be sick or not to be sick basically. Tomlinson, participant comment.

… In our religion it says whatever that's good for your health… just do it. Tomlinson, participant comment.

Religious practices also affected whether parents believed their children were at risk of acquiring immunisation-preventable diseases. Some Asian Muslim and Black Christian parents discussing HPV immunisation (which protects against a sexually transmitted infection) stated that their daughters were not at risk of infection, as their religion promotes abstinence from sex before marriage. However, other Asian Muslim parents opted to vaccinate against HPV as they believed that they could not control their children's behaviour.

Coming from a Muslim background… we don't have sex before marriage for example, so your first experiences of these things are when you're married and you stay in a relationship… because of that reason I'd probably say no, I wouldn't bother with it with my two girls. Marlow, participant comment.

Some Somali parents had concerns about the content of immunisations (gelatine) on religious grounds.

### Toward an integration of spirituality and religiousness into the psychosocial dimension of schizophrenia [^bbb4d173]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Spirituality and religiousness have been shown to be highly prevalent among patients with schizophrenia. However, clinicians are rarely aware of the importance of religion and understand little of the value or difficulties it presents to treatment. This study aimed to assess the role of religion as a mediating variable in the process of coping with psychotic illness.

Method

Semistructured interviews about religious coping were conducted with a sample of 115 outpatients with psychotic illness.

Results

For some patients, religion instilled hope, purpose, and meaning in their lives (71%), whereas for others, it induced spiritual despair (14%). Patients also reported that religion lessened (54%) or increased (10%) psychotic and general symptoms. Religion was also reported to increase social integration (28%) or social isolation (3%). It may reduce (33%) or increase (10%) the risk of suicide attempts, reduce (14%) or increase (3%) substance use, and foster adherence to (16%) or be in opposition to (15%) psychiatric treatment.

Conclusions

Our results highlight the clinical significance of religion in the care of patients with schizophrenia. Religion is neither a strictly personal matter nor a strictly cultural one. Spirituality should be integrated into the psychosocial dimension of care. Our results suggest that the complexity of the relationship between religion and illness requires a highly sensitive approach to each unique story.

### Spirituality and religion in patients with HIV / AIDS [^f6638217]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Spirituality and religion are often central issues for patients dealing with chronic illness. The purpose of this study is to characterize spirituality/religion in a large and diverse sample of patients with HIV/AIDS by using several measures of spirituality/religion, to examine associations between spirituality/religion and a number of demographic, clinical, and psychosocial variables, and to assess changes in levels of spirituality over 12 to 18 months.

Methods

We interviewed 450 patients from 4 clinical sites. Spirituality/religion was assessed by using 8 measures: the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spirituality-Expanded scale (meaning/peace, faith, and overall spirituality); the Duke Religion Index (organized and nonorganized religious activities, and intrinsic religiosity); and the Brief RCOPE scale (positive and negative religious coping). Covariates included demographics and clinical characteristics, HIV symptoms, health status, social support, self-esteem, optimism, and depressive symptoms.

Results

The patients' mean (SD) age was 43.3 (8.4) years; 387 (86%) were male; 246 (55%) were minorities; and 358 (80%) indicated a specific religious preference. Ninety-five (23%) participants attended religious services weekly, and 143 (32%) engaged in prayer or meditation at least daily. Three hundred thirty-nine (75%) patients said that their illness had strengthened their faith at least a little, and patients used positive religious coping strategies (e.g., sought God's love and care) more often than negative ones (e.g., wondered whether God has abandoned me; P < .0001). In 8 multivariable models, factors associated with most facets of spirituality/religion included ethnic and racial minority status, greater optimism, less alcohol use, having a religion, greater self-esteem, greater life satisfaction, and lower overall functioning (R2 = .16 to .74). Mean levels of spirituality did not change significantly over 12 to 18 months.

Conclusions

Most patients with HIV/AIDS belonged to an organized religion and use their religion to cope with their illness. Patients with greater optimism, greater self-esteem, greater life satisfaction, minorities, and patients who drink less alcohol tend to be both more spiritual and religious. Spirituality levels remain stable over 12 to 18 months.

### Religion and mental health in racial and ethnic minority populations: a review of the literature [^6fcda9ec]. Innovation in Aging (2020). Medium credibility.

Latino Americans

Religion and the church have also played a prominent role in Latino communities in the United States. Latino Americans predominately identify as Christian (80%), with Catholics comprising the majority of this population (55%;). Protestant, mostly Evangelical, Latinos make up 22% of the Latino population. In Latino American communities, religion facilitates (a) the stress-coping process of migration, (b) reestablishing ethnic communities in the United States, and (c) preservation of cultural values and ethnic identity. Similar to religion in black communities, religion and the church play central roles within Latino communities in the United States. Often churches in Latino communities have distinctive ethnic characteristics, such as Spanish language services and Latino cultural programs, and are institutions that help maintain Latino identity. Thus, religious and ethnic/cultural identities are complexly interwoven in Latino communities.

Overall, Latinos demonstrate relatively high levels of religiosity, with 60% indicating that religion is very important in their lives. The overwhelming majority of Latinos (91%) also display moderate to high levels of religious commitment. National survey data indicate that religiosity also increases with age among Latinos. For example, close to three in four Latinos aged 50 and older say that religion is very important in their lives. This is compared to 45% of Latinos aged 18–29 years and 63% of Latinos aged 30–49 years who say that religion is very important. Older Latinos also exhibit higher levels of religious commitment than their younger counterparts. At the organizational level, close to half of older Latinos, compared to nearly one of three young Latinos, attend religious services at least once a week. Older Latinos have higher rates of participation in church activities outside of worship, albeit this difference is only slight. Older Latinos' rates of nonorganizational religious involvement are also higher than those of younger Latinos. For instance, about three quarters of older Latinos, when compared with less than half of young Latinos, pray at least once a day.

### Spirituality and religiosity in a palliative medicine population: mixed-methods study [^df624c0f]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2022). High credibility.

Background

Spiritual care allows palliative care patients to gain a sense of purpose, meaning and connectedness to the sacred or important while experiencing a serious illness. This study examined how Australian patients conceptualise their spirituality/religiosity, the associations between diagnosis and spiritual/religious activities, and views on the amount of spiritual support received.

Methods

This mixed-methods study used anonymous semistructured questionnaires, which included the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Scale-12 (FACIT-SP-12) and adapted and developed questions examining religion/spirituality's role and support.

Results

Participants numbered 261, with a 50.9% response rate. Sixty-two per cent were affiliated with Christianity and 24.2% with no religion. The mean total FACIT-SP-12 score was 31.9 (SD 8.6). Patients with Christian affiliation reported a higher total FACIT-SP-12 score compared with no religious affiliation (p = 0.003). Those with Christian and Buddhist affiliations had higher faith subscale scores compared with those with no religious affiliation (p < 0.001). Spirituality was very important to 39.9% and religiosity to 31.7% of patients, and unimportant to 30.6% and 39.5%, respectively. Following diagnosis, patients prayed (p < 0.001) and meditated (p < 0.001) more, seeking more time, strength and acceptance. Attendance at religious services decreased with frailty (p < 0.001), while engagement in other religious activities increased (p = 0.017). Patients who received some level of spiritual/religious support from external religious/faith communities and moderate to complete spiritual/religious needs met by the hospitals reported greater total FACIT-SP-12 spirituality scores (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Respectful inquiry into patients spiritual/religious needs in hospitals allows for an attuned approach to addressing such care needs while considerately accommodating those disinterested in such support.

### Medically valid religious beliefs [^70b6de54]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2008). Low credibility.

Patient requests for "inappropriate" medical treatment (violations of the standard of care) based on religious beliefs should have special standing. Nevertheless, not all such requests should be honored, because some are morally disturbing. The trouble lies in deciding which ones count. This paper proposes criteria that would qualify a religious belief as medically valid to help physicians decide which requests to respect. The four conditions suggested are that the belief (1) is shared by a community, (2) is deeply held, (3) would pass the test of a religious interpreter and (4) does not harm others.

### Fertility intentions and the way they change following birth-a prospective longitudinal study [^de75ee00]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

The Jewish population in Israel is made of several religious groups, which differ in their cultural beliefs, practices, and social norms. They could be broadly defined based on levels of observance of the Jewish traditions in their everyday life and social identity. Identification with a certain religiosity group impacts various life domains such as educational system choice, political ideology and day to day life such as dress code, prayer habits, and abstaining from activities on Saturday (the Jewish Holy day). The very-religious (Ultra-Orthodox) are the most observant group, followed by religious (Orthodox/Modern-Orthodox), traditional (slightly observant) and secular (non-observant Jews). The very-religious are the smallest group (approximately 10% of Jewish women 20 years of age and older), similar to the religious (11%), the traditional group (35%) is larger and the largest group are the secular (non-observant Jews), making up 44%. As with other religions, in Judaism, fertility rates are influenced by religiosity. Israeli very-religious women have high fertility rates, nearing 6.5 children per women. Fertility rates are lower among religious (4.5 children per woman), traditional (2.5 children per woman) or secular families (2.1 children per woman). Very-religious women often do not 'plan' the number of children they will have, adhering to the religious commandment that is interpreted as having as many children as God wills. Fertility issues (i.e. pregnancies, miscarriages, infertility, contraception) are considered a private matter and thus it is likely that some very-religious women would not disclose specific fertility intentions (i.e. answering "do not know" or "whatever God chooses"). Nonetheless, research has shown that women who do not answer regarding fertility intentions in surveys are typically like most of their socio-cultural group.

### Considering culture, complementary medicine, and spirituality in pediatrics [^06eeafb1]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Whether or not it is apparent, cultural and spiritual diversity exist in many clinical encounters, both with patients and with colleagues. These issues may cloud other concerns, contribute to inadequate or misleading communication, and affect lifestyle and therapeutic choices. Given the rapid rise in complementary therapies and the growing diversity in North America, the challenges of providing sensitive, compassionate, comprehensive care are compounded. Reflecting on the ways cultural backgrounds, religious beliefs and complementary medicine affect physicians, colleagues and patients may enrich, clarify, deepen, and improve the effectiveness of our clinical practice. The cases presented here offer an opportunity for role playing and reflection to support this process.

### Exploring the out-group homogeneity effect among arab children in Israel: the roles of religion, contact, and group identification [^f9d0a7a7]. Child Development (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

The out‐group homogeneity effect has been found to contribute to adults' inter‐group biases. Three studies examined whether 5‐ and 8‐year‐old Arab (i.e. minority) children in Israel also manifest this effect (March 2017–January 2020). Arab children from different religious affiliations and social environments (N = 272, 54% females) were asked to choose either a homogeneous or a heterogeneous sample of group members to infer if a given property (biological or psychological) was true of a whole group: either the participant's in‐group (Arabs) or out‐group (Jews). Overall, differently from Jewish (i.e. majority) Israeli children, Arab children did not exhibit the out‐group homogeneity effect. Nevertheless, there were indications that religious affiliation, social environment, and group identification affected children's responses.

### Guidelines for psychological practice with older adults [^9070baa3]. The American Psychologist (2014). Medium credibility.

Guideline 6 — diversity in aging and sociocultural factors: Psychologists strive to understand diversity in the aging process, particularly how sociocultural factors such as sex, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, immigration status, sexual orientation, disability status, religion, spirituality, employment status, and urban/ rural residence may influence the experience and expression of health and of psychological problems in later life. Rationale notes that diversity in terms of age cohort, gender identity, race, ethnicity and cultural background, sexual orientation, rural/urban environment, employment status, education and socioeconomic status, and religion, may impact psychological issues experienced by older adults differently, and psychologists endeavor to be aware of the intersectionality of these characteristics of diversity, and that the interplay of these factors may have multiplicative effects on the well-being of older adults, with age noted as a weaker predictor of outcomes than factors such as demographic characteristics, physical health, functional ability, or living situation. Application guidance states to consider the influence of cohort or generational issues when providing psychological services to older adults because each generation has unique historical circumstances that shape that generation's health as well as their collective social and psychological perspectives throughout the lifespan, and that current and emerging cohorts of older adults have generational perspectives that differentiate them from earlier cohorts and those generational perspectives will continue to profoundly influence the experience and expression of health and psychological problems.

Table 2 discriminates the items assessed in the 23 final articles. It was noted that none reached the maximum score of 11 because these studies do not enable the use of 'double-blind' methods. The highest-scoring study at nine points was by McCauley et al. The 'third-party blind' method, which means that the examiner that has no idea of the patient's allocation, was present in four studies. There was uniformity of intensity, duration, frequency and follow-up (items H and J, respectively) in the protocols used.

### Pediatric integrative medicine [^2f84d5eb]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Spirituality and prayer in pediatric care — prevalence, perceived effects, and evidence gaps: Spiritual healing includes prayer and has traditionally been identified as one of the most prevalent complementary therapies in the United States. Eighty-two percent of Americans believe in the healing power of personal prayer, 73% believe that praying for someone else can help cure their illness, and 77% believe that God sometimes intervenes to cure people who have a serious illness. Prayer is used by up to two-thirds of parents for their children. Studies have suggested that spiritual and/or religious beliefs and practices may contribute to decreased stress and increased sense of well-being and enhanced immune system functioning. A large systematic literature review demonstrated that the majority of patients express interest in a discussion of religion and spirituality in the medical visit, and spirituality in health care is especially relevant to children in oncology and palliative care settings. RCTs of the clinical therapeutic effects of prayer in pediatrics are lacking, and national efforts promote use of the FICA Spiritual History tool in clinical care; categories covered include Faith and belief, Importance, Community, and Address in care. Some states have pursued legal measures against parents seeking prayer or spiritual healing as an alternative to conventional medical therapy for children with serious medical problems, such as cancer.

Social determinants of health and health equity — Health equity is defined as when everyone has the opportunity to attain their full health potential and no one is disadvantaged because of social position or other socially determined circumstance, and also as the absence of systematic disparities in health or in the major social determinants of health between groups with different levels of social advantage or disadvantage. Other factors that portend greater obstacles to health include religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, mental health, and physical ability, leading to preventable differences in health status due to discrimination or exclusion. There was expert panel consensus on the importance of addressing social determinants of health and on ensuring that lifestyle medicine recommendations are in alignment with and respectful of the patient's cultural background, and the majority of the expert panel agreed that advocacy for addressing social determinants of health should be considered a part of LM while emphasizing that advocacy responsibilities extend to all medical specialties and components of health care.
