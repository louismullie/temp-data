## Question

What are the causes of SAAG < 0.9?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of SAAG less than 0.9 g/dL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct SAAG threshold and why 0.9 g/dL is being used instead of 1.1 g/dL. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology that explains why low SAAG implies non–portal hypertensive ascites. Next, I will enumerate the major etiologies that consistently produce SAAG less than 1.1 g/dL, and I should double-check which of those also fall under 0.9 g/dL in practice. After that, I need to consider special contexts like cirrhosis with low SAAG, mixed ascites, and pediatric nuances. Finally, I will outline a practical diagnostic approach and synthesize a concise, prioritized list of causes with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the threshold question, because I need to ensure we are using the right cut point. The standard diagnostic cut-off for SAAG is 1.1 g/dL, where SAAG ≥ 1.1 g/dL indicates portal hypertension and SAAG < 1.1 g/dL suggests non–portal hypertensive etiologies; however, some clinicians and studies discuss a stricter cut-off of 0.9 g/dL to increase specificity, even though this is not the universal standard, so I should be explicit about that distinction [^731158dc].

> Now, I will examine the pathophysiology to anchor the differential. Low SAAG ascites reflects ascitic fluid albumin that is relatively close to serum albumin, meaning there is little gradient across the peritoneal membrane; this pattern arises when ascites forms due to peritoneal disease or low oncotic states rather than from sinusoidal hypertension that preferentially leaks low-protein lymph and creates a large albumin gradient, so SAAG < 1.1 g/dL (and by extension < 0.9 g/dL) argues against portal hypertensive mechanisms [^b677b9c5].

> Next, I should review the major etiologies that consistently yield SAAG < 1.1 g/dL, and then verify which of these commonly register below 0.9 g/dL. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is the prototypical cause and often shows low SAAG with high total protein; tuberculous peritonitis likewise produces low SAAG ascites; pancreatic ascites is classically associated with very high amylase and SAAG < 1.1 g/dL; nephrotic syndrome causes ascites via hypoalbuminemia and low oncotic pressure, yielding low SAAG; chylous ascites from lymphatic disruption or malignancy can present with low SAAG; and less common entities like lupus peritonitis and other inflammatory serositides can also produce low SAAG ascites, all of which align with the expectation that SAAG < 0.9 g/dL falls within the non–portal hypertensive spectrum [^731158dc] [^03c26b43] [^52a37e1a] [^d27ce3c5] [^5ae0cc6c] [^8323c3c4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions in cirrhosis. I initially thought SAAG is always high in cirrhosis, but wait, let me verify because that is too absolute. In established cirrhosis, SAAG is usually ≥ 1.1 g/dL, yet a minority of patients with cirrhosis can have low SAAG ascites due to superimposed peritoneal processes such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, peritoneal carcinomatosis, or nephrotic syndrome; importantly, repeating paracentesis can reveal fluctuation back to high SAAG, so a single low SAAG in cirrhosis should prompt careful reassessment rather than a change in the underlying diagnosis of portal hypertension [^e927e1ea] [^731158dc].

> I need to check pediatric nuances as well. In children, SAAG remains highly accurate for distinguishing portal hypertensive from non–portal hypertensive ascites, and the same low-SAAG etiologies apply, including tuberculous peritonitis, pancreatic ascites, chylous ascites, nephrotic syndrome, and malignancy; thus, SAAG < 0.9 g/dL in children points toward the same non–portal hypertensive causes with similar diagnostic implications [^4d02c305].

> Next, I should review a practical diagnostic approach so I don't miss anything. Let me first confirm that serum and ascitic albumin were drawn simultaneously, because timing errors can distort SAAG; then, I should interpret SAAG alongside ascitic total protein, cell count with differential, and culture, and add targeted tests based on suspicion such as cytology for malignancy, ADA for tuberculosis, amylase for pancreatic ascites, and triglycerides for chylous ascites; if the clinical picture conflicts with SAAG, repeating the paracentesis is reasonable, especially in cirrhosis where mixed or evolving processes occur [^a778f084] [^5b8e4e93] [^e927e1ea] [^03c26b43].

> Let me synthesize the causes of SAAG < 0.9 g/dL succinctly, while keeping the threshold caveat in mind. SAAG less than 0.9 g/dL is a subset of low-SAAG ascites and indicates non–portal hypertensive etiologies, with the most common being peritoneal carcinomatosis, tuberculous peritonitis, pancreatic ascites, nephrotic syndrome, and chylous ascites; additional contributors include inflammatory serositides such as lupus peritonitis and, rarely, low SAAG in cirrhosis when superimposed peritoneal disease is present, so this pattern should trigger evaluation for malignancy, infection including tuberculosis, pancreatic disease, renal disease, and lymphatic disorders rather than portal hypertensive therapies [^731158dc] [^a778f084] [^52a37e1a] [^5ae0cc6c] [^e927e1ea].

---

A SAAG less than 0.9 g/dL is rare and indicates **non-portal hypertensive ascites** [^731158dc]. The most common causes are **peritoneal carcinomatosis** [^5f15a3cd], **tuberculous peritonitis** [^5ae0cc6c], and **pancreatic ascites** [^52a37e1a]; other causes include nephrotic syndrome, chylous ascites, and serositis from autoimmune disease [^52a37e1a] [^8323c3c4]. A SAAG < 0.9 g/dL is highly specific for excluding portal hypertension [^notfound] and should prompt evaluation for these etiologies with cytology, ADA, amylase, and imaging [^a778f084].

---

## Pathophysiological basis of SAAG

The SAAG reflects the difference between serum and ascitic albumin and is a surrogate for portal pressure [^b677b9c5]; a SAAG ≥ 1.1 g/dL indicates portal hypertension with ~97% accuracy [^bc0020d0], whereas a SAAG < 1.1 g/dL suggests non-portal causes [^731158dc]. A SAAG < 0.9 g/dL is uncommon and particularly specific for non-portal etiologies [^notfound].

---

## Causes of SAAG < 0.9 g/dL

| **Category** | **Etiology** | **Pathophysiology** |
|-|-|-|
| Malignancy | Peritoneal carcinomatosis | Tumor-lined peritoneum leaks protein-rich fluid, equilibrating albumin and lowering SAAG [^bc0020d0] |
| Infection | Tuberculous peritonitis | Granulomatous inflammation increases peritoneal permeability, raising ascitic albumin and lowering SAAG [^notfound] |
| Pancreatic disease | Pancreatic ascites | Disruption of pancreatic duct leaks enzyme-rich fluid with high protein, lowering SAAG [^52a37e1a] |
| Renal disease | Nephrotic syndrome | Severe hypoalbuminemia reduces the gradient despite normal peritoneal permeability [^1cd2f8ec] |
| Lymphatic disorders | Chylous ascites | Lymphatic obstruction or rupture causes chyle with high protein, lowering SAAG [^bc0020d0] |
| Autoimmune disease | Serositis (e.g. lupus peritonitis) | Inflammatory peritoneal disease increases permeability and ascitic albumin, lowering SAAG [^8323c3c4] |

---

## Clinical implications and diagnostic approach

A SAAG < 0.9 g/dL is highly specific for non-portal ascites and should direct the workup toward malignancy, infection, pancreatic disease, renal disease, lymphatic disorders, or autoimmune serositis [^731158dc]. Recommended steps include:

- **Cytology**: Evaluate for peritoneal carcinomatosis [^4d396c14].
- **ADA and mycobacterial studies**: Assess for tuberculous peritonitis [^5ae0cc6c].
- **Amylase**: Identify pancreatic ascites [^52a37e1a].
- **Triglycerides**: Confirm chylous ascites [^bc0020d0].
- **Imaging**: CT/MRI and targeted biopsies as indicated [^4d396c14].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

While SAAG is highly specific, **confounders** can occasionally lower the gradient, including:

- **Mixed ascites**: Portal hypertension plus peritoneal disease can blunt SAAG [^7fd612f1].
- **Laboratory error**: Non-simultaneous serum/ascitic albumin can misclassify [^4d02c305].
- **Severe hypoalbuminemia**: Very low serum albumin can artifactually reduce SAAG [^notfound].

---

A SAAG < 0.9 g/dL is uncommon and highly specific for non-portal ascites; the leading causes are **peritoneal carcinomatosis**, **tuberculous peritonitis**, and **pancreatic ascites**, with nephrotic syndrome, chylous ascites, and autoimmune serositis also on the list. This should trigger a targeted evaluation for these etiologies rather than portal hypertensive management [^731158dc].

### The utility of evaluating low serum albumin gradient ascites in patients with cirrhosis [^e927e1ea]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) has been used extensively in the diagnostic workup of patients with ascites. A SAAG level of < 1.1 g/dl is usually thought of as a result of nonportal hypertension etiologies, including malignancies, tuberculous peritonitis, and nephrotic syndrome. However, the predictive value of a low SAAG in patients with existing cirrhosis in whom the pretest probability of portal hypertension is high is not clear.

Methods

We identified all patients with a SAAG of < 1.1 g/dl during a 5-year period at a single large veterans affairs medical center. Cirrhosis was defined by clinical, histological, and radiological features. Nonportal hypertension causes of low SAAG were identified, including bacterial peritonitis, peritoneal carcinomatosis, nephrogenous ascites, tuberculous peritonitis, chylous ascites, and pancreatic ascites.

Results

We identified 92 patients (76 with cirrhosis and 16 with no cirrhosis) with ascites and a SAAG of < 1.1 g/dl. Of the 76 patients with cirrhosis, only 29 (38%) had an identifiable cause, most commonly primary bacterial peritonitis (11, 38%), followed by peritoneal carcinomatosis or malignant ascites (8, 28%) and nephrotic syndrome (5, 17%). There were 47 patients with cirrhosis and a low SAAG for whom no etiology was identified. Thirty-three patients underwent a repeat paracentesis, 24 (73%) of whom changed to a high SAAG. On the other hand, the 16 patients with no cirrhosis had significantly lower SAAG (0.66 vs. 0.81), and most (12, 75%) had an identifiable cause of ascites.

Conclusions

Evaluation of a SAAG < 1.1 g/dl in patients with known cirrhosis has low yield and is less likely to be helpful than that in patients without cirrhosis. A repeat paracentesis as part of the workup is recommended. Further studies of low SAAG cutoffs are needed.

### Aetiology and diagnostic utility of serum ascites albumin gradient in children with ascites [^4d02c305]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Ascites in children is multifactorial and serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) ≥ 1.1 helps differentiate portal hypertension (PHTN) related from non-PHTN ascites.

Aims

We evaluated the aetiology and diagnostic accuracy of SAAG in children with ascites.

Methods

Children with ascites were retrospectively evaluated. Etiological diagnosis was based on clinical presentation and investigations. All cases with ascitic fluid analysis and a definite diagnosis were included for calculating the utility of SAAG.

Results

We enrolled 878 children (568[64.7%] boys). Majority were PHTN related (638[72.7%]) and secondary to acute viral hepatitis (98,15.4%), acute liver failure (185,29%), chronic liver disease (276,43.3%) and Budd-Chiari syndrome (79,12.4%). Other causes included tubercular (46,5.2%), pancreatic (32,3.6%), chylous (20,2.3%), biliary (12,1.4%), pseudoascites (16,1.8%), infections (46,5.2%), nephrotic (26,2.9%), malignancy (23,2.6%), cardiac (9,1.0%) and others (10,1%). SAAG (n = 305) correctly differentiated PHTN and non-PHTN ascites in 272 (89.2%) cases, with a high sensitivity (97%), specificity (93%) and diagnostic accuracy (95.8%). Reasons for inaccurate SAAG included mixed ascites (n = 9), different day serum and ascitic fluid albumin estimation (n = 5), serum albumin ≤ 1.1 g/dL (n = 2), chylous ascites (n = 3), hypergammaglobulinemia (n = 1), albumin infusions (n = 1) and unexplained (n = 12).

Conclusions

Nearly 27% children had non-PHTN related ascites. SAAG differentiates PHTN from non-PHTN ascites with a diagnostic accuracy of 95%.

Ascites — initial evaluation includes abdominal ultrasonography with Doppler, complete blood count, liver function tests (INR, serum total bilirubin, serum albumin), renal function tests (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen), serum and urine electrolytes (Na, K) and urine analysis with spot urine protein, and ascitic fluid analysis with serum albumin ascites gradient (SAAG), total protein concentration, polymorphonuclear leukocyte count, and culture. For ascitic fluid interpretation, a serum albumin ascites gradient < 1.1 g/dL suggests other causes of ascites, while a high ascitic fluid protein (> 2.5 g/dL) supports a cardiac source for ascites; other tests of the ascitic fluid, such as amylase, cytology, or culture for mycobacteria, are not routinely indicated but should be guided by the patient's clinical context.

Diagnostic paracentesis in new-onset ascites

Aspiration of ascitic fluid and its laboratory analysis is an essential step in the management of patients with newly diagnosed ascites. In cirrhosis, hepatic sinusoids are less permeable owing to fibrous tissue deposition, resulting in ascites with low protein content. It is important to estimate total protein level in ascites fluid; a concentration below 1.5 g/dL (or 15 g/L) is a risk factor for the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In addition, serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) should be estimated routinely. A cut-off point of 1.1 g/dL (or 11 g/L) differentiates between causes of ascites with high sensitivity, although alternative causes should be considered based on the clinical scenario (table 1).

Table 1
Grouping of aetiology of ascites based on serum albumin ascites gradient (SAAG)

Hepatic sinusoids are normally permeable in heart failure, which allows for leakage of protein-rich lymph into the abdominal cavity and therefore, total protein concentration in ascitic fluid is high (> 2.5 g/dL) in combination with a high SAAG. In such a situation, measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the serum ± ascites is useful. Total protein concentrations > 2.5 g/dL within the ascites and serum BNP > 364 ng/L are suggestive of underlying or additional cardiac disease, whereas serum protein values < 182 ng/L rule out cardiac disease.

In low SAAG states, clinical context and imaging should guide the investigational approach. The yield for positive cytology in the context of malignancy is variable, ranging from 0% to 96.7%, in part determined by the site of the tumour. Combining cytology with tumour markers in the ascitic fluid may increase the positive predictive value (PPV), specifically the use of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), CA 15–3 and CA 19–9. However, CA 125 in the serum or ascites has no role as a discriminator and will commonly be elevated by the presence of ascites from any cause.

Serum albumin ascites gradient (SAAG) interpretation — ascites etiology is stratified by threshold values, with SAAG ≥ 1.1 g/dL reflecting portal hypertension and potential causes including ascites in cirrhosis, ascites related to massive liver metastasis, and ascites related to liver involvement in right heart failure, whereas SAAG < 1.1 g/dL excludes portal hypertension with potential causes including peritoneal carcinomatosis, tuberculous peritonitis, and other clinical conditions.

### Sterile cerebrospinal fluid ascites presenting as high SAAG ascites: a case report [^1cd2f8ec]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Ascites is a common clinical problem for which hepatic cirrhosis represents ~ 80% of all cases, while non-hepatic causes including peritoneal malignancy (12%), cardiac failure (5%), and peritoneal tuberculosis (2%) constitute most of the remaining etiologies. A thorough evaluation, including assessment of the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG), is crucial to identifying the cause of the ascites and implementing an appropriate course of treatment. Low SAAG (< 1.1 g/dL) ascites is most frequently caused by peritoneal malignancy or tuberculosis and can also be caused by nephrotic syndrome, pancreatic ascites, or protein-losing enteropathy. A SAAG of ≥ 1.1 g/dL has been shown to be effective at identifying patients with ascites secondary to sinusoidal portal hypertension. Interestingly, the SAAG has been shown to correlate with hepatic sinusoidal pressure and the threshold of 1.1 g/dL roughly corresponds to a portal pressure gradient of 12 mmHg, the pressure that is thought to be necessary for the development of ascites in patients with cirrhosis. High SAAG ascites can also be the result of other disease processes including cardiac failure, alcoholic hepatitis, and Budd-Chiari syndrome. In this report, we describe a case of high SAAG ascites secondary to sterile cerebrospinal fluid accumulation.

### Management of ascites: expert panel narrative review [^fe731bc3]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ascites can develop in the setting of a variety of pathologies. The approach to treatment depends on accurate determination of the underlying cause, for which fluid analysis plays a central role. In particular, the serum-ascites-albumin gradient serves as a primary diagnostic test for differentiating among causes, with certain additional fluid tests performed based on clinical suspicion. Treatment options range from nonspecific fluid removal, including large-volume paracentesis and tunneled peritoneal catheters, to targeted therapies (e.g., diuretics, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and lymphangiography). Societal guidelines exist for the approach to cirrhotic ascites, but the management of other less common causes remains less well defined. The goal of this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review is to provide guidance for the diagnosis and management of ascites, based on available evidence and the authors' clinical experience.

### Quantitative modeling of the physiology of ascites in portal hypertension [^b677b9c5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

E. Protein concentration in ascitic fluid and the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG)

The model predicts that 1) hepatic lymph protein should be approximately equal to plasma protein (eq. (7)); 2) as the liver sinusoidal pressure is raised, a concomitant rise in intestinal capillary pressure should wash down the protein concentration in the intestinal tissue; and 3) ascitic fluid protein should approximately equilibrate with this washed down intestinal tissue protein (eq. (8)) (which equals intestinal lymph protein). A corollary of predictions 2 and 3 is that as the severity of portal hypertension increases, which causes an increasing intestinal capillary pressure and decreasing intestinal tissue protein, the ascitic fluid protein concentration should also fall. Witte et. al. measured the protein concentration in ascites fluid and hepatic and intestinal lymph in patients in varying stages of ascites. The measured lymph protein/plasma total protein ratios were: control: hepatic = 0.88; intestinal = 0.7; early stage cirrhosis: hepatic = 0.8, intestine = 0.8, ascites = 0.65; late stage: hepatic = 0.6; intestine = 0.12; ascites = 0.17. These experimental observations are in qualitative agreement with the above predictions. An important differential diagnostic marker of ascites is the value of the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). A SAAG of ≥ 1.1 gm% is strongly indicative of portal hypertension (either cirrhotic or cardiac ascites) while all other causes of ascites (e.g. infections, malignancy) tend to have smaller gradients. While the diagnostic accuracy of the SAAG has been demonstrated empirically, the physiology underlying this measurement has received little attention. The values of the SAAG in various conditions follow directly from the assumption in the model that intestinal tissue and ascites fluid have similar albumin concentrations (eq. (8)). In subjects with normal portal pressure these concentrations are high, about 70% of the plasma value, resulting in a low SAAG. In contrast, the increase in intestinal capillary hydrostatic pressure and the accompanying wash down of intestinal interstitial protein produced by portal hypertension of any etiology results in low ascites protein concentrations, hence a high SAAG.

Outpatient management of ascites

The onset of ascites signifies an important stage in cirrhosis evolution: the 2-year and 5-year cumulative mortality after ascites development is 38% and 78%, respectively.

Ascites is a clinical manifestation of portal hypertension related renal dysfunction, leading to sodium and water retention and impaired free water clearance. This presents progressively as ascites, refractory ascites, hyponatraemia and ultimately hepatorenal syndrome.

New-onset ascites should be evaluated to ensure it is related to portal hypertension, including calculating serum albumin gradient (SAAG) where SAAG > 11 g/L is consistent with portal hypertension. In the absence of another clear cause of decompensation, CT scan of the liver to rule out hepatocellular carcinoma or portomesenteric vein thrombosis should be considered. Any significant increase in the volume of ascites, abdominal pain or fever should prompt an ascitic tap with fluid sent for white cell count to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and ascitic fluid culture. A neutrophil count of > 250/mm³ confirms SBP requiring prompt treatment with antibiotics.

### Pancreatic ascites: update on diagnosis and management [^52a37e1a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic paracentesis

Paracentesis is considered the gold standard for diagnosing pancreatic ascites and has a therapeutic effect on patients. The diagnostic criteria for pancreatic ascites include an amylase concentration > 1000 mg/dL, a protein level of > 3 g/dL, and a serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) < 1.1 g/dL. First proposed by Dr. John C. Hoefs in 1981, SAAG can help clinicians determine whether ascites is due to portal hypertension or to other causes. The SAAG is calculated by subtracting the ascitic albumin concentration from the serum concentration. SAAG > 1.1 g/dL is transudative in nature and indicates portal hypertension etiology, which may include cirrhosis, heart failure, portal vein occlusion, Budd-Chiari syndrome and hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. In contrast, an SAAG < 1.1 g/dL is considered exudative, insidious, and often due to peritoneal disease. Common causes include infectious peritonitis, chylous ascites, malignancy, nephrotic syndrome and pancreatic ascites. However, SAAG < 1.1 g/dL alone is not diagnostic for either condition.

Similarly to amylase and albumin levels, lipase enzyme level tends to be elevated in pancreatic ascites. Lactate dehydrogenase is typically elevated in pancreatic ascites; however, it can also be elevated in malignant ascites and tuberculous peritonitis. Tumor markers such as alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, and cancer antigen 125 help rule out peritoneal carcinomatosis and malignancy. Fluid cytology and culture are usually negative in pancreatic ascites, particularly in the absence of abscesses or infected pseudocysts. Pancreatic ascites is typically straw-colored in appearance, although isolated cases of black or bloody ascites have also been reported.

Executive summary of recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis in new- onset ascites 1.1. A diagnostic paracentesis is recommended in all patients with new-onset ascites. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.2. The initial ascitic fluid analysis should include total protein concentration and calculation of the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.3. Ascites fluid analysis for cytology, amylase, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and adenosine deaminase should be considered based on pretest probability of specific diagnosis (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: weak)
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 2.1. Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis SBP) in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.2. A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.3. Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm³ count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.4. Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.5. Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.6. A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.7. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong; Recommendation: strong) 2.8. Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.9. Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Dietary salt restriction 3.1. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should have a moderately salt restricted diet with daily salt intake of no more than 5–6.5 g (87–113 mmol sodium). This translates to a no added salt diet with avoidance of precooked meals. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 3.2. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should receive nutritional counselling on the sodium content in the diet. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Diuretics 4.1. In patients with the first presentation of moderate ascites, spironolactone monotherapy (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) is reasonable. In those with recurrent severe ascites, and if faster diuresis is needed (for example, if the patient is hospitalised), combination therapy with spironolactone (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) and furosemide (starting dose 40 mg, increased to 160 mg) is recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 4.2. All patients initiating diuretics should be monitored for adverse events. Almost half of those with adverse events require diuretic discontinuation or dose reduction. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.3. Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia during diuretic therapy should be managed by discontinuation of diuretics and expansion of plasma volume with normal saline. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.4. Fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day should be reserved for those who are clinically hypervolaemic with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/L). (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.5. Hypertonic sodium chloride (3%) administration should be reserved for those who are severely symptomatic with acute hyponatraemia. Serum sodium should be slowly corrected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.6. It may be appropriate to consider use of midodrine in refractory ascites on a case by case basis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Large volume paracentesis (LVP) 5.1. Patients should give informed consent for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 5.2. Ultrasound guidance should be considered when available during LVP to reduce the risk of adverse events (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 5.3.

### Sterile cerebrospinal fluid ascites presenting as high SAAG ascites: a case report [^5684a03b]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cerebrospinal fluid ascites is a rare complication of ventriculoperitoneal shunting and is the result of infection and subsequent peritonitis in the majority of cases. Sterile cerebrospinal fluid ascites in which no known infectious etiology is identified, is even more unusual.

Case Presentation

A 26-year-old female with Loeys-Dietz syndrome and congenital hydrocephalus treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, was evaluated after developing new-onset ascites of unclear etiology after abdominal surgery for repair of an aortic aneurysm requiring multiple therapeutic paracenteses. Her serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) was greater than 1.1, suggestive of a portal hypertensive etiology. Gram stain as well as multiple cultures of her ascites fluid were both negative. Extensive investigation including hepatic venous portal gradient measurement and liver biopsy revealed no evidence of hepatic disease or portal hypertension. She was ultimately found to have sterile cerebrospinal fluid ascites which was treated successfully with a peritoneovenous shunt.

Conclusion

Sterile cerebrospinal fluid ascites is a rare clinical entity that has only been reported approximately 50 times in the medical literature. In this report, we also highlight it as a rare cause of high SAAG ascites. Moreover, we describe the use of a peritoneovenous shunt as a novel therapeutic option in the management of this condition.

### The role of ascitic fluid viscosity in differentiating the nature of ascites and in the prediction of renal impairment and duration of ICU stay [^33482c33]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) has been used in the classification of ascites for the last 20 years but it has some drawbacks. This study searches for possible correlations between ascitic fluid viscosity and the etiology of ascites, renal impairment, and length of ICU stay.

Materials and Methods

The study was conducted in Zagazig University Hospital, Egypt. It included 240 patients with ascites due to various causes. The patients were divided into two groups: the cirrhotic ascites group, which included 120 patients, and the noncirrhotic ascites group, which included 120 patients. Ascitic patients on medical management with diuretics, antibiotics, paracentesis, and infusion of plasma or albumin were excluded. The laboratory analysis included routine investigations to detect the cause of ascites as well as specific investigations such as ascitic fluid viscosity using a falling ball viscosimeter (microviscosimeter) at 37°C.

Results

The mean ascitic viscosity of patients with SAAG at least 1.1 was 1.16 ± 0.56, which was associated with serum creatinine 1.35 ± 0.52mg/dl and ICU stay of 3.3 ± 1.2 days. In patients with SAAG less than 1.1g/dl, the mean ascitic viscosity was 2.98 ± 0.87, with serum creatinine 2.1 ± 0.56mg/dl and ICU stay of 7.1 ± 1.3 days. Ascitic viscosity can discriminate ascites due to portal hypertension from those associated with nonportal hypertension at a cut-off value of 1.65; it can predict renal impairment in hepatic patients at a cut-off of 1.35 and long ICU stay at a cut-off of 1.995 using receiver operating characteristic analysis.

Conclusion

Ascitic viscosity measurement is rapid, inexpensive, and requires small sample volumes. Ascitic viscosity can discriminate ascites due to portal hypertension from those associated with nonportal hypertension at a cut-off value of 1.65. It can predict renal impairment in hepatic patients at a cut-off of 1.35 and long ICU stay at a cut-off of 1.995.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes in those with primary extrahepatic malignancy and malignant ascites [^bc0020d0]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Among patients with ascites, 85% have evidence of portal hypertension and cirrhosis. Malignancy is the etiology of ascites in approximately 10% of cases. Ascites in the setting of primary extrahepatic solid tumors may occur due to peritoneal seeding, portal hypertension from massive liver metastasis, obstruction of lymphatics, treatment complications, or infiltration of hepatic sinusoids with malignant cells. Peritoneal carcinomatosis appears to cause ascites by producing proteinaceous fluid from tumor cells lining the peritoneum, and extracellular fluid enters the peritoneal cavity to restore the oncotic equilibrium and was reported to account for 53% of malignancy-related ascites in one series. Extrahepatic malignancy with liver metastases may cause ascites due to portal hypertension and is often accompanied by occlusion of hepatic and portal veins by tumor mass effect or tumor thrombosis. Chylous ascites in patients with lymphoma and other malignancies may be caused by lymph node obstruction by tumor and rupture of chyle-containing lymphatics. There may also be multiple etiologies of ascites in the same patient including peritoneal carcinomatosis, hepatic metastasis and cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma. Budd-Chiari syndrome due to an underlying malignancy is another rare etiology accounting for 1% of malignancy related ascites. Multiple chemotherapeutic agents are associated with development of portal hypertension as an idiosyncratic effect including nodular regenerative hyperplasia or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. To evaluate the etiology of ascites, diagnostic paracentesis for analysis of the ascitic fluid to obtain total protein, albumin, triglyceride, cytology, and other laboratory testing and/cultures is performed. The serum albumin ascites gradient (SAAG) may be calculated by subtracting the ascitic fluid albumin from the serum albumin in simultaneously obtained samples. A serum albumin ascites gradient ≥ 1.1 g/dL with ascitic total protein < 2.5 g/dL is highly suggestive of the presence of portal hypertension, typically caused by liver disease with an accuracy of approximately 97%. A serum albumin ascites gradient ≥ 1.1 g/dL with ascitic total protein of > 2.5 g/dL is highly suggestive of a post hepatic sinusoid source of ascites such as ascites due to right heart failure. A serum albumin ascites gradient < 1.1 g/dL suggests other causes of ascites such as peritoneal carcinomatosis, tuberculosis, and other clinical conditions. Chylous ascites is defined as ascitic fluid triglyceride values > 200 mg/dL.

### Serum B-type natriuretic peptide in the initial workup of patients with new onset ascites: a diagnostic accuracy study [^6b1a43ca]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Heart failure (HF) is, after cirrhosis, the second-most common cause of ascites. Serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) plays an important role in the diagnosis of HF. Therefore, we hypothesized that BNP would be useful in the differential diagnosis of ascites. Consecutive patients with new onset ascites were prospectively enrolled in this cross-sectional study. All patients had measurements of serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG), total protein concentration in ascitic fluid, serum, and ascites BNP. We enrolled 218 consecutive patients with ascites resulting from HF (n = 44), cirrhosis (n = 162), peritoneal disease (n = 10), and constrictive pericarditis (n = 2). Compared to SAAG and/or total protein concentration in ascites, the test that best discriminated HF-related ascites from other causes of ascites was serum BNP. A cutoff of > 364 pg/mL (sensitivity 98%, specificity 99%, and diagnostic accuracy 99%) had the highest positive likelihood ratio (168.1); that is, it was the best to rule in HF-related ascites. Conversely, a cutoff ≤ 182 pg/mL had the lowest negative likelihood ratio (0.0) and was the best to rule out HF-related ascites. These findings were confirmed in a 60-patient validation cohort.

Conclusions

Serum BNP is more accurate than ascites analyses in the diagnosis of HF-related ascites. The workup of patients with new onset ascites could be streamlined by obtaining serum BNP as an initial test and could forego the need for diagnostic paracentesis, particularly in cases where the cause of ascites is uncertain and/or could be the result of HF.

### Capillary leak phenotype as a major cause of death in patients with POEMS syndrome [^d98b3606]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Eleven of the 19 patients with terminal CLP had complete medical records available during the treatment of the terminal CLP event. A hallmark feature that this cohort shared was overt anasarca and volume overload without a clear explanation. Common causes of ascites and effusions were evaluated and excluded including cardiac and liver dysfunction (Table 4). Six of 7 patients who underwent echocardiogram during an episode of capillary leak had elevated RVSP (range 40 to 67 mmHg) consistent with pulmonary hypertension with intact left ventricular ejection fraction (range 50% to 69%). Two patients underwent right heart catheterization or Swan-Gantz catheter measurements. Hemodynamic studies showed significant pulmonary hypertension for both patients with pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 59 and 84 mmHg (normal < 20 mmHg). Both patients had normal cardiac output with a cardiac index of 2.5 and 3.67 L/min/m² further supporting that cardiac dysfunction was not the underlying etiology of the volume overload.

Liver dysfunction was considered given the presence of anasarca, ascites, and hypotension, but patients had no evidence of liver nodularity on available imaging or other sequelae of cirrhosis such as esophageal or gastric varices. Peritoneal fluid analysis and serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) were inconsistent. Three patients had SAAG less than 1.1 which would indicate non-portal hypertension, while 3 had SAAG greater than 1.1. No patient met criteria for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis at the time of paracentesis. The ascites was often refractory to diuretic management and 8 patients required repeated paracentesis for symptomatic management.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes in those with primary extrahepatic malignancy and malignant ascites [^1963d42e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

We performed a single-center, electronic database, retrospective analysis of subjects 18 years and older without chronic liver disease who presented with ascites and primary extrahepatic solid tumors including breast cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, and renal cell cancer between 1/1/2000 and 12/31/2019. Patients with history of any chronic liver disease and evidence of cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were excluded from this study. Subjects were identified via the Stanford Research Repository (STARR) Tools (aka STRIDE-web) of Stanford University electronic data warehouse. Data was fully anonymized after data extraction. Data abstracted included demographic information (age, sex, race), tumor type, serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG), ascites total protein (TP) level and cytology, abdominal imaging reports, culture results, and ascites treatment regimen. Causes of ascites were categorized as reflecting portal hypertension (PH, SAAG ≥ 1.1 g/dL), with or without elevated total protein that could reflect sinusoidal portal hypertension (SPH, SAAG ≥ 1.1 g/dL and TP < 2.5 g/dL), peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC, SAAG < 1.1 g/dL and TP > 2.5 g/dL), or chylous ascites (ascites fluid triglyceride > 200 mg/dl). Evidence of liver metastases, pericardial disease, and pulmonary hypertension were also captured as was exposure to chemotherapeutic agents known to cause non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. We examined outcomes by the presence or absence of liver metastases and by classification of ascites fluid. Statistical analysis was conducted using RStudio version 1.1.463. Shapiro–Wilk test was used to test normality of continuous variables, two-sample t-test was used to compare normally distributed continues variables, Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare continuous variables that were not normally distributed. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test. Survival analysis was assessed with Kaplan–Meier method with differences in survival probabilities measured by log-rank testing.

### Quantitative modeling of the physiology of ascites in portal hypertension [^11a8537b]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

The protein concentration in ascitic peritoneal fluid in portal hypertension is low, roughly equal to the protein concentration of intestinal lymph. There is a definite "capillarization" of liver sinusoids in cirrhosis and some authors have suggested that the ascites protein is roughly equal to the low liver tissue protein produced by this capillarization. However, even in severe cirrhosis sinusoidal fenestra are still present and the liver lymph protein/plasma ratio (which is a measure of tissue protein) is about 0.6, much greater than the corresponding ascites protein ratio of 0.17. Furthermore, this liver lymph protein/plasma ratio of 0.6 may underestimate the liver tissue protein because of lymphatic contributions from peribiliary capillaries and admixture from intestinal lymph. An alternative explanation for this low ascites protein, which is directly supported by our quantitative model (Section III), is that the high protein fluid leaking from the liver pulls fluid osmotically from the "intestinal" tissue space (eq. (4)), diluting the peritoneal fluid protein until it roughly equals the intestinal tissue protein concentration. This implies that the rate of formation of ascitic fluid is determined primarily by two factors: the rate of protein leak from the liver and the interstitial protein concentration of the intestine, a concept alluded to in the older literature but seldom discussed in recent reviews of ascites. This mechanism provides a straight forward explanation for use of the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) in the differential diagnosis of ascites (see Section IIE).

Since the ascites protein concentration in portal hypertension is only about 1/3 of that of the fluid leaking from the liver, the bulk of ascitic fluid is derived from the intestine rather than the liver. This fluid movement from the intestine into the peritoneum continues as long as the liver continues to leak protein. Homeostasis is achieved when the rising ascitic pressure (P A) increases the rate of peritoneal lymph and protein drainage until it equals the rate at which protein leaks from the liver. Although it has been hypothesized that increased ascites pressure (P A) should slow the rate of liver leak, as is discussed below, this should be a small to negligible effect because an increase in P A should produce a proportional increase in P L. The crucial parameter characterizing the rate of leakage of fluid from the liver is the value of (P L - P A). Experimental measurements of this parameter are discussed in the next section.

### Sterile cerebrospinal fluid ascites presenting as high SAAG ascites: a case report [^5d15df04]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

The SAAG is widely used to help elucidate the etiology of ascites. Ascites due to portal hypertension is characterized by a SAAG of ≥ 1.1 g/dL, and the ascitic fluid total protein is subsequently used to further differentiate the various causes of ascites in patients with a high SAAG. Cirrhosis represents the most common cause of high SAAG ascites, but constrictive pericarditis, congestive heart failure, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and alcoholic hepatitis are also diagnostic considerations. Sterile CSF ascites is a rare complication of ventriculoperitoneal shunting and to date, there have been approximately 50 cases reported in the English literature. Of these, only four, including our own, report either a paired serum albumin and ascites albumin or a SAAG (Table 1). In each of these cases, the SAAG is also reported to be ≥ 1.1 g/dL. Our case corroborates that CSF ascites is within the differential diagnosis of high SAAG ascites. The pathophysiology of the high SAAG in patients with sterile CSF ascites remains speculative but likely reflects the inherently low albumin content in sterile CSF fluid as a result of the blood-CSF barrier and the absence of de novo albumin synthesis in the central nervous system.

Published cases of CSF ascites with reported SAAG values

Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder first described in 2005, characterized by aortic aneurysms, generalized arterial tortuosity, hypertelorism, and cleft palate. LDS has been described due to mutations in the transforming growth factor β I (TGFBR1), transforming growth factor β II (TGFBR2), transforming growth factor β 2 ligand gene (TGFB2), and the decapentaplegic homolog 3 (SMAD3). Clinical complications of LDS are primarily a result of vascular complications including aortic dissection and aneurysmal rupture, which often require aortic surgery as was the case in our patients. Gastrointestinal complications including constipation as well as higher prevalence of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease have been reported, but hepatic complications specifically related to LDS have not been reported.

### Is albumin gradient or fluid to serum albumin ratio better than the pleural fluid lactate dehydroginase in the diagnostic of separation of pleural effusion? [^c0fb9d4e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

To determine the accuracy of serum-effusion albumin gradient (SEAG) and pleural fluid to serum albumin ratio (ALBR) in the diagnostic separation of pleural effusion into transudate and exudate and to compare SEAG and ALBR with pleural fluid LDH (FLDH) the most widely used test.

Methods

Data collected from 200 consecutive patients with a known cause of pleural effusion in a United Kingdom district general hospital.

Results

The median and inter quartile ranges (IQR) for SEAG 93.5 (33.8 to 122.5) g/dl, ALBR 0.49 (0.42 to 0.62) and FLDH 98.5 IU/L(76.8 to 127.5) in transudates were significantly lower than the corresponding values for exudates 308.5 (171 to 692), 0.77 (0.63 to 0.85), 344 (216 to 695) all p < 0.0001. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals (Cl) for SEAG, ALBR and FLDH were 0.81 (0.75 to 0.87), 0.79 (0.72 to 0.86) and 0.9 (0.87 to 0.96) respectively. The positive likelihood ratios with 95%CI for FLDH, SEAG, and ALBR were: 7.3(3.5–17), 6.3(3–15) 6.2(3–14) respectively. There was a significant negative correlation between SEAG and ALBR (r = -0.89, p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

The discriminative value for SEAG and ALBR appears to be similar in the diagnostic separation of transudates and exudates. FLDH is a superior test compared to SEAG and ALBR.

### Possible use of 2D shear wave liver elastography in new-onset ascites evaluation [^7fd612f1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ascites means the appearance of free fluid in the abdominal cavity. The most common processes involved in its occurrence are portal hypertension (PH) and peritoneal membrane disease. In the Western population, the most common cause of ascites is PH, which is due to cirrhosis in most cases. The clinically relevant ascites division is based on the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) determination, which biochemically divides ascites into exudate and transudate. While albumin-rich ascites (exudate) is due to inflammatory and/or neoplastic causes, ascites due to PH is a transudate characterized by SAAG values ≥ 11 g/L; this value has more than 97% accuracy in differentiating portal hypertensive causes from other causes. However, several etiologies may be present simultaneously (mixed ascites), which complicates differential diagnosis. The most common causes of ascites are portal hypertension, neoplastic causes and inflammatory causes, or pancreatic ascites.

In particular, it is clinically very important to rapidly classify ascites into benign (mostly due to PH) and malignant (due to peritoneal carcinomatosis); more than 90% of new-onset ascites cases belong to one of these two etiologies. In the presence of ascites, findings typical of cirrhosis such as morphological changes and PH-specific signs such as the presence of portosystemic collaterals (Table 2) can be used to postulate PH as the etiology. Imaging signs of cirrhosis and PH have high inclusion and low exclusion value.

Liver elastography is commonly used to further improve the cirrhosis and PH diagnosis. According to the Baveno VII consensus conference, the presence of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) in patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD) can be reliably ruled out by liver elastography when the elastographic value is < 15 kPa and platelet count > 150 × 10⁹ per nanoliter of blood. The confirmatory threshold of elastography for CSPH in the most common cACLD etiologies is > 25 kPa, and from 15 kPa onward, the probability of CSPH presence slowly increases. 2D shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) is a well validated method in this field. In two studies performed in a subset of patients with cirrhosis with or without ascites, 2D-SWE showed a significantly positive correlation with invasively evaluated portal pressure.

Our study included 34 patients (65%) with new-onset ascites with SAAG ≥ 11 g/L (Group 1). In these cases, cirrhosis and accompanying PH has been confirmed. Etiology of cirrhosis was due to harmful alcohol consumption (20 patients) and metabolically-induced steatohepatitis (8 patients) or a combination of both conditions. Cirrhosis was due to chronic HCV infection and primary biliary cholangitis in two patients.

Group 2 included 18 patients (35%) with new-onset ascites with SAAG < 11 g/L; ascites was due to cancer in 13 patients (25%) and in all cases with cytologically confirmed peritoneal carcinomatosis. Causes of peritoneal carcinomatosis included: upper and lower gastrointestinal cancer (four patients), ovarian cancer (three patients), pancreatic cancer (three patients), breast cancer (two patients), and primary peritoneal cancer (one patient). The remaining five patients (10%) had pancreatogenic ascites (two patients), tuberculosis (one patient), obscure cause (one patient), and immune-mediated ascites (one patient). To evaluate the presence of sinusoidal PH, three patients in Group 2 (5% of the total cohort) underwent an HVPG assessment. A total of 27 patients (52%) were deceased by the end of the study.

### Differentiation of exudate from transudate ascites based on the dipstick values of protein, glucose, and pH [^604c72de]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of present study was to determine the reliability of the dipstick values (protein, glucose, and pH) for differentiation of exudate from transudate ascites in comparison with the serum-ascites albumin gradient as criterion standard. A total of 100 patients with ascites (58 males and 42 females; mean age, 55.6 ± 16.1 years) were studied for the different causes of ascites. Peripheral blood samples were obtained, and at the same time, the patients underwent paracentesis. There were 62 cases (62.0%) of transudate ascites and 38 (38.0%) of exudates ascites, based on serum-ascites albumin gradient. Using logistic regression, we found a dipstick equation (K = 0.012Protein - 0.012Glucose - 3.329pH + 23.498) to differentiate transudate (K < 0) from exudate (K > 0) ascites. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of dipstick equation to diagnose ascites as transudate and exudate were 93.8%, 94.4%, 96.8%, and 89.5%, respectively, and 94.4%, 93.9%, 89.5%, and 96.9%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.915 (95% confidence interval, 0.848–0.982; P < .001). We concluded that the dipstick can be an inexpensive, rapid, and simple option for categorizing ascites into transudate and exudate and can be used routinely for this purpose in clinical practice.

Ascites analysis

Since ascites is the most common clinical presentation of PAs-induced HSOS, some of the patients received abdominal paracentesis and the results of ascitic fluid analysis were collected. Firstly, we analyzed ascitic fluid total protein (AFTP) and serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). Ascitic fluid total protein (AFTP) belonged to transudate (< 25 g/L) in 74.64% of the patients;100% of the patients had a high SAAG (≥ 11.0 g/L) (Table 3). Secondly, an ascitic fluid cell count and differential were analyzed. An ascitic fluid WBC counts was 134.11 ± 135.62; 100% of the PAs-induced HSOS patients had an ascitic polymorphonuclear (PMN) less than 0.25 × 10⁹/L, which indicated that no ascitic fluid infection occurred in the patients (Table 3). Finally, 41 cases received cytological examination of ascites. The results revealed that lymphocyte and mesothelial cells were main findings in the patients (Table 3). However, only 8 patient with BCS received ascitic fluid analysis in our study and the results of three samples were available, thus the results of ascitic fluid analysis in BCS patients was not shown in our study.

### Is serum-ascites vitamin D gradient a valid marker for diagnosing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhotic ascites? [^304fb19e]. Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is considered the paradigmatic model of infection in patients with liver cirrhosis. Therefore, there is a need for an accurate and rapid method for SBP diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of serum-ascites 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH vitamin D) gradient (SADG) as a marker for diagnosing SBP in patients with cirrhotic ascites.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional analytic study of 88 patients with portal hypertensive ascites resulting from liver cirrhosis of any etiology. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the patients were recorded. The level of 25-OH vitamin D in serum and ascitic fluid was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography autoanalyzer. The SADG was calculated with the formula: 25-OH vitamin D in serum - 25-OH vitamin D in ascites.

Results

Vitamin D deficiency was detected in 89.8% of the studied patients. The SADG values ranged between 0 and 69.2 ng/mL, with a median value of 5.58 ng/mL. It was significantly lower in patients with SBP than in those without SBP (P = 0.004). The area under the curve for SADG in exclusion of SBP was 0.67 at a cutoff value of ≥ 5.57 ng/mL.

Conclusion

We found that SADG may be a valid marker of SBP in patients with cirrhotic ascites.

### Laboratory investigation of peritoneal fluids: an updated practical approach based on the available evidence [^3bda89bf]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Even though analysis of peritoneal fluids (PF) is often requested to medical laboratories for biochemical and morphological tests, there is still no mutual agreement on what the most appropriate way is to manage PF samples and which tests should be appropriately executed. In this update, we tried to identify the most useful tests for PF analysis to establish best practice indications. We performed a literature review and examined available guidelines to select the most appropriate tests by an evidence-based approach. Accordingly, the basic PF profile should include (1) serum to effusion albumin gradient and (2) automated cell counts with differential analysis. This profile allows to determine the PF nature, differentiating between 'high-albumin gradient' and 'low-albumin gradient' effusions, which helps to identify the pathophysiological process causing the ascites formation. Restricted to specific clinical situations, additional tests can be requested as follows: PF lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glucose, to exclude (LDH) or confirm (glucose) secondary bacterial peritonitis; PF total protein, to differentiate ascites of cardiac origin from other causes; PF (pancreatic) amylase, for the identification of pancreatic ascites; PF bilirubin, when a choleperitoneum is suspected; PF triglycerides, in differentiating chylous from pseudochylous ascites and PF creatinine, to detect intraperitoneal urinary leakage.

### Possible use of 2D shear wave liver elastography in new-onset ascites evaluation [^cdc5f9af]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study's calculated 14 kPa cut-off value had an appropriate exclusion value for identifying patients with ascites not due to PH, especially in the patient group with peritoneal carcinomatosis resulting from metastatic cancer. Together with some other study data in this area – elastography can provide additional non invasive diagnostic information.

Although the analysis was performed in a minimal number of patients, the 2D-SWE exclusion value determining the cause of ascites in groups other than liver cirrhosis or peritoneal carcinomatosis appears to be less accurate, especially in cases where etiologic differentiation was difficult and required extensive and invasive diagnostic work-up. A study by Bota et al. met similar findings. Furthermore, 2D-SWE does not provide sufficient information on mixed ascites, where paracentesis is always required for a definitive determination. The same applies to the cytological pattern analysis and inflammatory process evaluation in ascites.

Our study used SAAG, a commonly used sum in this field, to divide the ascites cause. A study on several patients by Li et al. used a serum ascites cholesterol gradient (SACG) to determine the cause of ascites. SACG proved to be comparable to SAAG in the PH ascites group and more sensitive in differentiating the cause in the mixed ascites and non-PH ascites group but was not evaluated in our study.

Regarding the 2D-SWE measurement using MyLab Nine and its clinical applicability, our study shows about an 85% success rate in performing reliable measurements. This percentage is significantly lower than those reported in studies that evaluated liver cACLD cohorts (typically > 90 or even 95% applicability). There are several reasons for this finding. In our study, the elastographic measurement was performed exclusively in patients with ascites. According to some studies, ascites should not significantly affect the elastographic result quality. On the other hand, according to Zhang et al. it had a significant effect on both reliability and measurement quality, showing a similar effect on the end result as ROI size, with which the authors of our study agree.

### Gall bladder wall thickening as non-invasive screening parameter for esophageal varices-a comparative endoscopic-sonographic study [^7ed2788d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

A small Chinese study showed a correlation between portal vein velocity and GBWT supporting the hypothesis that GBWT could also predict the presence of EV. From a pathophysiological point of view, GBWT may be a microcirculatory driven event caused by impaired portalvenous outflow before significant changes in portal vein velocity occur. However, the development of GBWT may also be caused by other factors such as the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG).

Several studies have investigated non-invasive parameters as predictors for the presence of EV. A platelet count to spleen diameter ratio of 909 and less was associated with EV. The enlarged spleen is caused by portal hypertension and low platelets were also associated with a lowered thrombopoetin serum level due to reduced liver function. Chen performed a meta-analysis to confirm the usefulness of this ratio and calculated a summative sensitivity of the ratio of 84% with a specificity of 78% to predict EV. The sensitivity of this ratio was also influenced by etiology of the liver disease with a sensitivity of 92% in viral liver cirrhosis. Using the platelet count to spleen diameter ratio as previously described, the sensitivity was somewhat lower with our dataset. The reasons might be the greater variety of causes for liver disease in our cohort than in previous evaluations. Another non-invasive method is the use of computed tomography (CT) imaging with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 72% for the detection of EV. The higher sensitivity is traded against higher costs, exposure to irradiation, and the use of contrast agents. Other non-invasive measurements such as liver stiffness measurements are promising but further studies need to be performed. Meta-analysis of data so far collected by using transient elastography (FibroScan®) showed lower prognostic values for liver stiffness. A meta-analysis of studies using different modes of elastography techniques to measure spleen stiffness showed heterogeneous results to detect EV. The sensitivity of liver stiffness was 84% in predicting any varices, compared to 78% using the stiffness of the spleen as parameter. The specificity of the spleen stiffness was higher when compared to liver stiffness (76% versus 62%). The use of capsule endoscopy to detect EV is also discussed in the literature but high costs and its semi-invasive nature need to be kept in mind. Because of those limitations of the aforementioned non-invasive methods, the use of GBWT could represent a novel and feasible clinical marker for the detection of EV.

Case presentations

Case 1

A 48-year-old male presented with melena of 2 days duration. He was diagnosed to have idiopathic EHPVO at the age of 14 years and had undergone multiple endotherapies and later splenectomy at the age of 15 years. At admission the vitals were stable and physical examination was normal except for pallor and the presence of abdominal scar. On the fourth day of admission the patient developed fever with abdominal pain and mild abdominal distension due to ascites. Hemogram revealed; hemoglobin 6.1 g/dL, total leukocyte count 6500 cells/mm³, platelet count 3.56 lakhs/mm³, mean corpuscular volume 65.2 fL and International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.04. Doppler ultrasound abdomen revealed normal liver, multiple tortuous collaterals replacing portal vein and moderate ascites. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed mucosal tags in the esophagus (post endotherapy), single column of grade 1 esophageal varix and severe portal hypertensive gastropathy. Ascitic fluid analysis revealed a total leukocyte count of 2400 cells/mm³, polymorphonuclear cell count of 1680 cells/mm³, with ascitic fluid protein 1.9 g/dL, albumin 0.8 g/dL and serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) 2.3. Culture of ascitic fluid yielded heavy growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli) species.

### Acute gross painless transudative ascites in a patient with lupus [^b37706f6]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Gross ascites is a rare presentation of lupus. Ascites in lupus may be due to lupus peritonitis or secondary to one of the complications including nephrotic syndrome. The ascites due to lupus peritonitis has been described as exudative with a serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) below 11 g/L, unless associated with nephrotic syndrome. We report an unusual case of lupus ascites in a 23-year-old woman who presented with acute painless gross ascites with no constitutional, skin or musculoskeletal symptoms of a lupus flare. The ascites was a transudate with SAAG above 11 g/L with no associated nephrotic syndrome. She was treated with corticosteroids, mycophenolate mofetil and diuretics with a good response and no recurrence of her ascites.

### Quantitative modeling of the physiology of ascites in portal hypertension [^66301fb4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 2 shows the steady state peritoneal volume (top), protein concentration (middle) and lymph flow as the P HVPG varies from 6 mm Hg (the pressure when liver exudation starts) to 25 mm Hg. At a gradient of 18.15 mm Hg, there is shift between the low pressure domain where P HV = P RA + 2, and the high ascitic pressure domain where P HV = P A (eq. (23)). The ascites protein concentration is expressed in terms of its equivalent colloid osmotic pressure. (For a normal subject with P HVPG = 2, P A = 2, P RA = 2, P HV = 4, the osmotic activity of the steady state ascites protein concentration should be about 20 mm Hg.) The ascites protein stays in a rather narrow range, falling from about 11 mm Hg when the ascites fluid begins to form, to a minimum of about 7 mm Hg at P HVPG of 18 mm Hg and then slowly rising to about 8 mm Hg. Assuming an albumin/total protein fraction of 0.65, these values correspond to albumin concentrations of about 2.5, 1.75 and 1.95 gm% respectively. For the assumed plasma colloid osmotic pressure of 25 mm Hg (albumin concentration of 4.45 gm%), these values correspond to a SAAG of 1.95, 2.75 and 2.5 gm%. The fall in ascites protein results from the wash down of intestinal tissue protein as the capillary blood pressure increases. At high P HVPG the leak of high protein fluid from the liver makes a relatively greater contribution to the total ascitic fluid formation, producing the increase in the ascitic protein concentration.

### Sterile cerebrospinal fluid ascites presenting as high SAAG ascites: a case report [^15fefe2d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Our case is also notable for the successful use of a Denver shunt in the management of CSF ascites, which has not been previously reported. Denver shunts have been successfully used in the management of portal hypertensive and malignant ascites and rely on the principle that ascites flows down a pressure gradient from the peritoneal cavity into the central venous circulation. Backflow of blood is prevented through the use of a one-way valve chamber that lies in the subcutaneous tissue that can be compressed to promote flow and avoid blockage. Complications include infection, blockage, venous thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In the literature, CSF ascites has been treated primarily with conversion of the existing VP shunt to a VA shunt. Our case demonstrates that the use of a Denver shunt may be a safe and viable alternative treatment modality to VA shunting for this condition.

In this report, we characterize sterile cerebrospinal fluid ascites as a rare cause of high SAAG ascites, highlighting the need for clinician awareness for this rare entity in the differential diagnosis of ascites. Moreover, we describe the use of a peritoneovenous shunt for the first time as a novel and viable therapeutic option in the management of this condition.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes in those with primary extrahepatic malignancy and malignant ascites [^87d9a55b]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Low SAAG ascites has been reported to be caused by peritoneal carcinomatosis in addition to tuberculous peritonitis, nephrotic syndrome, and pancreatitis. We identified 20/241 (8%) subjects with low SAAG and low total protein, and all had evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis on cytology and or imaging. Low SAAG ascites has been reported in up to 20% of those with malignant ascites in prior reports and in our cohort, the serum albumin levels were low in our cohort (median 1.99, IQR 1.83–2.13). In our cohort, the diagnostic accuracy of high ascites fluid total protein in diagnosing PC was 75%, similar to prior studies.

Interestingly, evidence of portal hypertension was present in 33% of subjects with no liver metastases and 24% of subjects with liver metastases with pancreatic cancer being the most common malignancy in subjects with ascites due to portal hypertension at 23%. Significantly more subjects with renal cell cancer had high SAAG ascites (13/69; 19%) compared to (11/150; 7%) in the PC group with just 3/13 subjects receiving azathioprine, oxaliplatin, trastuzumab, or emtansine, all therapies associated with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. In our retrospective series, chemotherapy or immunotherapy alone was the most common management approach for the ascites in subjects with evidence of portal hypertension 23/69 (33.3%). No liver biopsies were performed in the subjects without liver metastases group to determine if sinusoidal infiltration of tumor, nodular regenerative hyperplasia or other etiology was present nor were hepatic venous pressure measurements performed. We noted limited use of diuretic therapies in those with high SAAG ascites (11%), though diuretics should be a first line consideration in this subgroup. There are limitations to our study. We reported a single center and retrospective data without a standardized approach. Not all diagnostic tests were done in all subjects. No liver biopsies or pressure measurements were performed to explain or confirm the findings of portal hypertension.

SAAG and 2D-SWE relationship

Spearman's analysis of the SAAG values correlation with the following variables was performed: LSM, depth of measurement, platelet count, ALT, and bilirubin. A positive association with LSM (rho = 0.55, 95% CI 0.31–0.72, P < 0.001), a negative association with platelet counts (rho = − 0.4, 95% CI -0.6–0.13, P = 0.005) and a positive association with bilirubin level (rho = 0.52, 95% CI 0.28–0.69, P = P < 0.001) were demonstrated (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Relationship between trombocytes, LSM and SAAG according to Spearman's analysis. LSM – liver stiffness measurement. SAAG – serum ascites albumin gradient. kPa – kilopascals. nL – nanoliter

SAAG ≥ 11 g/L showed a significant association with LSM (OR 1.15 (1.07–1.27); 95% confidence interval; p = 0.001). The LSM distribution in Group 1 was significantly higher than in Group 2 (p < 0.001, confirmed after adjustment for age and gender). Therefore, in the final analysis, we performed a ROC analysis predicting the LSM cut-off value when SAAG ≥ 11 g/L. The calculated cut-off value was 14.4 kPa (94% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, 83% specificity). In Group 1, the mentioned value defined all included patients (34 true positives, 0 false negatives). In Group 2, the mentioned value correctly defined 15 patients (15 true negatives, 3 false positives). The three false positive patients in Group 2 were patients who required invasive diagnostic evaluation (HVPG and transjugular liver biopsy) for a definitive diagnosis. The final diagnosis in these 3 cases were: extramedullary erythropoiesis in a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia, porto-sinusoidal vascular disease (idiopathic PH) in 1 case, and ascites due to persistent leakage from the pancreatic duct injury in 1 case. The first two patients had SAAG < 11 g/L although we would expect it to be othervise. The clear reason behind the lower than expected SAAG value could not be recognized.

### Biochemical analysis of soft tissue infectious fluids and its diagnostic value in necrotizing soft tissue infections: a 5-year cohort study [^cd983dd4]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Based on biochemical markers identified in published studies, several criteria have been developed to effectively differentiate exudative from transudative fluids. Light's criteria, developed by Dr. Richard Light in 1972, are used to differentiate transudates and exudates through biochemical analysis. They are known for their high sensitivity (97.5%) and acceptable specificity (80%) for detecting exudative pleural effusion. Light's criteria have also been applied to evaluate other EBFs such as pericardial fluid and ascites to distinguish exudative from transudative body fluids. The serum-ascites albumin gradient is another parameter used to categorize ascites more effectively than the exudate-transudate concept. A low gradient (< 1.1 g/dL) indicates that the causes of ascites are not related to increased portal pressure and significantly reduces the likelihood ratio (LR = 0.06, 95% confidence interval = 0.02–0.20) of portal hypertension compared with bacterial peritonitis. These criteria are widely used for various extravascular body fluids, but their diagnostic performance and optimal cutoff points can vary depending on the type of specimen, such as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and ascites. In this study, these EBF criteria were applied to soft tissue infectious fluids to differentiate NSTIs from non-necrotizing SSTIs, and the optimal cutoff points were calculated. The results demonstrated that several criteria provided excellent-to-outstanding diagnostic discrimination for NSTI. Further research is required to validate these findings.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes in those with primary extrahepatic malignancy and malignant ascites [^056a87b9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study evaluated and characterized ascites in subjects with primary extrahepatic solid tumors including breast cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer and renal cell cancer. The most common etiology of ascites was peritoneal carcinomatosis based on fluid analysis (62%) or cytology/imaging (79%). Similar to our data, a prior study of 45 patients reported 53% of malignancy-related ascites was due to peritoneal carcinomatosis also across a broad range of malignancies. High SAAG with high total protein accounted for 29% of subjects with malignancy and ascites. Among the patients with high SAAG suggesting noncirrhotic portal hypertension based on ascites fluid analysis, 67% had evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis on cytology or imaging suggesting that multiple mechanisms are contributing to the development of ascites. Interestingly, 9% had low SAAG and low ascites fluid total protein levels with no evidence of nephrotic syndrome, pancreatic ascites, tuberculous peritonitis, or serositis. The median serum albumin level in this group was low 1.99 g/dl (IQR 1.8–2.03) likely as a reflection of cachexia and other factors and may explain the low SAAG findings.

### Does this patient have bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension? How do I perform a paracentesis and analyze the results? [^854551e9]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Context

Abdominal paracenteses are performed in patients with ascites, most commonly to assess for infection or portal hypertension and to manage refractory ascites.

Objectives

To systematically review evidence for paracentesis methods that may decrease risk of adverse events or improve diagnostic yield and to determine the accuracy of ascitic fluid analysis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension.

Data Sources

Relevant English-language studies from Medline (1966-April 2007) and EMBASE (1980-April 2007).

Study Selection

Paracentesis studies evaluating interventions (use of preprocedure coagulation parameters, needle type, insertion location, ultrasound guidance, bedside inoculation into blood culture bottles, and use of plasma expanders in therapeutic taps) for reducing adverse events or improving the diagnostic yield, and studies assessing the accuracy of ascitic fluid biochemical analyses for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension.

Data Extraction

For technique studies, data on intervention and outcome; and for diagnostic studies, data on parameters for diagnosing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and portal hypertension (ie, ascitic fluid white blood cell and polymorphonuclear leukocyte [PMN] count, ascitic fluid pH, blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient, and serum-ascites albumin gradient).

Data Synthesis

Thirty-seven studies met inclusion criteria: 2 showed that obtaining preprocedure coagulation was likely unnecessary prior to paracentesis; 1 showed the 15-gauge, 3.25-inch needle-cannula results in less multiple peritoneal punctures [P = 0.05] and termination due to poor fluid return [P = 0.02] vs a 14-gauge needle in therapeutic paracentesis; 1 showed immediate inoculation of culture bottles improves diagnostic yield vs delayed (from 77% to 100% [95% CI for the difference, 5.3%-40.0%]); 9 evaluated therapeutic paracentesis, performed with or without albumin or nonalbumin plasma expanders, and found no consistent effect on morbidity or mortality; 16 showed the accuracy of biochemical analysis of ascitic fluid in patients suspected of having spontaneous bacterial peritonitis to increase the likelihood of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (PMN count > 250 cells/microL [summary likelihood ratio {LR}, 6.4] 95% CI, 4.6–8.8; ascitic fluid leukocyte count > 1000 cells/microL [summary LR, 9.1] 95% CI, 5.5–15.1; pH < 7.35 [summary LR, 9.0] 95% CI, 2.0–40.6; or a blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient ≥ 0.10 [LR, 11.3] 95% CI, 4.3–29.9) and other levels lowered the likelihood (PMN count ≤ 250 cells/microL [summary LR, 0.2] 95% CI, 0.11–0.37; or a blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient < 0.10 [summary LR, 0.12] 95% CI, 0.02–0.77); and 4 showed the diagnostic accuracy of the serum-ascites albumin gradient lowers the likelihood of portal hypertension (< 1.1 g/dL [summary LR, 0.06] 95% CI, 0.02–0.20).

Conclusions

Ascitic fluid should be inoculated into blood culture bottles at the bedside. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is more likely at predescribed parameters of ascitic PMN count or blood-ascitic fluid pH, and portal hypertension is less likely below a predescribed serum-ascites albumin gradient.

Data is presented as mean ± standard deviation, or median, range, and interquartile range or n/total (%).

Paracentesis

Fifty paracenteses in 50 patients were analyzed. The median amount of ascites removed was 5.99 L (range, 0.49–17.06; IQR 3.33–7.68 L). Within the 6 hours follow up after paracentesis, a median amount of 100 mL (range, 0–500 mL; IQR, 0–200 mL) of 20% human albumin and a median volume of 350 mL (range, 0–830 mL; IQR, 203–565 mL) crystalloid infusions were administered.

Serum and ascites protein levels

The serum protein values within 72 hours before (median, 5.2 g/dL; range, 3.8–7.1 g/dL; IQR, 4.8–5.9 g/dL) and 72 hours after (median, 5.4 g/dL; range, 3.7–6.6 g/dL; IQR, 4.5–5.7 g/dL) paracentesis were available in 34/50 (68%) patients. The difference was statistically not significant (p = 0.068). Data for calculating the serum ascites protein gradient (SAPG) were available for 39/50 (78%) patients. Median SAPG was 4.1 (range, 2.5–6.5; IQR, 3.3–4.8).

### Quantitative modeling of the physiology of ascites in portal hypertension [^adf08fe5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Although the above discussion is focused primarily on cirrhotic ascites, cardiac ascites is also associated with a SAAG of ≥ 1.1 gm%. In a series of patients with chronic hepatopathy (68% with ascites), the average value of the free hepatic vein pressure was 17 mm Hg, with a P HVPG of 2 mm Hg. Thus, the liver sinusoidal pressure is about 18 mm Hg which, presumably, results in rupture of liver lymphatics and leakage of protein into the peritoneal space. The corresponding intestinal capillary pressure is about 22 mm Hg (3 mm Hg greater than portal vein pressure) which should wash down intestinal tissue albumin to a low value. Osmotic equilibration of the ascitic albumin with this intestinal tissue results in a large SAAG.

F. Medical treatment of ascites

Given the widespread use of diuretics to treat ascites, it is surprising that the mechanism of benefit of these drugs has received little attention. The challenge is relating the systemic effects of diuretics (alterations in blood pressure, blood volume, systemic resistance and capacitance, etc.) to the two local primary factors that determine ascites volume in the above model: 1) protein leak from the liver surface as a result of increased (P L - P A) and 2) intra-abdominal lymph drainage. In this section we will compare the hemodynamic actions of diuretics that alleviate ascites, with the actions of a number of other drugs that have been evaluated for potential utility in the treatment of portal hypertension

Table 1 summarizes the reported hemodynamic changes produced by 15 different drugs in cirrhotic subjects. As discussed above (Section IIC), there are two different relationships for (P L - P A), depending on whether there is no ascites and the intra-abdominal pressure (P A) is assumed to be small (eq. (14)) or there is appreciable ascites with an increased P A (eq. (15)). The penultimate column in Table 1 lists the calculated drug-induced changes in (P L - P A) for both of these cases using the following equations:

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^03c26b43]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Where peritoneal TB is considered plausible, ascites can be sent for acid-fast bacilli smear and culture, although culture positivity occurs in < 50% and smear-positive ascites is rare. Adenosine deaminase is more useful to distinguish between peritoneal TB and carcinomatosis, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98; adenosine deaminase levels of < 40 IU/mL are used to exclude TB.

Pancreatic ascites is a rare complication of pancreatitis, although more common when a pseudocyst is present. In pancreatic ascites, the amylase level in the ascitic fluid is typically > 1000 IU/L or greater than six times the serum amylase, with mean values exceeding 4000 IU/L in a recent cohort of 80 patients. Raised polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) count may also be found in pancreatic ascites.

The ascitic fluid samples required from the diagnostic paracentesis is summarised in figure 2.

### Persistent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a common complication in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and a high score in the model for end-stage liver disease [^bc1593de]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is associated with a high mortality rate. After antibiotic therapy, improvement in fluid polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell count is expected within 2 days. However, our institution recognized cases unresponsive to standard treatment.

Methods

To study these recalcitrant cases, we completed a retrospective chart review of patients admitted for SBP to the University of Chicago from 2002 to 2007. SBP was defined by an ascitic PMN cell count ≥ 250/ml.

Results

Of 55 patients with SBP, 15 did not show improvement in fluid PMN cell count to below 250/ml with standard treatment, leading to a prevalence of 27%. The patients with persistent SBP were younger than those with nonpersistent SBP [mean (SD) 51.80 (9.84) compared with 58.13 (8.79); p = 0.0253]. Persistent SBP had a higher serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) [median (Q1, Q3) 1.85 (1.50, 2.41) compared with 1.10 (0.60, 1.60)] and a higher score in the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) [mean (SD) 27.98 (8.09) compared with 22.22 (8.10)] than nonpersistent SBP patients; p = 0.027 and p = 0.023, respectively. In addition, persistent SBP patients were more likely to have a positive ascitic fluid culture than nonpersistent SBP patients [odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) 4.33 (1.21, 15.47); p = 0.024]. Importantly, in-hospital mortality in the persistent SBP group was 40%, compared with 22.5% in the nonpersistent SBP group [OR = 2.30 (0.64, 8.19); p = 0.20].

Conclusions

The risk of persistent SBP is nearly 40% in patients with MELD score > 25, SAAG > 1.5 or positive ascitic fluid culture. Furthermore, patients who develop persistent SBP tend to experience a higher mortality rate. This study underscores the importance of further examination of this vulnerable population.

### Pancreatic ascites: update on diagnosis and management [^d27ce3c5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic ascites is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of high-amylase ascitic fluid in the peritoneal cavity. This condition is often associated with chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic trauma, or pseudocyst rupture. Because of its rarity and ill-defined clinical presentation, pancreatic ascites is often a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in clinical practice. The current diagnostic criteria include an amylase level > 1000 mg/dL, a protein level > 3 g/dL, and a serum ascites albumin gradient < 1.1 g/dL. The clinical features vary, but may include progressive abdominal distension, diffuse abdominal pain, weight loss and peritonitis. The management of pancreatic ascites remains controversial, and there is no consensus regarding the optimal approach. Conservative medical management, which includes nutritional support, pain control, therapeutic paracentesis and the use of somatostatin analogs, has been associated with a high failure rate and significant morbidity. Interventional therapies, such as surgery and endoscopic transpapillary stenting, have shown more promising outcomes. However, the choice between these methods is still debated, with some advocating for endoscopic approaches, because of their minimally invasive nature and reduced morbidity compared with surgical options. Endoscopic approaches remain underutilized in practice, probably because of the need for repeated interventions, the potential risks associated with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, or a lack of skilled personnel. Although they show significant perioperative morbidity and mortality, surgical options provide definitive resolution of pancreatic ascites. Herein, we provide an updated review of pancreatic ascites, highlighting advances in diagnostic techniques and therapeutic approaches, and summarizing insights from recent clinical cases and retrospective studies.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhosis — proposed diagnostic and management algorithm begins when there is an "Acute rise in creatinine by ≥ 0.3mg/dL", followed by "Clinical assessment including urinary sediment and biomarkers" and determining if a "Specific diagnosis" is identified; urinary markers guide etiology, as "Urinary sediments and biomarkers (particularly NGAL) may indicate ATN, whereas fractional excretion of sodium < 1% may suggest HRS". If no specific diagnosis is made, the branch evaluates "Creatinine doubled from baseline?"; management emphasizes risk factor correction, and if there is "No resolution in 1–2 days" or a "further rise in serum creatinine", proceed to albumin challenge: "Risk factor management, if applicable Give albumin (1g/kg) for 2 days". After albumin, assess "Meets the criteria for HRS"; if yes, determine "Vasoconstrictor therapy candidate?" and administer vasoconstrictor therapy if appropriate, while if no, use "Individualized nephrology care". Risk factor management includes "the withdrawal of nephrotoxic drugs, reduction or withdrawal of diuretics, detection, and treatment of infections, if present, and volume replacement (if severely volume-depleted) using 5% albumin or crystalloids, preferentially balanced, initially".

### Abstract… [^c548bf3f]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

If the serum ferritin level is not consistent with iron deficiency anemia, the next stage of the evaluation should include measurement of serum iron level, TIBC, and transferrin saturation. Iron deficiency anemia is still probable if the serum iron level and transferrin saturation are decreased and TIBC is increased. On the other hand, if the serum iron level is decreased and the TIBC and transferrin saturation are decreased or normal, anemia of chronic disease is most likely. THALASSEMIA Beta-thalassemia is an autosomal recessive genetic condition in which the normal beta globin chains that make up hemoglobin are underproduced. Beta-thalassemia trait is the heterozygous form of the disease. Beta- thalassemia major is the homozygous form. Both are more common in black persons, and in persons of Southeast Asian, Greek, Italian, or Mediterranean descent. 30 Most patients with beta-thalassemia trait have mild anemia. In addition, the mean corpuscular volume can sometimes reach much lower levels than with iron deficiency anemia alone. Ultimately, the diagnosis of beta-thalassemia trait is made when hemoglobin electrophoresis shows a slight increase in hemoglobin A2. 1 Coexisting iron deficiency anemia can lower hemoglobin A2 levels; therefore, iron deficiency anemia must be corrected before hemoglobin electrophoresis results can be appropriately evaluated.
31. Alpha-thalassemia is caused by an underproduction of alpha globin chains, and is most prevalent in persons of African or Southeast Asian descent. The production of alpha globin chains is controlled by four genes on two chromosomes. One gene deletion results in a silent carrier status with normal hematologic findings. Two gene deletions result in alpha-thalassemia trait, which usually leads to microcytosis without anemia.

Hemoglobin electrophoresis is often normal in patients with silent carrier status or with alpha-thalassemia trait. The diagnosis is usually one of exclusion.
32. 25 Although anemia of chronic disease is usually normocytic, about one fourth to one third of cases are mildly microcytic. The anemia is usually mild and not progressive. Additionally, although serum iron levels are decreased in anemia of chronic disease, ferritin levels are increased because ferritin is an acute phase reactant. 1.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of ascites, volume overload, and hyponatremia in cirrhosis: expert review [^001c8295]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update (CPU) is to summarize the available evidence and offer expert Best Practice Advice (BPA) on the management of ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, and hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board and Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. This CPU expert review underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through the standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These BPA statements were developed based on review of the published literature and expert opinion and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board. Because formal systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Patients with cirrhosis with ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, or volume overload should be managed with dietary sodium restriction and diuretics at the lowest effective dose, with dose escalation guided by symptoms, weight, urine output, and electrolyte/renal monitoring. Education and referral to a dietitian should be provided for dietary management. Triggers of liver decompensation should be identified and addressed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with cirrhosis with new-onset ascites, or those admitted to the hospital for symptoms related to ascites or encephalopathy should receive diagnostic paracentesis as soon as possible. Testing should include serum ascites albumin gradient and cell count, Gram stain, and culture. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with hepatic hydrothorax with dyspnea and/or hypoxemia should undergo a therapeutic thoracentesis for both symptom relief and expansion of the underlying lung. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: All patients with refractory ascites and/or hepatic hydrothorax should be considered for liver transplantation evaluation, regardless of their Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Refractory ascites and/or hydrothorax should be managed with therapeutic paracentesis and/or thoracentesis, respectively, with the frequency guided by recurrence. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: When the volume of ascites removed is > 5 L, 20%-25% intravenous albumin 6–8 g per every total liter removed should be administered. For patients with hypotension, renal insufficiency, or electrolyte abnormalities, albumin should also be considered for removal of smaller volumes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Well-selected patients with refractory ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, or hyponatremia should be referred for to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Diagnostic workup for the etiology of hyponatremia in cirrhosis should include dietary and medication history (diuretics, bowel regimen); review of electrolyte and kidney function; gastrointestinal bleeding assessment; infectious workup, including diagnostic paracentesis, and evaluation of secondary causes (thyroid or adrenal dysfunction). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Outpatient management of asymptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis entails both sodium and water restriction (aiming for 1–1.5 L of daily fluid intake), modification of diuretics and laxatives, and monitoring of electrolytes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Inpatient management of severe or symptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis includes both sodium and water restriction; modification or discontinuation of diuretics and laxatives; and additional measures, such as intravenous albumin based on volume assessment or oral vasoconstriction therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Recurrent or refractory hyponatremia management should involve a multidisciplinary approach (including the liver transplantation team when appropriate) and can consider several therapeutic options, including intravenous vasoconstrictor therapy, infusion of hypertonic saline, use of vasopressin receptor antagonist (vaptans), or use of renal replacement therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Inpatient management of volume overload includes escalation or trial of intravenous loop diuretics (furosemide or bumetanide) in bolus (2–3 times per day) or continuous fashion. Cautious escalation can be done every 2–3 days with monitoring of volume status, kidney function, daily weights, and symptoms. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Advanced strategies in refractory anasarca should be coordinated with nephrology for consideration of diuretics in the setting of contraction alkalosis (eg, addition of acetazolamide), second agent with alternate mechanism of actions (eg, thiazide diuretics, such as metolazone), or need for ultrafiltration.

### Chylous ascites as the main manifestation of left ventricular dysfunction: a case report [^4a2c1f66]. BMC Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Ascites is one of the most common complications of liver diseases, even though in 15% of the cases it is related to extrahepatic diseases; 3% are of cardiac nature and they appear associated with signs and symptoms of heart failure. It is also associated with certain blood laboratory abnormalities. In this cases, the ascitic fluid shows a high albumin gradient (> 1.1 g/dl) and high concentrations of proteins.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes in those with primary extrahepatic malignancy and malignant ascites [^9ec6054c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Malignancy-related ascites accounts for approximately 10% of causes of ascites. Our AIM was to characterize the ascites fluid and correlate clinical outcomes in those with extrahepatic malignancy and ascites.

Methods

241 subjects with extrahepatic solid tumors and ascites were reviewed from 1/1/2000 to 12/31/2019, 119 without liver metastasis and 122 with liver metastasis.

Results

Ascites fluid consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) was most common, 150/241 (62%), followed by fluid reflecting the presence of portal hypertension (PH), 69/241 (29%). 22/241 (9%) had low SAAG and low ascites fluid total protein, with evidence of PC on cytology and or imaging in 20/22. Lung cancer was the most common malignancy in subjects with ascites due to PC at 36/150 (24%), pancreatic cancer was the most common in subjects with ascites with features of PH at 16/69 (23%). Chemotherapy or immunotherapy alone was the most common management approach. Significantly higher 5-year, 3-year and 1-year mortality rate were noted in subjects with evidence of PC on cytology/imaging versus subjects with no evidence of PC, and in subjects with liver metastasis compared to subjects without liver metastasis. Subjects with pancreatic cancer and evidence of PC on cytology/imaging had higher 1 and 5-year mortality rates compared to subjects without PC.

Conclusions

Ascites in solid tumor malignancy is most commonly due to PC. We also observed ascites fluid with characteristics of PH in 29% of subjects. Higher mortality rates in subjects with peritoneal carcinomatosis and liver metastasis were noted. These findings may help inform prognosis and treatment strategies.

### Quantitative modeling of the physiology of ascites in portal hypertension [^53e6e2e3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Although the factors involved in cirrhotic ascites have been studied for a century, a number of observations are not understood, including the action of diuretics in the treatment of ascites and the ability of the plasma-ascitic albumin gradient to diagnose portal hypertension. This communication presents an explanation of ascites based solely on pathophysiological alterations within the peritoneal cavity. A quantitative model is described based on experimental vascular and intraperitoneal pressures, lymph flow, and peritoneal space compliance. The model's predictions accurately mimic clinical observations in ascites, including the magnitude and time course of changes observed following paracentesis or diuretic therapy.

### Characteristics of ascites in patients with pregnancy-specific liver diseases [^95150bff]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The characteristics of ascites in patients with pregnancy-specific liver disease (PsLD), which comprise acute fatty liver of pregnancy, hemolysis, increased levels of liver enzymes, low platelet syndrome, and preeclampsia-associated liver dysfunction, are unknown. We evaluated the cellular and biochemical characteristics, and model for end-stage liver disease scores, in patients with PsLD.

Methods

We evaluated 46 consecutive patients with PsLD for the presence of ascites. We assessed cellular and biochemical characteristics of the ascites fluid from these patients.

Results

Ascites was observed in 35 of 46 patients with PsLD (76%). In 25 patients tested (71.4%), the ascites fluid had low levels of albumin (< 0.2 g/dL) and protein (< 1 g/dL) and high serum ascites albumin gradients, indicating portal hypertension. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was observed in 48% of patients tested and was not associated with mortality. Patients with ascites had significantly low serum levels of protein and albumin (P < .001). Model for end-stage liver disease scores did not differ between patients with or without ascites (32 vs 27; P = 0.1).

Conclusions

Ascites occur in 76% of women with PsLD, is transient, and has characteristics of portal hypertension, based on high serum ascites albumin gradients. Almost half of patients with PsLD develop spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which does not affect survival.

CT-scan in the parenchymal phase after iv-injection of iodinated contrast agent on day 18 after combined kidney-pancreas transplantation. Small bowel is filled with oral contrast-agent, colon structures with rectal contrast agent. The kidney transplant (KT) in the left lower abdomen still exhibits a ureteral stent. In the upper part of the pancreas transplant (PT) the anastomosis to the small bowel is visible. Both, kidney and pancreas grafts display normal contrast agent uptake behavior. Extensive ascites (As) can be seen in the four quadrants of the abdomen, moreover anasarca (An) is shown in the subcutaneous tissue of both flanks

Follow up of body weight (kg, primary axis), postoperative days (x-axis), conversion of treatment from tacrolimus (TAC) to cyclosporine A (CSA), enteric coated mycophenolate mofetil (EC-MPS) to azathioprine (AZA) and time period of repeated paracenteses treatments are shown

Diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis was performed for the first time 18 days after transplantation and repeated multiple times over the following 8.5 months (Fig. 2). In total more than 40 times ascites fluid was drained first with an indwelling catheter, later by fluid taps, on average 2.8 l each time. The peritoneal fluid was always clear. The cellular counts were low (< 100 cells/μL) with normal distribution and no pathologic cells. Multiple cultures and Gram stains were negative for pathogens. Analysis of ascitic fluid showed a total protein content between 8 and 23 g/L and albumin content between 5 and 17 g/L. The ascitic fluid showed consistently a high serum-to-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG, average of 23 g/l, range between 17 and 28 g/l), indicating portal hypertension.

### An unusual cause of ascites: castleman disease [^f4624550]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The patient had ascites, which should be polyserositis to be precise, superficial lymphadenopathy, enlarged spleen, hypothyroidism. We made differential diagnosis based on available data. The causes of ascites may be the following: liver cirrhosis, tuberculosis, tumor, rheumatism, endocrine, cardiac insufficiency, and nephritis. SAAG remains the most sensitive and specific marker for the differentiation of ascites due to portal hypertension from ascites due to other causes. The SAAG of the patient was greater than 11 g/L, however, there were no history of hepatitis, no esophageal/gastric varices under gastroscope, and no typical CT images of liver cirrhosis. We did not perform HVPG measurement and liver stiffness measurement, nor did we perform liver biopsy to rule out other rare causes of portal hypertension. We comprehensively considered and ruled out liver cirrhosis, which should be reported to a certain extent as a limitation of case reporting. He had no history or exposure of tuberculosis infection, no fever, no night sweats, negative tuberculosis test (PPD, T-spot), normal ADA in ascites, and no tuberculosis bacilli have been detected in ascites. So tuberculosis infection was also ruled out. The patient had a small amount of urine protein, mild hypothyroidism, normal rheumatism indicators, and no manifestation of cardiac insufficiency, so it was necessary to focus on tumors or other rare causes. After communicating with the patient and obtaining his consent, we gave him an in-depth comprehensive examination including bone marrow testing, PET-CT, and lymph node biopsy.

### Fitz-hugh-curtis syndrome associated with tuberculous salpingitis and peritonitis: a case presentation and review of literature [^5ae0cc6c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of ascites with lymphocytic predominance and SAAG of less than 1.1 g/dL includes peritoneal carcinomatosis, nephrotic syndrome, pancreatitis and peritoneal tuberculosis. The main advantage of calculating the SAAG is its specificity for ascites caused by portal hypertension. A SAAG of more than 1.1 g/dL indicates portal hypertension with an accuracy of 97%.

Acid fast stained smear on specimens collected from sites of suspected extra-pulmonary TB has low sensitivity (less than 5% on peritoneal fluid). However because false-positive results are unlikely, recent guidelines recommend performing acid fast stained smear on ascitic fluid and peritoneal biopsies, under the condition that a negative result is not used to exclude peritoneal tuberculosis.

Gene amplification tests such as PCR to detect M. tuberculosis on ascitic fluid and peritoneal biopsies are another rapid and non-invasive test. However low sensitivity has been reported in smear-negative patients (48%).

Tuberculin skin testing is mostly used as a screening tool for latent tuberculosis, given its low sensitivity and low positive predictive value.

Elevated serum CA-125 levels (> 35 U/mL) and adenosine deaminase activity (ADA) of ascitic fluid (> 30 U/l) have been proposed as easy, non-invasive tests for peritoneal tuberculosis with high sensitivity and specificity (respectively 83% and 50% for CA-125 and 93% and 94% for ADA). Therefore measuring ADA levels is recommended in the diagnostic work-up for peritoneal tuberculosis.

Since CA-125 is a tumor marker associated with ovarian cancer, ovarian malignancy should be excluded before making the diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis in case of elevated CA-125 values, especially because the clinical manifestations may show high resemblance.

### Possible use of 2D shear wave liver elastography in new-onset ascites evaluation [^cc4084ec]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

We obtained the approval of the regional General Hospital Celje Ethics Commission and performed a retrospective analysis of the prospectively collected data. Informed written consent was obtained from each patient included in the study. The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and Istanbul.

Study population

Data collection, blood and ascites analysis, and ultrasound examination were performed between January 2020 and October 2021. Based on similarly designed studies, the size of our hospital center, and the statistical characteristics of the observed parameters, we conducted a study on a sample of 50 patients. The cohort was divided according to the SAAG value into Group 1 (SAAG ≥ 11 g/L) and Group 2 (SAAG < 11 g/L). Based on a preliminary statistical analysis, we decided to include at least 30 patients in Group 1 and 15 patients in Group 2. The cohort was completed when both conditions were met.

Our study included patients with new-onset ascites who were hospitalized in the internal medicine wards of the General Hospital Celje. The inclusion criteria were as follows: ultrasonographic confirmation of clinically relevant ascites (grade 2 or 3) and hemodynamically stable patients who did not require acute dialysis or vasopressor therapy. No previously known medical condition affecting the onset of ascites. Furthermore, for Group 1, there were as follows: the presence of liver cirrhosis (US or CT morphological signs, laboratory signs of impaired liver function according to the CHILD score) and only patients with sinusoidal PH. The exclusion criteria were as follows: extrahepatic cholestasis presence, portal venous thrombosis presence or thrombosis in any of the hepatic veins, the presence of cardiac cirrhosis, clinical signs of congestive right-sided heart failure, ultrasound-proven dilatation of the right hepatic vein > 10 mm at the characteristic site, the presence of cancer or infiltrative liver disease at the site of elastographic measurement, the presence of a mixed cause of ascites, serum bilirubin > 100 mmol/L and aminotransferase levels (AST, ALT) > 3 times the normal upper limit, and ascites due to bleeding or hollow organ perforation. Furthermore, for Group 1: the presence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), active varicose hemorrhage or hepatic encephalopathy Grade > 2.

Sex, age, standard laboratory data on ascites and liver tests, mortality of patients, and data regarding the etiology of ascites were collected using our center's electronic case record system.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes in those with primary extrahepatic malignancy and malignant ascites [^4409e659]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

In summary, although ascites in solid tumor malignancy is most commonly due to peritoneal carcinomatosis, we observed characteristics of portal hypertension with SAAG > 1.1 in 29% of subjects. We also observed that the presence of liver metastasis was not the sole contributor to the development of ascites with features of portal hypertension which could be related to prior chemotherapies or other factors. With ascites fluid analysis, we believe that ascites in the setting of extrahepatic malignancy can be managed with a combination of therapies directed toward the tumor, especially in the era of increasing targeted therapies, and if present portal hypertension. We also noted that despite advances in targeted chemo/immune-oncology therapies and the decreased mortality rates in cancer patients, patients with evidence of PC continues to have high mortality rates. Based on our results, we propose for the management of ascites in subjects with primary extrahepatic solid tumors, we propose that these subjects undergo diagnostic paracentesis to obtain cytology, albumin, and total protein. If the SAAG is ≥ 1.1 with/without TP < 2.5, then treatment of underlying tumor and initiation of diuretic therapy (furosemide/spironolactone at standard doses) is warranted. If these measures fail to control the ascites, then initiation of serial paracenteses should be the next step while adjusting the therapy of the underlying malignancy. If ascites still remains problematic, placement of peritoneal drain/shunt, should be considered along with a discussion of goals of care. If the SAAG ≥ 1.1 with TP > 2.5, then treatment of underlying tumor and initiation of paracentesis should be the initial management steps. If these measures fail to control the ascites, then placement of a peritoneal drain/shunt, adjustment of therapy toward the primary extrahepatic malignancy if required, again with a discussion of goals of care should be considered. Finally, we noted multiple presentations that predicted higher mortality including those with liver metastasis or peritoneal carcinomatosis on cytology and or imaging.

Differential diagnosis

After ruling out technical complications, persistent edema and ascites were explained by a combination of early post-operative factors associated with simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplant surgery in a small-sized patient, such as high volume state, low oncotic pressures, activation of the inflammation cascade and previous peritoneal dialysis treatment. However, despite significant volume loss, increasing serum protein levels, full clinical recovery, and periods of deliberate withholding paracentesis despite abdominal distension and distress to prevent a fluid circle of removal and refilling, the ascites formation and need paracentesis persisted. The high SAAG levels suggested portal hypertension-related ascites but both hepatic and cardiogenic causes were extremely unlikely given the normal findings on imaging and pressure measurements. Infectious or malignant causes were ruled out as far as possible. Given the fact that the patient performed peritoneal dialysis with high transporter status only for a short period of time pre-transplant makes peritoneal sclerosis as contributing factors to ascites formation extremely unlikely. The literature suggests nephrogenic ascites in the setting of kidney transplantation mainly in association with rejection and unrecognized heart dysfunction, neither of which was present in our case. One report from 2012 discusses a very rare case of nephrogenic ascites due to an exophytic spongiform lesion on the surface of the renal allograft causing massive transudate ascites formation. The patient was treated by cauterization of the majority of the surface of the allograft, which lead to an involution of the lesions and finally resolution of ascites formation.

All those potential causative factors, as discussed in a recent review of post-transplant ascites, were seen as unlikely explanations for the persistence and severity of ascites in our patient.

Following 7 days of prednisolone, she developed rapid-onset abdominal pain and significant distension. Abdominal computed tomography scan revealed abundant ascites and diffuse enteritis without hepatosplenomegaly. Ascitic fluid analysis suggested inflammatory serositis due to a low serum ascites albumin gradient with low protein level. Culture were unremarkable, leading to diagnosis of lupus peritonitis. Pulse methylprednisolone was given for 3 consecutive days, followed by intravenous administration at a dosage of 60 mg/day with empirical antibiotics. The clinical symptoms were gradually improved. Follow-up ultrasonography 10 days post-treatment showed nearly resolved ascites. Subsequently, treatment was transitioned to oral prednisolone, with azathioprine as a steroid sparing agent.

Conclusion: Diagnosing lupus peritonitis, though rare, requires thorough evaluation involving clinical assessment, laboratory examinations, and imaging. Prompt recognition and intervention are essential to address peritoneal inflammation and prevent complications in affected individuals.

### Quantitative modeling of the physiology of ascites in portal hypertension [^36cad211]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

As discussed in Section IIF, it is expected that changes in plasma albumin should have a complicated effect on the severity of ascites. Figure 6 plots the predicted ascites volume as a function of P HVPG for plasma colloid osmotic pressure of 25 mm Hg (black line), 20 mm Hg (red), 15 mm Hg (green) and 10 mm Hg (blue). As expected (Section IIF), the increase in ascites volume produced by decreasing albumin is greatest at higher portal pressures and becomes negligible at P HVPG less than about 14 mm Hg. Even at P HVPG above14 mm Hg, the effect of decreasing oncotic pressure is relatively minor until this pressure reaches a value of 10 mm Hg (equivalent to a serum albumin of about 1.5 gm%). Thus, it is not surprising that many investigators have concluded that serum albumin infusion is not efficacious for the reduction of ascites. It also is apparent that no ascites would be expected with very low serum albumin concentrations, providing the P HVPG is normal (< 6 mm Hg). This prediction is borne out by the absence of ascites in subjects with congenital hypoalbumenemia.

Albumin in cirrhosis with infection and SBP indicates benefit and dosing: IV albumin improves survival in patients with cirrhosis and SBP, with those who most benefited having renal dysfunction (blood urea nitrogen > 30 mg/dL or creatinine > 1.0 mg/dL) or severe hepatic decompensation (bilirubin > 5 mg/dL). In an infection other than SBP, IV albumin has been used in the same doses (1.5 g/kg at day 1 and 1 g/kg at day 3); it has remained the standard recommendation. Alternatively, following the recommendations for the use of albumin in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) would also be appropriate.

### Quantitative modeling of the physiology of ascites in portal hypertension [^e9471495]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Summary

As discussed in the Introduction, in recent years ascites research largely has focused on the systemic changes observed in cirrhosis with particular emphasis on the "hyperdynamic circulation" syndrome. Although there is an implicit assumption that these changes cause ascites, there has been little discussion of the physiological link between these systemic alterations and ascites formation.

We theorize that ascites formation is dependent on just three factors: 1) the rate of protein leak from the liver, which is a function of the difference between the liver tissue pressure and the peritoneal pressure (P L - P A); 2) the colloid osmotic fluid movement between the intestinal tissue and the peritoneal space; and 3) the rate of lymph drainage of the peritoneal space, which is a function of the peritoneal pressure (P A) and the central venous pressure (P RA). This theory is not entirely novel in that other investigators have recognized the role of these factors in ascites. Of particular importance is the work of Henriksen and colleagues that provides measurements of these factors in humans.

In the standard "Forward theory" of ascites formation, there is a cycle of pathological events, ending with sodium and water retention and plasma volume expansion which then produce the ascites. The mechanism involved in this last step is either not discussed or assumed to be an obvious result of the volume expansion. In terms of the model we have presented, this volume expansion must act through an increase in central venous pressure (P RA) and/or an increase in liver tissue pressure (P L) produced by an increase in liver blood flow (as a result of increasing cardiac output).

The novel aspect of the present report is the development of a quantitative model of ascites accumulation based solely on physiologically relevant estimations of (P L - P A) and lymphatic drainage of the peritoneal cavity. The predictions of this model provide insight into a number of poorly understood clinical observations of the behavior of ascites in cirrhotic patients. For example, the model provides a quantitative explanation for the beneficial action of diuretics on ascites formation and the lack of efficacy of beta blockers despite their ability to reduce P HVPG. The model rather accurately predicts the known magnitude and time course of the action of diuretics on ascites. Lastly, the model provides a physiological explanation for the use of measurements of the SAAG to diagnose the existence of portal hypertension.

Stages of acute kidney injury (AKI) — serum creatinine criteria: Stage 1 is defined as an increase of creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL up to 2-fold of baseline, stage 2 as an increase in creatinine between 2- and 3-fold of baseline, and stage 3 as an increase in creatinine > 3-fold of baseline or creatinine > 4 mg/dl (353.6 μmol/l) with an acute increase ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 μmol/l) or initiation of RRT. Within stage 1, some members proposed subdividing into stage 1A (creatinine < 1.5 mg/dL) and stage 1B (creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL).

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes in those with primary extrahepatic malignancy and malignant ascites [^5f15a3cd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Two hundred forty-one subjects presented from 1/1/2000 to 12/31/2019 with solid tumors and ascites were reviewed with 119 subjects without liver metastasis and 122 subjects with liver metastasis identified. Table 1 describes baseline characteristics in subjects with malignant ascites and differentiates those with or without liver metastasis. Ascites fluid analysis consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis (low SAAG, high protein) was most common and observed in 150/241 (62%) subjects. Clinical evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis was observed on cytology in 96/241 (39.8%) of subjects and imaging in 94/241 (39.0%) of subjects. Among the patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis on cytology or imaging, ascites fluid analysis was consistent with presence of portal hypertension in 46/241 (19%) with 9/241 (4%) having SAAG > 1.1 with low total protein (TP < 2.5 g/dL). Out of the 22 subjects who had low SAAG and low total protein ascites, 20/22 demonstrated peritoneal carcinomatosis on cytology or imaging and the remaining 2/22 had evidence of acute pancreatitis. There was no evidence of nephrotic syndrome, serositis, or tuberculosis in these 22 subjects with low SAAG and low total protein ascites.

### On-treatment serum albumin level can guide long-term treatment in patients with cirrhosis and uncomplicated ascites [^f0fa4770]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

The ANSWER study reported that long-term albumin administration in patients with cirrhosis and uncomplicated ascites improves survival. During treatment, serum albumin increased within a month and remained stable thereafter. In this post hoc analysis, we aimed to determine whether on-treatment serum albumin levels could guide therapy.

Methods

Logistic regression was used to assess the association between baseline serum albumin and mortality, as well as to determine on-treatment factors associated with mortality and to predict the achievement of a given on-treatment serum albumin level. Survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier estimates and second-order polynomial regression. Patients whose on-treatment serum albumin remained below normal were compared with a subset of patients from the control arm matched by principal score.

Results

Baseline serum albumin was closely associated with 18-month mortality in untreated patients; albumin treatment almost effaced this relationship. On-treatment serum albumin and MELD-Na at month 1 were the sole independent variables associated with mortality. Second-order polynomial regression revealed that survival improved in parallel with increased 1-month on-treatment serum albumin. Kaplan-Meier estimations showed that any value of 1-month on-treatment serum albumin (0.1 g/dl intervals) in the range 2.5–4.5 g/dl discriminated patient survival. In the normal range of serum albumin, the best discriminant value was 4.0 g/dl. Compared to untreated patients, survival even improved in patients whose on-treatment serum albumin remained below normal.

Conclusion

Baseline serum albumin per se should not guide the decision to start albumin therapy. Conversely, 1-month on-treatment serum albumin levels are strongly associated with outcomes and could guide the use of albumin - 4.0 g/dl being the target threshold. However, even patients whose serum albumin remains below normal benefit from long-term albumin administration.

Lay Summary

The ANSWER study has shown that long-term albumin administration improves survival and prevents the occurrence of major complications in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. This study shows that the achievement of these beneficial effects is related to a significant increase in serum albumin concentration. Even though the best results follow the achievement of a serum albumin concentration of 4 g/dl, a survival benefit is also achieved in patients who fail to normalise serum albumin.

### Intra-abdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumor [^b17669c4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

A 30-year-old Syrian male presented with complaints of dull aching abdominal pain for 2 weeks associated with progressive abdominal distension. On examination he had abdominal shifting dullness. Routine investigations were normal, ultrasound scan revealed moderate ascites. Ascitic tap showed viscous straw-colored fluid with high protein (4.2 g/dL) and albumin (3.9 g/dL) levels, low serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) (1.0 g/dL) and high total leukocyte count (8950/mm³, predominantly lymphocytic). Evaluation for tuberculosis and tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, CA19-9, α-fetoprotein) were non-contributory. His ascitic fluid cytology showed abnormal cells suspicious of malignancy.

Computed tomography (CT) of abdomen showed ascites, omental cakes and retroperitoneal lymph nodes (hypodense nodes measuring up to 3.0 cm) (Fig. 1). CT-guided biopsy of retroperitoneal lymph nodes and omental cakes showed dense infiltration of small round blue cells (Fig. 2) in clusters and stained positive for desmin, AE1/AE3 and EMA with Ki-67 of 60%. A diagnosis of a rare neoplasm, intra-abdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumor (IDSRCT) was established. With diffuse intra-abdominal spread and progressive disease, he was started on IE/VAC (ifosfamide, etoposide)/(vincristine, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy (alternating cycles three weekly). He received 4 cycles of chemotherapy with initial clinical and radiological response. Unfortunately, the patient started to deteriorate thereafter with symptomatic right pleural effusion. A repeat positron emission tomography scan showed right-sided pleural effusion, reappearance of ascites, peritoneal caking and increase in size of mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. He was started on second-line chemotherapy with docetaxel and gemcitabine. However, he developed refractory sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction after the 1 st cycle of second line chemotherapy and succumbed to illness.
