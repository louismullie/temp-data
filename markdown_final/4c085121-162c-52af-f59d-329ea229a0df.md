## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining ITP and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify diagnostic criteria and the differential. Next, I will review first-line management thresholds and options, followed by second-line choices and how to individualize them. After that, I need to consider special populations, monitoring, and safety trade-offs like thrombosis. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight evidence gaps and research priorities, making sure I anchor each step to guidelines and key trials.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I don't gloss over fundamentals. ITP is an acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia due to immune-mediated platelet destruction and impaired platelet production, with antiplatelet antibodies and complex cellular immune dysregulation contributing to accelerated clearance and reduced megakaryopoiesis, which explains why counts can be low even when production is stimulated pharmacologically [^6296d91b] [^bc721cb0].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before jumping to treatment. ITP remains a clinical diagnosis of exclusion; I should confirm isolated thrombocytopenia without anemia or leukopenia, review the smear to exclude pseudothrombocytopenia or schistocytes, and screen for secondary causes such as HIV, hepatitis C, H. pylori, and medications. Bone marrow is not routinely required in typical presentations, though I need to ensure I consider it if the course is atypical or if I suspect marrow pathology, and I should remember that standardized response definitions and disease phases (newly diagnosed, persistent, chronic) are now codified in guidelines to harmonize care and research [^4df5863d] [^a85bb8f6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about when to treat; I should confirm thresholds. In adults with newly diagnosed ITP, ASH suggests corticosteroids when platelets are less than 30 × 10⁹/L, but recommends observation rather than steroids when platelets are 30 × 10⁹/L or higher and bleeding is minor or absent. In children, observation is generally favored unless there is more significant bleeding or quality-of-life impairment, reflecting high spontaneous remission rates and the risks of overtreatment [^bf3c6ca3] [^333ef55b] [^a2ad5e73].

> I need to check first-line therapy details and dosing so I don't misstate them. Standard first-line options include corticosteroids (prednisone or pulse dexamethasone), IVIG or anti-D for rapid count increases, and observation when appropriate. ASH advises against prolonged steroid courses beyond about 6 weeks total because of toxicity, and emphasizes shared decision-making given the limited high-quality comparative evidence in newly diagnosed adults [^6e6291e1] [^cc7e22b6].

> Let me consider second-line choices carefully, and I should double-check the hierarchy. For adults with ITP lasting 3 months or more who are steroid-dependent or unresponsive, ASH suggests either a TPO receptor agonist (romiplostim or eltrombopag) or rituximab, and suggests rituximab over splenectomy when choosing between those two, while also suggesting a TPO-RA over rituximab in some contexts. However, these are conditional recommendations based on very low certainty, so patient values, access, comorbidities, and preferences drive selection, and splenectomy should generally be deferred for at least 12 months when possible [^c71e9e29] [^e6f73a20] [^8f75cb57] [^6ce61eb3].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought splenectomy was broadly favored over rituximab because of higher durable response rates, but I should correct that. While splenectomy achieves durable remissions in roughly 60–70% of patients, contemporary guidelines actually suggest rituximab over splenectomy in many adults due to surgical risks and irreversibility, and they frame TPO-RAs as equally reasonable second-line options. So, I need to ensure I present this as a shared decision rather than a single best path [^8f75cb57] [^568961b3] [^c71e9e29].

> I will now examine the evidence base for TPO-RAs so I don't overstate benefits. Romiplostim and eltrombopag increase platelet counts in most patients and reduce bleeding events compared with placebo, though durable off-treatment responses are uncommon and long-term safety, including thrombotic risk, requires ongoing vigilance. A Cochrane review found improved platelet responses without clear reduction in major bleeding versus standard of care, underscoring that count gains do not automatically translate into fewer severe bleeds and that patient selection matters [^ceedaa3c] [^a833752c].

> Let me think about rituximab's role and durability, and I should confirm the numbers. Rituximab produces responses in about 40–60% with roughly 20% maintaining response at 3–5 years in some series, but there is no reliable predictor of response and repeated dosing may blunt humoral immunity; thus, I need to discuss infection risk, vaccination status, and the possibility of nonresponse or late relapse with patients [^568961b3] [^2ea3fd74].

> Next, I should review special populations so I don't apply adult algorithms indiscriminately. In children, observation is first-line for most with no or minor bleeding given high remission rates, and if treatment is needed for mucosal bleeding or QoL, short-course corticosteroids are reasonable. Rituximab and TPO-RAs are generally reserved for refractory disease, and splenectomy is avoided when possible due to infection risk and the potential for spontaneous remission [^a2ad5e73] [^d00bf597] [^8b69df8f].

> I should confirm inpatient versus outpatient thresholds and monitoring so safety is not compromised. For adults with newly diagnosed ITP and platelets less than 20 × 10⁹/L, ASH suggests hospital admission, whereas with established ITP and the same count, outpatient management with close follow-up is reasonable. For children, outpatient care is generally appropriate unless there are social barriers, diagnostic uncertainty, or unreliable follow-up, and all patients discharged with very low counts need education and expedited hematology follow-up [^0457afe0] [^492ab6f5] [^82b6b3dc].

> But wait, what if the patient is "refractory" after multiple lines; I need to ensure I don't miss modifiable drivers. I should reassess the diagnosis to exclude hereditary thrombocytopenia, drug-induced thrombocytopenia, or secondary ITP, then consider tiered strategies: tier 1 options include rituximab, TPO-RAs, and low-dose steroids; tier 2 includes immunosuppressants like azathioprine or mycophenolate; tier 3 includes experimental or high-toxicity options for severe bleeding. Combination therapy, such as a TPO-RA plus rituximab, may be reasonable in select refractory cases, though high-quality evidence is limited [^df716969] [^8e2e9b48].

> I should double-check safety trade-offs, especially thrombosis, because this increasingly influences second-line selection. Patients with ITP have a higher background thrombotic risk, and splenectomy and TPO-RAs further increase that risk, particularly in older adults or those with cardiovascular comorbidities. Rituximab and fostamatinib do not carry the same thrombotic signal and may be preferred when thrombotic risk is a concern, though fostamatinib's long-term durability and comparative effectiveness remain less certain [^5f200f0d].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, and I should verify it aligns with guidelines. For newly diagnosed adults, if platelets are 30 × 10⁹/L or higher with minor or no bleeding, observe; if less than 30 × 10⁹/L or there is more significant bleeding, use corticosteroids with or without IVIG/anti-D for rapid effect, limit steroid duration to 6 weeks or less, and reassess at 6 weeks. For persistent or chronic ITP, choose among TPO-RA, rituximab, or splenectomy using shared decision-making, deferring splenectomy when feasible. For children, favor observation and reserve therapy for bleeding or QoL impact, escalating to rituximab or TPO-RAs if refractory and avoiding splenectomy when possible [^cc7e22b6] [^c71e9e29] [^a2ad5e73].

> Hold on, I should verify research gaps so I don't overpromise. There is a pressing need for head-to-head randomized trials comparing second-line options, better prediction of durable response to rituximab, standardized bleeding and QoL outcomes, and cost-effectiveness analyses. ASH's 2022 review concluded that while new data have emerged, evidence remains insufficient for a full guideline overhaul, prompting a planned focused update on adult second-line therapy and continued emphasis on observational registries and patient-centered outcomes [^9234f65d] [^625730fc] [^336ab654].

> In summary, ITP management hinges on individualized, risk-stratified care anchored to platelet count, bleeding phenotype, age, comorbidities, and patient preferences, with first-line steroids or IVIG/anti-D for those who need rapid count improvement, and second-line TPO-RAs, rituximab, or splenectomy chosen via shared decision-making. I need to ensure I continually reassess the diagnosis, monitor for toxicity, and adapt therapy as the disease course evolves, recognizing that many recommendations remain conditional due to limited high-certainty evidence [^cc7e22b6] [^c71e9e29] [^a85bb8f6].

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an **autoimmune disorder** characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia from immune-mediated platelet destruction and impaired production [^6296d91b], with a bleeding risk that varies widely and is not strictly tied to platelet count [^39f0187b]. Diagnosis is **clinical and exclusionary**, requiring a normal CBC aside from thrombocytopenia and no other identifiable cause; bone marrow is not routinely needed unless atypical features are present [^4df5863d]. First-line therapy is **corticosteroids or IVIG** for symptomatic patients or those with platelets < 30 × 10⁹/L; observation is appropriate for asymptomatic patients with higher counts [^bf3c6ca3] [^333ef55b]. Second-line options include TPO receptor agonists, rituximab, or splenectomy, chosen via shared decision-making given variable durability and risks [^c71e9e29] [^e6f73a20]. Most children recover spontaneously, whereas adults often have a chronic course; long-term risks include bleeding and thrombosis, so individualized monitoring and therapy adjustments are essential [^2ba610f1] [^5f200f0d].

---

## Pathophysiology

ITP arises from **autoimmune platelet destruction** driven by autoantibodies (often against GPIIb/IIIa or GPIb/IX) [^6c3e75d9] and impaired megakaryocyte function, reducing production [^6296d91b]. Cellular immunity — notably cytotoxic T cells — also contributes to platelet clearance [^6c3e75d9].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Bleeding**: Mucocutaneous bleeding (petechiae, purpura, epistaxis, menorrhagia) is common; severe bleeding (GI, ICH) is rare but can be life-threatening [^39f0187b].
- **Fatigue**: Common even without bleeding, impacting quality of life [^39f0187b].
- **Asymptomatic**: Many patients, especially with counts > 50 × 10⁹/L, have no symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is **clinical and exclusionary**:

- **CBC**: Isolated thrombocytopenia with normal hemoglobin and leukocytes.
- **Peripheral smear**: Normal morphology except for low platelets.
- **Bone marrow**: Not routine; consider if atypical features or uncertainty [^4df5863d].
- **Secondary causes**: Exclude HIV, hepatitis C, H. pylori, drugs, and inherited thrombocytopenias [^4df5863d] [^8fdb5d81].

---

## Treatment indications

Treatment is guided by **platelet count, bleeding, and patient factors**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended approach** |
|-|-|
| Platelets ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L, asymptomatic or minor bleeding | Observation [^333ef55b] |
| Platelets < 30 × 10⁹/L, symptomatic, or major bleeding | Treat (steroids, IVIG, or anti-D) [^bf3c6ca3] |
| Life-threatening bleeding | IVIG ± steroids ± platelets [^notfound] |

---

## First-line therapies

- **Corticosteroids**: Prednisone or dexamethasone; rapid response in ~70–80% but high relapse and toxicity with prolonged use [^6e6291e1].
- **IVIG**: 1 g/kg once or in two doses; rapid effect, useful for bleeding or pre-procedure rescue [^e56d9e3a].
- **Anti-D immunoglobulin**: 50–75 μg/kg IV; for Rh-positive, non-splenectomized patients [^notfound].

---

## Second-line therapies

Choice depends on **durability, side effects, and patient preference**:

- **TPO receptor agonists**: Romiplostim (weekly SC) or eltrombopag (daily PO); ~70–90% response, but relapse off therapy is common [^568961b3].
- **Rituximab**: ~40–60% response, ~20% durable at 3–5 years; infection risk and delayed hypogammaglobulinemia can occur [^568961b3].
- **Splenectomy**: ~60–70% durable response; invasive, irreversible, and infection risk; generally deferred ≥ 12 months [^a6625c72].

---

## Special populations

- **Children**: High spontaneous remission (~70–80%); observation is first-line unless major bleeding or QoL impact [^2ba610f1] [^a2ad5e73].
- **Pregnancy**: Treat if platelets < 30 × 10⁹/L or near delivery; IVIG or corticosteroids preferred; avoid splenectomy and rituximab when possible [^notfound].
- **Elderly**: Higher bleeding and thrombotic risk; tailor therapy and monitor closely [^5f200f0d].

---

## Prognosis and complications

- **Children**: Excellent; most recover spontaneously [^2ba610f1].
- **Adults**: Often chronic; ~20–40% achieve sustained remission [^2ba610f1].
- **Complications**: Bleeding (including ICH), thrombosis (especially with TPO-RAs or splenectomy), and treatment-related toxicity [^39f0187b] [^5f200f0d].

---

## Emerging therapies

- **Fostamatinib**: SYK inhibitor; ~18% response, oral, no thrombosis signal [^cb8e04ac] [^5f200f0d].
- **Rilzabrutinib**: BTK inhibitor; phase 2/3 trials ongoing [^203d5c1b].
- **FcRn antagonists**: Efgartigimod and rozanolixizumab in trials to reduce IgG autoantibodies [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular assessment should track **platelets, bleeding, and treatment toxicity**, with therapy adjusted to maintain a safe count (generally ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L) while minimizing adverse effects. Patient education should emphasize bleeding precautions, infection risk (especially post-splenectomy), and when to seek care [^7b9f41c3].

---

ITP is a chronic autoimmune thrombocytopenia with heterogeneous bleeding risk; management is **individualized**, balancing efficacy, safety, and patient preferences, with observation for low-risk patients and steroids, IVIG, TPO-RAs, rituximab, or splenectomy for higher-risk or refractory cases.

### Refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura: current strategies for investigation and management [^e486702b]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

There is currently no consensus on how best to manage refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). In part, this reflects the need for individualized treatment due to the wide spectrum of patients' requirements and responsiveness to therapies. The objective of this review is to provide a clinically useful guide to current management strategies. This article suggests investigations to identify factors that may exacerbate thrombocytopenia and underlie poor therapeutic responses, and highlights emerging therapies, including the thrombopoietic agents, which are anticipated to dramatically alter the natural history of "refractory" ITP. Morbidity, mortality and heath-related quality of life are also discussed.

### Management of patients with refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura [^6f6a009e]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2006). Low credibility.

In immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), thrombocytopenia is a result of both increased platelet destruction and insufficient platelet production. In adults, the course is commonly chronic, but most patients never experience serious bleeding even with severe thrombocytopenia. In case series of consecutive adult patients identified at the time of diagnosis, the frequency of death from bleeding is low, < 1%. The goal of treatment is only to prevent bleeding, not to correct the platelet count to normal. All current treatments are designed to diminish the increased platelet destruction, either by immunosuppression or splenectomy. The frequency of death from complications of treatment is similar to the frequency of death from bleeding. Perhaps because of increasing recognition of both the infrequent occurrence of serious bleeding and the risks of immunosuppressive treatment and splenectomy, data from case series across the past 30 years suggest a trend toward less therapy and fewer splenectomies among patients with ITP. However treatment is necessary for patients with severe and symptomatic thrombocytopenia. Splenectomy remains the most effective treatment for ITP, with two-thirds of patients achieving durable complete remissions. Immunosuppressive agents, including rituximab and combinations of agents, may be less effective than splenectomy in achieving complete remissions and the remissions may also be less durable. New agents for patients with ITP are currently in development that enhance platelet production, rather than diminish platelet destruction. In preliminary reports, these agents have been effective in maintaining safe platelet counts in patients with chronic ITP that was refractory to splenectomy and other treatments.

Abstract

The 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) included recommendations on the management of adults (recommendations 1–9) and children (recommendations 10–21) with primary ITP. We describe here the results of a review of the 2019 guidelines by a working group of experts requested by ASH to inform decision-making about the need for and timing of a guideline revision. An updated Medline and Embase search applied the same search terms as in the 2019 ASH guidelines, limited to systematic reviews and clinical trials, from May 2017 to July 2022. There were 193 studies identified, 102 underwent abstract reviews, and 54 full reviews. Each study was assessed based on relevance to the previous recommendation with regard to the population, prioritized outcomes, new outcomes, and study design. Reviewers assessed if the data would change the strength or the directionality of the existing recommendation or merit development of a new recommendation. Based on this review, the ASH Committee on Quality endorsed a focused update on second-line management for adults with ITP. In addition, there will be continued annual monitoring and reviewing of the 2019 ASH guidelines on ITP in full to evaluate when there is sufficient new evidence to warrant additional revisions.

### Evidence-based management of immune thrombocytopenia: ASH guideline update [^94a48567]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

In 1996 and 2011, the American Society of Hematology (ASH) supported efforts to create guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). These guidelines used different approaches to arrive at recommendations for testing and treatment. Despite differences in methodology, in both cases there was a paucity of randomized trials to inform recommendations. As data on the diagnosis and management of ITP expands, the ASH Committee on Quality is dedicated to maintaining updated guidelines representing recent evidence and guideline methodology. Here, we will review the updated ASH guidelines on ITP with a focus on recommendations with new understanding and future research to close knowledge gaps.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia [^cc7e22b6]. Blood Advances (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite an increase in the number of therapies available to treat patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), there are minimal data from randomized trials to assist physicians with the management of patients.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in their decisions about the management of ITP.

Methods

In 2015, ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that included 8 adult clinical experts, 5 pediatric clinical experts, 2 methodologists with expertise in ITP, and 2 patient representatives. The panel was balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The panel reviewed the ASH 2011 guideline recommendations and prioritized questions. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, including evidence-to-decision frameworks, to appraise evidence (up to May 2017) and formulate recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on 21 recommendations covering management of ITP in adults and children with newly diagnosed, persistent, and chronic disease refractory to first-line therapy who have non-life-threatening bleeding. Management approaches included: observation, corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, anti-D immunoglobulin, rituximab, splenectomy, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists.

Conclusions

There was a lack of evidence to support strong recommendations for various management approaches. In general, strategies that avoided medication side effects were favored. A large focus was placed on shared decision-making, especially with regard to second-line therapy. Future research should apply standard corticosteroid-dosing regimens, report patient-reported outcomes, and include cost-analysis evaluations.

### The American Society of Hematology 2011 evidence-based practice guideline for immune thrombocytopenia [^8f717f65]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is commonly encountered in clinical practice. In 1996 the American Society of Hematology published a landmark guidance paper designed to assist clinicians in the management of this disorder. Since 1996 there have been numerous advances in the management of both adult and pediatric ITP. These changes mandated an update in the guidelines. This guideline uses a rigorous, evidence-based approach to the location, interpretation, and presentation of the available evidence. We have endeavored to identify, abstract, and present all available methodologically rigorous data informing the treatment of ITP. We provide evidence-based treatment recommendations using the GRADE system in those areas in which such evidence exists. We do not provide evidence in those areas in which evidence is lacking, or is of lower quality — interested readers are referred to a number of recent, consensus-based recommendations for expert opinion in these clinical areas. Our review identified the need for additional studies in many key areas of the therapy of ITP such as comparative studies of "front-line" therapy for ITP, the management of serious bleeding in patients with ITP, and studies that will provide guidance about which therapy should be used as salvage therapy for patients after failure of a first-line intervention.

### Management of newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: can we change outcomes? [^db53bd5e]. Blood Advances (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia resulting from antibody-mediated platelet destruction combined with impaired platelet production is a common cause of thrombocytopenia. The decision to treat newly diagnosed patients is based on several factors including ceasing hemorrhagic manifestations, increasing the platelet count, prevention of bleeding, and inducing remission. Current standard first-line therapy is a course of corticosteroids. Although this treatment paradigm increases the platelet count in the majority of patients, a high percentage relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. For this reason, intensification of first-line therapy that results in superior long-term remission rates would be desirable. This manuscript focuses primarily on adults with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), highlighting pediatric data and practice when applicable. The primary aim is to outline upfront strategies for treatment-naive patients with ITP to enhance remission rates, taking into account assessment of the risks and benefits of these approaches.

### Immune thrombocytopenic purpura [^a6251a27]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoantibody-mediated thrombocytopenic disorder in which accelerated destruction of platelets occurs; platelet production may also be impaired by these antibodies. ITP is characterized by mucocutaneous bleeding. Rarely, more severe hemorrhages, such as intracranial hemorrhage, may occur. Traditional therapies, such as steroids, immunoglobulin therapy, and splenectomy, generally reduce peripheral destruction of platelets. More recently, with a better understanding of the immunopathologic mechanisms underlying thrombocytopenia, several new treatments have been developed, including thrombopoietic agents, specific inhibitors of Fcgamma receptor (FcgammaR) signaling, and B-cell depletion therapies. This article outlines current understanding of the epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ITP. The focus is on recent pathophysiologic insights and areas of potential controversy in which studies are ongoing.

### Diagnosis and classification of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia [^a4b407bc]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia, or ITP, has been recognized as a clinical entity for centuries, and the importance of humoral mechanisms in the pathophysiology of ITP has been recognized for decades. Despite the long history of the syndrome, progress in understanding its epidemiology and management has been hindered by inconsistencies in nomenclature and classification schema together with the inherent heterogeneity in characteristics of global populations and ITP-associated disorders. In the past decade, great strides have been made in devising a common language for caregivers and investigators alike through standardization definitions and outcome measures, while new tools have become available for management of its clinical manifestations. In 2009, an International Working Group presented proposed standards for definitions, classification criteria, and outcome measures. The American Society of Hematology adopted these standards in 2011, including them in that body's guideline for immune thrombocytopenia. Despite the progress made so far, 20th century interventions such as corticosteroids and IVIg remain the mainstay of therapy. However, advances in treatment have led to the introduction of targeted therapies for select patients with chronic disease. In this paper, we review aspects of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of ITP and discuss the recent changes in guidelines for nomenclature, diagnosis, and treatment.

### Controversies in the diagnosis and management of childhood acute immune thrombocytopenic purpura [^f0b85a77]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Acute immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) occurs most commonly in young children who present with severe isolated thrombocytopenia and purpura. A marrow examination is not required unless glucocorticoids are used, lest treatment mask incipient acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but controversy exists here. The recommendations for evaluation and management remain controversial, since prospective controlled trials have not been done. There is some consensus based on experience and empiric data. Almost all children with acute ITP will recover completely without therapy. Although the various treatments may increase the platelet count, they do not influence the outcome of the illness, may increase cost, and cause significant side effects. Therefore, careful observation may be the best management option for the patient with ITP, in the absence of severe bleeding. The data available relevant to these issues are discussed.

### International Consensus Report on the investigation and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia [^db2a6f3a]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Previously published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) require updating largely due to the introduction of new classes of therapeutic agents, and a greater understanding of the disease pathophysiology. However, treatment-related decisions still remain principally dependent on clinical expertise or patient preference rather than high-quality clinical trial evidence. This consensus document aims to report on new data and provide consensus-based recommendations relating to diagnosis and treatment of ITP in adults, in children, and during pregnancy. The inclusion of summary tables within this document, supported by information tables in the online appendices, is intended to aid in clinical decision making.

### Immune thrombocytopenia – what are the new treatment options? [^d2ca24b7]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a minor disease for many patients; however, the natural history is variable and unpredictable. Many patients who are in otherwise good health can be left untreated, especially if their platelet counts are close to 20 × 10⁹/l. The overall mortality rate for ITP is < 1%, and the morbidity and mortality associated with treatment can be worse than the disease.

Areas Covered

ITP is not purely due to platelet destruction and in a significant proportion platelet production is sub-optimal; the review will cover the newer developments with the thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPOrAs) of which two agents, romiplostim and eltrombopag, are now licensed and these will be placed in context to conventional treatment.

Expert Opinion

There is an increasing understanding of the natural history of ITP and an increasing evidence-based approach to the disease and its management. Treatment should be aimed at the patient with a bleeding risk and should minimise the risk of adverse effects while maximising the chances of response. Few, if any, treatments are curative and treatment strategies need to be designed in ITP that manage patients with what can be a life-long condition with periodic relapses.

### The immune thrombocytopenia syndrome: a disorder of diverse pathogenesis and clinical presentation [^c26b1a45]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

This article presents a brief history of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) from the first clinical description written in 1735, through years of controversy about the nature and causes of what was first known as idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, then immune thrombocytopenic purpura, and, finally, ITP. Current understanding of ITP's primary and secondary forms and the effect of diverse defects in immune self tolerance that result in the development of antiplatelet antibodies is described. This overview is followed by a narrative list of other articles in this issue on topics ranging from a comprehensive review of the role of antiplatelet antibodies in platelet destruction and production to a review of classic treatment modalities and newer approaches to initial treatment.

### The pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopaenic purpura [^f28510eb]. British Journal of Haematology (2006). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disease that is rarely fatal. However, in many adults treatment is unsatisfactory, with as much morbidity from the immunosuppressive effects of treatment as from bleeding. Identifying the underlying disease process should help us to identify more targeted therapies and improve not only the treatment but also the quality of life of patients with this disorder.

### Current management of immune thrombocytopenia [^bc721cb0]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune-mediated condition that results from antibody-mediated destruction of platelets and impaired megakaryocyte platelet production. ITP patients exhibit severe thrombocytopenia and are at risk for significant hemorrhage. Few randomized trials exist to guide management of patients with ITP. Ultimately, each patient requires an individualized treatment plan that takes into consideration the platelet count, bleeding symptoms, health-related quality of life, and medication side effects. This article provides an up-to-date review of management strategies drawing on links between the expanding amounts of clinical trial data and associated biology studies to enhance understanding of the disease heterogeneity with regard to the complex pathogenesis and response to treatment.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) guideline — panel, scope, and key emphases: In 2016, ASH formed a multidisciplinary panel including 9 clinical experts, 5 pediatric clinical experts, 2 methodologists with expertise in ITP, and 2 patient representatives, used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach with evidence-to-decision frameworks to appraise evidence up to May 2017, and agreed on 21 recommendations covering management of ITP in adults and children with newly diagnosed, persistent, and chronic disease refractory to first-line therapy who have non–life-threatening bleeding; management approaches included observation, corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, anti-D immunoglobulin, rituximab, splenectomy, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists. The background notes minimal randomized-trial data to assist management, and the conclusions state there was a lack of evidence to support strong recommendations, that strategies avoiding medication side effects were favored, that a large focus was placed on shared decision-making (especially second-line therapy), and that future research should apply standard corticosteroid-dosing regimens, report patient-reported outcomes, and include cost-analysis evaluations.

### Clinical updates in adult immune thrombocytopenia [^ebeb73d4]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) occurs in 2 to 4/100000 adults and results in variable bleeding symptoms and thrombocytopenia. In the last decade, changes in our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder have led to the publication of new guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ITP and standards for terminology. Current evidence supports alternatives to splenectomy for second-line management of patients with persistently low platelet counts and bleeding. Long-term follow-up data suggest both efficacy and safety, in particular, for the thrombopoietin receptor agonists and the occurrence of late remissions. Follow-up of patients who have undergone splenectomy for ITP reveals significant potential risks that should be discussed with patients and may influence clinician and patient choice of second-line therapy. Novel therapeutics are in development to address ongoing treatment gaps.

### TPO receptor agonist for chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [^a833752c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disorder that is characterized predominantly by a low platelet count. Thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists increase production of platelets by stimulating the TPO receptor in people with chronic ITP.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of TPO receptor agonists in chronic ITP patients.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE (from 1950 to March 2011), EMBASE (from 1974 to March 2011), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 3) to identify all randomized trials in chronic ITP. We also contacted authors of included studies and TPO receptor agonists manufacturers.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TPO receptor agonists alone, or in combination with other drugs, to placebo, no treatment, other drugs, splenectomy or another TPO receptor agonist in patients with chronic ITP.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened papers, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies.

Main Results

Six trials with 808 patients were included. Five studies compared TPO receptor agonists with placebo (romiplostim: 100, eltrombopag: 299, placebo: 175); one study compared TPO receptor agonists with standard of care (SOC) (romiplostim: 157; SOC: 77). SOC included a variety of therapies, such as glucocorticoid, anti-D immune globulin, intravenous immune globulin, rituximab, azathioprine, and so on. Overall survival, one of our primary outcomes, was not studied by these RCTs and we could not estimate number needed to treat (NNT). Another primary outcome, improving significant bleeding events, did not reveal any significant differences between the TPO receptor agonists group and the control group (placebo or SOC) (versus placebo risk ratio (RR) 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 1.15; versus SOC RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.63). For secondary outcomes, TPO receptor agonists statistically significantly improved overall platelet response (versus placebo RR 4.06, 95% CI 2.93 to 5.63; versus SOC RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.37), complete response (versus placebo RR 9.29, 95% CI 2.32 to 37.15) and durable response (versus placebo RR 14.16, 95% CI 2.91 to 69.01). There was a significant reduction in overall bleeding events (WHO grades 1 to 4) when compared to placebo (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89), but not when compared to SOC(RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.26). Total adverse events (Grades 1 to 5) were not statistically significantly different between the treatment and control groups(both placebo and SOC) (versus placebo RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.15; versus SOC RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.26). Total serious adverse events (Grade 3 and higher adverse events) were increased when patients receiving treatment with SOC (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.92), but not receiving treatment with placebo (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.38). There are selective and performance biases because of open-label and inadequate allocation.

Authors' Conclusions

There was currently no evidence to support that TPO receptor agonists are effective in chronic ITP. Compared to placebo or SOC, despite significantly increased platelet response, there was no evidence to demonstrate that TPO receptor agonists did improve significant bleeding events in chronic ITP. The effect on overall survival awaits further analysis. Although long-term studies are lacking, current data demonstrated adverse effects of TPO receptor agonists were similar to that of placebo and SOC.

Bleeding and isolated thrombocytopenia in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) are phenomena of a transient or long-term disturbed immune response. Since 1980, ITP has become a model for targeted therapeutic immunomodulation with still unclear mechanisms of action. The systematic analysis of ITP aims to determine more clearly defined patient subgroups for targeted therapy and to explore the complex immune disturbances in this autoimmune disorder.

### Biomarkers for predicting response to corticosteroid therapy for immune thrombocytopenic purpura [^ab6d4c6a]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) often receive corticosteroids as a first-line treatment strategy. The ability to predict the therapeutic response to corticosteroids before initiating treatment would reduce the risk of adverse events, but biomarkers of this parameter have not yet been established. Here, in a single-centre, retrospective, cohort study of 127 ITP patients who received corticosteroids as first-line treatment, we compared several characteristics and test results between those patients with a favourable response to corticosteroids (responder cohort, n = 68) and those with a poor response to corticosteroids (non-responder cohort, n = 59) to identify potential biomarkers that were predictive of corticosteroid response. We extracted six factors as indicative of poor response to corticosteroid therapy for ITP: old age (≥ 81years) (odds ratio [OR], 2.44; p = 0.02); low platelet count (< 9×10⁹/L) (OR, 2.25; p = 0.02); high level of platelet-associated IgG (≥ 445ng/10⁷ cells) (OR, 3.95; p < 0.01), high platelet distribution width (≥ 14.0 g/dL) (OR, 2.00; p = 0.03), high lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (≥ 3.52) (OR, 1.40, p = 0.04), and low megakaryocyte count in bone marrow (< 85.5/μl) (OR, 1.72; p = 0.04). Thus, our present data support the fact that these six factors are useful biomarkers for predicting corticosteroid response in patients with ITP.

### State of the art-how I manage immune thrombocytopenia [^e37e905c]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

The management of patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is rapidly evolving. Over the last 15 years, a number of novel treatments have improved practice, with many steroid-sparing agents and a reduction in the progression to splenectomy. Although this has improved clinical care, many therapeutic challenges remain. There is no diagnostic test, no biomarkers to direct treatment and few comparative studies to help management decisions. Development of up to date guidelines is difficult with little high-grade evidence. First line treatment continues to be steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) although both are often poorly tolerated and not curative. Common second line treatments include rituximab, immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil, and the thrombopoietin receptor agonists romiplostim and eltrombopag. There are no comparative studies to decide between these agents and treatment is generally individualized, depending on comorbidity. Use of splenectomy has declined and is generally reserved for patients with chronic disease, although the exact position of splenectomy is subject to debate. Further understanding of the cause of disease in individual patients may help guide treatment. Randomized controlled studies of common treatments and novel treatments for refractory patients are urgently needed.

For patients with a platelet count of ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the ASH guideline panel recommends against corticosteroids and in favor of management with observation (strong recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects), noting that for patients at the lower end of this threshold; for those with additional comorbidities, anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, upcoming procedures; and for elderly patients (> 60 years old), treatment with corticosteroids may be appropriate. A good practice statement specifies that the treating physician should ensure that the patient is adequately monitored for potential corticosteroid side effects and should conduct an assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (depression, fatigue, mental status, etc) while patients are receiving corticosteroids.

### Second-line therapies in immune thrombocytopenia [^192264e0]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare, acquired autoimmune condition characterized by a low platelet count and an increased risk of bleeding. Although many children and adults with ITP will not need therapy beyond historic first-line treatments of observation, steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and anti-D globulin, others will have an indication for second-line treatment. Selecting a second-line therapy depends on the reason for treatment, which can vary from bleeding to implications for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) to likelihood of remission and patient preference with regard to adverse effects, route of administration, and cost. Published studies of these treatments are limited by lack of comparative trials, in addition to inconsistent outcome measures, definitions, and efficacy endpoints. This article provides an up-to-date comparison of the second-line treatments, highlighting important outcome measures including bleeding, HRQoL, fatigue, and platelet counts, which influence treatment selection in a shared decision-making model.

### Insights on treatment of adult ITP: algorithm for management and role of multimodal therapy [^8e2e9b48]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

The management of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is continuously evolving with the development and introduction of newer therapies and a better understanding of the disease. Corticosteroids still represent the cornerstone of first-line treatment. Patients who fail to achieve remission with a short course of corticosteroids require subsequent therapy. Most guidelines recommend starting with either a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA), rituximab, or fostamatinib since these agents have been investigated in randomized trials and have well-characterized efficacy and safety profiles. Patients' involvement to reach a shared decision regarding choice of therapy is essential as these treatments have different modes of administration and mechanisms of action. Less than 10% will fail to respond to and/or be intolerant of multiple second-line therapeutic options and thus be considered to have refractory ITP and require a third-line therapeutic option. Such patients may require drugs with different targets or a combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action. Combining a TPO-RA and an immunomodulatory agent may be an appropriate approach at this stage. Many studies have been conducted during the last 2 decades investigating the efficacy and safety of combinations strategies for first and later lines of therapies. Yet none of these are recommended by current guidelines or have gained wide acceptance and consensus.

### Efficacy of romiplostim in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura: a double-blind randomised controlled trial [^ceedaa3c]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is characterised by accelerated platelet destruction and decreased platelet production. Short-term administration of the thrombopoiesis-stimulating protein, romiplostim, has been shown to increase platelet counts in most patients with chronic ITP. We assessed the long-term administration of romiplostim in splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients with ITP.

Methods

In two parallel trials, 63 splenectomised and 62 non-splenectomised patients with ITP and a mean of three platelet counts 30 × 10⁹/L or less were randomly assigned 2:1 to subcutaneous injections of romiplostim (n = 42 in splenectomised study and n = 41 in non-splenectomised study) or placebo (n = 21 in both studies) every week for 24 weeks. Doses of study drug were adjusted to maintain platelet counts of 50 × 10⁹/L to 200 × 10⁹/L. The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy of romiplostim as measured by a durable platelet response (platelet count ≥ 50 × 10⁹/L during 6 or more of the last 8 weeks of treatment) and treatment safety. Analysis was per protocol. These studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00102323 and NCT00102336.

Findings

A durable platelet response was achieved by 16 of 42 splenectomised patients given romplostim versus none of 21 given placebo (difference in proportion of patients responding 38% [95% CI 23.4–52.8], p = 0.0013), and by 25 of 41 non-splenectomised patients given romplostim versus one of 21 given placebo (56% [38.7–73.7], p < 0.0001). The overall platelet response rate (either durable or transient platelet response) was noted in 88% (36/41) of non-splenectomised and 79% (33/42) of splenectomised patients given romiplostim compared with 14% (three of 21) of non-splenectomised and no splenectomised patients given placebo (p < 0.0001). Patients given romiplostim achieved platelet counts of 50 × 10⁹/L or more on a mean of 13.8 (SE 0.9) weeks (mean 12.3 [1.2] weeks in splenectomised group vs 15.2 [1.2] weeks in non-splenectomised group) compared with 0.8 (0.4) weeks for those given placebo (0.2 [0.1] weeks vs 1.3 [0.8] weeks). 87% (20/23) of patients given romiplostim (12/12 splenectomised and eight of 11 non-splenectomised patients) reduced or discontinued concurrent therapy compared with 38% (six of 16) of those given placebo (one of six splenectomised and five of ten non-splenectomised patients). Adverse events were much the same in patients given romiplostim and placebo. No antibodies against romiplostim or thrombopoietin were detected.

Interpretation

Romiplostim was well tolerated, and increased and maintained platelet counts in splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients with ITP. Many patients were able to reduce or discontinue other ITP medications. Stimulation of platelet production by romiplostim may provide a new therapeutic option for patients with ITP.

### Pathogenesis in immune thrombocytopenia: new insights [^6296d91b]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Idiopathic (immune) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a common autoimmune disorder resulting in isolated thrombocytopenia. ITP can present either alone (primary) or in the setting of other conditions (secondary) such as infections or altered immune states. ITP is associated with a loss of tolerance to platelet antigens and a phenotype of accelerated platelet destruction and impaired platelet production. Although the etiology of ITP remains unknown, complex dysregulation of the immune system is observed in ITP patients. Antiplatelet antibodies mediate accelerated clearance from the circulation in large part via the reticuloendothelial (monocytic phagocytic) system. In addition, cellular immunity is perturbed and T-cell and cytokine profiles are significantly shifted toward a type 1 and Th17 proinflammatory immune response. Further clues into immune dysregulation in ITP may be gleaned from studies of secondary ITP. Some infections can induce antiplatelet Abs by molecular mimicry, and there may be common elements involved in breaking tolerance with other autoimmune disorders. There is also evidence for a genetic predisposition to both ITP and responsiveness to therapy, which may in part lie within immune-related genes. Lastly, treatment with immunomodulatory agents remains the mainstay of ITP therapies.

A Study of Rilzabrutinib in Adult Patients With Immune Thrombocytopenia ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview This is a 2 part adaptive, open-label, dose-finding study of PRN1008 in approximately 60 patients in Part A and approximately 25 patients in Part B. Part A enrolls patients with ITP who are refractory or relapsed with no available and approved therapeutic options. Eligible patients have a platelet count < 30, 000/μL on two counts no sooner than 7 days apart in the 15 days before treatment begins. The active treatment period is 24 weeks and the post-treatment follow-up period is 4 weeks. In the dose-finding part of the study, each patient enrolled in the study is allowed to up-titrate their dose after 28 days of PRN1008 therapy, if they do not experience a platelet response or a dose-limiting toxicity at the last dose level. Patients who respond to PRN1008 per protocol may enter a long term-extension.

Part B of the study will include approximately 25 patients with ITP who have relapsed or have an insufficient response to prior therapies. Eligible patients will have a platelet count < 30, 000/µL on two occasions no less than 7 days apart, within 15 days before treatment begins and a platelet count of ≤ 35, 000/µL on Study Day 1. The study consists of a 28-day screening period, 24-week active treatment period, and a long-term extension. After the last dose of PRN1008 there will be a 4-week safety follow-up period.

### Immune thrombocytopenia guidelines get an annual checkup [^625730fc]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

In this issue of Blood Advances, Neunert et alreport on their systematic review of the literature performed to determine the need to revise or update the 2019 American Society of Hematology guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). In this field with multiple novel therapies on the horizon and many new publications reporting on potential important mechanisms of disease and targets for therapy, the group looked to reassess the validity of the provided guidance. The findings indicate that although new evidence has emerged, it is insufficient to dramatically change the current guidelines or justify a full guideline revision. This article discusses the results of the literature review and the recommendations for changes to the guideline, especially suggesting clarification of second-line therapies in adults with ITP and updates to several other recommendations.

One of the major criticisms of the 2019 guidelines has been that clinicians are rarely in the position of deciding only between 2 treatments that is thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist (RA) or splenectomy/rituximab or TPO RA, but the available methodology at the time did not have viable way to compare more treatment options. Since then, new methodologies have been developed, and a focused update to allow for updated guidance is proposed in this review, based on the available literature. Most of the other updates, based on a total of 54 studies, are not going to change the take home points of the original 2019 guidelines.

The evidence review "included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that had internal comparators", and due to scarcity also "included all single-arm prospective studies of ≥ 50 adults with newly diagnosed ITP" and, for observation, "retrospective studies of ≥ 50 adults". No direct comparative studies were found: "We found no studies that directly compared corticosteroids vs management with observation in adult patients with ITP with a platelet count of < 30 × 10^9/L", though "We found 5 RCTs… and 2 prospective studies" of corticosteroids. Reported outcomes included "Four studies reported data on response within 7 days; 6 studies reported on remission; 3 studies reported on major bleeding; 4 studies reported on mortality; 0 studies reported on overall HRQoL", and "There were no studies in ITP patients with platelet counts of < 30 × 10^9/L who were managed with observation alone". Consequently, "The relative effects were not estimable from the data because of a lack of direct comparisons".

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) corticosteroid duration — adults: The guideline panel recommends against a prolonged course (> 6 weeks including treatment and taper) of prednisone and in favor of a short course (≤ 6 weeks) as initial treatment, issuing a strong recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence. Evidence review found no usable comparative ITP data because no studies had data on short courses of prednisone. Based on clinical experience, the panel agreed there was likely trivial benefit in continuing corticosteroids beyond 6 weeks; for the majority of patients, a visit 6 weeks after starting corticosteroids should determine remission versus need for additional therapy, and for patients who require additional therapy, consideration of alternative therapy is preferred over ongoing exposure to corticosteroids. The panel also agreed the risk of harm was large with courses > 6 weeks and acknowledged that 6 weeks is not evidence based but represents a reasonable duration to permit a standard maximum 21 days of treatment plus taper.

### Reemergence of splenectomy for ITP second-line treatment? [^9a204280]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Corticosteroids are still the standard first-line treatment for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). As second-line therapy, splenectomy and Rituximab are both recommended. The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy of Rituximab to splenectomy in persistent or chronic ITP patients.

Methods

Between January 1999 and March 2015, we retrospectively selected all consecutive patients who underwent an ITP second-line treatment: Rituximab or splenectomy. The distinction between open (OS) and laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) was analyzed. Primary outcome was composite: hospitalization for bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia and death from hemorrhage or infection. Secondary outcomes were based on response (R) and complete response (CR) rates as defined by the American Society of Hematology.

Results

Ninety-six patients were included: 30 patients received Rituximab, 37 underwent OS, and 29 underwent LS. The follow-up was 30, 60, and 120 months in Rituximab, LS, and OS groups, respectively. At 30 month, the primary outcome-free survival rate was higher in splenectomy groups (84% for OS, 86% for LS) than Rituximab group (47%) (P = 0.0002). Similarly, at 30 month, R and CR rates were higher for OS (86.5% and 75.7%, respectively) and LS groups (93.1% and 89.7%) than Rituximab (46.7% and 30%) (P = 0.0001). Moreover, R rates remained elevated at 60 month for OS and LS groups (83.7% and 89.6% respectively) and 78.4% at 120 month for OS group.

Conclusion

We observed that splenectomy for ITP second-line treatment was more effective than Rituximab regarding maintenance of R, CR, and overall response rates. OS and LS had similar efficacy.

### Critical issues of current and future developments in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura [^2ea3fd74]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

B-cell depletion with rituximab has become a reasonable option for thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients who are refractory for corticosteroids and/or splenectomy, with a response rate of about 55%. The side effects are mostly mild and easily manageable. Long lasting responses are likely in patients who achieve normal platelet counts. The mechanism of action of rituximab in immune-mediated disease in general and ITP in particular is not completely clear. Most probably, depletion of the memory B-cell compartment causes a decrease in autoantibody formation. To date it is impossible to predict the response to rituximab, although the presence of a high affinity Fc receptor for IgG seems to have positive predictive value. Future studies will have to clarify these issues, as well as possible effects of repeated rituximab treatment on primary and secondary immune responses.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — 2018 European joint working group (JWG) guidance and second-line differences: The JWG recommended corticosteroids for adults with ITP who have no or mild bleeding (World Health Organization [WHO] 0-II) and platelet counts below 20 × 10⁹/L to 30 × 10⁹/L, with observation for patients with platelet count values above 20 × 10⁹/L to 30 × 10⁹/L; prolonged corticosteroid use is discouraged, and the JWG guidelines did not discuss the addition of rituximab to corticosteroid treatment in newly diagnosed adults. For second-line management, the JWG guidelines place a priority on thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) as second-line treatment with rituximab being considered a third-line agent reserved for patients who have failed a TPO-RA, and splenectomy is primarily reserved for patients with ITP for > 12 months' duration or major bleeding (WHO III, IV); the ASH guidelines herein also include a remark that splenectomy should be delayed until 12 months when possible. In children, the JWG advises that a low platelet count alone is not sufficient to start treatment in newly diagnosed ITP and that the majority with no or only mild bleeding do not require treatment; they acknowledge no standard treatment of chronic ITP with referral to a specialist center recommended, and suggest that splenectomy be avoided in children and reserved as a last option in those that are refractory.

### Contemporary management of primary immune thrombocytopenia in adults [^6c651c09]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2012). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) comprises a syndrome of diverse disorders that have in common immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, but that differ with respect to pathogenesis, natural history and response to therapy. ITP may occur in the absence of an evident predisposing etiology (primary ITP) or as a sequela of a growing list of associated conditions (secondary ITP). Primary ITP remains a diagnosis of exclusion and must be differentiated from non-autoimmune etiologies of thrombocytopenia and secondary causes of ITP. The traditional objective of management is to provide a hemostatic platelet count (> 20–30 × 10⁹ L⁻¹ in most cases) while minimizing treatment-related toxicity, although treatment goals should be tailored to the individual patient and clinical setting. Corticosteroids, supplemented with either intravenous immune globulin G or anti-Rh(D) as needed, are used as upfront therapy to stop bleeding and raise the platelet count acutely in patients with newly diagnosed or newly relapsed disease. Although most adults with primary ITP respond to first-line therapy, the majority relapse after treatment is tapered and require a second-line approach to maintain a hemostatic platelet count. Standard second-line options include splenectomy, rituximab and the thrombopoietin receptor agonists, romiplostim and eltrombopag. Studies that directly compare the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of these approaches are lacking. In the absence of such data, we do not favor a single second-line approach for all patients. Rather, we consider the pros and cons of each option with our patients and engage them in the decision-making process.

### Immune thrombocytopenia [^b928553b]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common hematologic disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia. ITP presents as a primary or a secondary form. ITP may affect individuals of all ages, with peaks during childhood and in the elderly, in whom the age-specific incidence of ITP is greatest. Bleeding is the most common clinical manifestation of ITP. The pathogenesis of ITP is complex, involving alterations in humoral and cellular immunity. Corticosteroids remain the most common first line therapy for ITP. This article summarizes the classification and diagnosis of primary and secondary ITP, as well as the pathogenesis and options for treatment.

Introduction

The 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) included recommendations on the management of adults (recommendations 1–9) and children (recommendations 10–21) with primary ITP. The guidelines addressed the treatment of newly diagnosed ITP as well as persistent and chronic ITP with regard to hospitalization, observation, and treatment selection of both first- and second-line agents. The guidelines also carried forward recommendations from the 2011 ASH guidelines for ITP related to diagnostic testing in patients with ITP, management of Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus, and measles mumps rubella vaccine–associated ITP. This review of the 2019 guidelines by a working group of experts was requested by ASH to inform decision-making about the need for and timing of a guideline revision.

### The 2022 review of the 2019 American Society of Hematology guidelines on immune thrombocytopenia [^9234f65d]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The 2019 ASH guidelines on the management of ITP continue to be relevant and important, including recommendations related to second-line therapy for adults. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence to justify a revision of the entire guideline at this time. We also recognize, however, that the 2019 recommendations on second-line therapy for adults were the result of paired comparisons of splenectomy, rituximab, and the TPO-RAs, and were based on a heterogeneous patient population. This resulted in discordant recommendations. Therefore, we recommend that a focused revision on second-line therapy for adults be conducted. We appreciate that due to the absence of comparative randomized trials and the lack of reporting on prioritized patient–related outcomes, recommendations on second-line therapy will likely remain highly dependent on patient values and preferences even with additional clinical trials. Preference for agents may also change with the prioritization of different outcomes and clinical contexts, such as the desire to avoid immunosuppression in the era of COVID-19. The updated search conducted here also identified alternate methodological approaches that would allow comparisons across several treatment strategies. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) approach also outlines a methodology for multiple comparisons that applies the evidence to the decision framework. Use of these methods and refinement of the population of interest may clarify the existing recommendations. This would also provide the opportunity to be inclusive of avatrombopag and fostamatinib, discussed above, as well as novel agents currently in clinical trial development. Based on this review, the ASH Committee on Quality endorsed a focused update on second-line management for adults with ITP. This update will involve the selection of a guideline panel, determination of appropriate questions, conduct of relevant literature searches, application of GRADE methodology, and publication of final recommendations. In addition, there will be continued annual monitoring and reviewing of the 2019 ASH guidelines on ITP in full to evaluate when there is sufficient new evidence to warrant additional revisions.

### Sequence of treatments for adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia [^97449662]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

Management of adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has changed dramatically in the past 10 years. New regimens of corticosteroids for first-line treatment have been introduced and are currently being evaluated in a randomized clinical trial. Many patients may not have durable remissions with initial corticosteroid regimens and may require additional, second-line, treatment. For these patients, rituximab has been increasingly used, as it has for other autoimmune disorders, and new thrombopoietin (TPO)-receptor agonists have been developed. Although splenectomy was the first effective and remains the most effective treatment for ITP, inducing durable complete remissions in 66% of patients, rituximab and TPO-receptor agonists are now additional options for second-line treatment. For patients who continue to have severe and symptomatic thrombocytopenia following failure of multiple treatments, including splenectomy and rituximab, the TPO-receptor agonists are effective as third-line treatment for maintaining safe platelets counts to prevent bleeding symptoms in most patients.

### Immune thrombocytopenia [^5a56a26e]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by autoimmune-mediated platelet destruction and impairment of thrombopoiesis. ITP may occur in the absence of an evident predisposing etiology (primary ITP) or secondary to a growing list of associated conditions (secondary ITP), and must be differentiated from other causes of thrombocytopenia. This review focuses on primary ITP in adults. The traditional goal of therapy in this population is to achieve a hemostatic platelet count of 30×10⁹/L or above for most patients while minimizing treatment-related morbidity. This approach has been called into question by the recent advent of well-tolerated and effective agents for the management of ITP, including pulse-dose dexamethasone, rituximab, and the thrombopoietin receptor agonists. Recent studies suggest the potential for aggressive therapy at the time of diagnosis to alter the natural history of ITP and point to the importance of quality-of-life considerations in therapeutic decision making.

Definition of terms in 2019 ASH guideline on immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — standardized thresholds for responses, disease phases, and bleeding severity are specified. Corticosteroid-dependent is defined as ongoing need for continuous prednisone > 6 mg/d (or corticosteroid equivalent) or frequent corticosteroid courses to maintain a platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L and/or to avoid bleeding. Response categories include durable response (platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L and at least doubling of the baseline count at 6 mo), early response (platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L and at least doubling baseline at 1 wk), and initial response (platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L and at least doubling baseline at 1 mo). Disease duration terms are newly diagnosed ITP (ITP duration of < 3 mo), persistent ITP (ITP duration of 3–12 mo), and chronic ITP (ITP duration of ≥ 12 mo), and remission is platelet count > 100 × 10⁹/L at 12 mo. Bleeding severity includes major bleeding defined as (1) WHO grade 3 or 4 bleeding, (2) Buchanan severe grade, (3) Bolton-Maggs and Moon "major bleeding", (4) IBLS grade 2 or higher, or (5) life-threatening or intracerebral hemorrhage bleeding, whereas minor bleeding is any bleeding not meeting the criteria for "major bleeding".

### When is the use of intravenous immunoglobulin appropriate in immune thrombocytopenia? [^e56d9e3a]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an auto‐immune disorder characterized by an isolated thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 × 10⁹/L) in the absence of other aetiologies. The main issue at the heart of ITP patient management is an increased bleeding risk, which guides treatment indications. Corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) are the cornerstone of first‐line treatment in ITP. There is a consensus in international guidelines that IVIg should be reserved for the most severe forms and in preparation for surgery in patients resistant to corticosteroids. It has been shown that in emergency situations with a platelet count < 20 × 10⁹/L, response to IVIg is faster, more important and more frequent than that obtained with corticosteroids. However, even if all guidelines clearly place IVIg as the reference treatment in severe ITP, there are no clear recommendations as to its indications and the assessment of bleeding severity is most often left to the discretion of the physician, with no consensual bleeding score. A widely accepted and validated bleeding measurement tool specific to adult ITP is lacking, with the literature identifying at least 12 different definitions of 'severe bleeding'. Hence, the classification of bleeding severity in patients with ITP remains unstandardized and is a challenge.

### Autoimmune thrombocytopenia [^6c3e75d9]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder in which platelets coated with mainly antibodies against platelet GPIIb/IIIa and GPIb/IX are destroyed in the spleen. Recent evidence suggests that platelets are also destroyed by cytotoxic T cells. The diagnosis is made by exclusion for other causes of thrombocytopenia. As routine blood counts are becoming more available, many mild cases of ITP (platelets > 30 × 10⁹ L⁻¹) are being diagnosed and they usually do not require treatment. In patients with platelet counts persistently < 30 × 10⁹ L⁻¹, treatment with corticosteroids, and/or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or anti-D may be required. The primary goal of treatment is to maintain the platelet count at a safe level with minimal side effects. After 3–6 months, if spontaneous remission has not occurred and if the side effects are significant, splenectomy is recommended. This is the single most effective treatment of ITP. The refractory patients who fails splenectomy and subsequently first- and second-line therapies, is a management dilemma. Therapeutic options are limited, available treatments potentially toxic and the chances of sustained response low. Observation with no active treatment is a reasonable option. With the increased availability of the thrombopoietic agents in the future, there may be a good prospect of keeping the platelet counts of these refractory patients at a safe long-term level with one of these drugs.

American Society of Hematology guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia — research priorities emphasize that the panel was able to make a strong recommendation for approximately one-fifth (5/21) of the prioritized questions and recommend methodological directions for future evidence generation. The panel recommends that collaborative cohort studies (retrospective and prospective), registries, and other observational studies addressing these issues could contribute much to improve the current levels of evidence and are likely more feasible than RCTs. These studies should apply standard dosing regimens and definitions, consistently report on patient-reported outcomes including HRQoL and side effects, and report long-term follow-up data. The panel also recommends ongoing collaborative engagement of patients to best understand how to apply these guidelines within the context of shared decision-making. Lastly, the panel recognizes that many of the management options covered in these recommendations are unavailable in certain countries; therefore global cost-effective strategies should also be assessed.

### The immune thrombocytopenia paradox: should we be concerned about thrombosis in ITP? [^5f200f0d]. Thrombosis Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the predisposition to bleeding, patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) may also have an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis, which can contribute to significant morbidity. The risk of thrombosis increases with age and the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. This narrative review explores the multifactorial nature of thrombosis in ITP, focusing on new pathological mechanisms, emerging evidence on the association between established treatments and thrombotic risk, the role of novel treatment approaches, and the challenges in assessing the balance between bleeding and thrombosis in ITP. The review also explores the challenges in managing acute thrombotic events in ITP, since the platelet count does not always reliably predict either the risk of bleeding or thrombosis and antithrombotic strategies lack specific guidelines for ITP. Notably, second-line therapeutic options, such as splenectomy and thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), exhibit an increased risk of thrombosis especially in older individuals or those with multiple thrombotic risk factors or previous thrombosis, emphasizing the importance of careful risk assessment before treatment selection. In this context, it is important to consider second-line therapies such as rituximab and other immunosuppressive agents, dapsone and fostamatinib, which are not associated with increased thrombotic risk. In particular, fostamatinib, an oral spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has promisingly low thrombotic risk. During the current era of the emergence of several novel ITP therapies that do not pose additional risks for thrombosis, it is critical to outline evidence-based strategies for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis in ITP patients.

### How I treat refractory immune thrombocytopenia [^df716969]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

This article summarizes our approach to the management of children and adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who do not respond to, cannot tolerate, or are unwilling to undergo splenectomy. We begin with a critical reassessment of the diagnosis and a deliberate attempt to exclude nonautoimmune causes of thrombocytopenia and secondary ITP. For patients in whom the diagnosis is affirmed, we consider observation without treatment. Observation is appropriate for most asymptomatic patients with a platelet count of 20 to 30 × 10⁹/L or higher. We use a tiered approach to treat patients who require therapy to increase the platelet count. Tier 1 options (rituximab, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, low-dose corticosteroids) have a relatively favorable therapeutic index. We exhaust all Tier 1 options before proceeding to Tier 2, which comprises a host of immunosuppressive agents with relatively lower response rates and/or greater toxicity. We often prescribe Tier 2 drugs not alone but in combination with a Tier 1 or a second Tier 2 drug with a different mechanism of action. We reserve Tier 3 strategies, which are of uncertain benefit and/or high toxicity with little supporting evidence, for the rare patient with serious bleeding who does not respond to Tier 1 and Tier 2 therapies.

### Introduction to a review series on the treatment of thrombocytopenic disorders: something old, something new [^8fdb5d81]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

The importance of the more primitive hemostatic mechanism stands out in the natural experiments represented by those clinical disorders in which thrombocytopenia is a sufficient cause of bleeding, despite an intact coagulation system. Quite surprisingly, contrary to what is expected, there are clinical situations accompanied by a reduced number of platelets in which thrombosis is also a major factor of morbidity or mortality, posing dramatic management dilemmas (see, for example, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia). Conversely, thrombocytosis may be accompanied by a hemorrhagic tendency as in essential thrombocythemia, whose first denomination was 'hemorrhagic thrombocythemia'. Finally, as detailed in Balduini's review, in a significant proportion of cases with inherited thrombocytopenias an associated impaired platelet function may further aggravate the bleeding tendency. Even worse, in rarer cases, the genetic lesions have impacts beyond thrombopoiesis and thrombocytopenia is just one component of more complex syndromic forms or may herald the future development of hematologic malignancies or bone marrow aplasia or fibrosis, raising ethical dilemmas on how to best inform patients on their condition.

Figure 1 depicts the many inherited and acquired causes that can lead to thrombocytopenia and the main pathogenic mechanisms involved. It is quite evident that a precise diagnosis is essential not only for directing prognosis and treatment, but also for excluding any underlying or associated disorder requiring prompt identification. As Balduini mentions in his review, the prevalence of inherited thrombocytopenias is reported to be as high as more than two cases per 100.000 persons, an order of magnitude similar to that of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Nevertheless, only a very tiny proportion of patients is diagnosed with inherited thrombocytopenias at major hematology centers, thus highlighting the under-diagnosis of this pathology. No prevalence data are available for drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia, but its diagnosis is very difficult without a high index of suspicion and underdiagnosis is anticipated also for this condition. Indeed, even in expert centers, several cases of isolated thrombocytopenia are initially misdiagnosed as ITP with potentially dangerous consequences.

### Systematic literature review of treatments used for adult immune thrombocytopenia in the second-line setting [^5cea9433]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare platelet disorder that is often persistent or chronic in adults. Patient management is dependent upon physician judgment and patient preference, given both the rarity of the condition and a paucity of high-quality clinical trial evidence to inform practice guidelines. A systematic literature review was conducted to provide an up-to-date summary of studies evaluating the safety and efficacy/effectiveness of therapies used to treat adults with primary ITP in the second-line setting. Using comprehensive search strings, several medical research databases were queried. Final abstraction was performed on 186 articles. Most (75%) studies were observational in nature; nearly half were conducted in Europe. Splenectomy was the most commonly studied (n = 83, 47%), followed by rituximab (n = 49, 26%) and the thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) romiplostim (n = 34, 18%) and eltrombopag (n = 24, 13%). Twelve prospective, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a placebo or standard-of-care arm evaluating the safety and efficacy of either rituximab or a TPO-RA were identified and described in detail. These trials provide important information on the safety and efficacy of these treatments, and in the absence of head-to-head data, offer insights on how these therapies compare with one another in treating adult ITP in the second-line setting. This review confirms that for most second-line ITP treatment options, there remains a lack of rigorous evidence derived from RCTs, and for many treatments, there is limited evidence of any kind. The need for additional research to guide treatment choices in this setting and greater use of standardized ITP terminology are highlighted.

Thrombocytopenia and purpura

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) occurs when autoantibodies target and destroy platelets. It presents as isolated thrombocytopenia without anemia, leukopenia, or another apparent cause (Table 3). Patients may have purpura, petechiae, hemorrhage, epistaxis, and fatigue. Diagnosis is based on exam, complete blood count (CBC), reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear. Bone marrow biopsy is not typically required but, when performed, shows increased megakaryocytes from destruction exceeding production.

Table 3
Hematologic immune adverse effects related to ICI therapy: thrombocytopenia and purpura

Treatment is prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for 2–3 weeks with tapering over 4–6 weeks. IVIG can be given as a single 1 g/kg dose. Rituximab monotherapy or in combination with thrombopoietin receptor agonists is used for steroid/IVIG-refractory cases23. Emerging data catalog immune-mediated bleeding/thrombotic complications in the broader ICI setting, supporting vigilance and early hematology consultation3⁷.

Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)

Acquired TTP is a thrombotic microangiopathy caused by severe ADAMTS13 protease deficiency, leading to unchecked von Willebrand factor activity and platelet aggregation. Thrombi form in small vessels, damaging organs. The classic pentad includes hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, fever, neurologic abnormalities, and renal dysfunction. Additional symptoms may include nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspnea, chest pain, bleeding, or easy bruising.

TTP is a medical emergency. Standard treatment includes plasma exchange and methylprednisolone (1 g daily × 3 days after plasma exchange). Rituximab is frontline in patients receiving blood/plasma transfusions. ICI-associated hemostatic complications — including TTP and acquired hemophilia — are increasingly cataloged and should trigger rapid multidisciplinary management.

Post-transfusion purpura (PTP)

PTP is a rare delayed complication of transfusion, usually 5 to 10 days post-transfusion, often triggered by alloimmunization to platelet antigens (e.g. HPA-1a). Platelet destruction results from complement fixation. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion and serologic testing, though treatment should begin empirically if PTP is suspected, as serology may not be readily available. Standard treatment includes IVIG, plasmapheresis, and corticosteroids. Discontinuation of ICI therapy may be required in severe cases5.

### Immune thrombocytopenic purpura of childhood [^60c4eba9]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

Immune mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common manifestation of autoimmune disease in children. Although patients often present with bruises, petechiae, and some mucosal bleeding, the incidence of life-threatening hemorrhage is rare (0.2–0.9%) but can be fatal when presenting in vital organs. A wide range of therapeutic regimens are currently in use, including observation alone, as the majority of children recover within 4–6 months regardless of treatment. A growing understanding of the pathophysiology of acute ITP in children has not impacted the controversy surrounding treatment, but has clarified the mechanism of action of the most frequently used agents in chronic ITP. Newer monoclonal antibodies such as Rituxan have proved very useful in chronic or refractory ITP and studies are ongoing to determine the best regimens using this form of immune modulation. Splenectomy and newer agents to boost platelet production are also under study in chronic ITP. Neonates may also have a form of immune thrombocytopenia with extensive bruising and thrombocytopenia called neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenic purpura (NATP). Rather than autoantibodies, the platelet destruction is secondary to transplacental maternal IgG alloantibodies. During pregnancy mothers may become sensitized to platelet membrane antigens present on fetal platelets. These antibodies may result in serious bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage in the perinatal period. Once identified, these mothers may require treatment during future pregnancies to minimize serious bleeding in the fetus and neonate. Treatment in utero and immediately following delivery is focused on restoring neonatal platelets to a safe level and preventing life-threatening bleeding.

1 INTRODUCTION

Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia that can lead to an increased tendency to bleed. 1, 2 Although it typically presents as a subtle‐onset, chronic syndrome in adults, with no forewarning symptoms or illness, clinical manifestations can range from minor bruising to severe hemorrhaging. 3, 4, 5 The primary goal of treatment is to achieve a safe platelet count (above which, a patient does not experience bleeding episodes), and this is determined on a case‐by‐case basis. 3 Common first‐line therapies include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and anti‐D (Rho[D] immune globulin intravenous). 6, 7, 8 Relapse or failure to respond to these may necessitate second‐line treatment, which can include splenectomy or a variety of medical therapies, most of which have not been approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of ITP but have been used because of efficacy demonstrated in other autoimmune diseases or as immune suppressants. 9

Splenectomy has historically been considered the second‐line therapy of choice in adult ITP. 10, 11 A systematic review was previously conducted to examine studies (published from 1966 to 2003) that assessed the efficacy/effectiveness of medical treatments for adult patients with ITP who have not responded to splenectomy. The review covered a total of 90 studies representing 656 patients who were splenectomized, aged > 16 years, had ITP for > 3 months, and a platelet count < 50 × 10⁹/L. 12 Only one study 13 was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) but the randomization was by dose of the same therapy; the remaining were cohort studies or uncontrolled case series. A complete response (as defined in each respective original report) was achieved in 14% of patients across the 22 treatment types, with the largest numbers of responders reported with cyclophosphamide (27% of 83 patients), rituximab (24% of 41 patients), and azathioprine (17% of 109 patients). Although partial response was achieved in 40% of patients across these three therapies, 36% to 42% had no response. This review focused on the third‐line setting and beyond, but it demonstrated that at least at that time, there was minimal evidence for the effectiveness of any medical treatment for ITP patients with persistent, severe thrombocytopenia, highlighting the need for RCTs to properly evaluate potentially effective treatments in this setting.

For clinicians, strong recommendations state "Most individuals should follow the recommended course of action; formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", while conditional recommendations advise "Recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that you must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with the patient's values and preferences; decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences". For policy-makers, strong recommendations indicate "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations; adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator", whereas conditional recommendations note "Policy-making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders; performance measures should assess whether decision-making is appropriate". For researchers, strong recommendations are "supported by credible research or other convincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation", and conditional recommendations state "The recommendation is likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adaptation) by additional research; an evaluation of the conditions and criteria (and the related judgments, research evidence, and additional considerations) that determined the conditional (rather than the strong) recommendation will help identify possible research gaps".

Abstract

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare platelet disorder that is often persistent or chronic in adults. Patient management is dependent upon physician judgment and patient preference, given both the rarity of the condition and a paucity of high‐quality clinical trial evidence to inform practice guidelines. A systematic literature review was conducted to provide an up‐to‐date summary of studies evaluating the safety and efficacy/effectiveness of therapies used to treat adults with primary ITP in the second‐line setting. Using comprehensive search strings, several medical research databases were queried. Final abstraction was performed on 186 articles. Most (75%) studies were observational in nature; nearly half were conducted in Europe. Splenectomy was the most commonly studied (n = 83, 47%), followed by rituximab (n = 49, 26%) and the thrombopoietin‐receptor agonists (TPO‐RAs) romiplostim (n = 34, 18%) and eltrombopag (n = 24, 13%). Twelve prospective, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a placebo or standard‐of‐care arm evaluating the safety and efficacy of either rituximab or a TPO‐RA were identified and described in detail. These trials provide important information on the safety and efficacy of these treatments, and in the absence of head‐to‐head data, offer insights on how these therapies compare with one another in treating adult ITP in the second‐line setting. This review confirms that for most second‐line ITP treatment options, there remains a lack of rigorous evidence derived from RCTs, and for many treatments, there is limited evidence of any kind. The need for additional research to guide treatment choices in this setting and greater use of standardized ITP terminology are highlighted.

This recommendation assumes that a short course of corticosteroids is being used for treatment and is reserved only for children with non-major mucosal bleeding. The panel did not prioritize any harms a priori and therefore the undesirable effects were determined to be unknown; IVIG is associated with a black box warning for associated thrombosis and renal failure, and IVIG has high costs compared with a short course of corticosteroids with administration often requiring inpatient admission.

### Traditional and new approaches to the management of immune thrombocytopenia: issues of when and who to treat [^180caf14]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and management of chronic ITP requires experience and the appropriate use of the laboratory despite the absence of a diagnostic test for ITP. Consideration of secondary ITP is important because identification of immunodeficiency infections or of lymphoproliferative disorders would change the management approach to a given patient. The development of newer therapies such as rituximab and the thrombopoietic agents has had a major impact on the management of ITP. In the future, combinations of agents may be a critical approach although the schedule and dosing remains difficult to establish. Finally, current studies to augment therapy in newly diagnosed ITP patients to prevent chronic disease may lessen the number of patients in chronic disease category.

### How I treat immune thrombocytopenia: the choice between splenectomy or a medical therapy as a second-line treatment [^568961b3]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The paradigm for managing primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults has changed with the advent of rituximab and thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) as options for second-line therapy. Splenectomy continues to provide the highest cure rate (60%-70% at 5+ years). Nonetheless, splenectomy is invasive, irreversible, associated with postoperative complications, and its outcome is currently unpredictable, leading some physicians and patients toward postponement and use of alternative approaches. An important predicament is the lack of studies comparing second-line options to splenectomy and to each other. Furthermore, some adults will improve spontaneously within 1–2 years. Rituximab has been given to more than 1 million patients worldwide, is generally well tolerated, and its short-term toxicity is acceptable. In adults with ITP, 40% of patients are complete responders at one year and 20% remain responders at 3–5 years. Newer approaches to using rituximab are under study. TPO-RAs induce platelet counts > 50 000/μL in 60%-90% of adults with ITP, are well-tolerated, and show relatively little short-term toxicity. The fraction of TPO-RA-treated patients who will be treatment-free after 12–24 months of therapy is unknown but likely to be low. As each approach has advantages and disadvantages, treatment needs to be individualized, and patient participation in decision-making is paramount.

### Splenectomy for immune thrombocytopenia: down but not out [^a6625c72]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Splenectomy is an effective therapy for steroid-refractory or dependent immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). With the advent of medical alternatives such as rituximab and thrombopoietin receptor antagonists, the use of splenectomy has declined and is generally reserved for patients that fail multiple medical therapies. Splenectomy removes the primary site of platelet clearance and autoantibody production and offers the highest rate of durable response (50% to 70%) compared with other ITP therapies. However, there are no reliable predictors of splenectomy response, and long-term risks of infection and cardiovascular complications must be considered. Because the long-term efficacy of different second-line medical therapies for ITP have not been directly compared, treatment decisions must be made without supportive evidence. Splenectomy continues to be a reasonable treatment option for many patients, including those with an active lifestyle who desire freedom from medication and monitoring, and patients with fulminant ITP that does not respond well to medical therapy. We try to avoid splenectomy within the first 12 months after ITP diagnosis for most patients to allow for spontaneous or therapy-induced remissions, particularly in older patients who have increased surgical morbidity and lower rates of response, and in young children. Treatment decisions must be individualized based on patients' comorbidities, lifestyles, and preferences. Future research should focus on comparing long-term outcomes of patients treated with different second-line therapies and on developing personalized medicine approaches to identify subsets of patients most likely to respond to splenectomy or other therapeutic approaches.

INTRODUCTION

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disease characterized by immune‐mediated platelet destruction and impaired platelet production, leading to thrombocytopenia and an increased risk of bleeding events. While single episodes followed by an immediate remission have been seen in some patients, ITP is known as a chronic condition (i.e. lasting > 12 months) in most adult patients. The incidence of chronic ITP ranges from 2 to 4 per 100 000 person‐years, with a higher rate in patients over 60 years of age. The prevalence of chronic ITP is approximately 10/100 000 people. Although mainly characterized by thrombocytopenia, which can be severe, the primary symptom is bleeding that can range from mild bruising and mucosal bleeding to severe haemorrhage. Patients with chronic ITP have an estimated 5‐year cumulative rate of 1%–2% experiencing intracranial haemorrhage. Furthermore, patients may be at a higher risk for venous thromboembolism.

Treatment is directed towards increasing the platelet counts to stop active bleeding and reducing the risk of future bleeding. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of first‐line treatment for ITP; however, adverse effects preclude their long‐term use. Although most patients respond to initial corticosteroid therapy, relapse is common when the dose is reduced, and prolonged exposure leads to significant toxicities. Other first‐line treatments include intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIgs) and anti‐D. However, not all patients respond to first‐line treatment, and subsequent treatment approaches are frequently necessary. Second‐line treatment options include thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO‐RA), fostamatinib and rituximab. While splenectomy achieves durable remissions in 60%–70% of patients, it comes with surgical and post‐operative bleeding risks, and potential long‐term complications such as infections (e.g. sepsis) and arterial as well as venous thromboembolic events.

2 SECOND‐LINE TREATMENT OPTIONS

Second‐line or maintenance therapy in persistent or chronic ITP (hereafter referred to as ITP) aims to establish a durable platelet response and to minimize bleeding events with a treatment that is safe, tolerable, and convenient for long‐term management. Splenectomy, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO‐RAs), and rituximab are the standard second‐line treatment options in current use. 3, 4 Before initiation of a second‐line therapy, it is advisable to confirm the diagnosis of primary ITP by excluding potential non‐immune causes of thrombocytopenia as well as causes of secondary ITP if these have not been previously ruled out.

1 INTRODUCTION

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoantibody‐mediated bleeding disorder, characterized primarily by accelerated platelet destruction and also by impairment of megakaryocyte function. 1, 2 The constellation of symptoms varies between patients and can include severe thrombocytopenia, with bleeding ranging from none to skin and mucosal bleeding, to intracranial, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary bleeding. 2, 3, 4 Mortality rates are very low but increase with age, certain comorbidities, and long‐term severe disease. 3, 5 Quality of life is often impaired in areas of physical functioning and mental health. 6, 7, 8

Patients needing treatment usually receive steroids with or without intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as first‐line therapy, but the great majority of patients require additional treatment due to intolerability or relapse. Current guidelines for second‐line and subsequent therapies are broad and nonprescriptive. There are many therapies available, but no comparative, randomized, controlled studies exist to facilitate treatment choice. 9, 10 Splenectomy is the only potentially curative approach, which is effective in a majority of patients initially, but some patients subsequently relapse. This surgical option is declining in use due to the availability of noninvasive options. 11 Medical therapies, such as rituximab, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, and immunosuppressive agents, have been effective in many patients and are chosen according to physician and patient preference. Some patients do not respond, or respond but relapse, when treated with second line treatments and develop persistent and then chronic disease. Those who do not improve often cycle endlessly through the various treatment options. Despite the multiple agents available, there is an unmet medical need for patients with ITP. 6, 7, 12, 13

Evidence notes no randomized controlled trials directly comparing TPO-RA and splenectomy. Reported remission favored splenectomy, given higher reported remission rates with splenectomy (68.5%), and splenectomy also seemed to demonstrate superior 1-month (91.1% with splenectomy and 57.7% with TPO-RAs) and durable remission (76.7% with splenectomy and 46.8% with TPO-RAs). The TPO-RAs seem to reduce bleeding events compared with splenectomy (3.0% compared with 6.3%) and TPO-RA use resulted in reduction or discontinuation of corticosteroids in 6.5% of children. Reported harms included infection with TPO-RAs (4.8%) compared with 3.8% that can likely be directly attributed to splenectomy, additional operative complications with splenectomy in 5.9% of children, and thrombosis not seen in children receiving TPO-RAs; although splenectomy is also associated with thrombosis, this outcome was not reported in the pediatric trials.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: challenges and best practices [^11b05284]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with ITP experience a high burden of disease, and it is important to offer management options that will improve quality of life. When possible, treatment options that are compatible with the personal preferences and lifestyle of the patient should be offered. Oral treatments taken once a day may be preferred by some patients, but others may favor injections that are administered less frequently. For patients who want to minimize their medication and monitoring needs, splenectomy may be the most desirable option.

An in‐depth understanding of second‐line treatment options will help optimize management of ITP and patient outcomes by ensuring the best use of available therapeutic options.

Remarks specify that patients with social concerns, uncertainty about the diagnosis, significant comorbidities with risk of bleeding, and more significant mucosal bleeding may benefit from admission to the hospital; patients not admitted to the hospital should receive education and expedited follow-up with a hematologist, and the need for admission is also highly variable across the range of platelet counts represented (0 to 20 × 10⁹/L).

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia [^6ce61eb3]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) second-line selection — evidence-to-decision considerations and conditional recommendations — states that TPO-RAs are more expensive than splenectomy or rituximab, equity and feasibility may be reduced with TPO-RAs and rituximab due to availability and coverage limits, and administration differs between romiplostim and eltrombopag. The panel acknowledged that there is no single second-line treatment that is optimal and that treatment should be individualized. For patients with ITP of < 12 months' duration, it may be preferable to delay splenectomy when possible, and when choosing between TPO-RAs and rituximab the panel made a conditional recommendation in favor of TPO-RAs; rituximab might be preferable for those prioritizing avoidance of long-term treatment or who cannot afford TPO-RAs. For adults who have had ITP for > 12 months, splenectomy, TPO-RAs, and rituximab were considered viable options, and the panel made a conditional recommendation in favor of rituximab over splenectomy because of the operative risks and irreversible nature of splenectomy with attendant long-term risks.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — bleeding risk and outcomes are characterized by unpredictable bleeding even with severe thrombocytopenia; intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) has been reported in 1.4% of adults and 0.1% to 0.4% of children; severe bleeding is reported in 9.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.1–17.1) of adults and 20.2% (10.0–32.9) of children; adults with ITP have a 1.3- to 2.2-fold higher mortality than the general population; fatigue is reported in 22% to 45% of patients; and ITP significantly affects health-related quality of life (HRQoL), particularly in the first year after diagnosis.
