## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which form of cosmopolitanism is most commonly associated with the idea that those in a position to help have an obligation to assist people in poverty and to promote basic human rights. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition of cosmopolitanism and its main branches. Then, I should verify which branch most directly grounds obligations to assist the poor and advance human rights. Next, I will check whether the provided sources explicitly support that branch. Finally, I will consider and rule out the alternative options to ensure the answer is precise and well-supported.

> Let me first confirm the conceptual frame. Cosmopolitanism, in ethics and political philosophy, generally asserts that moral concern and obligations extend beyond national or communal boundaries to all human beings, and it is typically divided into moral, political, cultural, and economic strands, with moral cosmopolitanism emphasizing universal moral duties to individuals regardless of citizenship or location.

> Now, I need to check which strand most directly yields an obligation to assist those in poverty and to promote basic human rights. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the alignment. Moral cosmopolitanism is the branch that grounds universal duties of justice, beneficence, and human rights, including duties to aid the globally disadvantaged and to respect and promote fundamental rights across borders, which matches the description in the question.

> Next, I should review the provided sources to see if they explicitly support this mapping. The BMJ Global Health meta-narrative on vaccine equity contrasts vaccine nationalism, rooted in communitarianism, with vaccine cosmopolitanism, which is tied to distributive justice and the irrelevance of community membership in allocating benefits, a stance that aligns with moral cosmopolitanism's universalist, justice-oriented logic rather than political, cultural, or economic framings [^8a4c8064]. Let me also consider the human rights angle: multiple high-credibility sources frame global health equity and vaccine access as matters of international human rights obligations and distributive justice, which are canonical expressions of moral cosmopolitan duties rather than purely political or economic cosmopolitanism [^1b025268] [^8e0a4b42].

> I will now examine the alternatives to ensure I'm not missing a better fit. Political cosmopolitanism focuses on global institutions, governance, and legal frameworks; while it can encode moral duties, its primary emphasis is on political structure rather than the direct moral obligation to assist individuals in poverty, so it is less specific to the question's wording than moral cosmopolitanism. Cultural cosmopolitanism emphasizes cross-cultural engagement and respect for diversity; it does not inherently entail a duty to alleviate poverty or promote human rights, so it does not match the obligation language in the prompt. Economic cosmopolitanism relates to global markets and trade; again, it lacks the explicit moral imperative to assist the poor and advance rights that the question requires.

> Wait, let me verify that I'm not overstating the source support. The vaccine cosmopolitanism literature and the human rights–based approaches to global health repeatedly invoke universal moral duties, equity, and rights that transcend national boundaries, which is the essence of moral cosmopolitanism, even if the exact phrase "moral cosmopolitanism" is not always used verbatim in those public health sources [^8a4c8064] [^1b025268] [^8e0a4b42]. This pattern of usage, together with the philosophical taxonomy, supports selecting moral cosmopolitanism as the best answer here.

> Putting this together, the most common and directly aligned form of cosmopolitanism that asserts an obligation to assist those in need because of poverty and to promote basic human rights is moral cosmopolitanism. Therefore, the correct choice is A. moral.

---

The most common form of cosmopolitanism is **moral cosmopolitanism**, which asserts that individuals have universal obligations to assist those in need due to poverty and to promote basic human rights, regardless of nationality or proximity. This view is widely reflected in global health ethics, humanitarian principles, and international human rights frameworks that emphasize **cross-border duties of justice and compassion** [^1b025268] [^8e0a4b42].

---

## Definition and core principles of moral cosmopolitanism

Moral cosmopolitanism is a philosophical stance that **extends moral concern and obligation beyond national borders**, asserting that all individuals are entitled to equal moral consideration and that those in a position to help have a duty to assist others in need, particularly those suffering from poverty or injustice [^notfound]. Key principles include:

- **Universal moral concern**: Every individual, regardless of nationality, race, or social status, possesses inherent dignity and moral worth [^d0fefcf5].
- **Global justice**: There is a moral obligation to address global inequalities, including poverty, lack of access to healthcare, and human rights violations [^8e457e87].
- **Cross-border obligations**: Those with the capacity to assist have a duty to help those in need, transcending national boundaries [^1b025268].

---

## Evidence from global health ethics

Global health ethics extensively reflects moral cosmopolitan principles, particularly in discussions of **equity, justice, and international cooperation** [^246cd9ee]. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted these principles through debates on vaccine equity and the moral imperative to ensure fair access to vaccines globally [^8a4c8064]. Vaccine cosmopolitanism, for instance, emphasizes distributive justice and the irrelevance of national boundaries in allocating life-saving resources [^8a4c8064].

---

## Human rights frameworks and international cooperation

International human rights law **embodies moral cosmopolitanism** by establishing universal standards for dignity, equality, and justice [^8e0a4b42]. Instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) articulate obligations of states to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights, including the right to health, education, and an adequate standard of living [^8e0a4b42]. These frameworks emphasize **international cooperation and assistance**, aligning with the cosmopolitan principle that those in a position to help have a duty to assist others [^1b025268].

---

## Comparison with other forms of cosmopolitanism

While moral cosmopolitanism focuses on **universal moral obligations**, other forms of cosmopolitanism emphasize different aspects:

| **Form of cosmopolitanism** | **Focus** | **Relation to poverty and human rights** |
|-|-|-|
| Political cosmopolitanism | Global governance, institutions, and legal frameworks | Supports international cooperation and human rights but primarily through political structures [^notfound] |
| Cultural cosmopolitanism | Cross-cultural exchange, diversity, and tolerance | Promotes understanding and respect but does not directly address poverty or human rights obligations [^notfound] |
| Economic cosmopolitanism | Global economic integration, trade, and markets | Addresses economic interdependence but does not inherently imply moral obligations to assist the poor [^notfound] |

---

Moral cosmopolitanism is the most directly aligned with the **obligation to assist those in poverty and promote human rights**, as it explicitly asserts universal moral duties transcending national boundaries [^notfound].

---

## Criticisms and challenges

Despite its widespread acceptance, moral cosmopolitanism faces several criticisms and challenges:

- **Implementation difficulties**: Translating universal moral obligations into practical policies and actions is complex, particularly in the face of national sovereignty and political interests [^0e2a54cb].
- **Cultural relativism**: Critics argue that universal moral principles may conflict with cultural values and traditions, necessitating careful balance between universalism and cultural sensitivity [^2fa51f6b].
- **Resource constraints**: Limited resources and competing priorities often hinder the fulfillment of cosmopolitan obligations, raising questions about fairness and feasibility [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Moral cosmopolitanism is the most common and widely accepted form of cosmopolitanism, emphasizing **universal moral obligations** to assist those in need due to poverty and to promote basic human rights [^notfound]. It is reflected in global health ethics, international human rights law, and humanitarian principles, asserting that those in a position to help have a duty to assist others, regardless of nationality or proximity [^1b025268] [^8e0a4b42].

### Vaccine equity in COVID-19: a meta-narrative review [^8a4c8064]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Meta-narrative 3: vaccine nationalism

Five included articles discussed vaccine nationalism'. accine nationalism' is a term frequently used in the press and research when discussing COVID-19 vaccine distribution. It is directly related to the ethical dilemmas arising from the pandemic and stems from the self-interest of nation states. In essence, it describes the situation in which countries take on responsibilities solely concerning the situation within their borders. It is often contrasted with the position of 'vaccine cosmopolitanism'.

According to Tandon, vaccine nationalism and cosmopolitanism originate from different political ideologies. Vaccine nationalism stems from communitarianism as it is shaped by the idea that belonging to different communities informs moral obligations. In contrast, vaccine cosmopolitanism relies on utilitarianism, which measures the outcome of vaccination by general global well-being without division into separate parties. However, other authors challenge definitions that are based solely on utilitarian perspectives. Two articles included in this meta-narrative pair it with the term 'distributive justice'. Ferguson and Caplandefine vaccine cosmopolitanism as a view in which community membership (eg, citizenship) is irrelevant in achieving distributive justice. This relates directly to the distribution of vaccines distinguishing between what is equitable and what is equality. According to Bolcato et al', equitable' in the context of distributive justice refers to proportionate distribution according to need, hence it refers to the process itself and priorities must be set in proportion to the reduction of risk for the greatest number of people in a given population at a given time. Equality (vaccine administration for all) is defined as guaranteeing the entire population equal protection against infection through vaccination campaigns that take into account equitable access in line with needs of populations, communities and individuals.

### Equity without human rights: a false COVID-19 narrative? [^1b025268]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

This is not to say that a framing on equity is not needed. It very much is. Equity is an ethical concept grounded in the principle of distributive justice.WHO defines equity as 'the absence of avoidable or remediable differences among groups of people, whether those groups are defined socially, economically, demographically, or geographically'. In operational terms 'pursuing equity in health means eliminating health disparities that are systematically associated with underlying social disadvantage or marginalization'. But who decides what is equitable? And according to what criteria?

So what do human rights offer? Equity in approach is needed ultimately to achieve equality in result. Healthcare in the event of sickness for all people, as well as the prevention, treatment and control of diseases, are central features of the right to the highest attainable standard of health as recognised in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which has over 170 States Parties. In recent years, WHO, the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health, civil society organisations, academics and many others have provided guidance on operationalising the right to health.

The key elements of this approach include an emphasis on the implementation of relevant national and international human rights laws, norms and standards as underlying a country's legal obligations, not as matters of goodwill or philanthropy but of law; recognition that obligations such as those to ensure equality and non-discrimination are subject to neither resource constraints nor progressive realisation, but are of immediate effect. Applied to this context, while realisable over time, this would mean countries have an obligation to avoid discrimination of any sort in access to COVID-19 vaccines and are accountable for their actions. In the context of vaccine distribution, particularly relevant also is the international human rights law tenet that speaks to the obligations of nation states beyond their borders, that is, to their responsibilities to international assistance and cooperation, akin to their domestic obligations, not subsidiary or secondary in any way.

### A glossary of policy frameworks: the many forms of' universalism' and policy' targeting' [^38e1941b]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2017). Low credibility.

The recognition that certain characteristics (such as poverty, disadvantage or membership of marginalised social or cultural groups) can make individuals more susceptible to illness has reignited interest in how to combine universal programmes and policies with ones targeted at specific groups. However, 'universalism' and 'targeting' are used in different ways for different purposes. In this glossary, we define different types and approaches to universalism and targeting. We anticipate that greater clarity in relation to what is meant by 'universalism' and 'targeting' will lead to a more nuanced debate and practice in this area.

### Meeting the needs of underserved populations: setting the agenda for more inclusive citizen science of medicine [^869534e5]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2019). Medium credibility.

In its expansion to genomic, epidemiological and biomedical research, citizen science has been promoted as contributing to the democratisation of medical research and healthcare. At the same time, it has been criticised for reinforcing patterns of exclusion in health and biomedicine, and sometimes even creating new ones. Although citizen science has the potential to make biomedical research more inclusive, the benefits of current citizen science initiatives are not equally accessible for all people-in particular those who are resource-poor, located outside of traditional networks of healthcare services, or members of minorities and marginalised groups. In view of growing public investments in participatory research endeavours, we argue that it should be considered more explicitly if, and how, citizen science could help make research more inclusive, contribute to the public good, and possibly even lead to better and more equitable healthcare. Reflecting on emerging ethical concerns for scientific conduct and best medical practice, we propose a set of relevant considerations for researchers, practitioners, bioethicists, funders and participants who seek to advance ethical practices of citizen-led health initiatives, and address profound differences in position, privilege and power in research.

### Disability, culture and the U.N. convention [^2fa51f6b]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

Is the universality of human rights, such as those set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, incompatible with therapeutic strategies of respecting cultural differences? I show that universalism is essential to the notion of human rights, as well as the rarely explained, political slogan of 'the rights approach to disability'. Similarly, culture responsiveness is commonly defended by therapists. I argue that the conflict between universalism of rights and cultural sensitivity exist only if these positions are expressed in extreme form: rights absolutism and cultural relativity. If more sensibly spelled out — in the form of progressive realisation of rights and situational sensitivity of difference — there is no conflict at all. Indeed, these more reasonable positions are mutually supportive. I conclude that, given resource and other constraints, the realisation of human rights will always be a matter of political negotiation, and that a social commitment to equality demands that we ensure that only transparent, fully-informed and fully-participatory procedures, respectful of difference [are employed]. These principles should guide us when we have to make hard choices in the implementation of human rights.

### The pandemic treaty, the pandemic fund, and the global commons: our scepticism [^0e2a54cb]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

COVID-19 revealed the limitations of the International Health Regulations

When the WHO declared SARS-CoV-2, the virus which caused COVID-19 disease a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the WHO's highest alarm in response to an infectious disease outbreak, 'none of us will be safe until everyone is safe' was the mantra for rallying global solidarity. The rapid spread of the virus beyond the walls of China signified an imminent danger and the cosmopolitan norms embedded in WHO's IHR was seen as central to international cooperation among states. The IHR which was last revised in 2005 under article 21 of WHO's constitution and entered into force in 2007 has been a key mechanism for global health emergency governance. Among other functions, the IHR empowers the WHO Director General to declare a PHEIC and make temporary recommendations in a way that minimises interference to international travels and trade.

Yet, for COVID-19, despite WHO's plea for collective action, state-centred, nationalistic responses prevailed. Many countries deviated from WHO's recommendations, abandoned platitudes of solidarity and pursued isolationist policies. We saw near total shutdown of borders, bans on export of medical supplies and the rise of 'vaccine nationalism'. Even though such policies proved to be ineffective, they conflict with science and produce grossly inequitable outcomes.

COVID-19 further exploited the geopolitical cracks between the major powers, centred on the origin of the virus and demonstrated the limitations of multilateral institutions in coordinating nation-states. These challenges impeded WHO's efforts to mount an effective global response and prevented poorer countries with low economic and political bargaining power in accessing essential medical supplies. As Fidler argues, COVID-19 shredded 'the perennial claim that a harmony of interests exists between low-income and high-income countries on health security'.

### Is it about the 'where' or the ' how'? Comment on… [^6ba16674]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Why practise somewhere else?

The authors raise relevant and justifiable concerns regarding some common assumptions among global health practitioners. First, we agree that the oft-assumed 'expertise gradient' is problematic and maintains an ill-conceived notion of the foreign expert. This presumes that global health is practised by foreign experts in distant lands, flowing directionally from high-income experts to low-income recipients. While we reject this notion, we acknowledge the importance of exchanging knowledge and sharing experiences. In fact, health problems are often shared, transcend geographical boundaries, and can be better addressed by working together across various cultural, social or political perspectives. Moreover, highlighting the assumption that those from outside have more valuable knowledge suggests that the authors have not adequately acknowledged the increasing trend to work in partnership with governments and local organisations, placing local and foreign expertise on at least the same level. Thus, how global health is practised is, in our view, just as important as where it is practised.

Second, working somewhere else may result in someone having less cultural proficiency or professional regulation — rendering them less accountable to their intended beneficiaries — than when working at home. While this is certainly a problem when it occurs abroad, it is important to note that accountability issues can also arise at home. Marginalised, vulnerable or at-risk populations, including those within high-income countries, are intervened on without the same ability to demand accountability of the person or organisation delivering the intervention. Furthermore, emerging trends in global health rely increasingly on a country-level or regional-level expertise, rather than bringing advisors from further afield who may lack contextual understanding. We therefore contend that, once again, the how is just as important as the where in this context.

Third, the global health industry often preserves its idealistic desire to 'help' at the expense of efficiency. It is certainly important to consider how resources are being consumed, particularly in resource-constrained areas. Yet we should also consider how resource constraint is a direct result of historical events such as slavery, colonisation and the development of the neoliberal economic order, the resultant moral obligation of which should account for at least some of the justification of global health interventions. Thus, global health practitioners should be sensitive to such histories and work towards redressing these structural ills, for example, through systems advocacy and strengthening.

### Time to clarify state obligations and accountability on NCDs with human rights instruments [^d473e28c]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Many commentators credit the human rights framework as the bedrock of AIDS progress over the past four decades. Rights-based approaches have been similarly effective in global efforts to curb tobacco consumption and realise reproductive and sexual health. Although demanded by activists, creating an enabling legal environment and addressing the structural constraints to good health, are considered to be the responsibility of the state, with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) now accounting for more than 70% of global deaths each year, and with more than 85% of premature NCD deaths occurring in low-income and middle-income countries.NCDs have gained greater prominence on many countries' policy agendas. The first High-Level Meeting of the UN General Assembly on Prevention and Control of NCDs, held in 2011, added significant momentum. In the lead-up to the Meeting, the NCD Alliance published a paper on NCDs and human rights. Among other things, it asserted that 'The human right to health provides a universal normative framework to design and assess health care and health determinants in relation to NCDs'. Further arguing that 'The promotion and protection of human rights must be integrated into national NCD policies'.

### Social justice as a foundation for democracy and health [^8e457e87]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Justice in the covid-19 pandemic

The covid-19 pandemic demonstrates that the fundamental determinant of an effective national response is whether a country operates a justice framework. This is because protecting and promoting the central health capabilities — preventing premature mortality and avoidable morbidity — for all is a problem of justice not politics. Justice, not politics, forms the foundation of what citizens owe each other and what leaders owe citizens.

Effective pandemic preparedness, the ability to anticipate, detect, and coordinate response and recovery, is a collective capability. Pandemic risk reduction is a global common good that benefits all nations and individuals; it is a duty. The moral obligation for reducing pandemic risk lies with national governments, which are best positioned to coordinate across levels and sectors of governance. National governments fulfil this obligation through humane, effective, and efficient action. An effective pandemic response also requires individual capabilities — citizens doing their part to reduce contagion.

Fulfilling this moral obligation requires ethical leadership. Ethical leadership, in both leaders and citizens, is necessary for a just society and for effective political institutions because people's and systems' capabilities are what determine whether public health policy succeeds or fails. Ethical leadership's hallmarks are honesty, transparency, impartiality, and integrity. Ethical leaders promote ethical beliefs and values and show regard for all people. They are committed to the common good.

From a justice viewpoint, national governments that sought to fulfil their moral obligation to act according to the current state of knowledge in pandemic preparedness were more successful in dealing with covid-19 than those who failed to do so. This is because countries that internalised the positive duty to develop and implement systems to reduce threats to and safeguard individuals' and communities' ability to flourishwere more successful in preparing for, preventing, and controlling covid-19. Successful nations set ethical standards for building and operating robust public health systems for resilient individuals and communities. Without ethical standards, neither democratic nor authoritarian political systems can be effective in a pandemic response.

### A human rights approach to an international code of conduct for genomic and clinical data sharing [^d0fefcf5]. Human Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

Possible objections to a human rights framework

Situating a code of conduct within a human rights framework faces some objections. First, some may argue that human rights or international codes or declarations can only be, at best, an amalgamation of minimalist or vague claims to achieve international consensus, or, at worst, merely a culturally imperialist Western ideological construct (Benatar). We think, on the contrary, that all people are entitled to basic rights by the mere fact of their human condition. To be human is to possess certain fundamental rights, regardless of one's status. Let us recall that essentially all of the world's countries have ratified the UDHR, which itself was drafted by members composed of varying religious and philosophical and cultural traditions, and 160 countries have ratified the ICESCR. The fundamental rights contained in the UDHR and ICESCR are not imposing one cultural standard. Rather, they are setting a baseline legal standard that all individuals and peoples can invoke to ensure basic human dignity and, quoting the Preamble of the UDHR, to establish the conditions "for freedom, justice and peace in the world" (United Nations). Also, rather than being culturally imperialist, human rights entail international cooperation: "It is particularly incumbent upon those States which are in a position to assist others" to help provide access to and use of science and technology (United Nations, Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights). Responsibly sharing genomic and clinical data around the globe is an important component of international cooperation and assistance that reflects not a Western ideological construct but a belief in human solidarity.

### A call to action: considerations for pediatricians in post-roe health… [^4bdd7275]. AAP (2022). Medium credibility.

Meredithe McNamara, MD, MS, FAAP August 11, 2022 Medical consensus holds that comprehensive reproductive health care is a basic human right. However, we now face a worsening reality in which many pediatricians across the U. S. cannot offer the full spectrum of this care to their patients. Abortion restriction deepens health and income disparities for those underserved Black, Hispanic and American Indian or Alaska Native individuals are more likely to die in pregnancy and childbirth than White women. LBGTQ individuals and persons with disabilities experience increased barriers to reproductive health care. Individuals who live in poverty or in rural locations face steeper financial barriers when long-distance travel, time off work, and time away from family is necessary to obtain abortion. Research has shown that those who seek and do not receive abortion services experience greater economic hardship and higher rates of poverty after carrying an undesired pregnancy to term.

New restrictions on abortion access will deepen income disparities and further entrench the most vulnerable in poverty. We as pediatricians know that the effects of childhood poverty can lead to lifelong negative health outcomes. Consider the cost. With the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, access to contraception, including emergency contraception, is covered by most health insurance plans. However, recent Supreme Court rulings now permit religious exemptions for contraception coverage by private insurance plans. Therefore, pediatricians need to consider the possibility of insurance coverage gaps and potential out-of-pocket costs. Financial resources are available if needed. Again, consider the cost. Some states have enacted laws which do not allow any insurance program to pay for abortion services. Therefore, it is critical to connect individuals with private abortion funds, that subsidize the cost of services and travel.

Federally funded Title X family planning services are also a critical resource for individuals whose insurance will not cover reproductive care or are uninsured. However, some states restrict Title X funding. "We face an immediate, unprecedented crisis in this post-Roe world and pediatricians have a crucial role to play. Our patients will look to us for guidance and support, and it is incumbent upon us to meet their needs. " A pediatricians' critical role in a post-Roe reality. As pediatricians, we must play an active role in ensuring that all individuals have access to safe, comprehensive reproductive health care, including abortions. *The views expressed in this article are those of the author, and not necessarily those of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

### Flourishing: migration and health in social context [^d1e458aa]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Flourishing: Implications for Global Health Clinicians, Systems and Policies

These insights have implications for clinical care, clinical training and health policy and planning. When migrants are consigned to positions of structural vulnerability that endanger their health and limit their ability to access healthcare, and when they are portrayed as less deserving than others of the resources needed to achieve their full potential, health stakeholders have a moral and ethical obligation to look, and think, beyond the confines of the clinical encounter.

Clinicians and healthcare institutions can bolster migrant patients' opportunities to flourish in multiple ways.

Clinicians, clinicians in training and others employed in health settings and health organisations should be trained in structural competency and cultural humility. With these tools in hand, providers and health institutions can better recognise how laws and policies, power dynamics, material needs and sociocultural and religious obligations can influence clinical encounters and health trajectories. As a result, they will be better equipped to confront obstacles to flourishing and health that stem from language and sociocultural differences, bureaucracy, discrimination and poverty.
Healthcare providers must learn to recognise that flourishing means different things to different people in different communities — and ask questions that can help them understand and work to meet their patients' needs. This means taking time to understand why migrant patients' needs or concerns may diverge from routine clinical care, and to consider with an open mind why patients may be unable or unwilling to meet clinicians' expectations or follow recommendations.
On a related note, health providers and institutions must develop the skills and infrastructure needed for effective partnership and collaboration between care providers and non-medical organisations and institutions — including stakeholders in law, public health and human rights. Clinical interventions alone will not promote flourishing — or health — among migrant patients. But clinicians can develop new modes of 'prescribing' — for instance, by using integrative healing strategies in the same way some primary care clinicians prescribe food, and some paediatricians prescribe books or reading. They can partner with rights organisations to document abuses that harm migrants' health, violate their rights and diminish their capacity to realise their full potential. Legal–medical partnerships can help confront upstream obstacles to flourishing and health by calling attention to root causes and political determinants. Finally, integrative care models that work across medical, legal, social, cultural and/or religious sectors (eg, women-friendly spaces, self-care interventions based on a logic of 'expert-patients', approaches to 'syndemic care') can serve as useful models.
Health professionals and healthcare organisations can work to transform social, economic and structural circumstances that impede flourishing and harm health — for migrants and for other vulnerable patients and communities. Clinicians can use their social position to engage in collective organising to support vulnerable migrant groups and others who have been ignored or harmed by the determining impact of social, political and economic circumstances. Both within their institutions and in broader public and policy conversations, care providers and healthcare institutions can insist on naming, documenting and tackling health inequities that simultaneously harm their patients' health and curtail their capacity to shape their futures and realise their full potential. Avenues of action include professional associations, NGOs like 'Physicians for Human Rights-Israel', networks like 'Medibüro Berlin' in Germanyand movements like 'White Coats for Black Lives' in the USA.

### How should morality play a role in global health? [^246cd9ee]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Moral determinants of global health

Moral determinants of health are extensively discussed in the context of individual and public health but have received less attention in global health and humanitarianism. Berwick highlighted the critical role of morality in shaping health outcomes and emphasised the need for a more robust ethical framework in addressing systemic inequities. Berwick argued that moral determinants such as fairness, justice and compassion are foundational to achieving health equity but are often overlooked in health policy contexts, where operational and technical priorities tend to dominate decision-making.

Morality in global health refers to the application of ethical principles and values such as justice, equity and compassion to guide decision-making and actions in health initiatives that impact diverse populations across the world. It involves addressing disparities, ensuring equitable access to healthcare and upholding the dignity and rights of individuals while navigating cultural, social and economic complexities.

Though often used interchangeably, moral determinants differ from social or structural determinants. Social and structural determinants are external factors, including poverty, education, housing and structural injustices, which shape health outcomes. Moral determinants, on the other hand, look at ethical choices, incentives and systems of values that guide the way decisions are made, priorities are set and policies are enforced within those structural environments.

Ethical opinions of such issues vary along the continuum: on one end is moral absolutism, the viewing of some actions as always right or always wrong; on the other is moral relativism, the belief that ethical assessments are situationally and culturally determined. Between these is moral objectivity, an effort to establish universal ethics but also an awareness of variation across cultures. Synthesising these perspectives is needed to develop ethically grounded interventions and policies that resonate with global health objectives while also honouring the diverse values of the populations they aim to benefit.

While the ideal of global health emphasises health equity and population well-being, suggesting a moral agenda, this ideal often remains more aspirational than actionable. It is reasonable to expect that a curriculum in global health would give due prominence to morality; human rights; ethics; and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). However, these principles are not always taught with the emphasis they merit. Foundational documents such as the 'United Nations Charter' and the 'Red Cross Code of Conduct' lay out a clear moral imperative to promote and protect health for all, grounded in humanitarian principles of impartiality, neutrality and human dignity.

### Disproportionate infection, hospitalisation and death from COVID-19 in ethnic minority groups and indigenous peoples: an application of the priority public health conditions analytical framework [^3233bf52]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

People from ethnic minority and Indigenous groups and have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The reasons for this are complex but relate to health inequity with large-scale social, political, and economic disadvantages that accumulate across the life course and are passed through generations.

Ethnicity is a social construct. An "ethnic minority group" can meet one or more of the following criteria: the group is numerically smaller than the rest of the population; it is not in a [social, economic, or politically] dominant position; it has a culture, language, religion or ethnicity that is distinct from that of the majority; and its members have a will to preserve those characteristics. The ways in which people are categorised into ethnic groups are racialised social processes, which vary across socio-historical contexts, and despite being abstract in nature, these social processes can manufacture tangible harms for racialised groups. The authors acknowledge that dedicated United Nations human rights bodies have the mandate to promote and protect Indigenous Peoples' rights, as well as differing national status due to treaty obligations in some countries.

### Grassroots organisations and the sustainable development goals: no one left behind? [^312c2aa7]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Grassroots involvement in social accountability initiatives

The term "social accountability", which became popular in the early 2000s, is used to describe initiatives designed to use new forms of civic engagement to promote reform. Pressure by citizens can help to stimulate government responsiveness. Social accountability is seen as a form of democracy building. It develops the ability of citizens to demand democratic change at the same time as enabling government institutions to respond to those demands. Social accountability is evolving and includes different types of intervention — for example, citizen monitoring of public services, social audits, and participatory budgeting.

In general, social accountability initiatives are the product of alliances between grassroots organisations and intermediaries, such as non-governmental organisations, think tanks, professional associations, or other organisations. The grassroots organisation provides a connection to the population. The intermediaries provide structure and resources, such as training, organisational models, research, or assistance with advocacy, to help establish and maintain an initiative.

Grassroots organisations have unique strengths. Many have long been involved in struggles over structural inequality and the promotion of human rights. They can bring a distinct awareness of inequities that are, from other perspectives, either normalised or invisible. By providing details of their experience of inadequate services and by calling for accountability, they can challenge the marginalisation that their communities experience.

In addition, grassroots members are well positioned to communicate directly with local and regional governments. The 2016 report of the high level political forum on sustainable development noted that regional governments "have a front role to play in securing the safety, wellbeing, and livelihoods of communities, including by providing basic services".

### Engaging globally with how to achieve healthy societies: insights from India, Latin America and east and Southern Africa [^0d3d8cd4]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Paradigm choices take us to significantly different futures

We are more informed than ever of the challenges we face to healthy societies in our way of life, production and consumption patterns, environmental degradation and in the extreme social inequality generated in the current global political economy. By the 2020s, two profound global conditions with significant local and national impact provide a useful insight on the critical point we have reached for the way we think and act on these challenges.

The first, the COVID-19 pandemic, is providing evidence of the insufficiency of and inequity generated by reactive, nationally self-protective, singularly biomedical-focused approaches to health emergencies. Such approaches ignore and thus fail to remedy the deeper structural drivers of 'emergencies'. They discount the critical contribution of comprehensive, equity-and rights-based, participatory and ecological approaches, or of a reassertion of early ideas of reciprocity and collective interests in health.

A second challenge lies in climate change and extreme biodiversity losses, their existential threat to healthy societies and the proactive reciprocal, collective cooperation they call for. As these planetary threats become increasingly immediate and more widely understood, they are stimulating a new understanding of interdependency; new forms of international cooperation reflecting collective interests and new demands to tackle the vested interests and power imbalances that undermine sustainable and equitable patterns of production and consumption, reasserting early ideas of health demanding harmony with nature.

Pandemics and climate change as manifestations of global crises show a potential of significantly different futures in the dominant thinking about and shaping of healthy societies. We live in a Gramscian moment of old and new ideas, where health threats are responded to by reviving old coercive public health approaches that leave many determinants unaddressed, even while new frameworks for global cooperation and collective responsibilities are advocated.

At this critical moment of choice, the social constructivist analysis suggests that we look not only to ideas advanced by elites and states for what assumes dominance, but also to those promoted by social actors. A key driver of healthy societies may thus be when sufficient people in communities, countries, regions and global institutions converge in seeing an unhealthy status quo as no longer acceptable; when we have generated the space and processes to fairly share and build ideas that benefit, are understood and embraced by the wider public; and when we have the confidence and assert the collective power to produce change.

### Promoting the well-being of older people in Ethiopia: lost opportunities due to the poverty of policy [^1595ebd6]. Innovation in Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

If ageism is alive and well in nations that provide an array of supports for their older citizens, it is not surprising that ageism is a core barrier to policy development around the support of older adults in Global South nations. Despite the Ethiopian government ratifying various international documents relating to human rights, points out that in practice, the Ethiopian government tends to operate under the long-standing notion of the community and not the national government as the duty bearer for social protection of citizens. However, there is some evidence of change as the mass media in Ethiopia has helped to raise awareness of social protection as a basic human right.

With a base of income support, geriatric health care, and social support, older adults can contribute to their communities in myriad ways. In nations where ageism is less of an impediment to policy development, there are an array of support programs for older adults including congregate and long-term care housing options, social clubs and peer companion programs and cultural centers, and opportunities for older adults to tutor youth and serve their communities in many capacities.

In Ethiopia, there are some successful small-scale models of elder care and contribution that can be expanded. On the local level, an informal system of insurance known as iddir provides protection for financial risks such as crop failure or death. Community members contribute to a common savings pool that can be drawn from in times of need. In the absence of formal, public resources, iddirs serve as an indigenous arrangement to assist community members. It is common for iddirs to be led by older members of the community. Another example of local leadership involving older adults in Ethiopia is the system of restorative justice. Disputes are settled most often outside of court with input from local leaders who are often older adults. Although older adults have the leadership capacity and wisdom to bring about positive change for older adults in Ethiopia, a critical missing ingredient is the political will to bring forth the necessary resources to enable older adults to contribute to their leadership capacity.

### Malnutrition: the silent pandemic [^a007511a]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Despite political platitudes that we are all in this together, the direct and indirect effects of covid-19 have disproportionally affected vulnerable groups.

Links between socioeconomic measures of poverty and childhood undernutrition are well documented. Without intervention, an estimated 140 million additional people will experience extreme poverty because of covid-19. The number of people in low and middle income counties facing acute food insecurity is also estimated to double to 265 million by the end of 2020. In many high and middle income countries obesity is more prevalent among poorer people, partly because of the affordability and availability of low quality food in areas of high vulnerability. People on low incomes from ethnic minorities are also experiencing an unequal burden of covid-19 infections, hospital admissions, and mortality, highlighting and compounding existing inequalities.

Calls have been made for a new type of "herd immunity" that comes from redesigning social and economic systems to tackle the root causes of health inequities. Ending malnutrition in all its forms is fundamental to this approach, and critical to tackling the worlds' biggest health challenges — from non-communicable diseases to antimicrobial resistance.

There are no simple solutions, but we know a great deal about how to end malnutritionand how to promote good nutrition during the pandemic. Yet underlying all forms of malnutrition are economic and social models that promote profit over social prosperity and do little to meet the needs of the most vulnerable people. Only when a healthy nutritious diet is seen as a basic right, and people are treated as citizens rather than consumers, will we truly be in a position to end malnutrition.

### A right to health: medicine as Western cultural imperialism? [^97073dea]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

Western medicine is intrinsically tied with modern Western culture, and as such is foreign to many African cultures. Relying on personal observations from working in Angola as a physiotherapist as well as secondary research, the author explores the divide between Angolan culture and medical practices which are deeply rooted in scientific research. Most strikingly, the author finds that concepts of evidence-based medicine as well as individual human or patients' rights contain aspects foreign to Angolan culture. Illustrative examples are given of differences in attitudes towards finances and religion in relation to medicine. Finally, the author proposes that factors such as poverty and illiteracy can play an important role in differences in practices and customs commonly seen as being strictly tied to culture. Although medicine does carry with it components of Western culture, there may be positive components of medicine that non-Westerners would like to adopt. This article suggests that Westerners and Angolans can combine beneficial aspects of Angolan culture with medicine to improve health care for the people of Angola.

### Conflict, sanctions and the struggles of Syrians for food security in the shadow of the UN food systems summit 2021 [^5afa4fcf]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Sanctions — the future

According to UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights, the world is facing an extraordinary expansion in the scope, grounds, purposes, targets, means and the extraterritoriality of unilateral sanctions. Douhan argues that this is taking place due to the absence of a universally recognised definition of what UCMs constitute. She claims this has resulted in an increasing violation of the rule of law by states with serious humanitarian consequences.

unilateral measures may be taken by states or regional organisations only in compliance with international legal standards: if they were authorised by the Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, in response to a breach of peace, a threat to peace or an act of aggression; if they did not violate any international treaty or customary norm of international law or if their wrongfulness was excluded in accordance with international law in the course of countermeasures, in full compliance with the rules of law of international responsibility, including the obligation to guarantee that fundamental human rights were not violated. Unilateral sanctions that did not satisfy the above criteria constituted UCMs and were illegal under international law and characterised the majority of UCMs being applied at present.

As a result, innocent civilians experience their economic, social and health impacts. The focus of the UNFSS, for example, is about the right to sustainable food but as with people from many parts of the world we question whether UCMS have much to do with protection of human rights or rather more to do with an abysmally failed geopolitical strategy primarily aimed to furthering economic and political interests of 'western' powers. However, it is citizens who ultimately suffer from the resulting lack of investment in basic services and infrastructure that has triggered an ongoing humanitarian and health crisis. Given the legacy of a conflict that has ripped apart a country and its people for more than 10 years, leaving 6.2 million people internally displaced and over 12 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, it is staggering that civilians must face further suffering, inflicted and compounded manifold by UCMs. They cannot be labelled as were the victims of sanctions on Iraq as 'collateral damage' whose effects on children in Syria are highlighted by WHO's support for severely malnourished children through its stabilisation programmes in different regions of the country.

### Use of human rights to meet the unmet need for family planning [^f47ad884]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

In this report, we describe how human rights can help to shape laws, policies, programmes, and projects in relation to contraceptive information and services. Applying a human rights perspective and recognising the International Conference on Population and Development and Millennium Development Goal commitments to universal access to reproductive health including family planning, we support measurement of unmet need for family planning that encompasses more groups than has been the case until recently. We outline how human rights can be used to identify, reduce, and eliminate barriers to accessing contraception; the ways in which human rights can enhance laws and policies; and governments' legal obligations in relation to contraceptive information and services. We underline the crucial importance of accountability of states and identify some of the priorities for making family planning available that are mandated by human rights.

### What can one legitimately expect from a health system? A conceptual analysis and a proposal for research and action [^7f04411e]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Participation and contestation across different political systems and realities

It is important to acknowledge that the above discussion around the establishment of legitimacy of expectations from a health system assumes and refers to an 'ideal' liberal democratic context where participation and contestation are seen as basic citizen rights and spaces for participation are many, are formalised, and tend to have constitutional bases. Political systems vary in their degree of political space for citizen participation and in the bases, processes, and platforms for citizens to participate in public discourse and policy. For instance, one can expect this to be different across single-party political systems and dictatorships as in parts of the Middle East, Latin American and parts of East Asia, to two-party or multi-party systems in liberal democracies in different parts of the world. Therefore, we argue that any scholarship that seeks to understand the nature of contestation and participation (including but not limited to health services-related matters) needs to explicitly take into account the political system context. While it is not within the scope of this analysis to examine how the processes of contestation and participation for establishing 'legitimate' expectations varies across political systems, we propose this as an area for future research. As an illustration, we look at the case of some countries in East Asia that have single-party polities. In these countries, understandings of citizen participation (and contestation) in the public sphere are influenced by the doctrine of 'Minben', a distinctly paternalistic idea in which the power of the government is based on responding to the welfare of common people and not in extending autonomy or participation in government. Within the Minben doctrine, the scope of citizens' political participation is limited to conveying their concerns to political leaders, with leaders having the power and freedom to deviate from public opinion when implementing policy. In this way, governmental legitimacy is established through the outcomes of policy, rather than through fair elections, such as in liberal democracies. It is therefore important to recognise that, in such polities, prevailing political traditions may constrain or even prevent the creation of 'invited spaces' for citizen participation and contestation in public policy. Moreover, peoples' expectations of their role could also be shaped by these cultural and political traditions, and they may in fact regard political leaders as, 'guardians of their interests' (p. 129). This, in turn, could influence their desire to contest and participate.

### Ethical considerations: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement [^34ba83ab]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Ethical considerations — international responder cultural competence: We suggest international disaster responders have an ethical obligation to familiarize themselves with the predominant cultural and religious practices of the affected population. Ethical treatment of survivors entails a blend of knowledge about culture, religious beliefs, and human rights. Despite good intentions, humanitarian assistance has made errors based on religious or cultural insensitivity (eg, an overemphasis on an individualistic orientation that is alien to the local culture).

### Pharmaceutical governance system for costly drugs through human rights due diligence [^af558d9c]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Why use a human rights framework?

First, international human rights law is widely recognised and provides a strong foundation for the right to health. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, explicitly affirms the right to "the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health" (article 12) and other health-related social rights. Within Europe, other sources of relevant human rights law include the European Convention on Human Rightsand the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.

Second, human rights hold a special status as high priority norms and must be prioritised over rights under other legal rules related to intellectual property law and other economic rights. Although implementation of the right to health remains inconsistent — due to political, economic, and institutional barriers — there is a growing realisation that intellectual property laws and agreements and the interpretation of their rules must be informed by human rights.

Third, although human rights law creates direct legal obligations for governments to hold private actors accountable and promote human rights, it is increasingly recognised that all members of society — including corporations — must also respect and protect these rights. Corporations are deemed to have "responsibilities" instead of legal obligations, as international treaties do not directly bind them.

### A pandemic recap: lessons we have learned [^7cdd2f92]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Subjecting large numbers of people in certain low-income countries to economic sanctions that limit imports of vaccines, life-saving medications, and other medical equipment due to political conflicts or disagreements is immoral and unethical. It violates the basic human rights advocating that all humans are equal. Healthcare professionals and all respected medical societies and organizations should stand firmly against these sanctions that put innocent people's lives at risk and imply that their lives are less important than others.

Last but not least, sharing of health systems tools and facilities sharing must not be promoted in a subtle new form of colonization. In fact, healthcare facilities, structures and tools distribution from high-income systems to lower ones must be promoted together adequate and proportional growth in infrastructure. Healthcare promotion cannot be done without infrastructural, social and territorial implementation to allow the heath care actions to be effective.

To support "One globe one health" approach

To manage the ongoing pandemic crisis and to better anticipate the next one, it is of outmost importance to strengthen the foundations of an ecology of health, focusing on the interdependencies between the functioning of ecosystems, sociocultural practices and the health of human, animal and plant populations taken together. The system within we live in is a closed system. The more we dysregulate it, the more violent will be the reset to equilibrium.

So, the true prevention starts from understanding the deep connection among environment, use of resources and uncontrolled development. Even considering only the economical perspective and not the moral one, the cost of facing future subsequent pandemics could be even higher than reconsider worldwide the paradigm of an unstoppable economic growth.

Even considering the economical perspective and not the moral one, the cost of facing future subsequent global pandemics could be higher than the planned and anticipated economical gain that do not consider this approach.

### Adopting an ethical approach to migration health policy, practice and research [^86ae9b29]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Adopting an ethical approach to advancing migration health

Migration health is affected by decisions made at levels ranging from global to local, both within and beyond the health sector. These decisions impact issues such as healthcare seeking, entitlements, service delivery, policy making and knowledge production on migration health. It is key that ethical questions faced by decision makers are recognised and addressed in efforts to tackle the persisting challenges in migration health (exemplified in table 1).

Table 1
Ethical questions faced by decision makers on migration health

An ethical approach can provide methods to identify ethical issues, frameworks for systematising information and suggesting ethically acceptable solutions, and guidance on procedural concerns and legitimate decision making processe s. By unpacking dilemmas, conflicts of interests and values at stake, an ethical approach is relevant for all who make decisions about migration health policy and practice. In seeking transparent justification towards the best alternatives, ethics can assist in holding decision makers to account. Based on the ethical question that is at stake, the most relevant ethical guidance and tools should be used. Ongoing debates around the 'right' ethical approach demonstrate that decision makers should critically reflect on their choice of framework or method. For instance, principles used in clinical reasoning at a healthcare centremay differ from those emphasised by policy makers during a public health emergency. When facing real-life dilemmas on migration health decision makers should use various sources and frameworks.

In examining the dilemmas decision makers face on migration health (table 1), one may ask what the added value of an ethics approach is relative to the existing rights-based, public health and economic arguments. These approaches have different strengths and limitations; they put forward both intrinsic and instrumental arguments for mainstreaming migration health issues. Like human rights, ethics are concerned with dignity, equality and concern for vulnerable groups. Historically, human rights conventions have evolved as a framework for regulating the actions of governments, whereas ethics concerns 'specific actions, values, interests and relationships of individual health workers, researchers and organisations'. Human rights are formulated in broad, somewhat abstract terms, leaving open the precise way in which they should be implemented in the complex reality of practice 'on the ground'. An ethical approach, which explicitly recognises and discusses the values and norms at stake, equips its users with analytic tools and guidance on dealing with challenging dilemmas. Ethical and human rights approaches overlap in the sense that they both proceed from fundamental moral values, but they differ in the uses to which they are typically put.

### Creating child-inclusive societies [^8e101d2f]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2025). High credibility.

In a global landscape defined by polycrisis, children are being failed. To address this failure, we ask an ambitious yet fundamental question: how do we create child-inclusive societies where every child thrives and has the best start in life, where intergenerational disadvantage is redressed, and where child poverty is ended? Building on the power of the social determinants of health in advancing equity and human wellbeing, we argue that child inclusiveness requires three foundational actions linked to the political, commercial, and social determinants of health: (1) prioritising implementation of transformative collaboration between policy makers, public bodies, and communities to improve outcomes for children; (2) reclaiming the public good through child-centred regulatory frameworks that aim to deliver health care and improve wellbeing; and (3) valuing the time to care for children and to build meaningful and responsive relationships with them. With innovative thinking about our societies and their core values, we can design child-inclusive interventions and derive relevant metrics and indicators to track progress.

### How should morality play a role in global health? [^805cadf3]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Comparative analysis of moral frameworks in global health

Global health relies on various moral frameworks to address ethical dilemmas, allocate resources and guide decision-making. These frameworks — utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics, communitarianism and principlism — offer distinct approaches, each with strengths and limitations (table 1). A deeper understanding of these frameworks can help practitioners design more equitable and effective interventions.

Table 1
Comparative analysis of moral frameworks in global health

Utilitarianism emphasises maximising overall well-being by implementing actions that provide the greatest benefit to the largest number of people. This framework is widely used in global health for cost-effectiveness analysis, particularly in resource allocation during crises. Its strength lies in promoting efficiency and scalability; however, it often neglects marginalised groups, focusing on aggregate outcomes over individual rights.

Deontology focuses on adherence to moral rules or duties, emphasising the inherent value of individual rights regardless of outcomes. This framework ensures justice and non-discrimination in healthcare, making it essential in areas like clinical trials and access to treatment. For instance, ethical guidelines in trials uphold equal treatment for participants, irrespective of economic considerations. While deontology safeguards individual autonomy, it can lead to rigid decisions that may not account for the broader societal impact, such as prioritising lifesaving treatments based solely on duty rather than resource availability.

Virtue ethics highlights the moral character of individuals, advocating for virtues like empathy, compassion and integrity in global health practices. This framework is particularly relevant in humanitarian missions, where healthcare workers often face morally complex situations requiring personal judgement. Virtue ethics strengthens personal accountability and ethical behaviour but can be subjective, as cultural differences influence perceptions of virtues.

Communitarianism prioritises the values and well-being of the community over individual interests, making it effective in designing culturally sensitive health programmes. This approach builds trust by aligning interventions with local customs and traditions.

Principlism integrates four key ethical principles — autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice — into decision-making processes. It is particularly flexible, allowing for diverse ethical considerations in complex scenarios. For example, principlism is commonly applied in vaccine trials, where researchers must balance participant safety with societal benefits. Its strength lies in adaptability; however, competing principles can create dilemmas, such as prioritising justice over autonomy in scenarios where limited resources must be distributed equitably.

### Strategies for improving vaccine communication and uptake [^aa5cb71c]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Dismissal policies for vaccine-refusing families — ethical rationales and counterarguments are described, including that under a duty of easy rescue "herd immunity is a collective good and achieving herd immunity is a collective moral obligation… Dismissal policies, therefore, may be justified by disincentivizing parents from shirking this moral obligation", and a contractualism view in which vaccination is a "social contract" requiring individuals, "out of fairness", to accept "small burdens", with dismissal policies helping "uphold this social contract and limit the unfair distribution of the burdens of vaccinating". Noted weaknesses are that enforcing such obligations "requires additional justifications" relative to competing rights "such as the right to bodily integrity", and that uneven use "can create unequal burdens among clinicians and practices" and "unjustly redistribute the burdens of caring for unvaccinated patients". Proponents claim these policies "help convince the majority of vaccine-refusing parents to accept vaccines", are "needed to protect other children", and promote the "highest standard of medical care", yet "there is little empirical evidence for claims of positive outcomes", and key outcomes remain "unknown", including effects on likelihood of vaccination, where dismissed children receive care, and impacts on attitudes and population-level vaccination. Ethical objections center on the duty "to promote the well-being of the patient", with concerns that when permission is withheld "dismissing the parent and child from the practice arguably neglects this obligation", may leave some rural children with "little health care supervision", and may worsen disparities among "historically disenfranchised communities".

### 2020 American Heart Association and American college of cardiology consensus conference on professionalism and ethics: a consensus conference report [^554b4edc]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Social justice and health equity — Social justice is the belief in and commitment to the realization of access to quality health for all, and the principles of respect for individuals and justice require high-quality care to all patients regardless of underlying characteristics. Complicating this is the reality that as much as 80% of a person's health is determined by the social and economic conditions of their environment, termed the social determinants of health, and the World Health Organization asserts that the social conditions in which people are born, live and work are the single most important determinants of good or ill health. Rural-urban inequities persist, with a recent AHA presidential advisory noting that rural areas have higher death rates for cardiovascular disease and stroke than urban areas, and gaps are widening, and identifying mechanisms to address these disparities is seminal to effective health policy. Allyship is defined as the practice whereby a person or group in a privileged position seeks to operate with a marginalized person or group, and to achieve social justice and health equity, we must go to the margins by centering perspectives of marginalized groups. Cardiovascular clinicians and organizations must strive to support every person to attain their full health potential and to ensure that no one is disadvantaged from achieving their potential because of race, sex, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, education, social position, or other personal or socially determined circumstances.

### Situating support for people living with rarer forms of dementia [^cc802b87]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

… our online community, can help people with less common types of dementia to feel less isolated. If you're diagnosed with one of the less common causes of dementia, it may be harder to find people who understand the specifics of what you're going through. If they're mostly affected by Alzheimer's, vascular dementia or both – even if they can relate to many aspects of your experiences – you might also want to connect with people who know what it's like to live with your particular condition. (E1.i)

New bio-social groupings at the local, national and international levels filtered disease or condition specific information, education and other forms of support. As well, these groupings made visible dementia diversity and, for some, seemed to give people agency to combat dementia stigma or advocate for new forms of dementia support. These more recent bio-social groupings demonstrated further incongruence with the universal dementia support discourses.

Position E. Human rights, autonomy and dignity

The ideological positionings on human rights, autonomy and dignity are now more familiar within dementia discourse and were apparent within our data as indicated above. The messiness of the situation was especially apparent here. The right to receive support, assisted autonomy or interdependence, and living with dementia free from discrimination was shared across the universalistic and tailored positions. However, sundry conceptualizations of citizenship resulted in discursive tensions resulting from how people living with dementia were portrayed (e.g. powerless versus active agents), in what manner rights or autonomy were conveyed, and how these possibly shaped care and support systems. Nevertheless, this emphasis on citizenship in either position inferred that people affected had the right to services within an environment that challenged the social devaluation of PLWD. An excerpt from one national charter of rights for PLWD used a strengths-based approach to facilitate capabilities through meeting need, participation, growth and agency. Although the conditions necessary for action were left undeveloped as in this statement:

### Standing up for your birth rights: an intersectional comparison of obstetric violence and birth positions between quichua and Egyptian women [^3584d7b4]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Obstetric violence is a pervasive phenomenon in reproductive health across the world. Denial of the choice in birth position is a common form of obstetric violence as horizontal positions are non-evidence based, yet routinely imposed. This contributes to the cultural barriers to access reproductive health care. The present study compares women's experiences in childbirth from the Quichua and Egyptian communities, exploring the intersectional factors that contribute to obstetric violence and the adoption of preferred birth positions to offer recommendations on implementing respectful and rights-based reproductive care. Two independent scoping reviews have been carried out and subsequently compared. The intersectional approach revealed how gender, race, and class have a multiplicative effect on the denial of choice in birth position as a form of obstetric violence. This phenomenon exacerbates the pre-existing health disparities that disproportionately affect women, indigenous and racialized groups, and people living in poverty. Culturally competent, multilevel, and multidisciplinary interventions, strengthening of health systems, and community participation are essential to combat discrimination and guarantee birth rights. Allowing women to choose their birth position is a low-hanging fruit to challenge the complex issue of obstetric violence and ensure a rights-based approach to reproductive health.

### Promotion, protection, and support of breastfeeding as a human right: a narrative review [^625b1443]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background: Despite the benefits of breastfeeding, there are significant disparities in rates among various racial, social, and economic groups. Society poses various barriers to breastfeeding, threatening the child's access to a basic human right. Exploring and understanding these issues can ensure that effective interventions are implemented. Objective: To present situations in which the mother's and child's basic human right to breastfeeding is threatened and to highlight opportunities to uphold their rights within social and health care systems. Methods: A literature search of relevant articles was performed via PubMed regarding (1) rights to optimal protections for breastfeeding, (2) situations in which the rights of breastfeeding parents are threatened, and (3) challenges in providing inclusive and equitable breastfeeding care along with strategies to uphold the human right to breastfeed. Results: Maternity leave of at least 12 weeks was associated with higher breastfeeding rates, whereas mandated breaks in the workplace resulted in either positive or inconclusive effects. Peer counseling, institutional initiatives, and mass media campaigns were among the most effective interventions; however, effects on breastfeeding varied among different racial groups. Conclusions: There are clear benefits of breastfeeding for mothers and infants, which highlight the importance of prioritizing breastfeeding as a basic human right. Regardless, there are numerous societal barriers to providing equitable breastfeeding care. Although there are interventions that have proven to be helpful in breastfeeding promotion, protection, and support, further standardized research will be beneficial in identifying effective and inclusive interventions.

### Making research ethics work for global health: towards a more agile and collaborative approach [^97a8a60c]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

The way forward

We suggest several practical ways to enable richer, more impactful, and truly interdisciplinary and just global health research. In the long-run, we suggest implementing empirical studies of research ethics practices around informed consent and a systematic review of such studies.

During projects, researchers should dedicate time to regular deliberations, reflecting on whether standardised ethics standards are indeed best practice for this specific study and these participants in this situation or context. Informed consent procedures in particular need critical reflection. After all, the mere presence of informed consent does not guarantee an ethical process. As Matandika et al p11 note: 'a willingness to consent to be part of a research project can hide a wide range of initial and ongoing concerns among study participants, which highlight the need to further protect participants' rights and support those who consent through the life of a project'. Researchers should foster participant agency rather than autonomy, by ensuring that ethical consent is based on high-quality, participatory communication which fosters mutual respect and trust, and establishes participants as coagents. This could mean focusing discussions on participants' ability to choose, and monitoring researchers' language for formulations that leave space for participants' decision-making and participants' language for reflection of their awareness of choice.
Ethics procedures and frameworks need to become more agile, decolonial, pluralised and vernacularised to achieve congruence between communities' and IRBs' ideas of social justice and ethics, and enable optimal use of ethnographic methodologies (While we do not problematise what 'communities' might mean in this context, we are aware that it is not a homogeneous concept. In global health research, there is a risk that instead of benefiting the most vulnerable individuals, these projects may end up deepening inequities by benefiting those who are the easiest to reach and may be the least precarious). This necessitates that ethics procedures are oriented to ethnography, which requires meaningful and equitable engagements between medical scientists, public health scholars, and anthropologists or other social scientists.
Medical and public health researchers should receive basic training in ethnography and anthropological notions related to ethics. In addition, ethics training needs to incorporate informed consent communication. Education institutions must commit to developing such programmes, they need to be supported by budgets in research projects, and funders and IRBs must demand these.
Interdisciplinary dialogues to foster a greater understanding of different standpoints regarding ethics grounded in disciplinary backgrounds, professions and other positionalities (eg, gender, race/ethnicity, nationality). Anthropologists have written much on ethics but mainly on and for anthropological platforms; we need to reach out more to our public health colleagues (as we do here), using accessible language.
Anthropologists and community members should be on IRB boards and co-shape research ethics procedures. This would change the status quo that expects anthropologists or other social scientists to adapt to biomedically oriented ethics procedures, even though they normally do not collect biomedical data (eg, tissue) but social data (narratives, observations).

### A transition to sustainable ocean governance [^1317dc1a]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Empowering the commons through environmental justice and a shared knowledge commons

In order to ensure fairness and justice, compliance with environmental obligations is a matter of growing concern. Stronger accountability, transparency and participation mechanisms will be required to clear conflicts and enable equitable sharing between different ocean users. Compliance with environmental obligations is generally resolved at an inter-state level, but if one accepts that the ocean is a global commons and is part of the global social-ecological system, then in legal terminology, the obligations inherent in concepts such as the sustainable use of natural resources, inter-generational equity and the common concern of humankind fall into the category of obligations owed to the international community as a whole. While commons have traditionally been held in trust by sovereign nations, or collaboratively managed through inter-state relationships, this has proven insufficient to protect the ocean and other planetary commons.

The international recognition of an environmental human right through an international agreement – discussed above would create an opportunity to generate a shift in the collective understanding of legal norms and environmental rights in a similar fashion to that which occurred in the human rights body of law as a result of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights six decades ago. This could initiate a paradigm shift in global culture towards a "human rights-based holistic environmental stewardship for the planet". The FAO voluntary guidelines on natural resource tenureand on supporting small-scale fisheriesare grounded in human rights principles, and are the first examples of such an approach being applied in fisheries policy. In addition to the embedded normative aspects of equity and justice, we argue that a human right to the environment would form a baseline "net" for governance of the ocean commons, through the inherent potential that such a right provides to address and redress the inequities suffered by individuals and communities exposed to environmental degradation and the unsustainable extraction of natural resources –.

### Worldwide divergence of values [^72d4ddc2]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Our findings answer some important questions about contemporary value change, but they also pose new ones. Why has rising wealth led Western, but not non-Western, nations to espouse more emancipative values? We believe that this relationship might be embedded in ecological and cultural events throughout Western history, including the advent of participatory democracy in Athens and early Rome, enlightenment and post-enlightenment philosophy, the Catholic Church's marriage and family polices, the French revolution, and the reformation. These phenomena may have gradually solidified a Western identity focused on autonomy, primacy of individual rights over obligations to the in-group, and tolerance for breaking norms. As the world has globalized and Western nations have competed for resources on the world stage, this identity may have crystalized even further. But this does not mean that wealth or globalization should have encouraged similar values in African, East Asian, or South Asian cultures. To the contrary, growing power and resources may have prompted non-Western countries to affirm their own traditional values.

Practically, value divergence has implications for political polarization and conflict across world countries. Russia has framed the recent war in Ukraine as a war against Western values. Chinese politicians have spoken against countries that "forcibly promote the concept and system of Western democracy and human rights". Western non-governmental organizations have faced recent accusations of seeding immorality and propagating Western imperialism, and public opinion polling has found increasingly hostile attitudes towards Western countries in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Our findings do not shed light on the extent of the anti-Western sentiment or the exact nature of its antecedents and consequences. We do not know to what extent governments strategically propagate certain values to reinforce national identities, as Tomlinsonwould suggest. One goal of future research could be to understand the extent that political elites have encouraged value divergence among ordinary citizens.

### Who wants to live forever? Three arguments against extending the human lifespan [^b3b5ab75]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2007). Low credibility.

The wish to extend the human lifespan has a long tradition in many cultures. Optimistic views of the possibility of achieving this goal through the latest developments in medicine feature increasingly in serious scientific and philosophical discussion. The authors of this paper argue that research with the explicit aim of extending the human lifespan is both undesirable and morally unacceptable. They present three serious objections, relating to justice, the community and the meaning of life.

### Global health equity: evidence for action on the social determinants of health [^39d9ee63]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2008). Low credibility.

More than 30 years ago, the older of us published a paper with the proposal that all scientific papers should start with a statement along the lines of: "These are the opinions on which I base my facts". Why pretend? To take a topical example, if you are on the nature side of the nature/nurture debates, is it likely that your next paper will be an apologia: "I take it all back; genes don't matter at all; it is all environment"? Unlikely. Similarly, if you are on the other side. (We know. It's both.) Here, we are not in any way arguing for a relativist credo that would say opinions are all. Along with other readers of this journal, we spend a good part of our working lives gathering, analysing and interpreting empirical evidence. Evidence matters. But everyone has values and they do affect our positions.

### Reflections on a new medical cosmology [^c2df1d21]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2002). Low credibility.

Since the nineteenth century the theory and practice of mainstream Western medicine has been grounded in the biomedical model. In the later years of the twentieth century, however, it has faced a range of serious problems, which when viewed collectively, remain unresolved despite a variety of responses. The question we now face is whether these problems can be dealt with by modifying and extending the principles underlying the biomedical model, or whether a more radical solution is required. Recent critiques of Western medicine have focused mainly on the biopsychosocial model in relation to the former approach, but it will be contended that this cannot deal adequately with the challenges that medicine currently faces, because although it addresses both the scientific and humanistic aspects of medicine it fails to harmonise them. I shall therefore argue for the necessity of a more radical approach, and suggest that what is required to accomplish this is the development of a new medical cosmology, rooted in an older and more global framework. Such a fundamental change would inevitably involve a long term process which it is not yet possible to fully comprehend let alone specify in detail. Some of the necessary features of such a new medical cosmology can, however, already be distinguished and the outline of these is described.

### Integrating philosophy, policy and practice to create a just and fair health service [^60a0b410]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

To practise 'fairly and justly' a clinician must balance the needs of both the many and the few: the individual patient in front of them, and the many unseen patients in the waiting room, and in the county. They must consider the immediate clinical needs of those in the present, and how their actions will impact on future patients. The good medical practice guidance 'Make the care of your patient your first concern' provides no guidance on how doctors should act when they care for multiple patients with conflicting needs. Moreover, conflicting needs extend far past simply those between different patients. At an organisational level, financial obligations must be balanced with clinical ones; the system must support those who work within it in a variety of roles; and, finally, in order for a healthcare service to be sustainable, the demands of current and future generations must be balanced. The central problem, we propose, is that there is no shared philosophical framework on which the provision of care or the development of health policy is based, nor is there a practical, fair and transparent process to ensure that the service is equipped to deal justly with new challenges as they emerge. Many philosophers have grappled with constructing a set of principles which would lead to a 'good' society which is just to different users; prominent among them is Rawls. Four important principles can be derived using a Rawlsian approach: equity of access, distributive justice, sustainability and openness. However, Rawls' approach is sometimes considered too abstract to be applied readily to policymaking; it does not provide clear guidance for how individuals working within existing institutions can enact the principles of justice. We therefore combine the principles derived from Rawls with Scanlonian contractualism: by demanding that decisions are made in a way which cannot be 'reasonably rejected' by different stakeholders (including 'trustees' for those who cannot represent themselves), we ensure that conflicting needs are considered robustly. We demonstrate how embedding this framework would ensure just policies and fair practice. We illustrate this by using examples of how it would help prevent injustice among different socioeconomic groups, prevent intergenerational injustice and prevent injustice in a crisis, for example, as we respond to new challenges such as COVID-19. Attempts to help individual doctors practise fairly and justly throughout their professional lives are best focused at an institutional or systemic level. We propose a practical framework: combining Scanlonian contractualism with a Rawlsian approach. Adopting this framework would equip the workforce and population to contribute to fair policymaking, and would ultimately result in a healthcare system whose practice and policies-at their core-were just.

### Towards universal health coverage: including undocumented migrants [^3c37be6c]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Yet without an international roadmap for securing the health of migrants, there are considerable differences in healthcare access for undocumented migrants depending on their country of residence. These policy distinctions belie the universal promise of migrant health as a matter of human rights, with the right to health obligating states under international law to secure the'highest attainable standard of health' for all persons in the country – regardless of citizenship. Though 170 countries have ratified or signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and other international treaties recognising health-related human rights (table 1), there is a disconnect between international obligations and national realisation of the right to health for undocumented migrants. Taken to the extreme, nearly all countries have adopted treaties ensuring the right to health for children – including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child – yet undocumented children face restricted access to basic healthcare in many countries. Where the right to health seeks to assure that health services and systems are available, of sufficient quality, and accessible to all, states fail to meet these rights-based obligations towards undocumented migrants when they restrict who is included, which services are provided, and how affordable they are.

Table 1
Healthcare system, population and human rights Norway, Thailand and the United States

In seeking to prioritise migrant health under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made a forceful plea last year to the United Nations General Assembly: 'we need better policies that promote migrants' right to health'. The rights-based provision of healthcare for undocumented migrants is interconnected with national healthcare priority setting and resource allocation. Priority setting on universal health coverage involves choices on who to include, which services to provide, and how to cover out-of-pocket expenses.

### Being well together? Promoting health and well-being through more than human collaboration and companionship [^f5309e55]. Medical Humanities (2019). Medium credibility.

These and other questions reveal the importance of subjective and affective relationships in the medical encounter. Why do we feel obligations, take comfort in, or feel disgust toward, living therapies in ways that are diminished or absent with non-living medical interventions? How do we relate differently to a maggot than we do to a dog or a drug prior to the medical encounter? How does this change during and after? What makes possible, and what are the limits to, multispecies companion relationships? These questions are important as they open up to study the processes by which nature and culture are mutually constituted through medicine over time. They demonstrate the critical insight that the medical humanities can bring to understanding health as a product of more than human interactions.

Investigating why non-human life has been used to promote human health charts the social, political and economic contexts that facilitate the development and acceptance of medical interventions, including changing cultural perceptions of species difference. In recent years, examples of what we are calling 'multispecies medicine', including leech, larval and phage therapy, have found gained renewed medical interest having been pushed to the margins of 'scientific' medicine during the mid twentieth century. Others are applied in new ways, such as the development of deaf and disability assistance animals, as well as diabetes and seizure alert dogs, from the model of the guide (or 'seeing eye') dog. These examples powerfully impact on people's lives not only by providing new therapeutic interventions but by producing new forms of multispecies companionship capable of transforming lived experience. Yet they are little studied leaving unanswered important questions as to how cultural and social values sustain and challenge human–animal relationships medicated by health. Why are some species over others acceptable as emotional therapy animals? Why are some social spaces resistant to the new forms of human–animal companionship on which therapeutic relationships are founded? How do therapeutic practices become positioned as integral, alternative and complementary to medicine? Answers to these questions lie in cultural and social values. As such, they are questions for the medical humanities. Understanding what these positions mean, as well as how and why specific therapies move across these categories over time, is critical to understanding how cultural perceptions shape medicine. And equally critical to understanding the everyday experiences of those whose health and well-being are shaped by their non-human medical companions.

### An intersectional human rights approach to prioritising access to COVID-19 vaccines [^8e0a4b42]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

International human rights law provides a universal framework for advancing global health with justice, transforming moral imperatives into legal entitlements. Box 1 Every state has signed at least one human rights treaty and there is empirical evidence that all states have to some extent internalised human rights norms into legislation, policy and governance, even where compliance with such norms is demonstrably lacking. Here we argue that human rights legal principles have the potential to guide a more equitable allocation of a COVID-19 vaccine. A human rights approach reframes commitments as obligations and rights, and imposes accountability measures on states. International human rights law enshrines a range of individual and collective rights related to access to an essential vaccine for pandemic prevention (see Box 2).

Box 1
Human rights related to access to an essential vaccine for pandemic prevention

Box 2
Availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality (AAAQ) explained

Several vaccines for COVID-19 are already authorised in numerous countries. However, most countries will not immediately have the requisite number of vaccines for the entire population and so will have to make decisions about who they should prioritise. Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights states that states have obligations to prevent and control epidemics. In General Comment No 14, which interprets states' obligations under the right to health, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) has stated that the provision of vaccines would be critical to fulfilling this objective.(See box 1 for how these rights relate to access to a vaccine for pandemic prevention.) The Committee has also firmly positioned the provision of essential medicines defined by WHO as a 'core obligation' under the right to health. Such obligations are defined in General Comment No 3 as the minimum standards that must be met by states to give meaning to the enjoyment of Covenant rights. Therefore, providing a COVID-19 vaccine would fall within the core minimum obligations of states under the right to health, making it a priority.

### Social, cultural and political conditions for advancing health equity: examples from eight country case studies (2011–2021) [^63f2acac]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Despite global commitments to reducing health inequities, progress has been slow and mixed. The Commission on the Social Determinants of Health highlighted that 'the social gradient in health within countries and the marked health inequities between countries are caused by the unequal distribution of power, income, goods and services, globally and nationally'. Staggering differences in life expectancy both between and within countries persist, and in some cases, are increasing. In contrast, progress in health equity (HE) is defined as 'levelling the social gradient' so that everyone can attain their full potential for health and well-being. HE progress is achieved through the systematic identification and elimination of inequities resulting from differences in social and commercial determinants of health.

Evidence on how best to reduce health inequities is substantial and clear; however, the power and influence of political economies and their competing priorities have hampered progress. Researchers have explored the reasons behind inaction on HE, citing poor governance, globalisation, capitalism and corporate domination, competing vested interests, privatisation, repression of civil society, low unionisation, absence of collective bargaining, regressive welfare state policies, lack of understanding of how to act and low motivation. While a number of countries have given consideration to the social determinants of HE (SDHE), the recommendations of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health have not been significantly enacted.

Reducing health inequities is often described as too challenging and complex. Yet while the need for studies that contribute to the evidence base for how to embed effective policies in specific political economy contexts is crucial, actions must not stall in the interim. Indeed, the European Health Equity Status Reportstated that there is a need to change common perceptions that 'health equity is too complex to address and that it is unclear what actions to take and which policies and approaches will be effective'.

With this in mind, this article identifies five countries that made progress on HE and three countries that had not made the same gains, during 2011–2021 (a period of 10 years after the launch of the Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health). We use the term 'progress' to mean a reduction in 'within-country' social gradients in health outcomes and 'between country' health inequities. On the basis of the cases, we identify a set of social and political conditions that appeared to be prerequisites for progress towards achieving HE.

### Social justice as a foundation for democracy and health [^8b40b314]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Justice at work in democratic nations

Some of the most successful covid-19 responses worldwide have occurred in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Germany, Austria, Finland, Denmark, Iceland, and Norway. The governments of these countries were able to respond quickly and effectively because they steep their responses in justice, recognising mutual interdependencies and shared vulnerabilities. Underlying their covid-19 responses are shared values and shared responsibility and a goal of securing capabilities for all.

All of these countries have robust public health systems supporting resilient communities and individuals; they fulfil these moral obligations to safeguard human flourishing and reduce threats to it. In particular, they exhibit four characteristics of a justice framework for a resilient covid-19 response: governing for the common good; shared responsibility for scientifically grounded systems; rational, compassionate, and transparent communication; and ethical leadership and trust.

Governing for the common good

These successful countries use shared health governance to help prevent premature mortality and avoidable morbidity. Efficient healthcare and public health systems require shared responsibility, shared resources, and shared sovereignty. Private actors and public institutions engage collectively to ensure the health and flourishing of all. In shared health governance, genuine collective action brings about justice.

Narrow self-interest does not foster capabilities. The United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, and Russia, all democracies, have shown the failure of leaders who seek to deflect criticism or protect their personal and political interests. By contrast, the shared health governance approach in successful countries, rising above self-interest and focusing on the common good, has enlisted institutions and practices to ensure effective responses to covid-19.

### Social, cultural and political conditions for advancing health equity: examples from eight country case studies (2011–2021) [^6a86c34a]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

The final prerequisite for advancing HE identified through the country case analysis was the need for actions that will reduce the steepness of the social gradient in health. Researchers have called for a combination of universal and targeted approaches for levelling social gradients in health outcomes. A number of countries in this study had demonstrated significant reductions in poverty across the population; however, closer investigation revealed persistent pockets of disadvantage. An important component of this prerequisite for HE progress is an appropriate, robust and long-term monitoring system for HE. The WHO HE Monitor is a step in that direction.

### Defending frontline defenders of sexual and reproductive health rights: a call to action-oriented, human rights-based responses [^718184c4]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Hostility directed against those on the frontlines of healthcare and advocacy is reportedly most often at the hands of 'patients, their families, and visitors '.but is also perpetrated by colleagues, institutions and communities. However, the literature does not directly assess what role is played by political and other leaders' expression of hostility to SRHR, and by regressive SRHR policies, in the hostility that frontline workers experience. Yet, those who advocate for, support and provide SRHR services, information and advocacy throughout the world, know that adverse political and social environments elevate these risks. For example, health workers providing legal abortion care can face intimidation, harassment and arrest from law enforcement due to lack of clarity or misinterpretation of national abortion laws and policies.

Around the world, some of the most ideologically charged public debates are directed at SRHR and services. Moreover, mounting aggression in public narratives from political actors alongside regressive government policies amplify hostility towards those who provide, protect and promote SRHR. Within such settings, our colleagues are often required to draw deeply on their own reserves of courage and resilience just to continue their daily work. They do so in countries and communities around the globe, often in the face of stigma, discrimination, belittlement, harassment and even violence, that is directed against themselves, their places of work, their colleagues, and even their families — impinging on their private as well as their professional lives.

What are the personal costs of delivering on the frontlines of SRHR in contexts of public and/or political hostility? What are the consequences of regressive laws and policies on SRHR for health workers, advocates and activists? What is being done to protect our colleagues, to defend their rights as they go about their work, and to seek redress and accountability when they experience abuse, are harmed or injured?

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^d408850a]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

Low-income and economic marginalization (LIEM) — associations between socioeconomic status (SES) and behavioral, mental, and physical health are described as well-documented, and poverty has been identified as the most pervasive risk to the health of children in America. Needs and desires of LIEM populations are described as often neglected or ignored, with distancing identified as a key factor in classist beliefs and classism defined as cognitive and behavioral distancing from people who are poor. Classist attitudes are defined as assignment of characteristics of worth and ability to individuals based on their known or perceived social class, with stigma occurring as microaggressions and more affluent individuals blaming social class circumstances on perceived faulty or deficient attributes of poor individuals. This process of blame is described as preserving a social system that benefits those in power while creating obstacles that marginalize and exploit poor and working-class populations, and negative views are used as justification for inequities in education, healthcare, the justice system, the environment, and access to a vocation that provides a living wage. The Western value of meritocracy is described as reinforcing biased and negative views toward people living in poverty, contributing to greater distancing and endorsement of system-justifying ideologies that can lead to internalized self-blame among people who are targets of classism, and when LIEM populations are made visible, it is often in a negative light.

### Global health governance as shared health governance [^b0e4dbfa]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2012). Low credibility.

Background

With the exception of key 'proven successes' in global health, the current regime of global health governance can be understood as transnational and national actors pursuing their own interests under a rational actor model of international cooperation, which fails to provide sufficient justification for an obligation to assist in meeting the health needs of others. An ethical commitment to providing all with the ability to be healthy is required.

Methods

This article develops select components of an alternative model of shared health governance (SHG), which aims to provide a 'road map', 'focal points' and 'the glue' among various global health actors to better effectuate cooperation on universal ethical principles for an alternative global health equilibrium. Key features of SHG include public moral norms as shared authoritative standards; ethical commitments, shared goals and role allocation; shared sovereignty and constitutional commitments; legitimacy and accountability; country-level attention to international health relations.

Results

A framework of social agreement based on 'overlapping consensus' is contrasted against one based on self-interested political bargaining. A global health constitution delineating duties and obligations of global health actors and a global institute of health and medicine for holding actors responsible are proposed. Indicators for empirical assessment of select SHG principles are described.

Conclusion

Global health actors, including states, must work together to correct and avert global health injustices through a framework of SHG based on shared ethical commitments.

### Bioethics and multiculturalism [^8db3d58a]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2018). Low credibility.

In his recent analysis of multiculturalism, Tom Beauchamp has argued that those who implement multicultural reasoning in their arguments against common morality theories, such as his own, have failed to understand that multiculturalism is neither a form of moral pluralism nor ethical relativism but is rather a universalistic moral theory in its own right. Beauchamp's position is indeed on the right track in that multiculturalists do not consider themselves ethical relativists. Yet, Beauchamp tends to miss the mark when he argues that multiculturalism is in effect a school of thought that endorses a form of moral universalism that is akin to his own vision of a common morality. As a supporter of multiculturalism, I would like to discuss some aspects of Beauchamp's comments on multiculturalism and clarify what a multicultural account of public bioethics might look like. Ultimately, multiculturalism is purported as a means of managing diversity in the public arena and should not be thought of as endorsing either a version of moral relativism or a universal morality. By simultaneously refraining from the promotion of a comprehensive common moral system while it attempts to avoid a collapse into relativism, multiculturalism can serve as the ethico-political framework in which diverse moralities can be managed and in which opportunities for ethical dialogue, debate and deliberation on the prospects of common bioethical norms are made possible.

### 2020 American Heart Association and American college of cardiology consensus conference on professionalism and ethics: a consensus conference report [^118ee42c]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Diversity — definition and rationale specify that diversity goes beyond skin color, race, ethnicity, and sex to include age, socioeconomic background, disability status, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, and class, among others, and requires inclusion of individuals with varied backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives in leadership, cardiovascular healthcare delivery, business, education, and science. Rigorous quantitative and qualitative assessments of institutional diversity are required to attain excellence, and deliberate strategies to improve representation may reduce discrimination, cultural marginalization, and denial of access, with quantification of dimensions of diversity and the use of targets for equity warranted to correct current severe disparities and address the urgent need to increase representation. These strategies neither imply nor require any compromise in competence or quality, and, in fact, the opposite is true; efforts to include more diverse individuals are an important opportunity to improve the entire workforce by adopting contemporary holistic review approaches.

Shared sanitation is not currently accepted within the international normative definitions of "basic" or "safely managed" sanitation. We argue that pro-poor government strategies and investment plans must include high-quality shared sanitation as an intermediate step in some densely populated urban areas. User experience must be considered in establishing the definition of high quality. We call for additional research on effective interventions to reach these quality standards and for the development of rigorous measures applicable to global monitoring.

### Strategies to promote uptake and sustainability of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions in basic education institutions in conflict settings: a scoping review of the horn of Africa [^8f89f89a]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) are human rights that form the basic needs of all individuals, determining health and education outcomes, nutrition status, excretion of wastes, human dignity and, ultimately, mortality. Limited or no access to safe facilities for eliminating human waste or safe water for consumption or hygiene in learning institutions may affect health, social and economic outcomes. This could arise through diminished health status and academic performance, which has implications for future career opportunities.

The right to clean and safe water and proper sanitation is enshrined in several international human rights instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. As part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2015, the United Nations aimed to achieve clean water and sanitation (SDG 6) and access to quality education (SDG 4) for all by 2030. An important area of focus to achieve this has been ensuring the provision of adequate WASH interventions within basic learning institutions. Most countries have been steadfast in aligning their development goals with those of the SDGs through interventions such as providing water and sanitation facilities, WASH education and capacity building among school stakeholders. This has been shown to decrease absenteeism, reduce episodes of WASH-related illnesses and generally improve the quality of life and the learning environment. A scoping review conducted in sub-Saharan Africa assessing outcomes associated with WASH interventions showed its positive effect on school attendance among menstruating girls and general behavioural change among institution stakeholders. As in any intervention, most report financial constraints and lack of government support as common barriers. Additionally, disconnects between knowledge, policy and practice have been reported as barriers to achieving adequate WASH within learning institutions. Among successfully implemented interventions, rigorous legal foundations, abundant water supply and security were noted as enablers of successful WASH interventions in other areas of the globe.

### Israel: health and beyond [^051bf26e]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The principle that global human identity and dignity supersede other values is a broadly accepted conviction that guides practice and policies in the realm of human health in most of the world. An assessment of the level of success that Israel has achieved in health, in the face of formidable challenges, including rapid population growth, diverse and often divided ethnic affiliations, and existential security threats, leads us to propose that extension of this principle of global human identity and dignity, together with the objective of a decent society, as overriding values beyond health to other domains of human endeavour within Israel and in its relations with neighbouring peoples, represents an entirely achievable imperative. The result will be to further advance Israel's aspiration to serve as a model for societal decency with wide international acceptance and engagement. We have identified several determinants of Israel's advancement in health, including: articulation of a clear vision, national purpose, and long-term commitment that seeks to take the health of its citizens seriously; a multi-ethnic population that brings diversity and energy to national progress; a political democracy, which is characterised by robust debate and discussion about the nation's future; national legislation governing cardinal health-care processes; cultural and religious histories that respect and revere scholarship, learning, research, and charitable donation; an expanding economy, with recent but increasing appreciation of the economic, social, and political underpinnings of health and health inequalities; a strong base of international support from the Diaspora Jewish community; and a strong desire for acceptance by the international community in key arenas, especially science and health. As a result, despite the fewer than seven decades since its establishment, Israel has achieved important milestones in health. Nevertheless, this trajectory of achievement is threatened by several serious challenges, including the capacity to sustain high-quality universal health coverage, especially for an ageing population living with multiple comorbidities in the face of a stagnant level of the percentage of treasury funding to health care at a level that is well below the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; ever-increasing transfer of services and care covered by the mandatory public health services basket to private programmes; insufficient progress in resolving health disparities among and between communities, populations, and regions of the country congruent with disparities in income and employment; gender inequities; a looming increase in the already alarming shortfall in health-care professionals; and failure to match inpatient and acute care facilities to manage growing needs. These challenges within Israel are magnified in the context of health disparities with the neighbouring Palestinian population, a situation in which ongoing-but fragile and limited-health cooperation and training arrangements cannot stand in for a solution that will address Palestinian national aspirations. We come away from this Series with a great sense of optimism, but with specific recommendations that are based on the foregoing challenges. We believe that by increasing the investment in the health sector, which includes investing in the societal, political, educational, and environmental underpinnings of health, far more can be achieved to move Israel to a model international leadership position in health care, education, and research, and turn health into an engine for economic wellbeing and development. Religious leadership in Israel, with its formidable political influence, can be harnessed to promote health initiatives in areas ranging from smoking cessation and healthy diet to organ transplantation, and most of all condemnation of hostility and its replacement by peaceful resolution of even the deepest conflicts. Most of all, this Series showed that there is an enormous opportunity, which Israel can lead, to leverage the universally accepted principles of health as a sanctuary against conflict and inequity, to achieve a brighter future for a deeply troubled region of the world.

### How to live in peace? Mapping the science of sustaining peace: a progress report [^aaf810fb]. The American Psychologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite good faith attempts by countless citizens, civil society, governments, and the international community, living in a sustainably peaceful community continues to be an elusive dream in much of our world. Among the challenges to sustaining peace is the fact that few scholars have studied enduringly peaceful societies, or have examined only narrow aspects of them, leaving our understanding of the necessary conditions, processes and policies fragmented, and deficient. This article provides a work-in-progress overview of a multidisciplinary, multimethod initiative, which aims to provide a holistic, evidence-based understanding of how peace can be sustained in societies. The Sustaining Peace Project, launched in 2014, uses complexity science as an integrative platform for synthesizing knowledge across disciplines, sectors and communities. This article introduces the multiple components of the project and shares preliminary findings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).

### Priorities for consent-based and well-supported climate relocations [^a30702e6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Universalizing across contexts hinders research and advocacy

Climate-related planned relocation is emerging as a growing climate policy and human rights concern, as the topic of a dedicated Special Rapporteur reportand a feature of loss and damage debates. Some Governments are even creating laws, guidelines, funding arrangements, and operating procedures for planned relocation. International organisations are increasingly getting involved, often in an ad hoc and siloed manner. As more policy processes, governments, and international organizations focus on these issues, it is imperative for researchers and community advocates to recognize that planned relocations vary widely.

The diversity of case contexts requires researchers and advocates to, at minimum, ask: is there consent, and is there adequate support? Communities and advocates can tailor their strategies based on answers to these two key questions. These questions can also frame future research to support understanding, for example, of the social, cultural, institutional, political and economic barriers to achieving well-supported and consensual relocations and pathways forward across contexts.

Not all planned relocations are the same, and universalizing across contexts can result in serious consequences. A planned relocation with high consent but no support in Alaskawill require a fundamentally different set of principles and advocacy approaches than a government-led case where community members have not consented to move in Mozambique. While both these cases are climate-related planned relocations, this shared label hides considerable differences, requiring the additional concepts of support and consent to properly understand different communities' perspectives on relocation and their relationships to external actors. Conceptualizing these cases as the same through the combined label of climate-related planned relocation can be problematic when what community members want diverges dramatically (to move or to stay); different community desires require different advocacy approaches. Institutional and economic capacities across these cases also vary significantly and may ultimately determine how consent is obtained and these processes are implemented, over local needs or desires. Advocacy claims and strategies will vary depending on the possibilities afforded by the economic, political and institutional context: they will not be the same in a high-resource environment with established representational channels, compared to fragile or conflict state contexts. The most vulnerable are often in places with lowest levels of consent and capacity to support. Across contexts, policies and practices that create conditions required for the ideal type — where relocations are consensual and well-supported over time — can help ensure better, more rights-respecting outcomes for affected communities.

### No right to food and nutrition in the SDGs: mistake or success? [^9bd97be6]. BMJ Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

The Europeans' double standards: supporting abroad, reluctant at home

The EU authorities have repeatedly said that states should 'mainstream a human rights perspective in their national strategies for the realisation of the right to adequate food for all'. After the Treaty of Lisbon, a binding agreement of high legal and political relevance, all member states and the European Commission have the legal obligation to respect, protect and promote human rights within its territory and in EU-supported interventions in other countries. Of course, that should include all the internationally recognised human rights, such as the right to food. Moreover, the Commission has expressed its support to 'right to food-based political and legal frameworks' in developing countries, as well as establishing and strengthening redressal mechanisms. Likewise, the European Parliament has taken a similar position regarding the relevance of the right to food to address food security challenges in developing countries.

Yet no EU member state recognises explicitly the right to food in their Constitutionsor in specific laws; nor is any mention to the right to food made in the fundamental European Treaties: No right to food in the European Social Charter, adopted in 1961 and revised in 1996 that actually extends the protection of social and economic rights to the Council of Europe members; or in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, adopted in 2000 as legally binding; it is supposed to include rights from international instruments ratified by all European members (ie, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights); or in the European Convention on Human Rights, originally signed in 1950 and having been enriched with seven protocols. It is worth noting that the right to private property was included in the first article of the first protocol in 1952. Ergo, private property is a right for Europeans, but food is not.

### Ethical framework for adult social care in COVID-19 [^3dc13201]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

In March 2020, the Government produced a document entitled " Responding to COVID-19: The Ethical Framework for Adult Social Care" ('The Ethical Framework'). In this article, we summarise the key features of the proposed ethical framework and subject it to critical analysis. We highlight three primary issues. First, the emphasis placed on autonomy as the primary ethical principle. We argue if ever there was a context in which autonomy should dominate the ethical analysis, this is not it. Second, we examine the interface between ethics and law which is largely overlooked in the document. Finally, we explore the surprising lack of attention paid to the concept of responsibility and communal obligations within the framework.

### International cooperation and health. part I: issues and concepts [^d3b7cc51]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2005). Low credibility.

The world is increasingly shaped by powerful global forces, many of which have consequences for human health and the social, economic, and environmental factors that influence health are increasingly determined at a supranational level. As a result, local or national level efforts to influence health determinants can have only a limited impact and it is all too easy for the individual public health practitioner to feel powerless. Yet while public health practitioners, on their own, may indeed be comparatively powerless, together they can achieve a great deal. Part I of this glossary explores a range of issues that arise as they seek to make a difference.

### Advancing Germany's new global health strategy [^12973d2c]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

First, priorities in the global health strategy, as well as the principles underpinning the adopted decisions, should be documented in a transparent manner. This includes documenting the supporting research evidence, as well as an explicit and critical reflection on the normative reasoning applied (eg, why research on obesity was selected as a priority over neglected tropical disease, or vice versa).
Second, an effective management of conflict of interest should make the involvement of different stakeholders and their specific contributions public. This allows for public scrutiny and an open discussion to determine whether any conflicting interests of stakeholders have been addressed and balanced out in an acceptable manner.
Third, the input already provided by the five stakeholder groups should truly be taken into consideration during the interministerial decision-making processes. To further enhance public participation, drafts of the strategy should be made available to selected stakeholder groups or the public at critical transition points, allowing for appeal and revision. It may also be helpful to examine the forms of public participation that countries, such as Canada, the UK, the Netherlands or Switzerland, have used for making strategic health decisions.
Fourth, in the light of global health being a holistic, multisectoral and transdisciplinary concept, the government should critically reflect on the stakeholders to be consulted within Germany. The current dominance of the medical and healthcare sector may need to be redressed to include a broader range of disciplines (eg, sociology, ethics) and sectors (eg, economics, agriculture, environment), in particular in view of complex multisectoral global health challenges, such as mitigating and/or adapting to climate change in the light of its health impacts.
Fifth, as the new German global health strategy is likely to have a profound impact on populations in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), representatives of their populations should be given the opportunity to directly voice their interests and concerns, too. We therefore welcome the expansion of the International Advisory Board on Global Health in July 2018, which now includes three (out of ten) members from LMICs. However, two of these are current or former WHO staff, with the third representing a think tank from a middle-income country, suggesting that the nomination of additional LMIC stakeholders (eg, representing civil rights, poverty action or patient organisations) may be warranted.
Last, once the new German global health strategy is adopted, the government should monitor its implementation on a regular basis, evaluate its successes and failures, and make adjustments where necessary. At these stages and tasks should the government strive for public participation and transparency.

### Concepts of "person" and "liberty, " and their implications to our fading notions of autonomy [^1c2f7b5b]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2007). Low credibility.

It is commonly held that respect for autonomy is one of the most important principles in medical ethics. However, there are a number of interpretations as to what that respect actually entails in practice and a number of constraints have been suggested even on our self-regarding choices. These limits are often justified in the name of autonomy. In this paper, it is argued that these different interpretations can be explained and understood by looking at the discussion from the viewpoints of positive and negative liberty and the various notions of a "person" that lay beneath. It will be shown how all the appeals to positive liberty presuppose a particular value system and are therefore problematic in multicultural societies.

### Mixed effectiveness of global protected areas in resisting habitat loss [^87520797]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The conflict between conservation and development is a crucial factor affecting the spatio-temporal effectiveness of global PAs in resisting habitat loss. We found that more than 200 million people (including Indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants) live in PAs, and many of these people are living in poverty (Supplementary Fig. 13). These people and their socio-economic activities are directly related to habitat loss in PAs and their surrounding areas. For such a large population group, displacing and relocating all these people and their households would be not only unfair and unethical but also impossible. Households are basic units of production and consumption, and the number of households has increased faster than the population, due to factors such as divorce, resulting in higher demand for resources. From an equity and human rights perspective, local people need to be able to pursue their traditional livelihoods. However, land resources form the basis of their socioeconomic development, supporting settlements, food production, forestry, livestock, and other important functions. PAs urgently need to establish sustainable development and harmonious coexistence between humans and nature to reduce the trade-off between conservation and development. In practice, nature-based solutions are essential to protect and sustainably manage biodiversity and natural ecosystems by promoting lower-impact land uses and strategically reducing the risk of biodiversity loss within and near PAs. It is even more critical to design a coordinated plan to reduce human demand for settlements, croplands, pasturelands, forest lands, and other resources in PAsthrough land use displacement, compensation funds, and global assistance. We should ensure that these measures and solutions are also beneficial for Indigenous peoples and local communities and help to improve their economic and social well-being. Paying for ecosystem services is one example of such a solution.

### Emerging human rights standards on obstetric violence and abuse during childbirth [^1603ce4d]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

2 SAFE MOTHERHOOD: AN EVOLVING HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK

The notion of "safe motherhood" emerged from the United Nations Safe Motherhood Initiative, which was launched in 1987 by several international human rights agencies to advance the specific goal of addressing the high incidence of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, with a particular focus on developing countries. The Initiative facilitated the global recognition that preventable maternal death and disability are human rights violations. Subsequently, human rights bodies confirmed the relevance of and clarified the application of several international human rights to the issue of safe motherhood, including the right to life, and the right to the highest attainable standard of health. Safe motherhood underscores that the right to health includes women's right to maternal and reproductive health, and that states are under positive obligations to actively improve maternal health. They must similarly adopt measures to ensure the provision of accessible, acceptable, and quality pre‐ and postnatal care and emergency obstetric services to prevent foreseeable risk of maternal mortality and morbidity. Further, failure to provide health care that only women need, such as those required to ensure safe motherhood, is a form of discrimination against womenthat governments are obligated to prevent or remedy.

### Informed consent in international research: the rationale for different approaches [^24a21d97]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

In developed countries, informed consent is based on the autonomy of the individual, a written description of the studies proposed, and previous experience of the participant with Western medicine. Consent is documented by the signature of the participant and supervised by institutional review boards (IRBs), which have conflicts of interest because they are also responsible for limiting institutional liability. In developing countries, the initial decision-making for informed consent is typically vested in the community rather than the individual, and illiteracy is common-limiting the value of written documents and signatures. The challenges in developing countries are exacerbated by the fact that persons at greatest risk of disease are often illiterate, have limited experience with Western medicine, and have limited understanding of the scientific rationale for the studies proposed. Given these differences, it is unrealistic to expect that consent strategies used in developed countries would be effective in such diverse settings.

### A human rights approach: the right to education in the time of COVID-19: commentary on COVID-19 special section [^3221fb26]. Child Development (2021). Medium credibility.

The third key element concerns the nature of States' duties. Although the full realization of the right to education might not be possible immediately, States have a "specific and continuing obligation to move as expeditiously as possible towards the full realization" of the right (Committee on economic social and cultural rights). Importantly, non‐discrimination is an immediate duty, which cannot be delayed. The closure of schools during the COVID‐19 pandemic magnified States' obligations to provide access to schools. However, States' obligations extend beyond access. States are also required to ensure the provision of functioning educational institutions with sanitation, safe drinking water, trained teachers, IT, and computer facilities. Schools must also be accessible, physically, and economically; acceptable in form and substance; and adaptable to changing needs (Committee on economic social and cultural rights). Ultimately, States must ensure education is directed to the overriding aims expressed in the Covenants, which include both the development of the child's personality and abilities to their fullest potential, and their preparation to participate effectively in society "in the spirit of understanding, peace, tolerance, equality of sexes, and friendship among all peoples… " (CRC, Art. 13; CRPD, Art 24; ICESCR, Art. 29(1)(a) and (d)). Online teaching only very partially achieves these objectives, and then only for a minority of learners. The use of digital tools, while bringing important benefits, also needs to be managed in a human‐rights compliant way. In particular, children's right to privacy requires States to protect their education data, especially in relation to the collection, retention, or sharing of such data (Special Rapporteur on the Right to Education,), for commercial, immigration, or security purposes.

For our youngest generations, the loss of education during the pandemic has been a heavy burden, and its consequences will linger in years to come. Moreover, the pandemic exposed the deep underlying inequalities and weaknesses in the system, as well as triggering further potential human rights breaches. The promise of "building back better" once we emerge from this pandemic should have the right to education as a central pillar. This is not just a good policy choice for both individuals and societies. It is a binding obligation in international human rights law.

### Ethics and best practice guidelines for training experiences in global health [^0051da0b]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Sending and host institutions.

Well-structured programs seem to be the optimal means of ensuring optimal training programs in global health. Developing and maintaining well-structured programs generally involves a sustained series of communications and seems to have a common set of attributes as listed below, and may include clear delineation of roles and responsibilities of all parties, budgets, duration of attachments, participation in and distribution of written reports, and other products. We recommend that sending and host institutions should do the following:
1 Develop well-structured programs so that host and sender as well as other stakeholders derive mutual, equitable benefit including: a. Discuss expectations and responsibilities of both host and sending institutions and agree on terms before program implementation; the terms may be outlined within a memorandum of understanding. Revisit the expectations and responsibilities on a periodic basis; b. Consider local needs and priorities regarding the optimal structure of programs; c. Recognize the true cost to all institutions (e.g. costs of orientation, insurance, translation, supervision and mentoring, transportation, lodging, health care, administration) and ensure that they are appropriately reimbursed; d. Aspire to maintain long-term partnerships so that short-term experiences may be nested within them; and e. Promote transparency regarding the motivations for establishing and maintaining programs (e.g. to meet an educational mission, to establish a relationship that might be used to support research, to meet student need) and identifying and addressing any conflicts of interests and conflicts of obligations (e.g. to local patients, communities, or local trainees compared with the global health trainees) that may result from such a program.
2 Clarify goals, expectations, and responsibilities through explicit agreements and periodic review by a. Senders and hosts; b. Trainees and mentors; and c. Sponsors and recipients.
3 Develop, implement, regularly update, and improve formal training for trainees and mentors, both local and foreign regarding material that includes: a. Norms of professionalism (local and sending); b. Standards of practice (local and sending); c. Cultural competence, e.g. behavior (local and sending) and dealing effectively with cultural differences; d. Dealing appropriately with conflicts (i.e. professionalism, culture, scientific and clinical differences of approach); e. Language capability; f. Personal safety; and g. Implications of differential access to resources for foreign and local trainees.
4 Encourage non-threatening communication to resolve ethical conflicts as they arise in real-time and identify a mechanism to involve the host and sending institutions when issues are not readily resolved.
5 Clarify the trainees' level of training and experience for the host institution so that appropriate activities are assigned and patient care and community well-being is not compromised.
6 Select trainees who are adaptable, motivated to address global health issues, sensitive to local priorities, willing to listen and learn, whose abilities and experience matches the expectations of the position, and who will be good representatives of their home institution and country.
7 Promote safety of trainees to the extent possible (e.g. vaccinations, personal behaviors, medications, physical barriers, security awareness, road safety, sexual harassment, psychological support, insurance and knowledge of relevant local laws).
8 Monitor costs and benefits to host institutions, local trainees, patients, communities, and sponsoring institutions to assure equity.
9 Establish effective supervision and mentorship of trainees by the host and sending institution, including the selection of appropriate mentors and supervisors and facilitating communication among them.
10 Establish methods to solicit feedback from the trainees both during and on completion of the program, including exit interviews, and track the participants post-training to evaluate the impact of the experience.

### The right not to know and the obligation to know [^f3f1a80c]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

Even if a member of a patients' medical team were somehow to be in an idealised position to judge her patients' reasons, it is consistent with a patient's having an obligation to acquire information that they have a right not to be told that information. For it is not the medical professionals' task to enforce all of their patient's moral obligations, even those that arise in a medical context. This way of thinking about the RNTK sees the respective obligation and right as operating at different levels, and for different reasons. For instance, if it is true that, as I have argued, an obligation to know medically relevant facts can be derived from a more fundamental obligation not to impose unreasonable burdens on one's fellow citizens, then this obligation may be seen as operating at a fundamental moral–political level. But this is consistent with there being a right at the institutional–legal level not to know (or, more strictly, not to be told) medically relevant information, a 'right to do wrong', which may be justified quite differently. For instance, it may not be that I have a basic moral claim on remaining ignorant of information that would help me fulfil other obligations, but rather that I have a moral claim on people in positions of social and institutional power (such as medical professionals) respecting my preferences about how they treat me. This is consistent with it being wrong of me to ask that I am treated in that way. It is thus overly simplistic to point to a (basic moral) obligation to know as evidence against an (institutional) RNTK.

### Oslo ministerial declaration – global health: a pressing foreign policy issue of our time [^f52d70ba]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Under their initiative on Global Health and Foreign Policy, launched in September, 2006, in New York, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Brazil, France, Indonesia, Norway, Senegal, South Africa, and Thailand issued the following statement in Oslo on March 20, 2007-In today's era of globalisation and interdependence there is an urgent need to broaden the scope of foreign policy. Together, we face a number of pressing challenges that require concerted responses and collaborative efforts. We must encourage new ideas, seek and develop new partnerships and mechanisms, and create new paradigms of cooperation. We believe that health is one of the most important, yet still broadly neglected, long-term foreign policy issues of our time. Life and health are our most precious assets. There is a growing awareness that investment in health is fundamental to economic growth and development. It is generally acknowledged that threats to health may compromise a country's stability and security. We believe that health as a foreign policy issue needs a stronger strategic focus on the international agenda. We have therefore agreed to make impact on health a point of departure and a defining lens that each of our countries will use to examine key elements of foreign policy and development strategies, and to engage in a dialogue on how to deal with policy options from this perspective. As Ministers of Foreign Affairs, we will work to: increase awareness of our common vulnerability in the face of health threats by bringing health issues more strongly into the arenas of foreign policy discussions and decisions, in order to strengthen our commitment to concerted action at the global level; build bilateral, regional and multilateral cooperation for global health security by strengthening the case for collaboration and brokering broad agreement, accountability, and action; reinforce health as a key element in strategies for development and for fighting poverty, in order to reach the Millennium Development Goals; ensure that a higher priority is given to health in dealing with trade issues and in conforming to the Doha principles, affirming the right of each country to make full use of TRIPS flexibilities in order to ensure universal access to medicines; strengthen the place of health measures in conflict and crisis management and in reconstruction efforts. For this purpose, we have prepared a first set of actionable steps for raising the priority of health in foreign policy in an Agenda for Action. We pledge to pursue these issues in our respective regional settings and in relevant international bodies. We invite Ministers of Foreign Affairs from all regions to join us in further exploring ways and means to achieve our objectives.

### What principlism misses [^0c58d9c3]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2009). Low credibility.

Principlism aims to provide a framework to help those working in medicine both to identify moral problems and to make decisions about what to do. For it to meet this aim, the principles included within it must express values that all morally serious people share (or ought to share), and there must be no other values that all morally serious people share (or ought to share). This paper challenges the latter of these claims. I will argue that as a descriptive claim about what values morally serious people do in fact share, principlism is inadequate; more principles would be needed to make this claim true. Furthermore, I will argue that while, taken as a claim about what principles we ought to share, principlism could turn out to be correct, it is either unsupported or unable to meet its aims. The only way in which principlists can avoid these problems is to add to the current four principles.

### The effects of armed conflict on children [^ff42a64f]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

### Josébarzelatto lecture: vision on unsafe abortion [^ddb6edbc]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2010). Low credibility.

José Barzelatto first distinguished himself as a leader with a vision in his years as a medical student. Later, principally as Director of the Reproductive Health Program at the World Health Organization and of the Ford Foundation program for women's sexual and reproductive rights, he contributed immensely toward the recognition of women's sexual and reproductive rights as part of their basic human rights. José Barzelatto's vision on abortion reflects his drive to promote social justice and respect individual rights, respect diversity, and promote a social consensus for a peaceful society. He believed that the fetus has moral value and did not accept abortion as a method of fertility control, but understood that abortion is a social phenomenon that cannot be changed with legal or moral condemnation. He accepted that condemning women who abort does not prevent abortion, is unfair, and causes great human suffering at a high social cost. José proposed nine points to form the basis for an overlapping consensus on abortion, on which to base a practical consensus that would allow societies to reduce the number of abortions and minimize their consequences. If we can agree on all or most of those points we would achieve the common objectives of: fewer women confronting the dilemma of how to deal with an unwanted pregnancy; fewer induced abortions; and fewer women suffering the consequences of unsafe abortion.

### Social, cultural and political conditions for advancing health equity: examples from eight country case studies (2011–2021) [^4493c3a1]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Willingness to engage and collaborate

The CIVICUS monitor collates data on the state of civil society and civic freedoms in 196 countries. None of the countries in this study were fully 'open'. Afghanistan, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Jordan were 'repressed', that is, civic space was significantly constrained; and the USA and Sri Lanka were 'obstructed', that is, civic space was heavily contested by power holders. Vietnam was 'closed'. Afghanistan and the USA have experienced dramatic declines in freedom over the past 10 years. Spain was ranked higher by CIVICUS and described as 'narrowed' because while the state allowed individuals and civil society organisations to exercise their rights to freedom of association, peaceful assembly and expression, violations of these rights also took place.

The study found that there are often discrepancies between policy rhetoric and meaningful reality. For example, the authoritarian Jordanian Government has given consideration to greater citizen participation in decision-making and increased transparency and accountability across all levels of government, with the King outlining his recognition of the 'vital role that civil society plays in enhancing our democratic model'. Despite promising in-principle progress, researchers continue to express concern about the underpinning neopatriarchal structure and functioning of Jordanian society, which seems to cycle between liberalisation and control.

Universal and proportionately targeted policies for daily living

The SPR assesses the quality of a country's current policy and institutional framework, where 'quality' refers to how conducive that framework is to fostering poverty reduction, sustainable growth and the effective use of development assistance. Across the eight country cases, the SPR was highest for Ethiopia, Jordan and Spain, and lowest for Afghanistan and the US. Universal health and social protection policies provide a solid platform for HE progress. Prior to the war in Tigray, Ethiopia had some of the fastest rates of poverty reduction in the world and ran the largest social protection programme in Africa. While in the USA, the social protection system has been described as involving eligibility rules that 'are too strict', with benefits that 'are too hard to access even when people are eligible' and benefits amounts that 'are too low'. The social protection system in the USA is reported to contribute to widening inequities along the lines of race and gender.

### Penile transplantation as an appropriate response to botched traditional circumcisions in south Africa: an argument against… [^ab58efe4]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2018). Low credibility.

A similar obligation could be extended to civilians suffering penile injuries due to non-battlefield causes, such as cancer or accidents, as with the patient in Boston. In this case, however, the basis of the obligation would have to change from reciprocity to a putative right to healthcare. Following Matthew Liao, one could argue for a right to basic healthcare, and then add further arguments to cover a further right to more-than-basic healthcare, including penile transplantation. Liao argues: (1) human beings have human rights to the fundamental conditions for pursuing a good life; (2) basic health is a fundamental condition for pursuing a good life; (3) therefore, human beings have a human right to basic health; (4) a human right to basic health implies a human right to those essential resources for maintaining and promoting basic health; (5) basic healthcare is an essential resource for maintaining and promoting basic health; (6) therefore, there is a human right to basic healthcare. The further step, that is, whether human beings with disabilities have rights to more than just basic healthcare, has long been discussed, without consensus. Defence of such rights leads quickly into questions of healthcare resource allocation, where under many cost-effectiveness models those with pre-existing disabilities often have less claim to medical care than the non-disabled. In many cases, getting the greatest benefit from scarce medical resources means providing them to those who are (healthwise) less worse off. Against this background, the ingredients for an argument for a right to penile transplantation in the US context would include: the fact that relatively few people would demand it; that the costs of the operation are likely to go down as techniques improve; that private insurance companies may provide coverage in the future. Many problems remain, clearly, such as weighing a right to penile transplantation against rights related to other, difficult-to-compare and more life-threatening forms of disability. However, that is true of all such rights.

The contribution of community participation

Providing data that support the contribution of community participation to health proved to be even more challenging. First, there are no standard definitions for either 'community' or 'participation'. In the health literature 'community' is often defined within geographic borders assuming a homogeneity of share interests. Yet common sense and experience confirms people living in the same area most often have different backgrounds, views and commitments'. articipation' has often been defined on a spectrum that ranges from having community people turn up at a meeting for a discussion of health topics to community people becoming part of the decisions about how health programmes are created, implemented and financed (empowerment). Second, participation in health programmes has been based on a number of unproven assumptions. These include: programmes can be created and implemented without clearly defining 'community' and 'participation'; the provision of information ensures that people information will change their attitudes and behaviours; people want to be involved in decisions about their own health care; and participation will empower people to act in the way professionals know will bring about health improvements. Third, the evidence to support the contribution of participation to development projects including health has not been robust. The World Bank commissioned a review to investigate the contribution of participation in development projects including health. The conclusion was that the money which the Bank invested in participation, over $85 billion over the period 2003–2013, was 'arguably still driven by ideology and optimism more than by systematic analysis, either theoretical or empirical' (p. 3). Finally, it has been shown that community participation in health has not addressed questions around power and control, a key to the emphasis on the importance on empowering people in order to make health interventions sustainable and cost-effective. Much of the literature has focused on the mechanisms of community participation rather than context and process. It was only in 2016 the Bulletin of the World Health Organization published an article that concluded power must be identified in communities if the transformation to sustainable health actions and programmes is to succeed.

Culturally informed care for individuals who are LIEM attends to and accounts for financial barriers, social marginalization, and differentiated development trajectories, noting that constraints are not purely monetary and can include access to quality school districts, childcare, adequate insurance, family size, and cultural capital. Psychologists who wish to provide culturally appropriate care are encouraged to design services and interventions that consider these barriers in how they facilitate access to care and administer services.

### Reconsidering the role of patriarchy in upholding female genital modifications: analysis of contemporary and pre-industrial societies [^ff4b557b]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The underlying motivations for these practices vary from culture to culture but are often broadly similar for both sexes, as we will discuss. In some cultures, the rite for girls elevates their social status, promoting within-sex bonding and increased personal and political agency. In others, where only boys are cut, it is the lack of a similar rite for girls that reflects their lower status. No single, overarching rule can be applied to every context. As one anthropologist has stated: "By collapsing all of the many different types of procedures performed into a single set for each sex, categories are created that do not accurately describe any situation that actually occurs anywhere in the world" (p. 3).

Ultimately, the stigma surrounding, and negative reactions to, the female-affecting practices arise for many reasons, including a genuine concern for the well-being of women and girls. However, Western-led campaigns to criminalize and eliminate only the female half of traditionally gender-inclusive genital cutting rites, mainly in Africa, have attracted growing criticism, including from feminist scholars who share female-child-protective concerns. According to some critics, such sex-selective campaigning may work against gender equality — for example, by weakening women's authority relative to men — while evincing moral double standards, the inconsistent application of human rights principles, and Western cultural imperialism.

These concerns are not merely academic. Rather, a failure to understand the complexities of, and commonalties between, male and female genital cutting practices has real-world consequences. It can lead to harmful or inappropriate medical care for affected women, based on inaccurate assumptions about their bodies and experiences; racially discriminatory surveillance of young girls and their families following migration to Western countries; unjust criminal proceedings targeting certain minority groups, and unequal treatment of persons of different sexes, genders, ethnic backgrounds, or religions. Accordingly, some scholars and advocates have called for greater accuracy in public health campaigns and social initiatives regarding these practices, irrespective of one's moral attitudes toward them. In other words, given the significant harms to already-marginalized individuals and communities that are caused by misinformed policy measures in this area, efforts to discourage female genital modifications, if they are to be justified, must at least be based on reliable information about the variegated nature of these practices rather than unsupported generalizations.

### A proposal for an inclusive working definition of genetic discrimination to promote a more coherent debate [^ccd9666b]. Nature Genetics (2024). High credibility.

Genetic discrimination is an evolving phenomenon that impacts fundamental human rights such as dignity, justice and equity. Although, in the past, various definitions to better conceptualize genetic discrimination have been proposed, these have been unable to capture several key facets of the phenomenon. In this Perspective, we explore definitions of genetic discrimination across disciplines, consider criticisms of such definitions and show how other forms of discrimination and stigmatization can compound genetic discrimination in a way that affects individuals, groups and systems. We propose a nuanced and inclusive definition of genetic discrimination, which reflects its multifaceted impact that should remain relevant in the face of an evolving social context and advancing science. We argue that our definition should be adopted as a guiding academic framework to facilitate scientific and policy discussions about genetic discrimination and support the development of laws and industry policies seeking to address the phenomenon.

Questions for discussion — Michael include "What are some practitioners' self-reflections regarding their values, beliefs, and assumptions about refugees coming to the United States from countries with civil strife; and about their knowledge of political uprisings, dictatorships, and religious and ethnic cleansing in African, Arabic, and/or Middle Eastern nations?" "How would a psychologist do a structured intake on personal and family history with Michael, who is a reticent and distrusting interviewee?" "Describe Michael's various cultural and social identities and their intersectionality. Which are dictated externally and have developed into an existential problem of a lack of self-knowledge?" and "Describe a community-based intervention that may help Michael incorporate and internalize a revolutionary aspect into his identity".

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^5b468e7d]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

System-justifying ideologies — definition and implications — are described as the general motivation to defend, bolster, and justify the status quo, current institutions, and social arrangements, encompassing constructs such as Protestant work ethic, meritocratic ideology, fair market ideology, and belief in a just world; these share an assumption that hard work, merit, and subsequent achievement is based on an individual's ability and that this ability is rewarded by a system that is fair and just, and evidence indicates that subtle priming messages of meritocracy can contribute to individual cognitive justification of social inequalities.

### Fine-scale population structure and the era of next-generation sequencing [^288eae96]. Human Molecular Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

Fine-scale population structure characterizes most continents and is especially pronounced in non-cosmopolitan populations. Roughly half of the world's population remains non-cosmopolitan and even populations within cities often assort along ethnic and linguistic categories. Barriers to random mating can be ecologically extreme, such as the Sahara Desert, or cultural, such as the Indian caste system. In either case, subpopulations accumulate genetic differences if the barrier is maintained over multiple generations. Genome-wide polymorphism data, initially with only a few hundred autosomal microsatellites, have clearly established differences in allele frequency not only among continental regions, but also within continents and within countries. We review recent evidence from the analysis of genome-wide polymorphism data for genetic boundaries delineating human population structure and the main demographic and genomic processes shaping variation, and discuss the implications of population structure for the distribution and discovery of disease-causing genetic variants, in the light of the imminent availability of sequencing data for a multitude of diverse human genomes.

### Advancing health equity by addressing the social determinants of… [^8bfdb455]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

These have a greater impact on population health than factors like biology, behavior, and health care. 2, 3 SDoH, especially poverty, structural racism, and discrimination, are the primary drivers of health inequities. 4–6 Reducing health inequities is important because they are pervasive; unfair and unjust; individuals affected have little control over the contributing circumstances; affect everyone; and can be avoided with existing policy solutions.
7. 1 Structural Determinants of Health Inequities: The social, economic, and political mechanisms which generate social class inequalities in society. 8 Health Equity: "Health equity means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible. This requires removing obstacles to health such as poverty, discrimination, and their consequences, including powerlessness and lack of access to good jobs with fair pay, quality education and housing, safe environments, and health care".

10 Health Inequities: "A difference or disparity in health outcomes that is systematic, avoidable, and unjust. " 10 The most prevalent and severe health inequities occur where there is poverty, systematic racism, and discrimination. 6 Some of the most common and well-researched health inequities are experienced between groups based on socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender expression, as well as geographic location. 11, 12 Information is provided in the following sections to help characterize these health inequities. However, this is not intended to be comprehensive or cover all health inequities. Socioeconomic status refers to the social and economic factors that influence the position individuals hold in society. This includes factors like occupation, class, education, income, and wealth.

11, 12 Individuals with higher socioeconomic status consistently experience better health outcomes than those with lower socioeconomic status, and this occurs across a social gradient. 11 It is not just the very poor who are affected. Research has shown that: 8 These are macro-level factors that impact large numbers of people. Examples of structural determinants of health include the degree that government subsidizes health care or education; decisions about pollution, including minimum standards or where toxic substances are stored or released; and decisions about the built environment, which can benefit or harm communities. These all contribute to social class inequalities. The AAFP supports the following types of public policies for their ability to address SDoH and reduce health inequities.

### Advancing collaborative research for health: why does collaboration matter? [^6596b4e3]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

The calls for health research to be collaborative are ubiquitous-even as part of a recent World Health Assembly resolution on clinical trials-yet the arguments in support of collaborative research have been taken for granted and are absent in the literature. This article provides three arguments to justify why health research ought to be collaborative and discusses trade-offs to be considered among the ethical values guiding each argument.

### Global human trafficking and child victimization [^a17565f7]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Global Human Trafficking and Child Victimization — trafficking of children for labor and sexual exploitation violates basic human rights and constitutes a major global public health problem. Pediatricians and other health care professionals may encounter victims who present with infections, injuries, posttraumatic stress disorder, suicidality, or a variety of other physical or behavioral health conditions. Preventing child trafficking, recognizing victimization, and intervening appropriately require a public health approach that incorporates rigorous research on the risk factors, health impact, and effective treatment options for child exploitation as well as implementation and evaluation of primary prevention programs. Health care professionals need training to recognize possible signs of exploitation and to intervene appropriately, and they need to adopt a multidisciplinary, outward-focused approach to service provision, working with nonmedical professionals in the community to assist victims. Pediatricians also need to advocate for legislation and policies that promote child rights and victim services as well as those that address the social determinants of health, which influence the vulnerability to human trafficking. This policy statement outlines major issues regarding public policy, medical education, research, and collaboration in the area of child labor and sex trafficking and provides recommendations for future work. A critical role of the pediatric health care professional is to advocate for the health and well-being of children and adolescents. Central to this role is the conviction that health and well-being depend on a guarantee of fundamental human rights.

### The implicit ideological function of the global health field and its role in maintaining relations of power [^1a044b9e]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Conclusion

Ideology functions to naturalise and maintain prevailing relations of power. Recent debates about power imbalances in global health have urged the field to contest 'all forms of supremacy', 'to become actively anti-supremacist, and also anti-oppressionist and anti-racist' in order 'to transcend its origin'. This is a necessary step for transforming the field towards greater equity. But it is not enough. Critiquing particular ideological contents does not address how ideology operates. Without understanding and critiquing how ideology operates, we risk losing sight of new narratives in the making to legitimise inequalities.

As I am writing this article as an employee at the Gates Foundation, my own critical self-reflection gives rise to a sense of unease from recognising the inherent contradiction in my privileged position. No amount of writing about the ideological function of the field will 'cancel out' this conflict, and that is precisely the point: to confront the unease in recognising the injustice embedded in the structure, and my own inextricable role in it. Denying this conflict with 'but I am doing my part' obscures my role in perpetuating the structure of injustice. My intent is irrelevant. What matters is what is implicit in my doing.

Let us 'do our part' but let us not fall for an illusion that it is possible to escape the ideological pressure and conditioning which are inherent in an unequal and unjust society. That may sound pessimistic, but it is far from it. The point is to confront ideology and make it visible. Solidarity is unimaginable otherwise. Spaces for shared struggle open when we collectively confront the injustices inherent in the system, and our role in sustaining it. When we make visible this implicit ideological function that global health field performs, we can see new directions, new ideas and new allies for collective action that are otherwise kept unimaginable.

### Understanding participation dilemmas in community mobilisation: can collective action theory help? [^9950f885]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2019). Medium credibility.

(C) Outsize stakes, intermediate goals and interdependent groups are means by which the need for collective action may not involve a participation dilemma. Some individuals may have such an outsize stake in addressing a particular public issue that they are willing to either bear the full cost of supplying the non-excludable good or contribute to it despite their personal impact being small relative to personal cost. For example, a wealthy patron might be willing to build a clean water supply for his whole village, or a politically well-connected community member may be able to lobby for policy change on behalf of the community. Individuals may also see sufficient value in realising easily achievable intermediate goals that the achievement of the final goal is less important. For example, a health and sanitation club may be satisfied with raising awareness rather than changing behaviours in the short-term. Collective actions involving small, interdependent groups also pose less of a participation dilemma. When each individual contribution is essential to the end result, a single free rider would compromise the whole enterprise. For example, a small troupe of activist street theatre performers may depend intimately on each other for success. In general, when personal contributions make large, unique impacts, social dilemmas pose less of a problem.

(D) Intrinsic benefits or 'expressive' or 'symbolic' benefitsare psychological or moral benefits that are intrinsic to the act of participating, unlike 'instrumental benefits' that accrue as a result of participating. All the above motivations (A–C) were oriented towards obtaining instrumental benefits. Intrinsic benefits include gaining a sense of agency, feeling part of a greater cause, expressing outrage, feeling the 'warm glow' of helping others, feeling less lonely, expressing one's identity, showing solidarity or performing one's moral duty. Some political scientists have asserted that intrinsic benefits are the only rational incentive for participation in voting given the vanishing likelihood of any single vote changing the outcome of an election. Many intrinsic benefits depend on individual perceptions of community issues; thus, skilled communication and 'framing'of issues is crucial for activating them as motivations for collective action. For example, feminist microcredit non-government organisations in rural India successfully coordinated a number of large-scale protests against witch-hunts among tribal women by framing them as part of their struggle for independence from abusive husbands and exploitative employers.

### A libertarian case for mandatory vaccination [^5d16b550]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2018). Low credibility.

This paper argues that mandatory, government-enforced vaccination can be justified even within a libertarian political framework. If so, this implies that the case for mandatory vaccination is very strong indeed as it can be justified even within a framework that, at first glance, loads the philosophical dice against that conclusion. I argue that people who refuse vaccinations violate the 'clean hands principle', a (in this case, enforceable) moral principle that prohibits people from participating in the collective imposition of unjust harm or risk of harm. In a libertarian framework, individuals may be forced to accept certain vaccines not because they have an enforceable duty to serve the common, and not because cost-benefit analysis recommends it, but because anti-vaxxers are wrongfully imposing undue harm upon others.

### An actionable anti-racism plan for geoscience organizations [^ab87d8c0]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Geoscience organizations shape the discipline. They influence attitudes and expectations, set standards, and provide benefits to their members. Today, racism and discrimination limit the participation of, and promote hostility towards, members of minoritized groups within these critical geoscience spaces. This is particularly harmful for Black, Indigenous, and other people of color in geoscience and is further exacerbated along other axes of marginalization, including disability status and gender identity. Here we present a twenty-point anti-racism plan that organizations can implement to build an inclusive, equitable and accessible geoscience community. Enacting it will combat racism, discrimination, and the harassment of all members.

### Caring for rohingya refugees with diphtheria and measles: on the ethics of humanity [^45a5a6b1]. Annals of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees arrived in Bangladesh within weeks in fall 2017, quickly forming large settlements without any basic support. Humanitarian first responders provided basic necessities including food, shelter, water, sanitation, and health care. However, the challenge before them-a vast camp ravaged by diphtheria and measles superimposed on a myriad of common pathologies-was disproportionate to the resources. The needs were endless, resources finite, inadequacies abundant, and premature death inevitable. While such confines force unimaginable choices in resource allocation, they do not define the humanitarian purpose-to alleviate suffering and not allow such moral violations to become devoid of their horrifying meaning. As humanitarian workers, we maintain humanity when we care, commit, and respond to moral injustices. This refusal to abandon others in desperate situations is an attempt to rectify injustices through witnessing and solidarity. When people are left behind, we must not leave them alone.

### The concept of prevention: a good idea gone astray? [^c16f12c8]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2008). Low credibility.

Over time, the definition of prevention has expanded so that its meaning in the context of health services is now unclear. As risk factors are increasingly considered to be the equivalent of "diseases" for purposes of intervention, the concept of prevention has lost all practical meaning. This paper reviews the inconsistencies in its utility, and suggests principles that it should follow in the future: a population orientation with explicit consideration of attributable risk, the setting of priorities based on reduction in illness and avoidance of adverse effects, and the imperative to reduce inequities in health.

### IDPoor: a poverty identification programme that enables collaboration across sectors for maternal and child health in Cambodia [^6f1a6d41]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Poverty identification in IDPoor

Poverty levels in Cambodia have decreased substantially — from 47.8% of the population in 2007 to 13.5% in 2015. Nevertheless, a large proportion of non-poor households sit just above the national poverty threshold and are vulnerable to falling back into poverty.

The relation between poverty and poor health is well established. In poverty reduction, the targeting of services to those most in need is a common approach, including as a strategy within universal policies. Even though targeting is generally exposed to trade-off compromises between accuracy and workability, many countries have opted to prioritise access to health and social services for the poorest on the grounds of both efficiency and equity. To guide targeted delivery of services, at least 30 LMICs have developed some type of social protection information system, mostly social registries. In principle these also create the potential to align different social assistance programmes. Given the proliferation of such schemes and the importance of promoting MCH through sectors such as health and education, we seek to document what integration across sectors can be achieved through an example of a social registry in a LMIC.

IDPoor is central to the RGC's efforts to promote equity, with a mandate to identify the poor for targeting by health and social programmes across multiple sectors. Since 2011, Cambodia's Sub-Decree 291 has made it mandatory for all programmes targeting the poor to use IDPoor data for analysis, planning, and implementation.

IDPoor's origin is linked to the introduction of the national Health Equity Fund (HEF). After government health facilities introduced user fees in 1996, HEF grew out of the need to reduce financial access barriers for poor people in a standardised way. Health facilities faced the challenge of assessing poor patients' claims for fee exemptions without a systematic process, making it vulnerable to inconsistencies and with limited effectiveness in protecting poor Cambodians. At the same time, the social assistance landscape in Cambodia was fragmented, with different programmes operating across sectors, each implementing its own poverty targeting mechanism. In response, in 2005 the MoP, together with development partners, began formulating a national, cross sectoral poverty identification mechanism, which could serve multiple social assistance programmes. Active involvement of relevant ministries at national and sub-national level, communal structures, non-governmental organisations, and development partners helped to build a consensus on the national guidelines and contributed to wide acceptance of IDPoor.
