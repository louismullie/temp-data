## Question

Finger clubbing takes 6 months to develop

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether finger clubbing takes 6 months to develop and how to interpret that timeline in a clinical context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes finger clubbing and how we objectively measure it. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology to understand why timing might vary. Next, I will examine direct evidence on the time course of clubbing development and resolution. After that, I need to consider modifiers such as age, disease severity, and reversibility. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious conclusion and outline practical clinical implications for detection and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. Finger clubbing is a characteristic change in the distal phalanges with increased nail-fold angle, loss of the normal Lovibond angle, and increased distal phalangeal depth, often quantified by the profile angle, hyponychial angle, and phalangeal depth ratio; a distal phalangeal to interphalangeal depth ratio greater than 1.0 supports clubbing, and the Schamroth window is a useful bedside screen, though interobserver agreement varies and objective indices improve reliability [^1126bXqy] [^113iqHW5].

> I need to check the pathophysiology to anticipate time scales. The leading model implicates megakaryocyte fragmentation failure in diseased lungs, allowing platelet precursors to lodge in distal digital vessels and release platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, driving vascular proliferation, soft-tissue hypertrophy, and periosteal new bone; MRI studies corroborate nail-bed hypervascularization and bone edema in clubbed digits, which mechanistically explains why clubbing can evolve over weeks to months as these tissue changes accumulate [^1126bXqy] [^113paNNB].

> Now, let me examine direct evidence on timing. Wait, let me verify the most concrete data: in cystic fibrosis patients undergoing lung transplantation, clubbing regressed within 3 months in two patients and by 9 months in the third, with mean DPD/IPD ratios falling from 1.08 pre-transplant to near-normal by 3–6 months. This implies that the structural and vascular changes underlying clubbing can reverse on a similar time scale, suggesting development can also occur over months rather than years in active disease states [^1126bXqy]. Similarly, with highly effective CFTR modulator therapy, clubbing indices decreased significantly within 3 months, reinforcing a months-long time frame for change in either direction [^1124Mq55].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should consider modifiers. Age matters: infants and children can manifest clubbing rapidly in the setting of congenital heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, or severe interstitial lung disease, sometimes even at birth or within months, reflecting the vulnerability of growing tissues to cytokine signaling and hypoxia. Conversely, in adults with indolent disease, clubbing may evolve more slowly and be recognized only when advanced [^116wJeDY] [^116NNTPt]. Disease severity and activity also modify the time course. Aggressive malignancies or fulminant infections may accelerate clubbing, whereas mild chronic hypoxia may yield a gradual course over many months [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "clubbing takes 6 months" might be a fixed rule, but I should correct that impression. The 6-month figure is a useful clinical heuristic rather than a universal constant. It aligns with the observed 3–6 month window for regression after correcting the underlying disease and with case-based observations of evolution in active pathology, yet onset can be faster in severe disease and slower in milder or early cases, so a 6-month horizon reasonably captures many adult presentations while acknowledging biological variability [^1126bXqy] [^1124Mq55].

> Next, I should review how this informs practice. Let me consider detection and follow-up: because early clubbing is subtle and interobserver agreement is variable, I should confirm with quantitative indices such as the phalangeal depth ratio and profile angle, and if early clubbing is suspected, I should re-examine over 3–6 months to document progression, while concurrently investigating likely secondary causes such as lung cancer, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis, cyanotic heart disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and hepatic disease. In children, clubbing is a red flag that warrants expedited evaluation for underlying pulmonary or cardiac disease [^113iqHW5] [^1142YTem] [^111MZnPL].

> I will now examine reversibility to strengthen the inference about time course. Clubbing can regress after treatment of the underlying condition, as shown after lung transplantation in cystic fibrosis and with CFTR modulators, and case reports describe resolution after correction of shunt physiology or removal of tumors, supporting the concept that the tissue remodeling driving clubbing is dynamic over months rather than fixed. This reinforces the clinical value of tracking clubbing as a biomarker of disease activity and response to therapy [^1126bXqy] [^1124Mq55] [^114Rwiza] [^113tGWh3].

> Putting this together, I should conclude carefully. Finger clubbing does not universally require 6 months to develop, but a 3–6 month window is a clinically useful estimate for many adults with active cardiopulmonary or gastrointestinal disease. Onset can be faster in infants and children or in aggressive disease, and slower in indolent conditions, and its reversibility within months after effective treatment of the cause supports a similar time scale for development in the first place. Therefore, clinicians should document clubbing objectively, correlate with disease severity, and use serial examinations over 3–6 months to clarify evolution while pursuing targeted evaluation for secondary causes [^1126bXqy] [^1124Mq55] [^113iqHW5] [^114K174y].

---

The claim that finger clubbing takes 6 months to develop is **not supported by strong evidence**; the timeline varies with the underlying disease, its severity, and individual factors. Clubbing can appear within weeks to months in acute or severe disease, and may take months to years in chronic or mild disease. There is **no fixed 6-month rule**, and clinicians should assess clubbing promptly when detected, as it often signals serious underlying disease [^113iqHW5] [^114K174y].

---

## Evidence on the timeline of clubbing development

- **Variability in onset**: Clubbing can develop within weeks to months in acute or severe disease, and over months to years in chronic or mild disease.
- **No fixed timeline**: There is no established 6-month rule; onset is highly variable and disease-dependent.
- **Clinical examples**: Rapid onset has been documented in lung cancer, bronchiectasis, and infective endocarditis, while chronic diseases like ILD or liver cirrhosis may show slower progression.

---

## Factors influencing the rate of clubbing development

Several factors influence **how quickly clubbing develops**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on clubbing development** |
|-|-|
| Underlying disease | - Acute or severe diseases (e.g. lung cancer, bronchiectasis, infective endocarditis) can cause rapid onset <br/> - Chronic diseases (e.g. ILD, liver cirrhosis) progress more slowly |
| Disease severity | More severe disease accelerates clubbing |
| Individual factors | Age, genetics, and comorbidities affect onset and progression |
| Environmental factors | Smoking and occupational exposures may hasten development |

---

## Clinical implications of clubbing development timeline

- **Diagnostic significance**: Clubbing is a marker of serious disease; rapid onset should prompt urgent evaluation.
- **Prognostic value**: Faster onset may reflect more aggressive disease and worse prognosis.
- **Management**: Early detection and treatment of the cause can slow or reverse clubbing.

---

## Reversibility of clubbing

Clubbing can **reverse** with effective treatment of the underlying disease, such as lung transplantation in cystic fibrosis [^1126bXqy] or highly effective CFTR modulator therapy [^1124Mq55]. The timeline for reversal also varies with disease control and severity.

---

## Conclusion

There is **no fixed 6-month rule** for clubbing development; the timeline varies with disease, severity, and individual factors. Clinicians should evaluate clubbing promptly, as it often indicates serious disease, and management of the underlying condition can alter its course.

Differential diagnosis

Because the tumour diffusely involved surrounding tissues, detection of the primary site was not easy. At first, the constellation of dyspnoea, smoking history, remarkable digital clubbing and mediastinal mass made us consider lung cancer and bronchogenic tumour as differential diagnoses rather than oesophageal GIST. Endoscopic and pathological findings were very useful for making the correct diagnosis.

Patient 2

An 11-month-old male infant was admitted to our hospital with bilateral lower-limb swelling. The patient had exhibited bilateral digital clubbing since birth and had a PDA that spontaneously closed at six months of age (Fig. 1 J-L). His 4-year-old sister had a history of PDA, atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), and digital clubbing. However, digital clubbing persisted despite surgical correction of the ASD and VSD.

The patient was born at 35 +6 weeks of gestation via vaginal delivery due to excessive amniotic fluid, with a birth weight of 2.2 kg. The mother, aged 29 years at the time of delivery, had a normal pregnancy with regular prenatal check-ups. No significant complications were reported during the pregnancy. The father, aged 30 years at conception, had a mild form of digital clubbing. There was no consanguinity between the parents. The mother denied exposure to known teratogens during pregnancy and did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs.

Upon admission, the patient was alert but irritable. Physical examination revealed pronounced non-pitting edema in both lower limbs. Digital clubbing was evident in the extremities, but muscle strength and tone remained normal. Radiographs of the long bones demonstrated bilateral thickening of the humeri, ulnae, radii, femora, and tibiae, with layered periosteal reactions and spinal scoliosis (Fig. 1 E-H). The patient is 18 months old now, with a height of 80 cm (25th percentile for age), a weight of 9.9 kg (25th percentile for age), and a head circumference of 47 cm (25th percentile for age).

### Hypoxia due to intrapulmonary vascular dilatation in a toddler with a congenital portacaval shunt: case report [^114Rwiza]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The term hepatopulmonary syndrome typically applies to cyanosis that results from "intrapulmonary vascular dilatation" due to advanced liver disease. Similar findings may result from a congenital portosystemic shunt without liver disease. An adverse consequence of such shunts is intrapulmonary vascular dilatation, which affects the microvascular gas exchange units for oxygen.

Case Presentation

Here, we describe a toddler with chronic cyanosis, exercise intolerance, and finger clubbing due to a malformation shunt between the portal vein and the inferior vena cava. A transcatheter embolization of the shunt resulted in resolution of his findings.

Conclusions

Congenital portosystemic shunts need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of cyanosis.

Alternatively, ILD-associated growth factors implicated in clubbing may contribute to the development of TP. Although TP in the context of malignancy has been attributed to the secretion of epidermal growth factor by tumor cells, its pathogenesis in the absence of malignancy has yet to be elucidated. Perhaps platelet-derived growth factor, which is increased in ILD, produces cutaneous effects comparable to those of epidermal growth factor.

The strong association between TP and malignancy prompts an appropriately extensive workup but also has other implications, such as potential preclusion from organ transplantation. Our report adds to the small literature on nonmalignant TP. It is important to document these rare cases, as recognizing nonmalignant TP is essential to appropriate decision making in complex clinical scenarios and evokes alternative pathophysiologic mechanisms of disease.

Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in pleural SFT

Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (finger-clubbing) has been reported in 4–35% of patients with pleural SFT. It is characterized by finger clubbing that is associated with hypertrophic skin changes, and periosteal bone changes. The paraneoplastic manifestation of finger-clubbing secondary to thoracic SFT is eponymously referred to as Pierre-Marie-Bamberg syndrome [PMBS]. Reports in literature indicate that finger-clubbing in pleural SFT is more common than hypoglycaemia. The pathophysiology of finger-clubbing remains unascertained but it is postulated that the underlying HOA results from abnormal production of hyaluronic acid by the tumour cells resulting in periosteal changes, chronic hypoxia and paraneoplastic secretion of cytokines such as VEGF and PDGF. Though our patient had a history of smoking, it is the excision of the tumour that led to rapid and complete resolution of the finger-clubbing. This observation is consistent with previously published observations.

### Pathogenesis and current status of the treatment of lung cancer associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^116MbW9b]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, incurable lung disease characterized by chronic, progressive fibrosis of the lungs accompanied by an inexorable decline in lung function, progressive respiratory failure, and a high mortality rate. IPF has a poor prognosis, and its median survival without treatment is approximately 3–5 years after diagnosis However, recently published observations have reported improved survival in IPF patients, which may be related to early diagnosis and the use of antifibrotic drugs. The pathogenesis of IPF is unclear. The main clinical manifestations of IPF are shortness of breath, chronic cough, and clubbing fingers (showing chronic low blood oxygen saturation), and the diagnosis of IPF typically relies on histology and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest. Chest X-ray or computed tomography showing bilateral interstitial infiltration is considered one of the basic features of IPF. Currently, there are two antifibrotic drugs used as treatment strategies for IPF patients, pirfenidone and nintedanib, which can slow respiratory function decline. In addition, a recent large-scale real-world study demonstrated that by controlling for immortalization time bias, antifibrotic drugs simultaneously significantly reduced all-cause mortality and improved long-term survival in patients with IPF.

### Two cases of primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy caused by HPGD variants: a case report and literature review [^11476rP3]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature review

Given the limited reports of HPGD -related PHO, we thoroughly reviewed the cases published in PubMed. Our search identified 67 articles, of which 26 met the inclusion criteria (Supplemental Fig. 1). To date, 89 PHO cases attributed to HPGD variants have been documented. The c.310_311delCT variant accounted for 37.1% (33/89) of cases (Fig. 4), predominantly in homozygous form (60.6%, 20/33). Heterozygous HPGD variants can also cause PHO, albeit with milder PGE2 elevation and later symptom onset. Notably, the homozygous 577T > C variant exhibits variable penetrance linked to isolated clubbing or full PHO phenotypes, though this variability is not observed in other variants.

Fig. 4
Distribution of variant variants in HPGD, highlighting the predominance of c.310_311delCT

Ethnic distribution analysis revealed that 38% (34/89) of cases were Han Chinese, followed by Pakistani (13.5%, 12/89). Among cases with sex data, males outnumbered females (2.2:1 ratio). While previous studies linked male-biased PHO prevalence to SLCO2A1 variants, sex differences in HPGD -related PHO were previously considered insignificant. Our findings, however, suggest a potential male predominance in HPGD -associated cases. The median symptom onset age was 5.1 years (vs. 7.5 years historically reported), with digital clubbing often apparent at birth, implying earlier disease initiation than previously recognized. The median age at diagnosis is 22.1 years, with a significant difference between symptom onset and diagnosis. This delay underscores clinicians' potential lack of awareness, leading to delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis.

### More than knee pain: a case of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy secondary to lung cancer [^114XRVpD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA) is a musculoskeletal pathology that often occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome. 90% of HOA cases occur secondary to malignancy. 60 to 80% of which are lung cancers.

Case Report

We present a case of a 61-year-old man who had worsening knee pain. HOA was incidentally noted on extremity X-ray. The patient was found to have a soft-tissue attenuating mass on chest X-ray. The diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer was made after bronchoscopy. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? HOA can be an indication of malignancy, most commonly lung cancer, so it is important to recognize the key radiographic findings associated with HOA. When treating patients with bone pain and clubbed digits, emergency physicians should strongly consider screening for more severe primary pathology.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Amyopathic juvenile dermatomyositis
B. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
C. Pachydermodactyly
D. Subcutaneous granuloma annulare
E. Pachydermoperiostosis

Answers:
A. Amyopathic juvenile dermatomyositis – Incorrect. Amyopathic juvenile dermatomyositis is an autoimmune inflammatory disease with predominantly skin findings such as a purplish-red rash over the eyelids, erythematous patches and plaques over the neck, shoulders, chest, and back and dilated nail bed capillary loops. Purplish-red papules may be present on dorsum of hands over the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. Bilateral widening of the digits limited to PIP joints is not a feature. ANA is reported positive in 50% of cases.
B. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis – Incorrect. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory arthritis in children younger than 16 years. Characteristic symptoms include joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. Common lab abnormalities include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, with possible positive ANA and rheumatoid factor. Imaging shows changes of periarticular osteoporosis and bony erosion in the joint space.
C. Pachydermodactyly – Correct. Pachydermodactyly is a benign and uncommon fibromatosis typically seen around the proximal interphalangeal joints resulting in asymptomatic soft tissue swelling. It is most commonly seen in adolescent males. X-ray shows no joint or bony abnormalities and lab abnormalities are usually absent.
D. Subcutaneous granuloma annulare – Incorrect. Subcutaneous granuloma annulare is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue manifesting clinically as a single or multiple subcutaneous nodules. These lesions are predominantly found in children and often occur on the scalp, acral surfaces, and lower limbs, especially on the shins. The presence of discrete nodules as opposed to fusiform widening of digits makes this diagnosis less likely.
E. Pachydermoperiostosis – Incorrect. Pachydermoperiostosis is a rare genetic disorder with skin and bone involvement. Findings include coarsening of facial features, acne, hyperhidrosis, enlargement of hands and feet, clubbing of fingers and toes, and radiographic findings of periostosis and arthritis.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) — presentation and clinical course indicate that "Unoperated patients may present with a heart murmur or symptoms caused by a large left-to-right shunt, including shortness of breath and easy fatigability". With large nonrestrictive PDA, "the patient may present with Eisenmenger physiology, including differential cyanosis and clubbing". Such patients "are at an increased risk of developing endarteritis, heart failure, and pulmonary vascular disease".

### Clinicopathologic conference: a four-year-old child with digital clubbing [^111Q4oNV]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

The differential diagnosis of clubbing and of recurrent fevers are broad. This review will cover the differential of clubbing, particularly in the setting of recurrent fever.

The exact mechanism behind clubbing remains controversial, though several theories have been proposed. One such theory suggests that increased serum concentrations of growth hormone are associated with clubbing, although that has not been demonstrated in all cases of patients with clubbing. It has also been proposed that local vascular changes lead to arteriovenous anastomoses that result in changes of digital microcirculation, though firm evidence in support of this theory is lacking. Another theory proposes that clubbing is a function of platelet production, wherein the normal process of megakaryocyte breakdown into platelets inside the lungs is disrupted, allowing whole megakaryocytes to circulate. The megakaryocytes then become trapped in the finger or toe tip circulation. There, the megakaryocytes release platelet‐derived growth factor, ultimately leading to the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. However, this theory does not explain the existence of clubbing in all disease entities. Thus, the exact pathophysiologic process of clubbing remains unknown.

Despite the pathophysiology being uncertain, clubbing is a definite sign of pathologic changes, and the differential diagnosis includes primary and secondary causes. Primary clubbing can be seen in primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (PHO). PHO is also known as pachydermoperiostosis, a rare genetic syndrome affecting the skin and bones. It is characterized by digital clubbing, periosteal new bone formation, coarse facial features, and skin thickening. It typically arises either during the first year of life or during puberty. Causes of secondary clubbing are more diverse, as detailed below (Table 1). Causes of secondary clubbing with associated fever are also delineated.

### Cutaneous sarcoidosis: differential diagnosis [^1116ZirE]. Clinics in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease with cutaneous lesions present in 20%-35% of patients. Given the wide variability of clinical manifestations, it is one of the "great imitators", making it necessary to consider clinical, epidemiological, radiographic, laboratory, and histopathological criteria to make the diagnosis. Cutaneous lesions have been classified as specific and nonspecific, depending on the presence of noncaseating granulomas on histologic studies. Specific lesions include maculopapules, plaques, nodules, lupus pernio, scar infiltration, alopecia, ulcerative lesions, and hypopigmentation among others. Nail, mucosal, and childhood sarcoidosis represent a distinct subset of the disease process. The most common nonspecific lesion is erythema nodosum. Others include calcifications, prurigo, erythema multiforme, nail clubbing, and Sweet syndrome. The importance of considering cutaneous sarcoidosis in the clinical differential diagnosis of a given skin lesion relies on the association with systemic involvement and the convenience of the skin as a tissue source for histologic analysis.

### What are the clinical features of lung cancer before the diagnosis is made? A population based case-control study [^114WYEX6]. Thorax (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Over 38,000 new cases of lung cancer occur each year in the UK. Most are diagnosed after initial presentation to primary care, but the relative importance of the various clinical features is largely unknown.

Methods

A population based case-control study was undertaken in all 21 general practices in Exeter, Devon, UK (population 128 700). 247 primary lung cancers were studied in subjects aged over 40 years diagnosed between 1998 and 2002 and 1235 controls matched by age, sex and general practice. The entire primary care record for 2 years before diagnosis was coded using the International Classification of Primary Care-2. Univariable and multivariable conditional logistic regression analyses were used to identify and quantify clinical features independently associated with lung cancer. The main outcome measures were odds ratios and positive predictive values for these variables.

Results

Seven symptoms (haemoptysis, loss of weight, loss of appetite, dyspnoea, thoracic pain, fatigue and cough), one physical sign (finger clubbing), and two abnormal investigation results (thrombocytosis and abnormal spirometry) were associated with lung cancer in multivariable analyses, as was cigarette smoking. After excluding variables reported in the final 180 days before diagnosis, haemoptysis, dyspnoea and abnormal spirometry remained independently associated with cancer.

Conclusions

This study provides an evidence base for selection of patients for investigation of possible lung cancer, both for clinicians and for developers of guidelines.

### Painful clubbing and sarcoidosis… [^115e6xYH]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

ACQUIRED clubbing, particularly when painful, has long been recognized as an important physical finding often associated with an underlying disease. Detailed reviews have listed numerous pulmonary, cardiac, hepatic, gastrointestinal, and endocrinologic diseases as causes of acquired symmetrical clubbing. 1, 2 Notably absent from this list is sarcoidosis, which is a systemic disease known frequently to affect all these organ systems simultaneously. We report herein sarcoidosis associated with painful clubbing of all fingers and toes. Of interest also was the dramatic relief of pain and stiffness achieved with colchicine therapy. Report of a Case A 28-year-old man was seen at the medical clinic with a three-year history of migratory polyarthralgias and an 18-month history of painful clubbing of fingers and toes.

Associated symptoms included malaise, generalized weakness, low-grade fever, 7-kg weight loss, nonproductive cough with dyspnea on exertion, and one episode of painful nodules on the anterior aspect of his shins.

### Clinicopathologic conference: a four-year-old child with digital clubbing [^1129RCUB]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Another disease with increasing recognition is COPA syndrome, an autosomal dominant autoinflammatory condition named for mutations in the COPα gene. COPA syndrome is characterized by restrictive lung disease, arthritis, and renal disease. Patients with COPA syndrome frequently have clubbing due to their underlying restrictive lung disease. COPA syndrome is a relatively new and rare disorder, and the incidence and prevalence of this condition are still uncertain. Recurrent or periodic fever does not appear to be a defining feature of COPA syndrome. This lowered our suspicion that COPA syndrome was the cause of our patient's presentation. She also did not have arthritis or renal involvement to support this diagnosis.

Interestingly, there is a case report of a child with recurrent fevers and hepatosplenomegaly who ultimately developed clubbing secondary to portal hypertension due to Takayasu arteritis. Given the report of fevers and the initially elevated level of alkaline phosphatase, systemic sarcoidosis was considered. Sarcoidosis is a condition characterized by necrotizing granuloma formation in multiple tissues with manifestations dependent on the organ. Our patient did not have lymphadenopathy, parenchymal lung disease, organomegaly, or hypercalcemia that would suggest this diagnosis, and the elevated alkaline phosphatase level normalized spontaneously, further lowering suspicion for this disease.

Gastrointestinal (GI) conditions

GI‐related causes of clubbing include inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile polyposis, hepatic disorders, and celiac disease. Though our patient had abdominal pain following fevers, she did not have diarrhea, constipation, mucosal sores, or other findings to suggest primary GI disease. Her initially elevated alkaline phosphatase finding normalized without intervention, also lowering our suspicion for primary GI disease.

Neoplastic disease

Clubbing has been associated with neoplasms for decades, particularly with pulmonary neoplasms. However, for our patient, a primary pulmonary neoplasm was felt to be unlikely given her age and lack of risk factors, such as smoking or exposure to smoke. She also lacked systemic symptoms, such as night sweats, coughing, or weight loss, to suggest neoplasm. Her chest radiograph did not demonstrate a mass that would be consistent with primary pulmonary neoplasm.

Infectious disease

Infectious causes of clubbing include more indolent infections, such as tuberculosis, infective endocarditis, HIV, or chronic parasitic infection. She lacked risk factors for these infections, lowering suspicion that they were the cause of her symptoms.

### Band acro-osteolysis in a middle-aged woman [^115GSXnR]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Description

A female market worker in her 50s presented with fingertip pain and swelling over the past 6 months, rendering it difficult to handle goods (figure 1). She had no symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon or history of psoriasis, traumatic hand injury, frostbite or exposure to polyvinyl chloride. She had no family history of congenital bone dysplasia and psoriasis. Physical examination revealed mild clubbing of both thumbs and index fingers without nail deformities. Arterial oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry of the right index finger was 97%. Radiography (figure 2) and MRI (figure 3) revealed band acro-osteolysis of the distal phalanges of both thumbs and index fingers. A destructive change was evident in the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint of the right middle finger. There were no elevations in the levels of C reactive protein, serum alkaline phosphatase, calcium or intact parathyroid hormone. The serum was negative for rheumatoid factor, anti-DNA antibodies, anti-Scl-70 antibody and anticentromere antibodies.

Figure 1
Mild clubbing was evident in both thumbs and index fingers.

T1-weighted (left) and T2-weighted (right) magnetic resonance images of the distal phalanx of the right thumb.

The aetiologies of acro-osteolysis can be classified as idiopathic disease, occupational disease (caused by exposure to polyvinyl chloride, frostbite, or trauma), immunological disease (systemic sclerosis and psoriasis), infections (leprosy), endocrinological disease (hyperparathyroidism and diabetes mellitus), genetic condition (Hajdu-Cheney syndrome with or without syringomyelia) and lysosomal storage disorder (Gaucher's disease).

### Surgically cured hypoglycemia secondary to pleural solitary fibrous tumour: case report and update review on the doege-potter syndrome [^113dfVR9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The association of paraneoplastic hypoglycemia [Doege-Potter syndrome] and finger clubbing [Pierre-Marie-Bamberg syndrome] with pleural solitary fibrous tumour is rare. We present a previously unpublished but typical example of this rare occurrence together with a detailed updated literature review of previously published cases of pleural SFT discussing the histopathology of SFT; pathophysiology of the hypoglycemia and finger clubbing; treatment and outcome of pleural SFT. The patient, a 57-year-old African male was admitted at our hospital with recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia. He was found to have digital clubbing and decreased breath sounds in the right lower chest but no other significant clinical findings. His insulin level measured during an episode of hypoglycemia was undetectable. Chest radiograph and CT-scan revealed a lobulated mass in the right chest which was diagnosed to be SFT on histology. Surgical excision of the mass resulted in cure of the hypoglycemic episodes and rapid regression of the clubbing. Less than 65 cases of pleural SFT manifesting with hypoglycemia with or without finger-clubbing have been published in the English literature. The mean diameter of these tumours manifesting with hypoglycemia is 20 cm, 54% being benign while 42% were malignant. They predominantly present in the 6th-8th decade, average age of 64 years and a slight male preponderance at 58%. Complete surgical resection remains the most important predictor of clinical outcome in terms of recurrence and metastases, while providing instant cure for the hypoglycemia and rapid resolution of the finger clubbing.

### Palmoplantar keratoderma and digital clubbing in 2 sisters with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy [^114zGt4A]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig 1
Pedigree of the affected family. Black color marks subjects affected by palmoplantar keratoderma, digital clubbing, and hyperhidrosis.

At 82 years of age, IV-1 presented again to our clinic with onychosis and her > 70-year history of palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK). She displayed brittle hypertrophic nails with severe onycholysis and a nearly complete detachment of her left thumbnail (Fig 2). A symmetrical focal keratosis still affected the palms of her hands and took on a wavy pattern as it stretched out to the tips of her fingers. The keratosis on the soles of her feet was predominantly localized to the forefeet and heels. The wavy pattern was not as noticeable as on the phalanx of her fingers, which all displayed signs of clubbing. Residual signs of hyperhidrosis were apparent on her shins and feet. Besides PPK, presbycusis, osteoarthritis in her knees, and cataract surgery, IV-1 was healthy and not receiving any medical treatment. A technetium-99m bone scintigraphy scan, initiated after a suspected abnormal tomography of a knee joint, only demonstrated increased but irregular absorption in the calvarium, which is not unusual in older women. Trichophyton rubrum DNA was isolated from her toenail and her nails improved with oral terbinafine 250 mg once daily for 6 weeks.

To screen for a potential genetic cause, we performed whole exome sequencing on a blood sample from IV-1. Genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA blood. Genetic variation in HPGD was identified by aligning the TWIST comprehensive exome (Twist Bioscience) sequencing reads to the hg19 reference sequence followed by variant calling and annotation. We used the bioinformatic pipeline bcbio-nextgen version 1.1.5 (pypi.org/project/bcbio-nextgen), including bwa 0.7.17, picard 1.96, SAMtools 1.9, and GATK 4.1.3.0. Variant annotation was performed using Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor. Directed Sanger sequencing of HPGD exon 2 was performed using forward primer TGCCAAATTTCAGGTCCAGG and reverse primer TCAAGGTAGCTGCTCTCGAG.

### Refractory hypoxemia in an asymptomatic 6-year-old: It is not always the heart [^114YA8Xb]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Hypoxemia and clubbing in otherwise healthy children have a broad differential diagnosis and require a thorough work-up. Hypoxemia unresponsive to supplemental oxygen is strongly suggestive of shunting. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, though less common than intra-cardiac shunts, can present in a similar fashion and physicians must have a high index of suspicion when evaluating patients with hypoxemia refractory to oxygen therapy. Echocardiography with bubble study is a helpful bedside tool that provides rapid diagnosis. Computed tomography angiography and catheterization provides definitive diagnosis. The management of PAVMs is similar irrespective of cause, with the primary modality considered embolization. Patients must be followed closely after embolization to monitor sequelae and observe for recurrence.

### Touraine-solente-gole syndrome: pathogenic variant in SLCO ₂ A1 presented with polyarthralgia and digital clubbing [^114D4bn1]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Our patient presented a complete form of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy with onset in puberty, as seen in patients with homozygous SCLO2A1 mutations. Clinical history, physical examination, and plain radiographs were very suggestive. Plain films permit the evaluation of periostosis, with radius, ulna, tibia and fibula most commonly affected. Another frequent finding is acro-osteolysis of the distal phalanges.

The differential diagnosis depends on the presenting phenotype and age of onset and includes secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, thyroid acropachy, and acromegaly. Secondary causes of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, which are much more frequent (95% cases), especially those associated to lung neoplasia and, to a lesser degree, to hepatic cirrhosis, cardiopathy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, should be excluded, especially when dermatological signs are not prominent. The presence of arthralgia or arthritis might suggest systemic connective tissue diseases, such as JIA. In this case, osteoarticular ultrasound showed no joint effusions, but instead a layer of irregular echogenic tissue in thickness surrounding the femur and tibia without increased vascularity on Doppler. Awareness of the significance of digital clubbing under these circumstances and absence of synovitis on ultrasound is likely to prevent misdiagnosis.

After excluding secondary causes of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and other differential diagnoses, genetic studies may be useful to confirm the diagnosis and classify the PHO type. The identification of the mutation contributes not only to confirm diagnosis, but also to support future genetic counseling and prevention of associated disease complications.

Currently available therapeutic options are palliative and directed toward amelioration of the patient complaints. Clinical improvement of musculoskeletal symptoms can be achieved by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as verified in our patient. PGE2 is a lipid mediator derived from arachidonic acid through the action of enzymes, including the ubiquitous tissue constitutive isoform cyclooxigenase (COX-1) and the inflammatory/tumor-induced isoform (COX-2). Inflammatory marker levels including CRP and ESR were found to be high at baseline and subsequently declined after COX-2 inhibitor treatment, signifying a decline in inflammation with decreasing levels of PGE2. In addition, bisphosphonates, hydroxychloroquine, tamoxifen citrate, octreotide and colchicine have been reported as effective therapies in refractory cases. Plastic surgery should be reserved for extreme cases to remove excess of facial skin or to reduce finger clubbing.

### Giant oesophageal gastrointestinal stromal tumour presenting with dyspnoea and clubbed fingers [^1142gQ1i]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We experienced a rare case of giant GIST of the oesophagus presenting with prominent clubbing. Based on the experience, we would like to discuss the association of clubbing and GIST and the indication for imatinib in patients with giant GIST.

Although benign hereditary conditions can cause clubbing, clubbing sometimes provides important diagnostic clues to underlying infectious, neoplastic, inflammatory and vascular diseases in adults. Therefore, careful consideration of the underlying aetiology is required. Although many aetiologies, including genetic predisposition, parasympathetic neural mechanisms and the direct effect of tissue hypoxia have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of clubbing, the exact aetiology has not yet been determined.

Clubbing is generally known to be associated with bronchogenic carcinoma, malignant mesothelioma, pleural fibroma and metastatic osteogenic sarcoma. However, other malignancies also can cause clubbing. Clubbing associated with GIST is rare. Silva et al reported a case of GIST of the stomach presenting with clubbing as part of hypertrophic osteopathy. Axel et al also reported a case that was similar to our case; the patient presented with clubbing and body weight loss without digestive symptoms and was eventually diagnosed with GIST of the oesophagus. As we suggested, Axel et al advocate that recognition of paraneoplastic phenomena, including clubbing, assists in making an earlier diagnosis of malignancies. Given that patients seldom notice their own clubbing by themselves, recognition of clubbing on careful examination of the extremities is required by clinicians.

Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was originally developed as a drug for chronic myeloid leukaemia, a disease caused by a Bcr-Abl mutation. Because imatinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of KIT and Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) by competitively inhibit the binding between kinase and ATP, it has also been used for GISTs.

If resectable, surgical removal is the standard treatment for GISTs. Imatinib is the standard option for inoperable cases because of the drastic improvement in outcomes; imatinib reportedly achieved a 2-year event-free survival and 5-year mean overall survival. Before the introduction of imatinib, the mean survival was only 9–12 months. Combined use of imatinib with surgical removal has been also considered, since mass reduction due to imatinib may enable surgical removal of the tumour.

### Secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy associated with solitary fibrous tumor of the lung [^112SHd5U]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, synonymous with the terms "pulmonary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy" and "pachydermoperiostosis acquisita", is a syndrome characterized by finger clubbing, hypertrophic skin changes, and periosteal bone changes that can occur in patients with underlying disease of the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. We report the case of a 56-year-old man with a solitary fibrous tumor of the lung causing symptomatic hypoglycemia and secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. The patient was seen in the dermatology clinic because of his skin changes. Diagnostic work-up included imaging that revealed a large mass in the left lower lobe of his lung later identified as a solitary fibrous tumor. The patient underwent pneumonectomy and at 1-month follow-up had returned to a euglycemic state with resolution of his skin findings. Dermatologists may play a key role in early diagnosis of tumors of the lung and other extrathoracic sites, such as solitary fibrous tumors, as well as many endocrine disorders, through the recognition of the cutaneous and soft tissue manifestations.

### Clubbing: an update on diagnosis, differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, and clinical relevance [^114K174y]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Finger clubbing can be a striking physical finding. At other times, the presence of clubbing is difficult to establish by subjective examination alone and the profile angle or distal phalangeal to interphalangeal depth ratio are needed to confirm the finding. Most microscopic and imaging studies of clubbed fingers reveal hypervascularization of the distal digits. Recent research shows that when platelet precursors fail to become fragmented into platelets within the pulmonary circulation, they are easily trapped in the peripheral vasculature, releasing platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, promoters of vascularity and, ultimately, clubbing. Clinically, clubbing is associated with a number of neoplastic, pulmonary, cardiac, gastrointestinal, infectious, endocrine, psychiatric, and multisystem diseases. In narrowing the differential diagnosis, we recommend a detailed history and physical examination accompanied by focused laboratory and imaging studies. An algorithm for the evaluation of newly diagnosed clubbing is suggested.

### Primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (incomplete form) in young adults: a case report and review of literature [^112qniT7]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is characterised by digital clubbing and periosteal reaction of long bones. Most cases are associated with malignancy or other conditions such as congenital heart disease, liver cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, biliary atresia and inflammatory bowel diseases. We report a middle-aged man found to have 15-year history of clubbing of the fingers and toes on his routine check-up for dyspepsia. Skiagram of hand joints showed periosteal apposition without any periosteal reaction of long bones. The search for a secondary cause of clubbing remained negative. The primary or idiopathic form is rare and has a good prognosis and has to be differentiated from secondary form. He was eradicated successfully with Pylori kit for his antral predominant Helicobacter-induced gastritis.

### Awareness of palestinians about lung cancer symptoms: a national cross-sectional study [^116nKZRT]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and the second most commonly diagnosed cancer. In 2020, over 1.7 million deaths and 2.2 million new LC cases were estimated. The overall cancer-related mortality is potentially higher in low- and middle-income countries. In Palestine, a lower-middle-income country, LC is also the leading cause of cancer-related deaths (17.3%) and the second commonly diagnosed cancer (11.4%). Palestine has an age-standardized mortality rate of 19.2 per 100,000 persons, which is higher than that of some other countries in the region, such as Egypt (7.2 per 100,000 persons), Iraq (11.1 per 100,000 persons), Jordan (14.3 per 100,000 persons), and Lebanon (16.6 per 100,000 persons).

LC is one of the main causes of avoidable mortality around the world. Notably, more than 50% of LC patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage which lowers their chances for survival. Poor awareness of LC symptoms is considered one of the contributing factors to late presentation. Early diagnosis plays a crucial role in cancer control especially in low- and middle-income countries. In countries with low-resource settings (e.g. Palestine), fragile health systems, economic difficulties, and poor health literacy are factors that impede achieving optimal cancer care services. Cancer outcomes could be improved by raising the recognition of symptoms, which in turn may facilitate early seeking to medical advice.

There are different potential symptoms associated with LC including cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing up blood, and finger clubbing. Promoting the awareness of LC symptoms may enhance early presentation and diagnosis leading to better survival outcomes. Identifying the population's level of knowledge about LC symptoms could help in designing educational interventions to promote public awareness. This eventually may lead to lower morbidity and mortality rates associated with LC particularly in countries with low-resource settings like Palestine.

### Giant oesophageal gastrointestinal stromal tumour presenting with dyspnoea and clubbed fingers [^1117C6Zv]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 68-year-old Japanese man visited our hospital complaining of severe dyspnoea. He had become unable to eat properly and became hypoactive 3 months before being hospitalised. He started feeling dyspnoea during trivial daily activities a month prior to admission. A week prior to admission, he became unable to walk or even move by himself because of dyspnoea and fatigue. Despite repeated advice to visit a hospital by his family, he refused. Finally, his common-law wife called an ambulance to our hospital. He had a medical history of herpes zoster and had undergone upper gastrointestinal endoscopy 7 years prior as a work-up for transient epigastric discomfort, yet the result was normal. Otherwise, he had never visited hospitals or had regular health check-ups. He had a smoking history of one pack of cigarettes a day over a 50-year period.

On physical examination, he appeared extremely ill and his vital signs indicated he was in shock; the blood pressure and heart rate were 79/63 mm Hg and 117 bpm (regular), respectively. Examinations of the extremities were remarkable for symmetric clubbing at the fingers and the toes (figure 1) with fast-pitting oedema and peripheral coldness. Laboratory data on admission was characteristic of a high inflammatory response, with hypoproteinaemia (Alb 1.5 g/dL) and anaemia with haemoglobin of 7.0 g/dL. Tumour makers (carcinoembryonic antigen, CA19–9 and alpha-fetoprotein) were within the normal ranges.

### Surgically cured hypoglycemia secondary to pleural solitary fibrous tumour: case report and update review on the doege-potter syndrome [^111CGdSj]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The occurrence of hypoglycemia with an intrathoracic tumour was first reported by Doege and Potter independently in 1930 hence the eponym Doege-Potter syndrome [DPS]. Hyperthrophic osteoarthropathy clinically observed as finger-clubbing is also associated with intrathoracic tumours and goes with the eponym of Pierre-Marie-Bamberg syndrome [PMBS]. In this report we present a previously unpublished but very typical example of the rare occurrence of hypoglycaemia and finger-clubbing with pleural solitary fibrous tumour [SFT] in an adult African male. A detailed updated literature review is presented detailing the histopathology of SFT, pathophysiology of the hypoglycemia and finger clubbing, treatment and outcome of pleural SFT.

1 CASE ONE

A 6‐year‐old girl was admitted to our hospital with chronic dyspnea occurring over 5 years and increasing in severity within the proceeding 2 months. When she was 1 year old, she was suffered from fever followed by the onset of dyspnea. After treating with prednisone and antibiotics, Over the next 5 years, she was administrated prednisone 5 mg/d. Three to five times a year, she suffered from respiratory tract infection in addition to severe dyspnea. During these periods, prednisone dosage was increased to 30 mg/d. Her physical activity was gradually limited. She developed clubbed fingers. Two months before admission, she fractured her right arm. At the same time, she experienced high fever with respiratory distress and was treated with endotracheal intubation mechanical ventilation at a local hospital for 8 days. The patient was the younger of the two siblings. Her physical development was delayed. She suffered from occasional vomiting and poor appetite after age one. Her parents had no history of chronic diseases.

### A novel STING1 variant causes a recessive form of STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) [^116NozmX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

We have identified 6 patients from 4 unrelated families, all of whom are of Arabic ethnicity and harbor pathogenic STING1 variants that are disease causing only in homozygosity. The patients had clinical disease suggestive of SAVI and were enrolled into institutional review board–approved protocols, including the National Institutes of Health natural history protocol.

Patient 1, the index patient, presented at 4 weeks of age with a cough and failure to thrive, as well as with a maculopapular violaceous rash with a livedoid appearance (Fig 1, A and B). A chest computed tomography scan showed diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities. His lung disease progressed despite steroid therapy and short-term treatment with the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib, and he died of respiratory failure at 5 months of age. His older brother (patient 2) died at 18 months of age with chronic cough and failure to thrive. Although genetic testing was not performed, the clinical manifestations and similarities of patient 2 to those of his younger brother strongly suggest that he had SAVI. Patient 3 presented at 3 months of age with recurrent fever, erythematous rash, cough, and dyspnea, ultimately progressing to oxygen dependence. He had a chest computed tomography scan with results consistent with interstitial lung disease and a lung biopsy specimen that showed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with intraalveolar hemorrhage. He is currently taking the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib. His brother, patient 4, had respiratory symptoms starting at the age of 6 months; he was diagnosed with SAVI at the age of 15 months and was initially treated with steroids, after which baricitinib (a selective JAK1/2 inhibitor) was added to his treatment regimen. Patient 5 presented at the age of 2 months with cough, tachypnea, and recurrent lung infections; she was diagnosed with chronic aspiration pneumonia and had a laryngeal cleft that was repaired at the age of 4.5 years. Because of her lung disease (Fig 1, E), she has required supplemental oxygen since the age of 7 months and bilevel positive airway pressure support while sleeping since the second year of life, when digital clubbing was noticed. She developed pulmonary hypertension by the age of 4 years. At the age of 5 she developed polyarthritis, an erythematous rash over the soles of her feet and clubbing. She began taking baricitinib at the age of 7 years; there was clinical improvement, but her oxygen dependence continued. Patient 6 presented at the age of 8 months with a history of persistent tachypnea and failure to thrive, polyarthritis, intermittent vasculitic rashes, and clubbing (Fig 1, C and D). All of the parents and siblings were asymptomatic with normal inflammatory markers. Additional clinical and laboratory information is available in Table E1 (in this article's Online Repository at).

### Hypoxia due to intrapulmonary vascular dilatation in a toddler with a congenital portacaval shunt: case report [^1117m98g]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The term hepatopulmonary syndrome typically applies to cyanosis that results from " intrapulmonary vascular dilatation " due to advanced liver disease. Similar findings may result from a congenital portosystemic shunt without liver disease. An adverse consequence of such shunts is intrapulmonary vascular dilatation, which affects the microvascular gas exchange units for oxygen.

Case presentation

Here, we describe a toddler with chronic cyanosis, exercise intolerance, and finger clubbing due to a malformation shunt between the portal vein and the inferior vena cava. A transcatheter embolization of the shunt resulted in resolution of his findings.

Conclusions

Congenital portosystemic shunts need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of cyanosis.

### Interstitial lung disease in children – genetic background and associated phenotypes [^116wJeDY]. Respiratory Research (2005). Low credibility.

Review

Interstitial lung disease in children

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) in children represents a heterogeneous group of rare respiratory disorders characterised by restrictive lung disease and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. Affected children usually present with dry cough, dyspnoea and tachypnoea. Physical findings show elevated resting respiratory rate and rales (or crackles) mostly more pronounced in the basal segments of the lungs. In children suffering from severe ILD, chronic hypoxemia, cyanosis, finger clubbing and growth failure occur. High-resolution computed tomography provides detailed diagnostic information about the extent and distribution of the lung pathology and has become the most relevant imaging technique for ILD in children. However, the diagnostic gold standard is still the lung biopsy where the characteristic histological findings of inflammation in the pulmonary interstitium with wall thickening by inflammatory cells and/or fibrosis can be found. At present, no pathognomonic laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of ILD in children are available. ILD is associated with pulmonary inflammation which can resolve completely, partially or can progress to fibrosis. The factors determining the progression of ILD are not well understood but an interaction between genetic background and environmental modifiers is suggested.

In children, ILD is less frequent and comprises a broader spectrum of disorders with a more variable clinical course compared to adults. In addition, there are special disease entities which predominantly occur in children, like the recently described pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis, the neuro-endocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy and the genetic disorders of surfactant metabolism. Most of the information on ILD in childhood is based on studies performed in adults. In the recent years, however, there is increasing evidence that ILD in children differs substantially from adult ILD. PediatricILD occur in the context of lung development and are most frequent diagnosed in the first year of life when alveolar development is taking place. The combination of epidemiological rarity, clinical heterogenity and genetic background makes the classification of ILD in children difficult. Thus, studies up to now included only limited numbersof patients, except of one recent study encompassing 185 children, and no randomised controlled trials have been performed to evaluate treatment strategies.

### Patent ductus arteriosus: a contemporary perspective for the pediatric and adult cardiac care provider [^112bX3w3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES AMONG OLDER PATIENTS (TERM INFANT THROUGH ADULTHOOD)

Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and Eisenmenger Syndrome

Although the precise pathophysiological mechanisms are not completely understood, long‐standing left‐to‐right shunting exposes the pulmonary arterial system to higher pressures and greater blood flows. Over time, this leads to progressive morphological changes in the pulmonary vasculature, including arteriolar medial hypertrophy, intimal proliferation and fibrosis, and eventual obliteration of pulmonary arterioles and capillaries, characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance with development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). When pulmonary vascular resistance approaches and exceeds systemic vascular resistance, ductal shunting reverses and becomes right to left, classically described as Eisenmenger syndrome. Clubbing of toenails and spared (or mild) clubbing in the fingers is pathognomonic for Eisenmenger syndrome in the setting of a PDA. In this setting, patients may develop right ventricular systolic failure, the most common cause of death among patients with Eisenmenger syndrome.

Infective Endocarditis

Historical estimates suggest an incidence of infective endocarditis (IE) of ≈1% among patients with a PDA. Sadiq et al observed that, among 2908 children aged < 16 years admitted to a single pediatric cardiology center over a 6‐year time frame, 96 (3.3%) fulfilled diagnostic criteria for IE; PDA was the cardiac lesion in 14 children with IE (14.6%). Alternatively, of nearly 3 million deaths in Sweden (1960–1993), Thilen and Astrom‐Olsson reported 2 cases of IE as a complication of PDA. Historically, risk of IE was commonly cited as an indication for ductal closure beyond infancy; however, recent guidelines from the American Heart Association no longer support use of antibiotic prophylaxis (outside the first 6 months following definitive ductal closure) among patients with PDA to prevent IE.

### Familial clubbing of fingers and toes… [^113w4LXP]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE CLUBBING of the digits described by Hippocrates in the fifth century B. C. was associated with one of the progressive morbid states that may present this physical finding, i.e. empyema. Other maladies which may produce clubbing include chronic suppurative lung disease, cyanotic congenital heart disease, subacute bacterial endocarditis, liver cirrhosis, and inflammatory or neoplastic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. But not all clubbing of the fingers or toes portends serious organic dysfunction. Clubbing may be present as an hereditary anomaly in selected families. 1 When this anomaly is observed in a presumably healthy person, inquiry into the duration of the abnormality and the possible familial distribution may be rewarding. At least this was our experience. Although the familial and acquired forms of clubbing have a similar appearance superficially, the former variety occasionally may involve only one or two fingers symmetrically.

The rule, however, is symmetrical involvement of all digits. TALBOTT JH, MONTGOMERY WR. FAMILIAL CLUBBING OF FINGERS AND TOES. AMA Arch Intern Med. 1953; 92: 697–700.

### Inhaled treatment for dyspnea in a rare childhood disease [^116BzieS]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

2 CASE PRESENTATION

A 15‐year‐old male patient presented to our clinic with fatigue and shortness of breath for 2 years. He had a 5 kg weight loss over the last 3 months, dry cough, and tachypnea, which increased with effort and continued at rest. The patient had two hospitalizations for pneumonia at the ages of 4 and 8 years, which did not require respiratory support. The parents were not consanguineous, and he had no known family history of chronic respiratory disease or other conditions (Podcast).

On physical examination, the patient's growth parameters were normal. Although there was no fever, he had tachypnea (respiratory rate: 42/min) and dyspnea with jugular retractions at rest. His peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2) was 91% in room air (RA). Pectus excavatum and clubbing of the fingers and toes were present. No abnormal breath sounds were heard on auscultation.

Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were found to be abnormal (expressed as % predicted). The spirometry test revealed the following results: forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) 45%, forced vital capacity (FVC) 48%, FEV 1 /FVC 94%, and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DL CO): 53%. The body plethysmography test results were as follows: total lung capacity (TLC) 66%, residual volume (RV) 94%, RV/TLC 42,4. In the 6‐min walk test (6‐MWT), his SpO 2 was found to be 84%, intermittent coughing started, dyspnea increased, and the test was discontinued at a distance of 400 m. His arterial blood gas test at rest showed borderline hypercapnia and hypoxemia (pCO 2: 48.6 mmHg, pO 2: 66.9 mmHg). The partial alveolar‐arterial pressure gradient (P (A‐a)) was found to be increased to 80 mmHg (normal < 15 mmHg). The serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was found to be 328 U/L (elevated).

2.1 Challenge point

A 15‐year‐old male with a 3‐month history of tachypnea, fatigue, and weight loss presented to the pediatric pulmonology clinic. Pectus excavatum, clubbing, restrictive pattern in spirometry, decreased DL CO, increased P (A‐a), and elevated LDH were detected.

### Surgical considerations in the resection of solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura [^115dzUFh]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical features and presentation

SFTs generally have an indolent onset with slow growth, and no obvious clinical signs or symptoms in the initial stages. Interestingly, most SFTs are discovered incidentally in asymptomatic patients. However, a correlation between the tumor size and symptoms has been observed, especially in tumors > 10 cm in size. Typically, patients present with non-specific pulmonary symptoms, such as cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, hemoptysis, and obstructive pneumonitis. Compressive symptoms are observed in large, especially giant (> 20 cm) SFTs.

Paraneoplastic syndromes, such as Doege–Potter syndrome, Pierre–Marie–Bamberger syndrome, arthralgia, articular edema, and weight loss have also been reported. Of note, refractory hypoglycemia secondary to Doege–Potter syndrome is seen in < 5% of cases. The mechanism of refractory hypoglycemia is related to secretion of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) by the tumor. Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPO), characterized by clubbing of the fingers, periostitis and synovial effusions, has been reported in up to 22% of patients with SFT. Unfortunately, the mechanism underlying HPO is not entirely clear.

### Combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema: a retrospective analysis of clinical characteristics, treatment and prognosis [^116tJSEE]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Evidence suggests that a syndrome of CPFE, most frequently associated with IPF, deserves to be recognized as a separate clinical entity owing to the distinct clinical, functional, radiological, and pathological characteristics. In the present study, we compared the clinical characteristics, quantitative respiratory physiological index, radiographic scoring system, treatment and prognosis between patients with UIP plus emphysema (CPFE group) and IPF alone.

Although controversies exist in the published literature mainly regarding the prognosis of CPFE patients, the clinical characteristics of CPFE remain consistent with those described by Cottin et al. Most of the patients in the CPFE group in our study were males with a mean age between 65 and 70 years and had a smoking history which suggests tobacco smoking as a potential etiological factor for CPFE. Perhaps the lower survival in CPFE group than IPF group might be partially explained by the difference in proportion of smokers in the two groups. Compared to patients with IPF, those with CPFE had a less frequent history of viral infection prior to the diagnosis, which suggests that viral infection may not be a risk factor for CPFE; the increasing trend in CEA with time; and basal crackles were more frequently observed on physical examination along with presence of finger clubbing. Surprisingly, over half of CPFE presented with wheeze, which was significantly more than that in patients with IPF alone. This suggests that airway spasm may be more common in CPFE, which might aggravate hypoxia concomitantly with hypercapnia. This pathophysiological change may cause extrapulmonary tissue damage and have an adverse effect on prognosis; therefore, CPFE may be considered as a more severe interstitial lung disease than IPF.

Differential diagnoses

In the context of advanced cancer, metastases should always be considered as a differential diagnosis of rheumatic irAEs, notably in the case of localized articular symptoms or the lack of improvement with adequate treatment. Recently, non-malignant resorptive lesions (shoulder, hand and clavicle) and rapid bone loss leading to multiple fractures with vertebral compression have also been described under CPI treatment, making the differential diagnosis with metastases even more challenging and raising the question of the potential influence of immune activation on bone metabolism.

In lung cancer patients, paraneoplastic syndromes such as hypertrophic osteoarthropathy occurring after CPI-onset while not present or asymptomatic at cancer diagnosis have also recently been noticed. Patients usually presented with inflammatory pain in extremities, swollen joints (with non-inflammatory synovial fluid analysis) and nail clubbing. Plain radiographs show periostitis, as illustrated with Fig. 4. 4

Finally, in case of fatigue and diffuse pain or weakness, central adrenal insufficiency should be suspected as it is a possible immune-related complication of CPI. The diagnosis can be challenging, confirmed by the low dosage of cortisol and low Adreno CorticoTrophic Hormone. The presence of associated hypotension and hyponatremia may help to suspect an underlying endocrinopathy.

### Soft tissue chondroma: a possible diagnosis of single-digit nail clubbing [^117KyHAC]. Dermatologic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Soft tissue chondroma (STC) is a benign, slow-growing cartilaginous tumor characterized by well-demarcated nodule(s) of mature cartilage unattached to the adjacent bone. It commonly occurs in middle-aged people with a predilection to the distal extremities but rarely involving the subungual area. It has not been reported to induce nail clubbing.

We describe an unusual case of single-digit nail clubbing in a rare location of STC and briefly discuss its differential diagnosis. Patients developing single-digit nail clubbing should alert the dermatologist to consider the possibility of STC.

A 58-year-old man presented with a clubbed nail of his left index finger without any previous trauma event in the past 10 years. The single-digit clubbing had been ignored by him over the past decade because he had no symptoms. Because the clubbing of his nail gradually enlarged and eventually severely deformed the fingertip resembling a ball, he visited our institution. Dermatologic examination revealed a clubbed nail extending from the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint to the hyponychium with an increased transverse and longitudinal curvature (Figure 1 A). The suspected mass under the nail was hard, elastic, and immobile on palpation and without any signs of inflammation. Of note, there was no movement restriction of the DIP joint. Laboratory test results were normal. Plain radiographs showed a soft tissue tumor shadow, located subcutaneously on the dorsal aspect of the distal phalanx of his index finger, extending from the distal dorsal DIP joint through the subungual region up to the hyponychium (Figure 1 B). The tumor had no continuity with the underlying bone. In addition, there were no destructive changes in the distal phalanx and no periosteal reaction. Ultrasound examination exhibited an ovoid, well-defined, heterogenous hypoechoic nodule but without vascularity or continuity to the nearby bone (See Figure S1, Supplemental Digital Content). Based on these findings, the mass was believed to be a cartilaginous tumor, and excision was performed. After nail avulsion and incision of the extremely thin nail bed over the mass, a white solid tumor appeared. There was no adhesion to the periosteum, and it could be easily separated from the surrounding tissue. Its diameter was about 20 mm (Figure 1 C). The tumor was fragile and tended to break when using tweezers to hold it. Histopathology of the tumor revealed mature hyaline cartilage without nuclear pleomorphism (Figure 1 D). Thus, it was diagnosed as a STC involving the nail unit. Healing was uneventful, and his nail grew by about a third with slightly uneven nail plate during the 6-month follow-up period.

### Clubbing of the fingers in sarcoidosis… [^113rZqbV]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — Clubbing of the fingers occurs frequently in a wide variety of unrelated cardiopulmonary disorders including bronchiectasis, lung abscess, bronchial carcinoma, congenital heart disease, arteriovenous aneurysm, and interstitial fibrosis. It occurs less frequently in ulcerative colitis, liver disease, bacterial endocarditis, and carcinoma of esophagus and stomach. 1 Clubbing has not been reported in sarcoidosis. 2Of 136 patients with histologically proven sarcoidosis followed-up at Los Angeles County — University of Southern California, we have recently studied four who also had marked clubbing of the fingers: two patients had clubbing at the time of initial presentation and the other two developed clubbing during the follow-up period. All four patients had radiological evidence of bilateral interstitial disease. Finger clubbing is a common feature with an incidence of 70% to 90% of patients having fibrosing alveolitis.

### Phalangeal osteoid osteomas in the hand: a diagnostic problem [^117YGeKT]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Osteoid osteomas in the phalanges of the hand often present with atypical clinical and radiologic characteristics. These unusual presentations may cause a delay in diagnosis and treatment. In this study, seven cases (seven patients) of phalangeal osteoid osteomas in the hand were examined, six of which were misdiagnosed for long periods of time. These seven cases illustrate unusual presentations, including absence of reactive bone, monoarticular arthritis, clubbing, macrodactyly, painless swelling, and absence of bony lysis. Phalangeal osteoid osteomas also have unusual histologic features. Recognition of these unusual clinical, radiographic, and histologic features may prevent misdiagnosis and lead to prompt definitive therapy.

Although digital clubbing became apparent already in late infancy, the patient reported good exercise tolerance and did not suffer from major infections during childhood. As an adult, exercise intolerance became apparent (Figure 1B). The latest immunological evaluation revealed only a reduced IgG4 subclass level. The patient is currently in a stable clinical condition without regular medication.

P2 suffered from recurrent febrile respiratory tract infections since the age of 5 months. He developed failure to thrive and a chronic wet cough. At the age of 4 years, major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) were coiled, a procedure repeated when he was 10 years. Clubbing was noted at the age of 5 years but not further investigated.

At age 10, the patient attended respiratory medicine specialist care. He displayed eosinophilia (10%) in full blood count analysis with normal serum IgE levels. However, IgG and IgA were elevated with normal IgM. Lymphocyte subpopulations were grossly normal, only a slight decrease in the naïve CD4 + T cell subpopulation with corresponding expansion of the effector memory CD4 + T cell compartment was observed. Repeated nitroblue tetrazolium tests ruled out granulocyte dysfunction. He showed normal alpha 1 ‐antitrypsin levels, negative ANAs and ANCAs, and a negative Quantiferon test. However, elevated IgG antibodies against pigeon antigen were found.

### The microanatomic basis of finger clubbing-a high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging study [^113paNNB]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypervascularization in finger clubbing is recognized, but its microanatomical basis remains unclear. This pilot descriptive study used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore this further.

Methods

High-resolution MRI acquired with contrast agent was carried out in 4 patients with finger clubbing and 4 healthy volunteers. The anatomy of the nail bed, capsular structures, and bony changes were described.

Results

Marked nail bed thickening and contrast enhancement was noted in all clubbed fingers, with bone edema in 3 of the 4 patients. None of the healthy subjects had similar abnormalities.

Conclusion

This confirms that hypervascularization of the nail bed observed in the microanatomy on high-resolution MRI is associated with clubbed appearances of the nails.

### Clinicopathologic conference: a four-year-old child with digital clubbing [^1148bTbL]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

CASE PRESENTATION

Chief symptoms

A four‐year‐old female presented to our pediatric rheumatology clinic with the chief symptom of periodic fevers and abdominal pain.

History of the present illness

The patient's fevers began 4 months prior to presentation following a documented streptococcal pharyngeal infection, with a maximum temperature of 104°F. They occurred every 1–2 weeks and would then last a duration of 4–6 hours. Fevers were followed by severe abdominal pain that prevented eating. She did not have associated emesis, diarrhea, or constipation.

Medical, family, and social history

The past medical history of the patient included allergic rhinitis, characterized by rhinorrhea and congestion, which was treated with nasal spray. Otherwise, she was reported to have normal growth and development. There was no known family history of autoimmunity, including inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, psoriasis, or Raynaud's syndrome. Social history was noncontributory. There were no known relevant environmental exposures.

Review of systems

Review of systems was notable for lack of joint pain or swelling, digital clubbing, myalgia, limp, rash, fatigue, or headaches. The patient's parents denied that she had experienced respiratory symptoms, including shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, cough, or snoring. There was no history of recurrent respiratory infections.

Physical examination

The girl was a well‐appearing child without dysmorphic features. Vital signs were normal, though pulse oximetry was not obtained initially. There were no oral lesions, the oropharynx was clear, and tonsils were without exudate. Findings of ophthalmic examination were normal. Cardiac examination did not reveal murmur, rub, gallop, extra heart sounds, or arrhythmia. Lung examination demonstrated normal and symmetric air entry bilaterally. Her abdomen was soft, nontender to palpation, and without hepatosplenomegaly. Musculoskeletal examination was notable for redness overlying the distal interphalangeal joints and bilateral finger and toe clubbing (Figure 1). There was no evidence of synovitis or muscle tenderness or weakness. The patient had a normal gait without evidence of limp.

### Giant oesophageal gastrointestinal stromal tumour presenting with dyspnoea and clubbed fingers [^111yLPkq]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, rapid mass reduction often causes critical complications including bleeding or perforation of the necrotised gastrointestinal organs. A case of pleuritis and haemothorax associated with imatinib use was reported in Japan. In our case, the CT scan revealed diffuse adhesion to the surrounding tissues and air-fluid levels in the mass that indicates necrosis of the tumour. Given the CT findings, we thought the risk of complications associated with rapid mass reduction due to imatinib was high. We considered the risk of complications and the patient's preference and withheld imatinib for the patient.

Patient's perspective

Written by the patient's younger sister. (Translated by the corresponding author.)

I was surprised by the rarity and the rapid course of the illness. I am, however, satisfied with the medical management because my brother's preference was respected, and he passed away without prolonged suffering. I feel happy if our experience will be shared to other medical staffs to improve patients care they provide in the future.

Learning points

Giant gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) of the oesophagus can manifest as a mediastinal mass presenting with dyspnoea without digestive symptoms.
GIST can cause digital clubbing.
Recognition of clubbing can be a clue to the early diagnosis of oesophageal GIST lacking typical symptoms such as dysphagia.
Clinician should recognise and explain the benefit and risk of imatinib for patients with giant GIST because drastic mass reduction induced by imatinib can cause fatal complications such as bleeding or perforation.
The patient's preference must be taken into consideration.

The patient is currently asymptomatic and being monitored in the Cincinnati HHT Center of Excellence every 6 months. This Center is a multidisciplinary clinic, with the core specialties involved including a hematologist, a genetic counselor, interventional radiology, and an ear, nose, and throat surgeon. Our Center also includes a pulmonologist, a cardiologist, a gastroenterologist, a neurologist, a neuroradiologist, a neurosurgeon, and a plastic surgeon. As part of her monitoring, she will require several clinical tests per international guidelines. She will need a repeat brain MRI upon entering adulthood, as brain AVMs can grow with puberty. She will require repeat bubble echocardiograms every 2–3 years to monitor the state of her existing pulmonary AVMs and evaluate for anticipated complications, such as the risk of embolic and/or infectious events. She will require testing of annual hemoglobin levels starting at age 35 years due to risk for internal bleeding from AVMs (especially GI AVMs), as well as annual liver screening with liver function testing. She will also need routine colonoscopy at age 50 years, or sooner if she has evidence of GI bleed. Finally, she will also require antibiotic prophylaxis due to the risk for infectious emboli secondary to her existing pulmonary AVMs.

Patient story - Emily Schumacher

Ms. Schumacher described the story of her daughter, who is now 6 years old. She first developed signs of SJIA-like disease in 2015 with fevers and rash, initially thought to be a viral illness. Initial treatment of her SJIA included subcutaneous injections of tocilizumab. Since there was no response, tocilizumab was replaced with high dose daily anakinra injections. Cyclosporine and methotrexate were added few weeks later. SJIA remained active, and anakinra was next replaced with canakinumab without improvement of SJIA symptoms.

Despite all the efforts to avoid corticosteroids, oral prednisolone was started in July 2016, and the child continued to remain chronically steroid dependent 3 years later. In the same year, intravenous tocilizumab was initiated with the hope that infusions would work better then subcutaneous injections. Unfortunately, the child had an unusual reaction during her 3rd infusion, with tachycardia, and tachypnea requiring additional oxygen supplementation. After this event, tocilizumab was permanently discontinued.

The family was referred for a second opinion to Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where they were informed that the child was in the state of mild subclinical MAS. The doctors also noticed mildly increased respiratory rate and subtle clubbing of the fingers, but her HRCT showed only subtle abnormalities. A repeat HRCT 1 year later, however, suggested significantly worsening pulmonary disease; a lung biopsy performed about 1 month later confirmed PAP and SJIA-LD. At that time, mycophenolate was added to her drug regimen.

Prior to being diagnosed with SJIA-LD, Ms. Schumacher's child never had any apparent lung symptoms, and her peripheral pulse oximetry had been consistently normal. Apart from the clubbed fingers and mildly increased respiratory rate with physical activity, the child certainly lacked overt signs of lung disease at the time of SJIA-LD diagnosis.

### Clinicopathologic conference: a four-year-old child with digital clubbing [^114XLKJn]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL COURSE

The patient's fevers resolved without intervention within months of her initial consult visit with rheumatology. It was later discovered she had had dental procedures completed prior to her episodes. It was thought that perhaps some bacterial seeding had contributed to her fevers.

The patient was referred to pulmonology for further evaluation of clubbing noted in the setting of peribronchial thickening seen on chest radiograph. Pulmonology evaluation revealed that pulse oximetry was 97% on room air. She had a normal 6‐minute walk test. Chest CT also demonstrated peribronchial thickening but no other abnormality (Figure 2). As a result, a contrast echocardiogram was performed. The echocardiogram showed normal cardiac anatomy and function. It also demonstrated 20–30 bubbles in the left atrium within 4 beats following injection of bubbles into the right heart. This was felt to be concerning for pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM) (Figure 3). She was then referred to cardiology and gastroenterology and evaluated by our GI team due to an elevated level of alkaline phosphatase, though this finding normalized without intervention, and the cause of the original elevation was not determined. Results from a Doppler ultrasound of the patient's liver were normal.

### Mutations in 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase cause primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy [^115bL12S]. Nature Genetics (2008). Medium credibility.

Digital clubbing, recognized by Hippocrates in the fifth century BC, is the outward hallmark of pulmonary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, a clinical constellation that develops secondary to various acquired diseases, especially intrathoracic neoplasm. The pathogenesis of clubbing and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy has hitherto been poorly understood, but a clinically indistinguishable primary (idiopathic) form of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (PHO) is recognized. This familial disorder can cause diagnostic confusion, as well as significant disability. By autozygosity methods, we mapped PHO to chromosome 4q33-q34 and identified mutations in HPGD, encoding 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, the main enzyme of prostaglandin degradation. Homozygous individuals develop PHO secondary to chronically elevated prostaglandin E(2) levels. Heterozygous relatives also show milder biochemical and clinical manifestations. These findings not only suggest therapies for PHO, but also imply that clubbing secondary to other pathologies may be prostaglandin mediated. Testing for HPGD mutations and biochemical testing for HPGD deficiency in patients with unexplained clubbing might help to obviate extensive searches for occult pathology.

Case Report

Our patient was a 6-year-old female with no prior medical history who presented to her pediatrician's clinic with left ear otalgia. She lived in Egypt with her parents with travel history to Europe and South America. Her vital signs were notable for hypoxia with saturation of 77% on room air, without clinical distress. On physical examination, she had clubbing of fingers, perioral and peripheral cyanosis, which parents had not noticed before. She was referred to the Emergency Department (ED) for further evaluation.

In the ED, she had minimal improvement in saturation to 80% with a nonrebreather mask. Her other vital signs were unremarkable: heart rate 107 beats per minute, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, blood pressure 110/72 mm Hg, and she was afebrile. Her laboratory work showed polycythemia with hemoglobin of 18.5 g/dL, white cell count 5.3 k/cm 2, and platelet count 350 k/cm 2. Her blood chemistry was unremarkable with normal renal and hepatic function. Methemoglobin levels were within the normal reference range. A chest radiograph obtained in the ED showed normal lung fields and cardiac border. She was then transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) for management for hypoxemia, clubbing, and polycythemia of unclear cause.

### Surgically cured hypoglycemia secondary to pleural solitary fibrous tumour: case report and update review on the doege-potter syndrome [^113tGWh3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Pleural SFT is an uncommon but not rare tumour that is now known to be of mesenchymal fibroblastic rather than mesothelial origin. Paraneoplastic manifestation of hypoglycemia and finger-clubbing in pleural SFT are exceedingly rare yet important clinical features in terms of diagnosis and follow-up. Hypoglycemia with or without finger-clubbing has been recorded in < 80 cases in the English Literature. Both hypoglycemia and finger-clubbing resolve following excision of the tumour. In this updated review, hypoglycemia with and without finger-clubbing was found to associated with large tumours [> 10 cm], but does not appear to be significantly associated with histological features of malignancy. The hypoglycemia is caused by HMW IGF-II which results from defective enzymes due to PC4 gene abnormalities in the tumour cells. The finger-clubbing results from abnormal hyaluronic acid deposition due to VEGF and PDGF cytokine expression. Histological features for malignancy and size, though important, are not truly predictive of local recurrence or worse clinical outcome. Complete surgical excision of the tumour remains the best treatment and most important predictor of clinical outcome. Long-term follow-up is recommended due to varyingly high recurrence rates particularly for tumours that were difficult to completely excise and have histological features for aggressive or malignant behaviour.

Case presentation

A 2-year-6-month-old girl was referred to our hospital due to complaints of fever, cough, and tachypnea 10 days prior to her presentation. Upon admission, physical examinations revealed a body temperature of 38.5 °C, and percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 67% in room air. Chest auscultation revealed fine crackles in the posterior lung fields. Clubbing fingers, pigeon breast deformity, and chilblain-like rash on her face were observed (Fig. 1 A, B, C). Her anterior fontanelle was not closed (0.3 cm×0.3 cm). Other cutaneous manifestations were not observed. The patient displayed a height of 87 cm (-1.08 SD) and a weight of 11.5 kg (-0.82 SD). The patient experienced recurrent respiratory tract infections since the age of 6 months (once a month), and fatigue after activities was noticed beginning at 2 years of age. Family history found that her 27-year-old father had chest tightness and shortness of breath after activity beginning at 22 years of age. The clubbed fingers presented in all limbs, and mild tissue loss showed up on his face (Fig. 1 D, E). Chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed interstitial pneumonia with pulmonary cyst (Fig. 2 A), and pulmonary function tests indicated mixed ventilation dysfunction. Combined with positive levels of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and signal recognition particles (SRP) autoantibody, he was initially diagnosed with connective tissue disease (CTD) associated with ILD. After receiving combined therapy with cyclophosphamide and hydroxychloroquine for half a year, the symptoms have been improved while continuing to take hydroxychloroquine. However, about three years ago, the drug was stopped for unknown reasons, and the symptoms of dyspnea reappeared and slowly progressed.

A 36-year-old gentleman presented with 6 months of poor energy, tingling in fingers and weight loss with a change in bowel habit. He appeared cachectic and had clubbing, demineralisation of teeth, pectus carinatus, kyphosis, spinal tenderness, proximal muscle weakness and generalised muscle atrophy. Chvostek's and Trosseau's signs were positive. His haemoglobin (Hb) was 8.7 g/dl, MCV 64.7 fl with low iron. Calcium corrected was 1.30 nmol/l, parathyroid hormone 440.4 ng/l, vitamin D < 12.5 nmol/l; INR was 2.7 with coagulation inhibitor studies negative. Radiographs of spine and pelvis commented on osteopenia with thoracic kyphosis and mild anterior wedging of thoracic vertebrae. Antitissue transglutaminase was 145 U/ml, and antiendomysial antibodies were positive. An oesophagogastroduodenoscopy was consistent with coeliac disease. A diagnosis of osteomalacia and coagulopathy secondary to coeliac disease was made. The hypocalcaemia was treated with calcium gluconate infusions with symptomatic relief. Coagulopathy was treated with vitamin K intravenously with normalisation of INR. Following treatment with coeliac diet, calcium slowly normalised.

### The effect of comorbidities on diagnostic interval for lung cancer in england: a cohort study using electronic health record data [^1123Kcj2]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Study population and representativeness

Data were available on 800,018 patients, i.e. all patients in CPRD Gold born in 1954 or earlier who were still registered with a GP on their 65th birthday and who were eligible for linkage with the cancer registry, hospital episodes statistics, Office for National Statistics and IMD data (eligibility for linkage was determined by consent to the linkage process by the GP practice and the availability of a valid NHS number). From this sample primary lung cancer cases were identified from 3 data sources, the CPRD primary care data, and the linked hospital episodes statistics and cancer registry data, using lists of Read codes or ICD-10 codes as appropriate. The CPRD data has been shown to be broadly representative of the UK population in terms of age, sex, and ethnicity when compared to the UK census and to the Health Survey for England in terms of BMI. However, given the changing ethnic make-up of the UK over time, and the fact our sample was drawn from those patients born in 1954 or earlier, the proportion of white patients was relatively higher than if a younger age range of patients had been included. In addition, among women the proportion of lung cancer cases diagnosed at age 70 y or over increased substantially over the study period, so the study cohort will be less representative of the total population of female lung cancer patients in the earlier time periods.

Variable definitions

Diagnostic interval: DI was defined as the time between date of first presentation in primary care with a clinical problem suggestive of possible lung cancer, to the date of diagnosis (signs/symptoms and other clinical indicators up to 12 months before diagnosis were considered in line with a number of other studies of cancer DI conducted using the CPRD data).

Presenting clinical problem: Signs/symptoms and other clinical problems considered to indicate possible lung cancer were cough, haemoptysis, loss of appetite, fatigue, dyspnoea, weight loss, thrombocytosis, chest infection, finger clubbing and lymphadenopathy — these were based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for suspected cancer recognition and referral and on discussion with a GP (author MC). Due to small numbers of patients first presenting with finger clubbing, lymphadenopathy and appetite loss these were grouped together as "Other", patients presenting with more than one clinical indicator initially were categorised as "Multiple".

### Risk factors for diagnostic delay in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^117J5HoZ]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with a prolonged delay had relatively preserved DLCO at the time of diagnosis, suggesting that patients with more severe IPF were quickly diagnosed. On the other hand, patients with a prolonged delay reported a high symptom burden as indicated by a higher SGRQ total score. This apparent discrepancy could be explained by the complexity of quality of life data, which can be impacted by many factors, including a prolonged diagnostic delay but also by comorbidities, misdiagnosis, treatment and multiple healthcare contacts. Besides, the SGRQ total score has limitations in quantifying disease severity in IPF patients.

Patients reported frequent misdiagnosis prior to their final IPF diagnosis, which is in line with the presented risk factors for a diagnostic delay, and with previous patient surveys. The frequent treatment with inhalation therapy for obstructive lung disease, despite the lack of airway obstruction, confirms this problem. In addition, the previous treatments were often given for long periods (median duration of treatment was 7.0 months) and included potentially harmful treatments such as prednisolone and other immunosuppressive drugs, which are often prescribed for other fibrotic lung disease such as chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a common differential diagnosis to IPF. The frequent occurrences of pneumonia in the two years prior to the IPF diagnosis could either be due to an increased risk of infection in patients or misinterpretation of crackles on auscultation. Screening for finger clubbing and velcro crackles on auscultation, particularly if they do not resolve after treatment of suspected pneumonia, should prompt further diagnostic evaluation. A treatment attempt for any suspected disease prolongs the diagnostic delay, and most importantly delays the initiation of effective antifibrotic treatment. Early referral of patients with an uncertain diagnosis to a centre with expertise in ILD is essential and could contribute to shortening the diagnostic delay.

### The distal arthrogryposes: a new classification of peripheral contractures [^1163MD4d]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2005). Low credibility.

Distal arthrogryposes are a group of syndromes with congenital contractures primarily involving the hands and feet, which often are associated with abnormal facies, and are transmitted by autosomal dominant inheritance. Many affected individuals present in an orthopaedic setting. The features of these syndromes are described to allow diagnosis, establish prognosis, provide family counseling, and treatment. Increased recognition will lead to improved knowledge of the natural history.

### Knuckle pads associated with clubbed fingers [^116jUfNL]. The Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

The patient was a 37-year-old male who visited us for the chief complaints of severely keratinized elastic soft nodules with normal skin color or slightly glossy pale brown color at the distal interphalangeal joints of the bilateral second, third, fourth and fifth fingers associated with bilateral clubbed fingers. The nodules were histopathologically diagnosed as knuckle pads. Clubbed fingers were also noted, but no cardiopulmonary disorder was observed. Knuckle pads are circumscribed fibromatous thickenings of the skin overlying the finger joints. External factors are considered to be the cause, but many cases may be idiopathic such as this case. Many patients with clubbed fingers have underlying cardiopulmonary disorders, and idiopathic development, such as in this case, does not frequently occur. Our patient had the complications of knuckle pads and clubbed fingers, which has not previously been reported.

### The rational clinical examination. does this patient have clubbing? [^113iqHW5]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

The association between digital clubbing and a host of diseases has been recognized since the time of Hippocrates. Although the features of advanced clubbing are familiar to most clinicians, the presence of early clubbing is often a source of debate.

Objective

To perform a systematic review of the literature for information on the precision and accuracy of clinical examination for clubbing.

Data Sources

The MEDLINE database from January 1966 to April 1999 was searched for English-language articles related to clubbing. Bibliographies of all retrieved articles and of standard textbooks of physical diagnosis were also searched.

Study Selection

Studies selected for data extraction were those in which quantitative or qualitative assessment for clubbing was described in a series of patients. Sixteen studies met these criteria and were included in the final analysis.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted by both authors, who independently reviewed and appraised the quality of each article. Data extracted included quantitative indices for distinguishing clubbed from normal digits, precision of clinical examination for clubbing, and accuracy of clubbing as a marker of selected diseases.

Data Synthesis

The profile angle, hyponychial angle, and phalangeal depth ratio can be used as quantitative indices to assist in identifying clubbing. In individuals without clubbing, values for these indices do not exceed 176 degrees, 192 degrees, and 1.0, respectively. When clinicians make a global assessment of clubbing at the bedside, interobserver agreement is variable, with kappa values ranging between 0.39 and 0.90. Because of the lack of an objective diagnostic criterion standard, accuracy of physical examination for clubbing is difficult to determine. The accuracy of clubbing as a marker of specific underlying disease has been determined for lung cancer (likelihood ratio, 3.9 with phalangeal depth ratio in excess of 1.0) and for inflammatory bowel disease (likelihood ratio, 2.8 and 3.7 for active Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, respectively, if clubbing is present).

Conclusions

We recommend use of the profile angle and phalangeal depth ratio as quantitative indices in identifying clubbing. Clinical judgment must be exercised in determining the extent of further evaluation for underlying disease when these values exceed 180 degrees and 1.0, respectively.

### Clinical, biochemical, and genetic features of 41 han Chinese families with primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, and their therapeutic response to etoricoxib: results from a six-month prospective clinical intervention [^111muqci]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2017). Low credibility.

Primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (PHO) is a rare inherited disease caused by genetic defects in the prostaglandin metabolism pathway; disturbed prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) catabolism resulting in increased PGE 2 level is suggested in the pathogenesis. Forty-three Han Chinese patients with PHO were studied and 41 of them were treated. Mutations in the HPGD gene, causing hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, primary, autosomal recessive 1 (PHOAR1; OMIM 259100), were identified in seven patients, and mutations in the SLCO2A1 gene, causing hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, primary, autosomal recessive 2 (PHOAR2; OMIM 614441), were identified in 36 patients. Clinical phenotypes of PHO varied, ranging from mild isolated finger clubbing to severe pachydermia and disabling joint swelling, even within families. Circulating PGE 2 metabolism features of PHOAR2 were different from those of PHOAR1. Different frequency and severity of pachydermia between the subgroups were also indicated. A percentage of PHOAR2 patients suffered from gastrointestinal hemorrhage, but this symptom was not observed in the PHOAR1 subgroup. Clinical evidence highlighted the essential role of sex hormones in prostaglandin transporter regulation with respect to PHOAR2 onset, although no significant associations of urinary PGE 2 or PGE-M with sex hormones were identified. Treatment with etoricoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, was proved to be beneficial and safe. We detected its notable efficacy in decreasing urinary PGE 2 levels in the majority of the enrolled patients during 6 months of intervention; clinical phenotypes assessed, including pachydermia, finger clubbing, and joint swelling, were improved. We found no visible evidence of a positive effect of etoricoxib on periostosis; however, significant links between urinary PGE 2 and serum bone turnover markers indicated a potential role of decreased PGE 2 in periostosis management. This is the largest reported cohort of subjects genetically diagnosed with PHO. For the first time, we systematically investigated the biochemical and clinical differences between PHOAR1 and PHOAR2, and prospectively showed the positive efficacy and safety of etoricoxib for PHO patients. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Diagnosis of lung cancer in primary care: a structured review [^113Tcdcr]. Family Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Lung cancer has the highest cancer incidence and mortality in the UK. Despite this, an individual GP encounters only one new presentation approximately every 8 months, so gains relatively little experience of its diagnosis. This is partly addressed by referral guidelines which aim to help GPs in selection of patients for chest X-ray or referral for specialist investigation.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to review the primary care presenting features of lung cancer, in the light of the UK Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer.

Methods

A structured literature review was carried out.

Results

Little research has been undertaken in primary care, and the predictive values for most symptoms are unknown. Approximate likelihood ratios could be calculated for six symptoms or signs: haemoptysis 13; fatigue 5.7; cough 5.3; finger clubbing 3.9; weight loss 2.9; and dyspnoea 1.5–5.7, but none of these figures derived from single primary care studies. Three recommendations for urgent investigation of possible lung cancer in the UK Referral Guidelines are questioned: for unexplained dyspnoea, hoarseness or cervical lymphadenopathy. For all these presentations, other serious diagnoses are more likely.

Conclusion

The UK Guidelines for referral of suspected lung cancer have a weak evidence base.

### Impact of highly effective CFTR modulator therapy on digital clubbing in patients with cystic fibrosis [^1124Mq55]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The association of certain disease processes with digital clubbing is well documented. Digital clubbing is often reversible after successful treatment of the underlying pathology, for example, after lung transplantation in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We examined the effect of highly effective Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) modulators, defined for the purposes of this study as ivacaftor or the combination of ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor (ETI), on digital clubbing.

Materials and Methods

Clubbing index was measured on plaster of Paris casts of right index fingers obtained from 15 patients with cystic fibrosis, before and after initiation of CFTR modulator therapy. Similar measurements were made on casts for 9 cystic fibrosis patients who underwent lung transplantation. Measurements were made on the most recent casts available before treatment and the first cast available at least 3 months after initiation of treatment. The Wilcoxon signed-rank text was used to detect any significant difference in the pre- and post-treatment casts for each individual.

Results

A significant decrease in the clubbing index was found after both lung transplantation and treatment with highly effective CFTR modulator therapy.

Conclusions

These results add to the body of evidence demonstrating the efficacy of highly effective CFTR modulator therapy, the first agents that act directly at the dysfunctional chloride channel responsible for CF. By demonstrating that CFTR modulator therapy is capable of reversing digital clubbing, this study suggests a beneficial effect on lung pathology aside from air flow and gas transfer.

### Giant oesophageal gastrointestinal stromal tumour presenting with dyspnoea and clubbed fingers [^116ZYMhe]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract originating from the interstitial cells of Cajal. Giant oesophageal GISTs are rare since the oesophagus is rarely the primary site of GISTs, and they are usually diagnosed early due to complaints such as dysphagia. We present the case of a giant oesophageal GIST presenting with prominent clubbing. The case underlined the diagnostic importance of clubbing and the careful consideration of chemotherapy. Although clubbed fingers associated with GISTs are rare, our experience demonstrates the importance of physicians' recognition of clubbing as a paraneoplastic phenomenon for early diagnosis of malignancies since patients seldom notice their own clubbing by themselves. Chemotherapy using imatinib, an Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor, is the standard option for unresectable giant GISTs. However, careful consideration must be made of the risk of complications associated with rapid mass reduction due to imatinib such as bleeding, oesophageal perforation and mediastinitis.

### Clubbing: an update on diagnosis, differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, and clinical relevance [^1139MY9E]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Among other possible causes, digital clubbing can be caused by acromegaly, pulmonary artery sarcoma, sarcoidosis, primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, liver cirrhosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, achalasia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, lung abscess, bronchiectasis, small bowel lymphoma, mesothelioma, pleural fibroma, atrial myxoma, alpha heavy chain disease, endocarditis, primary biliary cholangitis, polyarteritis nodosa, Graves' disease, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, ventricular septal defect, ostium primum atrial septal defect, cystic fibrosis, complement hyperactivation angiopathic thrombosis and protein-losing enteropathy, pachydermoperiostosis, hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, patent ductus arteriosus, congenital clubbing, hypertrophic pulmonary osteo-arthropathy, cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, gastric cancer, Crohn's disease, lung cancer, Whipple's disease, Ebstein's anomaly, pleural empyema and tetralogy of Fallot. In addition, digital clubbing can be caused by medications such as sennosides.

### Clinicopathologic conference: a four-year-old child with digital clubbing [^117Rs5TY]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Rheumatic diseases

With the presentation of fevers and noted clubbing, concern arose for the possibility of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) complicated by lung disease, also known as diffuse parenchymal lung disease. There is increasing awareness of lung disease in systemic JIA. Though some have suggested the involvement of uncontrolled systemic JIA activity or medication exposure as the cause of the increasing rates of systemic JIA–associated lung disease, the exact immunopathologic cause remains unknown. It was recently reported that up to 78% of patients with systemic JIA and lung disease have clubbing. Again, these patients are also notably symptomatic with shortness of breath, cough, and/or chest pain. Our patient did not exhibit pulmonary symptoms, but systemic JIA with interstitial lung disease (ILD) remained on our differential.

When considering periodic fevers, another rheumatic condition to consider is chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular (CINCA) syndrome, also known as neonatal‐onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID). This is a rare autoinflammatory condition characterized by mutation in the FCAS1 gene and is within the spectrum of other periodic fever syndromes. Historically, CINCA/NOMID has been characterized by neonatal onset (or young infancy onset) of persistent rash, optic disc changes, and progressive neurologic involvement. There have been cases of older children who have clubbing associated with this condition. Our patient lacked a rash, and eye or neurologic involvement, to suggest CINCA/NOMID.

### Pathogenesis and current status of the treatment of lung cancer associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^112DbZfF]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Reported lung cancer incidence rates in patients with pulmonary fibrosis from 2017 to 2023

IPF is a chronic and progressive lung disease characterized by abnormal fibrosis of lung tissue. When this condition is combined with LC, the clinical situation becomes more complex and severe. The combination of IPF and LC not only increases the difficulty of diagnosis but also increases the requirements for treatment plans. Therefore, to guide clinical doctors in effectively managing IPF combined with LC, it is crucial to understand the clinical association between these two diseases. Liu et al. reported that the most common symptoms and signs were cough, dyspnea, rales and clubbing fingers in IPF patients with or without lung cancer, whereas chest pain, hemoptysis, and weight loss symptoms were more common in LC-IPF patients than in IPF patients alone. In addition, studies have revealed the anatomical features and histological types of LC associated with IPF. Tumors in patients with LC-IPF usually present as atypical nodular or nodular shadows, mostly located in anatomical locations around the lungs and lower lobes of the lungs, which is consistent with the distribution of fibrotic lesions in patients with IPF. In addition, LC in patients with IPF also resembles IPF, occurring primarily in the peripheral regions of the lungs and often developing from focal areas of IPF. This may be due to the abnormal mechanical force generated by IPF in the lungs affecting the occurrence and development of LC, which is related to the pathogenesis of LC-IPF. Like typical LC patients, the LC type of LC-IPF patients is mainly non-small cell lung cancer. Unlike LC patients, whose pathological type is mostly adenocarcinoma, most studies have shown that lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is the most common pathological type in LC-IPF patients. However, studies have reported that adenocarcinoma (58.6%) is the most common histological lung cancer type among IPF patients, followed by LUSC (26.6%). In addition, only a few cases of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and large cell carcinoma have been reported in IPF patients, which may reflect the susceptibility of IPF patients to different histologic subtypes of lung cancer. Chest HRCT is very important for the early detection of LC. Tzouvelekis et al. recommended annual HRCT as a method for LC screening in patients with IPF, and for nodules less than 8 mm in diameter, close monitoring with HRCT every 3–6 months is recommended. For nodules > 8 mm in diameter or if HRCT reveals nodal progression, PET‒CT scanning is recommended. A minimally invasive biopsy is recommended if PET uptake shows a tumor lesion.

### Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy masquerading as lower extremity cellulitis and response to bisphosphonates [^111DRctX]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA) is characterized by clubbing of digits and, in more advanced stages, by periosteal new bone formation and synovial effusions. Secondary HOA typically occurs in the setting of intrathoracic malignancy, infections or lung metastases. We report a case with an atypical presentation of HOA. The prominent systemic signs, presentation limited to lower extremities only and an excellent response to bisphosphonates make this case unusual.

### Finger clubbing in inflammatory bowel disease: association with upper small bowel lesions and need of surgery in Crohn's disease [^113obDjC]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Finger clubbing has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Aims

In a prospective single-center study, we aimed to assess the frequency of finger clubbing in a cohort of IBD patients. Whether finger clubbing is associated with clinical characteristics of IBD was also investigated.

Methods

IBD patients with a detailed clinical history were enrolled. Finger clubbing was assessed by visual inspection. Data were expressed as median (range), chi-square, t-test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess risk factors for finger clubbing, when considering demographic and clinical characteristics, smoking habits and chronic pulmonary diseases (CPD).

Results

Finger clubbing was searched in 470 IBD patients: 267 Crohn's disease and 203 ulcerative colitis. Finger clubbing was more frequent in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis: 45/267 (16.8%) vs. 15/203 (7.3%) [odds ratio (OR), 2.54 (1.37–4.70); P = 0.003]. Crohn's disease involved the ileum (59.9%), colon (4.5%), ileum-colon (25.8%) and upper gastrointestinal (GI) (9.8%). Ulcerative colitis extent included proctitis (E1) (13.4%), left-sided (E2) (43.3%) and pancolitis (E3) (43.3%). Upper GI lesions, but not other Crohn's disease localizations, were more frequent in patients with finger clubbing [9/45 (20%) vs. 17/222 (7.7%); P = 0.032]. Crohn's disease-related surgery was more frequent in patients with finger clubbing [36/45 (80%) vs. 107/222 (48.1%); P < 0.001]. In Crohn's disease, the only risk factors for finger clubbing were upper GI lesions and Crohn's disease-related surgery [OR, 2.58 (1.03–6.46), P = 0.04; OR, 4.07 (1.86–8.91), P = 0.006]. Ulcerative colitis extent was not associated with finger clubbing [E1: OR, 0.27 (0.02–3.44), P = 0.33; E2: OR, 0.93 (0.24–3.60), P = 0.92; E3:OR, 0.64 (0.22–1.86), P = 0.59]. In ulcerative colitis, but not in Crohn's disease, finger clubbing was more frequent in smokers [13/15 (86.6%) vs. 99/188 (52.6%); P = 0.01] and in patients with CPD [5/15 (33.3%) vs. 16/188 (8.5%); P = 0.002]. Smoking and CPD were the only risk factors for finger clubbing in ulcerative colitis [OR, 7.18 (1.44–35.78), P = 0.01; OR, 10.93 (2.51–47.45), P = 0.001].

Conclusion

In the tested IBD population, finger clubbing was more frequent in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis. In Crohn's disease, upper GI lesions and history of Crohn's disease-related surgery were risk factors for finger clubbing, suggesting the possible role of finger clubbing as a subclinical marker of Crohn's disease severity.

### Clinicopathologic conference: a four-year-old child with digital clubbing [^116KwNem]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary involvement

The presence of clubbing raises concern for pulmonary involvement. This includes underlying pulmonary disease such as cystic fibrosis, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), or causes of diffuse lung disease. Diffuse lung disease is further characterized as being either intrinsic lung disease (e.g. idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, aspiration syndromes), associated with systemic disease (e.g. connective tissue diseases, metabolic storage diseases), or found in infancy (e.g. due to inborn errors of surfactant metabolism).

Our patient was Caucasian, which could raise suspicion for cystic fibrosis, a condition more common in this racial group. However, she lacked other signs to suggest cystic fibrosis, such as thick or sticky stools or poor growth. Results on a sweat chloride test were indeterminate, but CFTR gene sequencing did not support the presence of a pathologic mutation.

Pulmonary AVMs can result in digital clubbing. Such AVMs can be the result of direct communication between the pulmonary arteries and pulmonary veins. This is most often due to congenital malformations. Sometimes, pulmonary AVMs can be acquired, such as in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, also known as Rendu‐Osler‐Weber syndrome). They may also be acquired in trauma, metastatic carcinoma, or infections.

Lastly, diffuse lung disease was excluded as a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest did not show parenchymal lung disease.

Cardiac involvement

Cyanotic heart lesions have been associated with clubbing. For example, there is a case report of a child with unilateral finger clubbing. This child was ultimately found to have an absent aortic arch and was relying on a patent ductus arteriosus for blood supply. There is also evidence in the literature of patent ductus arteriosus being associated with PHO. While PHO is considered a primary cause of clubbing, it is worth mentioning here that clubbing as the finding of a patent ductus arteriosus should not reassure the clinician that another entity, such as PHO, is not involved. These conditions are not associated with fever, however, lowering our initial suspicion for a primary cardiac cause in this patient. Additionally, her chest radiographic was not concerning for cardiomegaly.

European Heart Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) clinical presentation — Symptoms are non-specific and mainly related to progressive right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, with initial symptoms typically triggered by exertion and including shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness, angina and syncope; less commonly patients describe dry cough and exercise-induced nausea and vomiting, while symptoms at rest occur only in advanced cases and abdominal distension and ankle oedema mainly develop with progressing RV failure. Physical signs include left parasternal lift, an accentuated pulmonary component of the second heart sound, an RV third heart sound, a pansystolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation and a diastolic murmur of pulmonary regurgitation; in advanced disease elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatomegaly, ascites, peripheral oedema and cool extremities are seen, and wheeze and crackles are usually absent. Clinical examination may suggest an underlying cause of PH, with telangiectasia, digital ulceration and sclerodactyly seen in scleroderma, inspiratory crackles pointing towards interstitial lung disease, spider naevi, testicular atrophy and palmar erythema suggesting liver disease, and when digital clubbing is encountered PVOD, cyanotic CHD, interstitial lung disease or liver disease should be considered.

### Clinicopathologic conference: a four-year-old child with digital clubbing [^111nqDmF]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Hepatic AVMs are even more common in HHT, with up to 75% of patients being affected, though not all patients experience symptoms. When patients do experience symptoms, most present with heart failure, portal hypertension, or biliary disease. These symptoms can be managed medically, though liver transplantation is favored in Europe and has demonstrated good outcomes. Until recently, initial or routine screening for hepatic AVMs if asymptomatic (lacking a bruit and with normal transaminases) was not routinely recommended in HHT patients. Our institution recommends checking liver function tests, including gamma glutamyl transferase and brain natriuretic peptide, annually.

For rheumatologists, HHT is important as it can mimic the skin findings of limited systemic sclerosis (SSc) (formerly the CREST variant of scleroderma). Limited SSc is characterized by calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal involvement, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia. This was not in our initial diagnosis but is worth mentioning here as skin findings can precede other findings by years. It has been suggested that anticentromere antibodies can distinguish limited SSc from HHT. However, there are case reports where this is not the circumstance and distinguishing between limited SSc and HHT may present a diagnostic dilemma.

There have been reports of other diseases associated with HHT. An example is juvenile polyposis HHT (JP‐HHT), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by gastrointestinal polyps and increased risk for GI cancer. These patients require further screening with colonoscopy and endoscopy every 1–2 years beginning with first symptom or at age 12 years, whichever comes first.

Interestingly, patients with JP‐HHT have a known genetic variation in the SMAD4 gene. SMAD4 encodes a protein in the TGFβ pathway. This is relevant, as there is also a case report of a patient with systemic JIA and JP‐HHT with a known variation in the SMAD4 gene. Though our patient ultimately did not have persistent fevers or blood work supporting a diagnosis of systemic JIA, this association may be important for rheumatologists who have patients presenting with fevers, clubbing, and findings of telangiectasias.

### Riddle from a love potion [^112ZuMTr]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Isotretinoin is a teratogen. It interrupts normal development and is especially harmful during the early phases of embryonic development. Its chemical-related cousins are retinoic acid and their better-known vitamin A. Retinoic acid is produced in localised sites at critical stages of embryonic development. It helps determine position along the anterior/posterior axis. Isotretinoin will thus disrupt normal development. Although, the exact prenatal history of Mr Riddle (Junior) cannot be determined, suspicion can be drawn to drugs disturbing his development, and thus influence his subsequent physical and mental health.

Prominent features of Mr Riddle's behaviour and anatomy point to a long-term severe medical condition. He suffered from bouts of syncope when he became angry and upset. At times, he would drop to his knees and squat, or lose consciousness completely. This symptom indicates a loss of oxygenated blood supply to his brain. Likewise, his complexion at most times was whitish-grey or with a bluish ting. Medically, this is cyanoses. A third telling sign is the shape of Mr Riddles fingers and their abnormal broadening at the tips. In medical terms, this is called clubbing of the fingers. It is often the result of chronic hypoxia, the lack of sufficient oxygen in his blood for many years. Mr Riddle also suffered from facial changes later in adulthood.

### Two cases of primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy caused by HPGD variants: a case report and literature review [^116aSup4]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

PGE2 accumulation can result from genetic variants that disrupt its metabolism, such as pathogenic variants in HPGD and SLCO2A1. Additionally, PGE2 elevation can be secondary to chronic pulmonary/cardiovascular diseases or malignancies. Primary PHO presents unique features, including delayed cranial suture closure, PDA, and early onset of digital clubbing. These features help distinguish PHO from secondary causes, as similar changes typically appear later in life.

PHO caused by HPGD variants often presents with digital clubbing at the onset. Patients with this type of PHO typically usually do not have a history of chronic hypoxia. This highlights the need for clinicians to consider this condition with similar presentations. Long-bone X-rays are recommended to evaluate periosteal reactions and hyperostosis. Additionally, measurement of urinary PGE2-to-creatinine ratios and PGE2 metabolite (PGE2-M) concentrations can assist in the diagnosis. It can also help monitor treatment efficacy in facilities with appropriate resources. Unfortunately, we were unable to measure these indices due to technical limitations.

Genetic studies have linked impaired PGE2 metabolism to PHO. This suggests that targeting PGE2 synthesis is a promising therapeutic strategy. Current treatment options, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; e.g. ibuprofen, indomethacin) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib, etoricoxib), have demonstrated clinical efficacy in symptom management. However, NSAIDs carry risks of gastrointestinal complications (e.g. bleeding, ulcers) due to their non-selective inhibition of COX-1, especially with prolonged or high-dose use. COX-2 inhibitors are therefore preferred for long-term therapy. In patients with osteolysis, bisphosphonates like pamidronate may alleviate bone loss and pain, though their effectiveness requires further validation. Other experimental approaches include selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) for joint pain and botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) for facial pachydermia, although their mechanisms of action remain unclear. Supportive therapies such as physical rehabilitation and arthroscopic synovectomy can improve joint function and mobility. Patient 1 exhibited reduced tibial cortical thickening in our study after two years of etoricoxib therapy. In contrast, Patient 2 declined pharmacological treatment and developed knee valgus, requiring corrective footwear and physiotherapy. Early intervention with COX-2 inhibitors may mitigate pain sensitivity and joint symptoms in PHO.

### Weight loss with GLP-1 analogues in preparation for transplantation [^1159qtzr]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

This case describes a woman in her 20s with a 6-month history of progressive exertional dyspnoea and cough. Examination revealed hypoxia on room air, sinus tachycardia, finger clubbing and bibasal inspiratory crackles. Inflammatory markers were mildly elevated and empirical antimicrobial therapy was commenced. A multidisciplinary discussion consensus diagnosis of acute interstitial pneumonitis was made based on the findings of high-resolution CT of the chest, macrophage predominant bronchoalveolar lavage cell differential and surgical lung biopsy. There was clinical and radiological deterioration despite glucocorticoids and antifibrotic therapy. A body mass index of 37.5 kg/m 2 precluded her from lung transplant assessment and consideration. Following consultation with the weight management service, she was commenced on glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogue therapy. She had a remarkable response within 6months, was listed for lung transplantation, and within 18 months of her initial presentation, a double lung transplantation was performed.

Dorsal dimelia is a rare form of duplication along the dorsoventral axis as opposed to polydactyly and hyperphalangism, which are duplications along the radioulnar and proximodistal axes, respectively. All previous cases of dorsal dimelia involved the ulnar digits. We report the first human case of dorsal dimelia of a radial digit (index finger) in a patient with absent thumb and radial club hand. Associated anomalies of previously reported cases of dorsal dimelia are reviewed and their pathogenesis is discussed.

A woman in her early 70s was found to have incidental finger clubbing at a fracture clinic consultation for an unrelated problem. She reported no associated respiratory symptoms and was referred back to her General Practitioner for further investigation. A chest radiograph revealed a large left-sided mass. This was characterised as a pleural-based mass on CT, resulting in localised atelectasis and mediastinal shift. A CT guided biopsy revealed histology consistent with a solitary fibrous tumour of the pleura and the patient was referred for thoracotomy and resection.

### Reversal of digital clubbing after lung transplantation in cystic fibrosis patients: a clue to the pathogenesis of clubbing [^1126bXqy]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2002). Low credibility.

Digital clubbing is a common sign in cystic fibrosis (CF) and in a variety of other diseases. However, its pathogenesis remains obscure. In diseases other than CF, regression of clubbing has been noted after cure of the underlying disease. The aim of this study was to assess whether clubbing is reversible in CF patients after lung transplantation. Digital clubbing was investigated in 3 CF patients, prior to and after lung transplantation. Distal phalangeal depth (DPD) and interphalangeal depth (IPD) of the index finger were measured using a skinfold caliper, and the DPD/IDP ratio was calculated. The mean DPD/IDP ratio was 1.08 ± 0.05 prior to transplantation and 1.00 ± 0.06, 0.96 ± 0.06, 0.92 ± 0.04, and 0.89 ± 0.07 at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after transplantation, respectively. In all 3 patients, the DPD/IDP ratio was greater than 1 before transplantation. In 2 patients, this ratio decreased to less than 1 within 3 months, and in the third patient within 9 months after surgery. We conclude that digital clubbing is reversible in CF patients who undergo lung transplantation. Regression was usually noted during the first 3 months posttransplantation. This could be explained either by adequate inactivation of a circulating clubbing-inducing molecule by the normal transplanted lungs, or by removal of the diseased lungs in which this presumably causative substance was produced.

### A novel mutation in thegene results in the unusual phenotype of palmoplantar keratoderma with digital clubbing and hyperhidrosis [^111pYDsU]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Report

A 24-year-old man with consanguineous parents presented to our clinic with a 10-year history of palmoplantar skin thickening as well as hyperhidrosis (Figs 1 and 2). The patient was examined by more than 5 separate dermatologists. On physical examination, the patient had hyperkeratosis of his palms and soles and hyperhidrosis. The patient also had digital clubbing of all 20 digits, namely, obliteration of the Lovibond angle of all 20 nails (Figs 1 and 2). The rest of the physical examination findings were normal. Family history was negative for any similar condition.

A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen was taken from the patient's left palm, which showed hyperkeratosis, hypergranulosis, mild epidermal hyperplasia, and sparse superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate consistent with keratoderma (Fig 3). Systemic workup for any cardiopulmonary disease and malignancy was nonrevealing.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension: the task force for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), endorsed by the international society of heart and lung transplantation (ISHLT) [^112QGfpG]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension — clinical presentation notes that symptoms at rest occur only in very advanced disease; typical physical signs include left parasternal lift, an accentuated pulmonary component of the second heart sound, murmurs of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency, and an right ventricle (RV) third sound; advanced cases often show jugular vein distension, hepatomegaly, peripheral oedema, ascites, and cool extremities; lung sounds are usually normal; if digital clubbing is seen in 'IPAH', alternative diagnoses such as congenital heart disease (CHD) or pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) should be sought.

### Clubbing: bedside evaluation for associated conditions… [^111UJDUn]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Although usually symmetric, clubbing can be bilateral, unilateral, or even unidigital. Patients with clubbing may also have hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, a disorder most commonly associated with bronchogenic carcinoma, but also associated with extrapulmonary malignancies and non-malignant pulmonary conditions. Clubbing is almost always painless, unless it is associated with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy; most patients are even unaware of any abnormality in their fingers. Conditions associated with clubbing are listed in. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. There is no "gold standard" for the evaluation of clubbing and no imaging tests that can confirm its presence. Physicians must, therefore, rely on their clinical examination skills to verify a diagnosis of clubbing.

Visual inspection and palpation are usually sufficient to detect advanced clubbing, but early stages of clubbing can be more difficult to detect. Myers and Farquhar review the available literature about clubbing to determine the precision and accuracy of clinical examination in diagnosing the condition. Nail curvature by itself may occur with increasing age and does not necessarily indicate clubbing. The nail-fold angle is one method used to define clubbing. In normal fingers, the nail extends from the bed at about 160 degrees, but in clubbed fingers this angle approaches 180 degrees. The phalangeal depth ratio is also used to distinguish normal nails from clubbed nails. In normal fingers, the distal phalangeal depth should be smaller than the interphalangeal depth; this relationship is reversed in the finger with clubbing. Since calipers may not be readily available, physicians may estimate the phalangeal depth ratio.

The Schamroth sign describes the "window" that is created when the dorsal surfaces of the terminal phalanges on opposing fingers are placed together. A normal finger shows a diamond-shaped window, while the clubbed finger will have no space visible between the opposing nails. This sign has not been formally tested but is easy to perform at the bedside. When palpating the fingernail, the nail may seem to be loose within the soft tissue, and the base of the nail may be felt through the skin in advanced cases. Clinical examinations were found to be moderately precise in describing clubbing.

### Unexpected cause of cyanosis and dyspnea in an adult: direct communication of the right pulmonary artery and left atrium [^114D6vuV]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Direct communication of the right pulmonary artery and the left atrium is an extremely rare congenital malformation of the pulmonary vasculature. A 41-year-old woman with a history of cyanosis since childhood presented with mild exertional dyspnea. On physical examination, she had central cyanosis, clubbing of the fingers, and an upright position caused by orthodeoxia. Imaging studies showed a very large aneurysm in the distal right pulmonary artery with a direct communication to the left atrium. The patient underwent successful repair, with resolution of hypoxia and exertional symptoms.

### Pachydermodactyly: an unknown entity [^114RpHao]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Pachydermodactyly is a rare benign disease that usually affects the dorsal skin and subcutaneous tissue of the proximal interphalangeal joints of the index, middle, ring, and little fingers; the thumb is usually spared. Hyperkeratosis on the dorsal side of the affected areas is common. We present a case of a 19-year-old man who was diagnosed with pachydermodactyly after evaluation of a painless, progressive swelling and hyperkeratosis at the proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints of all fingers, bilaterally, for 6 years before presentation. Conservative treatment was prescribed and the patient remains asymptomatic. Given the benign and nonprogressive course of the disease, symptomatic treatment alone is all that is usually required.

### Clubbing in patients with fibrotic interstitial lung diseases [^116j89h4]. Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Clubbing is associated with poor prognosis and is variably present in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but is also seen in other fibrotic interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). Little is known about the best methodology to assess clubbing in ILDs and, hence, the prevalence and clinical utility and clinical significance of clubbing. We therefore aimed to evaluate the agreement between different clubbing assessment methods in patients with fibrotic ILDs. Additionally, we assessed the prevalence of clubbing in different fibrotic ILDs and related clubbing to disease severity and quality of life.

Methods

Consecutive outpatients with fibrotic ILDs of two tertiary referral centers were included. Clubbing was assessed with the phalangeal depth ratio, the digital index, the Schamroth sign test, and by the treating physicians and investigator.

Results

We included 153 patients (100 men), mean age 65 (range 33–88), mean FVC 79% (25–145%), mean TLCOc 50% (16–104%). Different methods for assessment of clubbing had poor correlation, and as a result, clubbing prevalence varied according to the method used, ranging from 7 to 42% in the total group of patients and 7–52% in IPF. The degree of clubbing did not correlate with FVC or TLCOc (p > 0.2) or with quality of life scores, but lower mean TLCOc scores were seen in patients with clubbing than in those without.

Conclusion

Clubbing was present in 7–42% of our fibrotic ILD cohort and showed no correlation with disease severity. Although considered an important clinical feature, assessment methods for clubbing showed no to poor agreement. Further studies are therefore needed to gain more insight into measuring clubbing reliably and the possible prognostic value and evolution of clubbing.

### Soft tissue enlargement of fingers in a teenager [^114QZo4e]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is true concerning this condition?
A. The condition is caused by a genetic mutation
B. The condition arises secondary to autoimmune processes in the joint
C. The condition requires a biopsy for diagnosis
D. The condition is thought to be related to repetitive mechanical microtrauma
E. The condition carries a poor prognosis if left untreated.

Answers:
A. The condition is caused by a genetic mutation – Incorrect. Pachydermoperiostosis is a genetic disease that may be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner.
B. The condition arises secondary to autoimmune processes in the joint – Incorrect. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory joint disease.
C. The condition requires a biopsy for diagnosis – Incorrect. Pachydermodactyly is typically diagnosed clinically. Proposed diagnostic criteria include: asymptomatic patient, absence of morning stiffness, absence of pain or tenderness on palpation, lateral as opposed to centrifugal enlargement of digits, normal lab tests, and radiographs demonstrating only soft tissue swelling.
D. The condition is thought to be related to repetitive mechanical microtrauma – Correct. Pachydermodactyly is strongly associated with repetitive, prolonged mechanical trauma from activities such as gymnastics, playing a musical instrument, knuckle cracking out of habit or secondary to a neuropsychiatric disorder. The influence of androgen on collagen synthesis is also thought to play a role, which could explain the male predominance.
E. The condition carries a poor prognosis if left untreated – Incorrect. Pachydermodactyly is a benign skin condition that does not typically require urgent treatment. It is nondebilitating and oftentimes the concern is purely cosmetic.

### Palmoplantar keratoderma and digital clubbing in 2 sisters with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy [^113MCron]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Several hereditary syndromes manifest with a distinct thickening of the palmar skin referred to as keratoderma. However, historically, the genetic cause of the condition has not always been resolved. We report 2 sisters who presented with palmoplantar keratoderma, digital clubbing, and hyperhidrosis, who were subject to a clinical case report in 1972. At a revisit, 50 years after the initial case presentation, the family was molecularly diagnosed with a deleterious variant in the gene 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD), found in both sisters (OMIM #). This case report illustrates the natural course of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy over 50 years.

### Congenital methaemoglobinaemia diagnosed in an adolescent boy [^11318vkU]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 14-year-old boy of Asian origin presented with a history of bluish discolouration of the finger and toenail bed with associated mild fatiguability on exertion since early childhood. Clinical examination revealed bilaterally symmetric uniform central cyanosis with no associated clubbing. Cardiovascular and respiratory system examination was normal. Pulse oximetry revealed an oxygen saturation of 87% in all four limbs. Transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography showed no evidence of shunt lesions. In view of the past diagnosis of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae made at 4 years of age, a repeat cardiac catheterisation study was done, which revealed no shunt at any level. Interestingly, arterial oxygen tension of the chocolate-brown blood was normal in all the samples, suggesting the possibility of methaemoglobinaemia. Co-oximetry revealed methaemoglobin levels of 36%, confirming the diagnosis. Secondary causes were ruled out. The family was counselled about the hereditary nature of the condition.

### Evaluation of post-market adverse events of lubiprostone: a real-world adverse event analysis from the FAERS database [^111NXjJA]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Clubbing-related AEs

In this study, a significant association between clubbing and lubiprostone was detected by four pharmacovigilance analysis methods (n = 3, ROR 91.6, PRR 91.53, IC 6.5, EBGM 90.74), suggesting the need to be alerted to the clinical risk of clubbing as an adverse drug reaction. clubbing as a classical clinical sign was firstly recorded by Hippocrates, it is characterized by painless enlargement of the distal phalanx and abnormal nail morphology, including (1) a skin-nail base angle of > 180° at the end of the finger; (2) disappearance of the rhombic window formed by the dorsal aspect of the adjacent phalanx; and (3) pathologically visible capillary dilatation, interstitial edema, and vascular smooth muscle proliferation. Notably, the pathogenesis is closely related to the persistent elevation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a potent vasodilator that activates persistent vasodilatation of the distal phalanx and an imbalance in osteogenic/osteoclastic activity, leading to characteristic bone remodeling (periosteal hyperplasia and trabecular lysis). lubiprostone, a bicyclic fatty acid derivative of prostaglandin E, has been shown to be an important component in the pathogenesis of prostaglandin E2. fatty acid prostaglandin E derivative, its pharmacological effects are not limited to ClC-2 channel activation. In vitro studies have demonstrated that it significantly activates the PGEP1 receptor (mediating 54% of maximal PGE2 activity), affecting inflammation, cell proliferation, and vascular function by modulating transmembrane signaling pathways. This property may be directly related to its ability to induce adverse effects of clubbing. Clinical cases further support this hypothesis: Kawamoto et al. reported a case of a patient on long-term lubiprostone use with a significantly elevated urinary PGE2/creatinine ratio (2.8-fold increase from baseline) and complete resolution of clubbing symptoms after 3 months of discontinuation with normalization of PGE2 levels. This temporal correlation of "medication-biomarker change-symptom relief" strongly suggests that lubiprostone may drive clubbing by upregulating PGE2 levels.
