## Question

What history questions and physical exam components should be included when assessing a patient with acute diarrhea

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what history questions and physical exam components should be included when assessing a patient with acute diarrhea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining acute diarrhea and establishing the core goals of the evaluation. Then, I should verify the key history elements that stratify severity, identify inflammatory features, and uncover exposures. Next, I will review the physical examination priorities, especially dehydration and signs of surgical or inflammatory disease. After that, I need to consider special populations and when to escalate testing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized approach and double-check that each element aligns with guideline-backed evidence and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope so I don't anchor incorrectly. Acute diarrhea is typically defined as three or more loose or liquid stools in 24 hours with duration less than 14 days, distinguishing it from persistent (14–29 days) and chronic (> 30 days) diarrhea, and this framing guides the intensity of evaluation and testing decisions.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before I establish the clinical goals. The priorities in acute diarrhea are to assess severity and hydration status, identify inflammatory features that change management, detect red flags mandating urgent intervention, and elicit exposures that inform pretest probabilities and public health actions, including outbreak considerations and travel-related risks [^116LQ4Y6] [^11278Z2D] [^114JmKZm].

> I will now examine the core history elements, starting with chronology and stool characteristics. I need to ask about onset and duration, frequency per day, stool form (watery versus bloody or mucoid), presence of blood, mucus, or fat, nocturnal occurrence, urgency, and incontinence, because these features help distinguish noninflammatory from inflammatory diarrhea and guide testing and treatment decisions [^112XuboH] [^116Si5YT].

> Wait, let me verify the associated symptoms that raise concern. Fever, chills, rigors, abdominal pain, cramping, nausea, vomiting, tenesmus, and systemic symptoms like malaise or myalgias should be documented, with particular attention to severe abdominal pain, persistent fever, and signs of sepsis that push me toward inflammatory or invasive pathogens and urgent evaluation [^112XuboH] [^1147dqkc].

> Next, I should review exposures and epidemiologic risks with a structured approach. I need to check for recent travel, especially to high-risk regions, and ask about high-risk foods such as raw or undercooked meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, dairy, and produce, as well as untreated water, street vendors, and daycare or childcare exposures, because these markedly shift pretest probabilities toward bacterial or parasitic etiologies and may trigger targeted testing or public health reporting [^116LQ4Y6] [^11278Z2D] [^116zqnsX].

> I should confirm medication and health-system exposures that change management. Recent antibiotic use increases the risk of C. difficile and should prompt testing in appropriate patients, while healthcare-associated diarrhea or recent hospitalization also elevates concern for C. difficile; immunocompromise, pregnancy, extremes of age, and chronic comorbidities increase risk of complications and may lower thresholds for testing and treatment [^113iRdjj] [^112XuboH] [^113WJAkC].

> But wait, what if there is a cluster of cases or occupational risk. I need to ask about similar illnesses in contacts or outbreaks, and I should document occupational risks such as food handling, healthcare, or childcare, because these have public health implications and may broaden the panel of pathogens to test and the need to coordinate with public health authorities [^11278Z2D] [^115T7tHT].

> Let me consider special populations explicitly so I don't miss nuances. In patients with HIV or other immunocompromised states, I should broaden the differential to include opportunistic pathogens and consider earlier stool testing for bacteria, viruses, and parasites; in infants under 3 months, I should maintain a low threshold for blood cultures and aggressive management given the risk of bacteremia and sepsis [^1152cwfm] [^113qt2r5].

> Now, I will examine the physical examination with a focus on severity and complications. I need to assess hydration status using general appearance, mental status, heart rate, blood pressure, orthostatics, mucous membranes, tears, fontanelle in infants, skin turgor, and capillary refill, because dehydration is the most common life-threatening complication and drives the urgency of rehydration strategy [^115Ne5w9] [^114JmKZm] [^116Xbgc1].

> Hold on, I should verify abdominal findings that suggest invasive or surgical disease. I will palpate for tenderness, guarding, rebound, and masses, and I will auscultate for bowel sounds, recognizing that severe focal tenderness, peritoneal signs, or distension raise concern for ischemia, perforation, or obstruction and may require urgent imaging and surgical consultation [^112XuboH] [^116zKZYC].

> I need to ensure I don't overlook perianal and rectal disease. A careful visual inspection for fissures, fistulas, abscesses, and hemorrhoids, and a digital rectal examination to assess for masses, strictures, or evacuation disorders, are important when symptoms suggest colitis, proctitis, or structural disease, and this is especially relevant in patients with suspected IBD or high-risk sexual exposures [^113G9CtT].

> Let me reconsider the synthesis so it's actionable. A prioritized approach is to first confirm severity and hydration, then identify inflammatory features and red flags, next elicit exposures and host risks, and finally tailor testing and treatment accordingly; this sequence aligns with IDSA and ACG guidance and helps avoid unnecessary testing while catching high-risk presentations early [^116LQ4Y6] [^112XuboH] [^1148R2pr].

> I should double-check that I've captured the key decision points. Bloody or mucoid stools, fever with severe pain, immunocompromise, recent antibiotics, travel to high-risk regions, persistent symptoms beyond a few days, and signs of dehydration are the principal triggers to expand evaluation and consider stool testing for bacterial pathogens, C. difficile, and parasites as indicated, whereas uncomplicated watery diarrhea in otherwise healthy hosts typically requires supportive care alone [^1147dqkc] [^113iRdjj] [^112XuboH].

For acute diarrhea, the history should focus on **onset, duration, frequency, stool characteristics** (watery, bloody, mucous, fatty), associated symptoms (fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, tenesmus), recent travel, antibiotic use, sick contacts, food exposures, and comorbidities (immunosuppression, pregnancy, chronic disease) [^116LQ4Y6] [^112XuboH]. The physical exam should assess **hydration status** (mucous membranes, skin turgor, capillary refill, orthostatics), vital signs (fever, tachycardia, hypotension), abdominal findings (tenderness, guarding, rebound, distension, masses), and perianal inspection for fissures, fistulas, or abscesses [^115Ne5w9] [^116zKZYC]. These elements help distinguish noninflammatory from inflammatory diarrhea, identify dehydration, and guide testing and treatment decisions [^112XuboH].

---

## Key history questions

### Onset and duration

Ask about **acute onset** (< 14 days) versus persistent (14–30 days) or chronic (> 30 days) diarrhea, as this helps frame the differential and testing strategy [^1115WUcq] [^1125KSJb]. Also determine the **duration and frequency** — number of stools per day and total duration — to gauge severity and risk of dehydration [^112XuboH].

---

### Stool characteristics

- **Consistency**: Watery vs formed; watery stools suggest secretory or osmotic processes, while formed stools suggest colonic involvement [^116Si5YT].

- **Blood or mucus**: Presence indicates inflammatory diarrhea (e.g. Shigella, Campylobacter, E. coli O157:H7, C. difficile) [^112XuboH].

- **Fatty or oily appearance**: Suggests malabsorption or maldigestion (e.g. celiac, pancreatic insufficiency) [^116Si5YT].

---

### Associated symptoms

- **Fever**: Suggests infectious or inflammatory etiology [^notfound].

- **Abdominal pain**: Cramping pain is common in infectious diarrhea; severe pain raises concern for ischemia, obstruction, or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [^notfound].

- **Vomiting**: Common in viral gastroenteritis; persistent vomiting increases dehydration risk [^notfound].

- **Tenesmus**: Suggests colonic inflammation (e.g. Shigella, C. difficile) [^notfound].

---

### Exposure and risk factors

- **Travel**: Recent travel, especially to developing countries, increases risk of bacterial and parasitic infections [^1126MvG2].

- **Antibiotic use**: Recent antibiotics increase risk of C. difficile [^113iRdjj].

- **Sick contacts**: Household or childcare exposures suggest infectious etiology [^notfound].

- **Food exposures**: Raw or undercooked meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, dairy, or produce; unpasteurized products; street food [^notfound].

- **Comorbidities**: Immunosuppression, pregnancy, chronic disease, HIV/AIDS increase risk and severity [^113WJAkC].

---

### Medication and supplement use

Review prescription, OTC, and herbal agents, especially **antibiotics, antacids, PPIs, metformin, magnesium-containing drugs, and laxatives**, which can cause or worsen diarrhea [^113iRdjj].

---

## Essential physical examination components

### General appearance and vital signs

Assess for **ill appearance, lethargy, confusion, and signs of distress**. Check temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate; fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest severe illness or sepsis [^112XuboH].

---

### Hydration status

- **Mucous membranes**: Dryness indicates dehydration [^notfound].

- **Skin turgor**: Delayed return suggests moderate-to-severe dehydration [^114pDes8].

- **Capillary refill**: Prolonged (> 2 seconds) indicates dehydration [^114pDes8].

- **Orthostatic vitals**: Drop in BP or rise in HR with standing indicates significant volume depletion [^notfound].

---

### Abdominal examination

- **Inspection**: Distension, visible peristalsis, surgical scars, hernias [^116zKZYC].

- **Auscultation**: Hyperactive bowel sounds in infectious diarrhea; absent or diminished sounds suggest obstruction or ileus [^notfound].

- **Palpation**: Tenderness, guarding, rebound, masses; diffuse tenderness in infectious diarrhea; focal pain suggests surgical pathology [^115aPYdV].

- **Percussion**: Tympany suggests distension or obstruction [^notfound].

---

### Perianal and rectal examination

Inspect for **fissures, fistulas, abscesses, hemorrhoids, and skin excoriation**. Perform a **digital rectal exam** to assess for masses, strictures, or rectal evacuation disorders [^113G9CtT].

---

## Clinical implications of history and physical findings

| **History/physical finding** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|
| Acute onset, watery stools, vomiting | Viral gastroenteritis |
| Bloody stools, fever, abdominal pain | Bacterial dysentery (Shigella, Campylobacter, E. coli O157:H7) |
| Recent antibiotic use | C. difficile infection |
| Travel to developing countries | Traveler's diarrhea (ETEC, Campylobacter, Shigella, Giardia) |
| Immunosuppression | Broaden differential, lower threshold for testing/treatment |
| Severe dehydration | Urgent IV rehydration, hospitalization |
| Focal abdominal tenderness, rebound | Surgical abdomen (appendicitis, diverticulitis, obstruction) |

---

## Conclusion

A structured history and physical examination are essential in acute diarrhea to distinguish noninflammatory from inflammatory causes, assess dehydration, and identify red flags. This guides **targeted testing**, appropriate use of antibiotics, and the need for hospitalization or urgent surgical evaluation [^112XuboH].

### Acute diarrhea in adults [^112XuboH]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute diarrheal disease accounts for 179 million outpatient visits annually in the United States. Diarrhea can be categorized as inflammatory or noninflammatory, and both types have infectious and noninfectious causes. Infectious noninflammatory diarrhea is often viral in etiology and is the most common presentation; however, bacterial causes are also common and may be related to travel or foodborne illness. History for patients with acute diarrhea should include onset and frequency of symptoms, stool character, a focused review of systems including fever and other symptoms, and evaluation of exposures and risk factors. The physical examination should include evaluation for signs of dehydration, sepsis, or potential surgical processes. Most episodes of acute diarrhea in countries with adequate food and water sanitation are uncomplicated and self-limited, requiring only an initial evaluation and supportive treatment. Additional diagnostic evaluation and management may be warranted when diarrhea is bloody or mucoid or when risk factors are present, including immunocompromise or recent hospitalization. Unless an outbreak is suspected, molecular studies are preferred over traditional stool cultures. In all cases, management begins with replacing water, electrolytes, and nutrients. Oral rehydration is preferred; however, signs of severe dehydration or sepsis warrant intravenous rehydration. Antidiarrheal agents can be symptomatic therapy for acute watery diarrhea and can help decrease inappropriate antibiotic use. Empiric antibiotics are rarely warranted, except in sepsis and some cases of travelers' or inflammatory diarrhea. Targeted antibiotic therapy may be appropriate following microbiologic stool assessment. Hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, and food and water safety measures are integral to preventing infectious diarrheal illnesses.

### Infectious diarrhea: IDSA updates guidelines for diagnosis and… [^1148QjvQ]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America has updated its 2001 guidelines for the management of children and adults with suspected or confirmed infectious diarrhea. The main points are highlighted here. Other topics can be found in the original guideline. Clinicians should evaluate patients with diarrhea for postinfectious and extraintestinal manifestations associated with enteric infections such as reactive arthritis, erythema nodosum, or glomerulonephritis. Specific manifestations may be associated with specific pathogens. When a clinical syndrome consistent with a known postinfectious manifestation is identified, an exposure history should be obtained with a diagnostic evaluation and directed management. DIAGNOSIS Diarrheal illnesses are usually self-limited and determining the exact etiology is not always necessary. Stool testing is indicated in patients at high risk of severe illness and when identification of a pathogen is important for the patient or public health.

In patients with diarrhea accompanied by fever, bloody or mucoid stools, severe abdominal cramping or tenderness, or signs of sepsis, stool should be tested for. Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Clostridium difficile, and STEC. Blood cultures should be performed in infants younger than three months and in patients with signs of septicemia or suspected enteric fever, patients with certain high-risk conditions, and patients who have traveled to endemic areas or had contact with travelers from endemic areas who have a fever of unknown etiology. A broad differential diagnosis should be considered in patients with diarrhea who are immunocompromised, especially those with moderate or severe primary or secondary immune deficiencies, and bacterial cultures and viral and parasitic testing should be performed.

Patients with AIDS require testing for additional organisms, including Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, Cystoisospora, microsporidia, Mycobacterium avium complex, and cytomegalovirus. Testing may be considered for C. difficile infection in patients older than two years who have a history of diarrhea following antimicrobial use and in those with health-care–associated diarrhea. One stool specimen is suggested for testing because multiple specimens do not increase diagnostic yield. C. difficile should also be considered in patients with diarrhea occurring in hospitals. Colonization is common in hospitalized patients and residents of long-term care facilities, although patients without diarrhea should not be tested or treated.

Acute infectious diarrhea is a major global health problem. Issues for the developed and developing regions of the world differ. Awareness of disease pathophysiology and epidemiology are essential, however, for clinical evaluation and management. The immense human and economic burden imposed by acute diarrhea illness can be addressed only by thoughtful strategies aimed at prevention as well as cost-efficient evaluation and treatment.

### Chronic unexplained diarrhea: a logical and cost-effective approach to assessment [^112ybPBR]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The workup of chronic unexplained diarrhea can be equally frustrating for care providers and patients. It carries a physical, financial, and social toll. In this review we provide a sensible approach to evaluating and managing chronic diarrhea.

Recent Findings

Bile acid diarrhea is becoming increasingly recognized as a potential cause behind some cases of chronic diarrhea.

Summary

A detailed history and physical examination can provide clues that guide a logical approach to the evaluation. We suggest a cost-effective approach to the workup and management of chronic diarrhea based on individual patient factors related to clinical history and physical exam. We find that this approach leads to initiation of treatment in a time-efficient fashion and avoids unnecessary testing.

Diarrhea generates a wide range of diagnostic considerations and has profound individual and public health significance. The setting and circumstances under which a patient presents with diarrhea drastically influences the concern brought to the encounter. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are often provisionally labeled "gastroenteritis" with appropriate expectant management. In resource-poor countries, the significance of diarrhea is even greater. This review focuses on diarrhea and its initial evaluation and management in the emergency department.

### Chronic diarrhea: diagnosis and management [^113uFvCT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is a common problem affecting up to 5% of the population at a given time. Patients vary in their definition of diarrhea, citing loose stool consistency, increased frequency, urgency of bowel movements, or incontinence as key symptoms. Physicians have used increased frequency of defecation or increased stool weight as major criteria and distinguish acute diarrhea, often due to self-limited, acute infections, from chronic diarrhea, which has a broader differential diagnosis, by duration of symptoms; 4 weeks is a frequently used cutoff. Symptom clusters and settings can be used to assess the likelihood of particular causes of diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome can be distinguished from some other causes of chronic diarrhea by the presence of pain that peaks before defecation, is relieved by defecation, and is associated with changes in stool form or frequency (Rome criteria). Patients with chronic diarrhea usually need some evaluation, but history and physical examination may be sufficient to direct therapy in some. For example, diet, medications, and surgery or radiation therapy can be important causes of chronic diarrhea that can be suspected on the basis of history alone. Testing is indicated when alarm features are present, when there is no obvious cause evident, or the differential diagnosis needs further delineation. Testing of blood and stool, endoscopy, imaging studies, histology, and physiological testing all have roles to play but are not all needed in every patient. Categorizing patients after limited testing may allow more directed testing and more rapid diagnosis. Empiric antidiarrheal therapy can be used to mitigate symptoms in most patients for whom a specific treatment is not available.

### Acute bloody diarrhea: a medical emergency for patients of all ages [^115MSYwf]. Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute bloody diarrhea should be considered a medical emergency. Its causes are frequently serious or actionable or both and are usually identified. However, acute bloody diarrhea as a stand-alone clinical presentation has received little scholarly attention in the past several decades. Although the range of possible causes of acute bloody diarrhea is broad, infectious considerations are paramount and should always be prioritized in the evaluation of such patients. History, examination, and laboratory testing should be focused on minimizing time to diagnosis (and, by extension, to implementing appropriate therapy). Strategically chosen tests and imaging, avoidance of extraneous diagnostic pursuits, and provision of supportive care while awaiting diagnostic clarity are central to the adroit management of patients with acute bloody diarrhea. Diagnostic considerations differ somewhat between adults and children but have many elements in common, including the need for vigilance in detecting Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection. In this review, we discuss diagnostic approaches (emphasizing the importance of rapid, accurate, and thorough microbiologic investigation) and measures that can be taken to support patients while awaiting information that determines the cause of their disease. These topics are discussed in the context of the medical care that is available to children and adults with bloody diarrhea in most institutions in developed nations.

### Acute diarrhea [^1128hkTk]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Acute diarrhea in adults is a common problem encountered by family physicians. The most common etiology is viral gastroenteritis, a self-limited disease. Increases in travel, comorbidities, and foodborne illness lead to more bacteria-related cases of acute diarrhea. A history and physical examination evaluating for risk factors and signs of inflammatory diarrhea and/or severe dehydration can direct any needed testing and treatment. Most patients do not require laboratory workup, and routine stool cultures are not recommended. Treatment focuses on preventing and treating dehydration. Diagnostic investigation should be reserved for patients with severe dehydration or illness, persistent fever, bloody stool, or immunosuppression, and for cases of suspected nosocomial infection or outbreak. Oral rehydration therapy with early refeeding is the preferred treatment for dehydration. Antimotility agents should be avoided in patients with bloody diarrhea, but loperamide/simethicone may improve symptoms in patients with watery diarrhea. Probiotic use may shorten the duration of illness. When used appropriately, antibiotics are effective in the treatment of shigellosis, campylobacteriosis, Clostridium difficile, traveler's diarrhea, and protozoal infections. Prevention of acute diarrhea is promoted through adequate hand washing, safe food preparation, access to clean water, and vaccinations.

---

### Severe acute diarrhea [^1126MvG2]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Acute diarrhea is commonly caused by an infection. Severe acute diarrhea warrants immediate medical evaluation and hospitalization. Indications for stool studies include fever; bloody diarrhea; recent travel to an endemic area; recent antibiotics; immunosuppression; and occupational risks, such as food handlers. Noninfectious causes include inflammatory bowel disease, radiation enteritis, and intestinal ischemia. Management of severe acute diarrhea includes intravenous fluid rehydration and empiric antibiotics. Use of antidiarrheal agents is controversial when invasive pathogens are suspected.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^116CuDrD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — diagnostic yield and selective testing report that among adults presenting with diarrhea to emergency departments in the United States, 17% of patients who submitted a stool specimen (as opposed to rectal swab) were found to have a bacterial enteric infection, that a bacterial etiology was found in 5%–11% of children seeking care in emergency departments and outpatient settings, and that restricting testing to patients with bloody stools, fever, or abdominal tenderness can increase the likelihood of identifying a bacterial pathogen; testing all patients with acute diarrhea for these pathogens would be inefficient.

3.2 History and examination: secondary care assessment

A detailed history is essential in the assessment of patients with chronic diarrhoea. This should attempt (a) to establish the likelihood that the symptoms are organic (as opposed to functional) based on presence of 'alarm features' as outlined above; (b) to distinguish malabsorptive from colonic/inflammatory forms of diarrhoea; and (c) to assess for specific causes of diarrhoea.

Symptoms suggestive of an organic disease include a history of diarrhoea of < 3 months' duration, predominantly nocturnal or continuous (as opposed to intermittent) diarrhoea and significant weight loss. The absence of these, in conjunction with positive symptoms such as those defined in the Rome IV criteria (improved clinical validation)and a normal physical examination, are suggestive of a functional bowel disturbance, but only with a specificity of approximately 52–74%. Unfortunately, these criteria do not reliably exclude inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), microscopic colitis or bile acid diarrhoea, all of which are relatively common and treatable with specific approaches.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^117NPL7v]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — empiric antimicrobial therapy for acute and persistent watery diarrhea is generally discouraged: in most people with acute watery diarrhea and without recent international travel, empiric antimicrobial therapy is not recommended (strong, low), with an exception that may be made in people who are ill-appearing, and empiric treatment should be avoided in people with persistent watery diarrhea lasting 14 days or more (strong, low). Asymptomatic contacts of people with acute or persistent watery diarrhea should not be offered empiric or preventive therapy, but should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate). Features suggesting inflammatory infection that warrant investigation include high fever, significant abdominal pain, and duration > 3 days, and given the relatively small benefit of empiric treatment (1 day shorter illness on average) and the likelihood of viral infection in the absence of inflammatory signs, empiric treatment cannot be recommended and may be potentially harmful.

### Derivation of a clinical prediction rule for evaluating patients with abdominal pain and diarrhea [^115aPYdV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to develop a simple prediction rule to reliably identify abdominal pain patients with diarrhea who may require surgical intervention.

Methods

We performed a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of adults with acute nontraumatic abdominal pain and diarrhea in an urban emergency department (ED). Structured data collection included 109 historical and 28 physical examination items, laboratory and radiographic results, and final diagnosis. The main outcome was operative intervention.

Results

One thousand patients were enrolled; 174 patients with diarrhea were included in this analysis. Patients had a mean age of 39 ± 16 years and were likely to be female (64%) and black (60%). Fifteen (9%) patients received a surgical intervention from the ED. Clinical variables associated with the need for surgical intervention using univariate analysis were age older than 40 years, constant pain, and peritonitis on examination. Using recursive partitioning multivariate analysis, the derived prediction rule included 2 variables: age older than 40 years and constant pain. This rule had a sensitivity of 1.0 (95% confidence interval, 0.78–1.0) and specificity of 0.23 (95% confidence interval, 0.16–0.30).

Conclusion

Patients older than 40 years with constant abdominal pain and diarrhea are likely to have a surgical cause of their symptoms.

### Gastroenteritis in children: part 1. diagnosis [^114vCHjd]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis in children is a major cause of morbidity in the United States. Viral infections, primarily from rotavirus, cause 75 to 90 percent of cases. The remaining infections are largely bacterial, with as many as 10 percent of cases secondary to diarrheagenic Escherichia coli. The history and physical examination of children with gastroenteritis should focus on assessing for the presence and degree of dehydration and determining the underlying etiology. The child's weight during the illness versus posttreatment is often used to evaluate degree of dehydration retrospectively. The three examination signs that best suggest dehydration in children are an abnormal respiratory pattern, abnormal skin turgor, and prolonged capillary refill time, although parental report of the child's history is also helpful in the assessment. In general, measuring serum electrolyte levels usually is unnecessary in children with mild to moderate dehydration. Laboratory tests are recommended only when severe dehydration is suspected; in such cases, intravenous fluids would be warranted. Although it is not necessary to routinely obtain stool cultures, they should be collected if diarrhea is persistent.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC DIARRHEA

Early and accurate diagnosis is essential in disease management. A patient with chronic diarrhea may present with a spectrum of symptoms indicating one of several disorders, including IBS-D, EPI, celiac disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, inflammatory bowel disease, and infections (eg, giardiasis). All of these conditions may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence among their symptoms. To assist in the accurate diagnosis of patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, we suggest a four-step diagnostic process (Fig. 2).

Step 1: Thorough History and Physical Examination

Diagnosis should begin by taking a thorough history and physical examination. Patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, defined as persisting for ≥ 4 weeks, should be questioned in detail on their symptoms and prior diarrhea history. Although the clinical definition of diarrhea is loose or watery stools ≥ 3 times in a 24-hour period, patients use various definitions (eg, loose stools, increased stool frequency, or fecal urgency), underscoring the importance of an accurate and detailed patient history. Abnormal stool form can be more important in defining diarrhea because patients with functional constipation will also present with a chief complaint of diarrhea owing to increased defecatory frequency. However, further questioning may cause illicit symptoms of straining, incomplete evacuation, obstruction, and the passage of hard stools.

As an initial approach, we recommend determining if diarrhea can be categorized as watery (indicative of IBS, celiac disease, endocrinopathy, or laxative misuse), fatty or greasy (which may indicate a malabsorptive or maldigestion disease, such as celiac disease or EPI), or inflammatory (indicative of infectious or inflammatory bowel disease); however, definitive categorization is not always possible using these criteria because some conditions overlap (Table 2). Further questioning should include the following: What is the pattern of diarrhea? Is it continuous, intermittent, or meal-related (this may differentiate secretory from osmotic diarrhea)? When did it start? Was there a precipitating event? What is the volume of feces? Is there blood, mucus, or fat in the stool or toilet basin? Is there a nocturnal component to diarrhea? Is there fecal urgency or incontinence?, In addition, other gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms should be explored, and potential aggravating factors, such as diet, stress, or medications, and alleviating factors should be queried.

Chronic watery diarrhea poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge and is often a disabling condition for patients. Although acute diarrhea is likely to be caused by infection, the causes of chronic diarrhea (> 4 weeks in duration) are more elusive. We review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic diarrhea. Drawing on recent insights into the molecular mechanisms of intestinal epithelial transport and barrier function, we discuss how diarrhea can result from a decrease in luminal solute absorption, an increase in secretion, or both, as well as derangements in barrier properties. We also describe the various extraepithelial factors that activate diarrheal mechanisms. Finally, clinical evaluation and tests used in the assessment of patients presenting with chronic diarrhea are reviewed, and an algorithm guiding therapeutic decisions and pharmacotherapy is presented.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — features linked to complications or severe disease: People of all ages with acute diarrhea should be evaluated for dehydration, which increases the risk of life-threatening illness and death, especially among the young and older adults (strong, high). When the clinical or epidemiologic history suggests a possible Shiga toxin–producing organism, diagnostic approaches should be applied that detect Shiga toxin (or the genes that encode them) and distinguish E. coli O157:H7 from other STEC (Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli) in stool (strong, moderate); if available, diagnostic approaches that can distinguish between Shiga toxin 1 and Shiga toxin 2, which is typically more potent, could be used (weak, moderate), and Shigella dysenteriae type 1 and, rarely, other pathogens may produce Shiga toxin and should be considered as a cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), especially with suggestive international travel or personal contact with a traveler (strong, moderate). Clinicians should evaluate people for postinfectious and extraintestinal manifestations associated with enteric infections (strong, moderate). Supporting risk data include that volume depletion is a frequently identified risk factor for diarrhea-related deaths; dehydration at admission among children with postdiarrheal HUS is associated with an increased need for dialysis; intravenous fluid during the diarrhea phase of STEC infections reduces the risk of oligoanuric renal failure; and although most patients with laboratory-confirmed STEC who develop HUS have bloody diarrhea, approximately 10% do not; factors independently associated with increased risk of STEC O157 include abdominal tenderness and absence of fever at first medical evaluation, and approximately 65% will have a peripheral white blood cell count > 10000 cells/μL.

Functional gastrointestinal symptoms in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — Clinical assessment should begin with a detailed symptom history including a review of bowel patterns, and clinicians should query for associated pain, incontinence episodes, urgency or tenesmus; alarm features (eg, weight loss, nocturnal symptoms, bleeding, high-volume or high-frequency diarrhea, fevers); recent antibiotic use; and symptom duration to identify features that may point away from a functional etiology. Presence of alarm features or acute symptom onset in previously well-controlled disease should prompt the clinician to maintain a high index of suspicion for underlying inflammatory activity. Physical examination should assess for objective findings suggesting organic pathology or active IBD such as abdominal distension or masses, and careful rectal examination should inspect for perianal or anorectal disease. In those without obvious perianal pathology to explain symptoms, a digital rectal exam to palpate for mass lesions and to screen for a rectal evacuation disorder should be completed. Objective evidence of inflammatory activity may be sought with laboratory testing such as serum CRP and fecal.

### Chronic diarrhea in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^114bbHKz]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is defined as a predominantly loose stool lasting longer than four weeks. A patient history and physical examination with a complete blood count, C-reactive protein, anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A (IgA), total IgA, and a basic metabolic panel are useful to evaluate for pathologies such as celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease. More targeted testing should be based on the differential diagnosis. When the differential diagnosis is broad, stool studies should be used to categorize diarrhea as watery, fatty, or inflammatory. Some disorders can cause more than one type of diarrhea. Watery diarrhea includes secretory, osmotic, and functional types. Functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and functional diarrhea are common causes of chronic diarrhea. Secretory diarrhea can be caused by bile acid malabsorption, microscopic colitis, endocrine disorders, and some postsurgical states. Osmotic diarrhea can present with carbohydrate malabsorption syndromes and laxative abuse. Fatty diarrhea can be caused by malabsorption or maldigestion and includes disorders such as celiac disease, giardiasis, and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Inflammatory diarrhea warrants further evaluation and can be caused by disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, Clostridioides difficile, colitis, and colorectal cancer.

### Acute abdominal pain in children [^113eU3VW]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain in children presents a diagnostic dilemma. Although many cases of acute abdominal pain are benign, some require rapid diagnosis and treatment to minimize morbidity. Numerous disorders can cause abdominal pain. The most common medical cause is gastroenteritis, and the most common surgical cause is appendicitis. In most instances, abdominal pain can be diagnosed through the history and physical examination. Age is a key factor in evaluating the cause; the incidence and symptoms of different conditions vary greatly over the pediatric age spectrum. In the acute surgical abdomen, pain generally precedes vomiting, while the reverse is true in medical conditions. Diarrhea often is associated with gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Appendicitis should be suspected in any child with pain in the right lower quadrant. Signs that suggest an acute surgical abdomen include involuntary guarding or rigidity, marked abdominal distention, marked abdominal tenderness, and rebound abdominal tenderness. If the diagnosis is not clear after the initial evaluation, repeated physical examination by the same physician often is useful. Selected imaging studies also might be helpful. Surgical consultation is necessary if a surgical cause is suspected or the cause is not obvious after a thorough evaluation.

3 Primary clinical assessment

The initial assessment of patients with chronic diarrhoea can be mostly carried out in the primary care setting. The importance of careful history taking and examination cannot be overemphasised.

3.1 Initial presentation in primary care

In most countries where there is a split primary/secondary care system, the first consultation is with the primary care physician. Around 10% of all consultations in primary care are for gastroenterological problems, of which half are for lower gastrointestinal (GI) problems. Most of these are for self-limiting symptoms or for functional GI disorders and only a very small proportion comprise chronic or persistent diarrhoea. Based on the accepted definition of chronic diarrhoea being abnormal passage of ≥ 3 loose stools per day for more than 4 weeks and a rate of 3–5% per year, a primary care physician with an average list size of 1700 patients may have 50–85 such patients each year. Only a proportion of these will consult, with many managing with self- or pharmacy-based treatments, while others will be managed within primary care, often with antidiarrhoeals.

No data are available on the proportion referred to secondary care, but these are likely to be a small minority of the total number of people with chronic diarrhoea in the community. First-line investigations are normally performed within primary care and patients may be referred if their condition causes interference with normal activities or a compromise of quality of life sufficient to warrant further action. As with other conditions, many patients merely adapt their lives to their symptoms. No formal primary care referral guidelines or recommendations exist for patients with chronic diarrhoea, but the presence of normal first-line investigations with symptoms severe enough to impair quality of life and not responding to treatment constitutes a rationale for referral.

The impact of the symptoms of chronic diarrhoea and the differential diagnoses that need to be considered are clearly different in individual patients. A patient with recent change in bowel habit to include diarrhoea over 6 weeks is likely to need a different approach compared with another patient who has suffered from intermittent watery diarrhoea which has been present for over 5 years. Blood, stool (if an infectious aetiology or if an inflammatory component is suspected) and serological tests (for coeliac disease, hyperthyroidism and anaemia) should be performed in primary care as an initial assessment. Equally, if alarm features (such as unexplained change in bowel habit, persistent blood in the stool and unintentional weight loss) are detected, then referral for further investigations should be initiated.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach — study design determines initial confidence, with "Randomized trials ➔ High confidence" and "Observational studies ➔ Low confidence"; confidence can be lowered for "Risk of Bias", "Inconsistency", "Indirectness", "Imprecision", and "Publication bias", or raised for "Large effect", "Dose response", and when "All plausible confounding & bias would reduce a demonstrated effect or would suggest a spurious effect if no effect was observed"; final confidence ratings include "High", "Moderate", "Low", and "Very low". For a Strong recommendation, "Healthcare workers: Most people should receive the recommended course of action" and "Policy makers: The recommendation can be adopted as a policy in most situations", whereas for a Weak recommendation the population is described as "The majority of people in this situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not" and healthcare workers should "Be prepared to help people to make a decision that is consistent with their own values/decision aids and shared decision making".

Approach to the patient with ASBO

An algorithm for the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the patient with ASBO is presented in Fig. 2. The initial diagnosis of ASBO is of utmost importance. Failure to diagnose or having a delayed diagnosis represents 70% of malpractice claims in ASBO.

Fig. 2
Algorithm to diagnosis and treatment of ASBO

The primary goals in the initial evaluation of patients in whom adhesive small bowel obstruction is suspected are:
Differentiating between adhesive small bowel obstruction and other causes of bowel obstruction
Assessing the need for urgent surgical exploration
Identifying and preventing complications from bowel obstruction

History taking and physical examination

History taking in a patient suspected for ASBO includes assessment of potential causes of bowel obstruction (previous operations, radiotherapy) and nutritional status. Signs of dehydration should also be assessed. Traditionally, ASBO is clinically diagnosed in a patient with intermittent colicky abdominal pain, distention, and nausea (with or without vomiting), with or without absence of stools. Although diagnosis of small bowel obstruction is fairly certain in a patient in whom all of these symptoms are present, there are some specific pitfalls that can result in delayed or misdiagnosis of bowel obstruction upon initial presentation. In patients with incomplete obstruction, watery diarrhea may be present. The presence of watery diarrhea can cause an episode of ASBO to be mistaken for gastro-enteritis. Stools might also be present in patients with a relatively high obstruction who are admitted early after onset of symptoms. Moreover, not all of these symptoms may be present, especially in the elderly in whom pain is often less prominent.

During physical examination, signs of peritonitis that might reveal strangulation or ischemia should be evaluated. Differential diagnostic considerations that can be assessed during physical examination include the presence of any abdominal wall or groin hernias. The evaluation of ASBO by history taking and physical examination has a low sensitivity for detecting bowel strangulation and ischemia. Sensitivity of physical examination for detection of strangulation is only 48%, even in experienced hands.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — fever or bloody diarrhea and enteric fever: People with fever or bloody diarrhea should be evaluated for enteropathogens for which antimicrobial agents may confer clinical benefit including Salmonella enterica subspecies, Shigella, and Campylobacter (strong, low). Enteric fever should be considered when a febrile person (with or without diarrhea) has a history of travel to areas in which causative agents are endemic, has consumed foods prepared by people with recent endemic exposure, or has had laboratory exposure to Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi and Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Paratyphi (strong, moderate). In typhoid and paratyphoid fever, diarrhea is an uncommon feature, typhoid fever outbreaks in the United States are uncommon and usually associated with foodborne transmission from an asymptomatic carrier, and a travel history is frequent, reported in 68% of patients with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and 50% with Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi.

### Visual diagnosis: chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive in a 5-year-old girl [^111BVEzu]. Pediatrics in Review (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic GVHD usually develops 100 days after BMT and is a serious and potentially life-threatening long-term complication. Chronic GVHD can occur after previous or ongoing acute GVHD or in patients without a history of acute GVHD (eg, de novo disease) as illustrated by this case. In evaluating a patient presenting with chronic diarrhea more than 100 days after BMT, one must consider a serious underlying illness such as chronic GVHD because it is a major cause of morbidity and mortality of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. As indicated by this case, chronic GVHD can cause diarrhea. Complete evaluation of the diarrhea state should be part of the initial investigation. In many cases, however, the diagnosis of GVHD is not straightforward, and gastrointestinal biopsy and histologic confirmation is often necessary to corroborate a clinical impression of chronic GVHD.

### Evaluation of abdominal emergencies [^114vc3RD]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Early primary assessment and abdominal examination can often be enough to triage the patient with abdominal pain into those with less severe underlying pathologic condition from those with more acute findings. A focused history of the patient can then allow the clinician to develop their differential diagnosis. Once the differential diagnoses are determined, diagnostic imaging and laboratory findings can help confirm the diagnosis and allow for expeditious treatment and intervention.

Rationale for best practice statements — history taking for gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in COVID-19. In outpatients with new-onset diarrhea, ascertain information about high-risk contact exposure; obtain a detailed history of symptoms associated with COVID-19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell; and obtain a thorough history for other GI symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In outpatients with new-onset GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), monitor for symptoms associated with COVID-19, as GI symptoms may precede COVID-related symptoms by a few days, and in a high COVID-19 prevalence setting, COVID-19 testing should be considered. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain a thorough history of GI symptoms (ie, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), including onset, characteristics, duration, and severity.

- patients who are planning travel to areas with moderate to high risk for exposure to S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi

- patients with intimate exposure to a documented S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi chronic carrier

- microbiologists and other laboratory personnel routinely exposed to cultures of S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi.

### Diagnosis and management of dehydration in children [^114pDes8]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

The most useful individual signs for identifying dehydration in children are prolonged capillary refill time, abnormal skin turgor, and abnormal respiratory pattern. However, clinical dehydration scales based on a combination of physical examination findings are better predictors than individual signs. Oral rehydration therapy is the preferred treatment of mild to moderate dehydration caused by diarrhea in children. Appropriate oral rehydration therapy is as effective as intravenous fluid in managing fluid and electrolyte losses and has many advantages. Goals of oral rehydration therapy are restoration of circulating blood volume, restoration of interstitial fluid volume, and maintenance of rehydration. When rehydration is achieved, a normal age-appropriate diet should be initiated.

Outcomes

The clinical practice outcomes were six sets of tasks: 1) Appropriate patient history questions asked given the patient's presenting symptoms; 2) Physical systems examined correctly during examination; 3) Appropriate laboratory tests; 4) Correct diagnosis; 5) Correct treatment (anti-malarials, antibiotics, or other drugs), and 6) Appropriate education regarding the illness and medication prescribed provided to the patient or caregiver.

A pretested standardized assessment tool was used to record trainees' clinical practice and anonymous patient information on these six sets of tasks. The tool was based on previous IMCI and JUMP evaluation tools with two important innovations from the work of Brentlinger et al. The clinical faculty teams: 1) recorded information on patients as well as trainee practice so accurate patient information was available, and 2) interrupted the assessment after the trainee completed the patient history and physical examination. This was done to ask additional history questions and conduct additional physical examination to complete missing information or correct erroneous information. Then the assessment of the trainee continued. History questions included follow-up questions for patients who presented with fever, ear discharge, cough, and diarrhea to establish duration and extent of illness. Consequently the required number of history questions varied across patients according to their symptoms. To distinguish patient information obtained by the trainee from that obtained by the faculty on the same form, trainees' clinical findings were recorded in blue or black ink and the faculty members' were recorded in red ink.

Construction of outcome variables

History

Trainees were expected to ask patients or caregivers questions and record correct responses for at least nine main questions about: danger signs, fever, ear discharge, cough, diarrhea, immunization status, HIV status of the child or mother if child's status was not known, and other symptoms. Table 1 shows the main questions and respective follow up questions. The number of appropriate questions depended on the patient's symptoms and ranged from eight to 19. The number of appropriate questions comprised the denominator while the numerator was the number of actual questions the trainee asked. In the analysis, we modelled the proportion of appropriate questions asked for any given patient.

### Survey of physician diagnostic practices for patients with acute diarrhea: clinical and public health implications [^115BxAjk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

To understand physician practices regarding the diagnosis of acute diarrheal diseases, we conducted a survey, in 1996, of 2839 physicians in Connecticut, Georgia, Minnesota, Oregon, and California. Bacterial stool culture was requested for samples from the last patient seen for acute diarrhea by 784 (44%; 95% confidence interval, 42%-46%) of 1783 physicians. Physicians were more likely to request a culture for persons with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, bloody stools, travel to a developing country, diarrhea for > 3 days, intravenous rehydration, or fever. Substantial geographic and specialty differences in culture-request practices were observed. Twenty-eight percent of physicians did not know whether stool culture included testing for Escherichia coli O157:H7; 40% did not know whether Yersinia or Vibrio species were included. These variabilities suggest a need for clinical diagnostic guidelines for diarrhea. Many physicians could benefit from education to improve their knowledge about tests included in routine stool examinations.

### Time-based coding… [^115M3g1z]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

The history component of a 99215 visit requires a comprehensive level of documentation. Documenting a comprehensive history means addressing four elements of the history of the present illness or the status of three chronic diseases in your documentation. Ten of the 14 body systems should be reviewed and commented on – significantly more than the two required for documenting a level-four history. At least two aspects of past, family, and social history should also be included. Exam This article focuses on the 1997 version of the E/M guidelines, which lists 14 organ systems and body areas comprising the general multisystem exam. Each has multiple elements. For instance, four exam elements define the "Respiratory" portion of the general multisystem exam: assessment of respiratory effort, percussion of the chest, palpation of the chest, and auscultation of the lungs. Coding 99215 requires a.

comprehensive exam in which two elements in each of nine or more organ systems and body areas are documented. A common way of remembering the exam documentation requirements for each level of exam is to build from a problem-focused visit to a comprehensive visit using the "rule of sixes". Reviewing old records and summarizing them in the record, Requesting old records or obtaining history from a source other than the patient, such as a family member or an emergency medical technician. CASE 1 The patient is a 46-year-old male with diabetes who is back to see you after visiting the emergency department the day before for acute nausea and vomiting. The patient had chest pain and was tested for a possible blood clot with a CT scan that was negative for pulmonary embolism. The patient is no longer with chest pain but complains of fatigue and slight abdominal pain.

He cannot tolerate crackers, lives with his wife, and drinks two beers every night at bedtime. No family history of heart disease and no allergies. Medications include simvastatin, lisinopril, metformin, and glyburide. A1C in office 10. 2, last A1C 3 months ago 13.
4. **Assessment/Plan**: Acute nausea/vomiting, recent chest pain, mild anemia. Suspect lactic acidosis given CT scan and metformin. Can be life threatening so will send to emergency department for potential hemofiltration and IV fluids.
